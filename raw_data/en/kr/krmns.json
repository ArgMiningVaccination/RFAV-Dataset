We are especially grateful to Michael Cernea of the World Bank forpreparing an insightful commentary on teaching about displacement. Appreciation is due to Gimena S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli for researching and identifying courses that relate to internal displacement throughout the world and for compiling this collection. It should be noted thatthis collection does not include all courses that deal with the subject of internal displacement. Ratherit is the first effort that brings together a broad sampling which highlights how instructors have inte-grated the subject matter into their curriculum. We hope that this collection will serve to stimulate further development of courses and trainings mate- rials on internal displacement. Such courses are vital to raising global awareness of the plight of theinternally displaced worldwide and building the knowledge base necessary for finding durable solu-tions to their protection and assistance concerns.

University faculty in different parts of the world have asked the Brookings-SAIS Project to undertake this compilation in order to stimulate additional courses and provide an exchange of ideas on howbest to teach the different aspects of internal displacement and integrate the subject into broadercoursework. Since 1997, a growing number of academic institutions around the world have begun to include the subject of internal displacement in their course work. At the City University of New York (CUNY),Dr. Francis M. Deng, Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons,introduced the first course exclusively devoted to the subject of internal displacement in 2002. Inpreparation for this course, I developed a Selected Bibliography on the Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , published by the Project in December 2001. The widespread interest in the bibliogra- phy and Dr. Deng's course further influenced the decision of the Brookings-SAIS Project to compilesyllabi from around the world relevant to the subject of internal displacement. The course syllabi found in this collection were sent in by faculty and trainers in different countries in response to an announcement that was circulated to over 300 academics and researchers engaged in the field of forced migration and other relevant course subjects. The announcement went to numer-ous universities, non-governmental and international organizations in Africa, Asia, Europe, theAmericas, and the Middle East in the course of 2002-3. The collection is divided into two sections: courses exclusively focused on internally displaced persons; courses on broader subjects that include internally displaced persons; training programs; and certifi-cate programs. The diversity of the university course syllabi demonstrates that internal displacementis a multi-faceted issue of relevance to several fields of study, including anthropology, law, publichealth, political science and development. The subject of forced migration has begun to be taught in Western industrialized states (Canada, Italy, Norway, Spain, UK and USA) where there is growing academic interest in the issue. It is also taughtin countries with significant populations of displaced persons, such as Colombia, India, Mexico andSri Lanka. In Colombia, an academic field of study has been developing in an effort to address theconcerns of IDPs and analyze the country's legal and national response to the problem. In India, theMahanirban Calcutta Research group has decided to launch its annual forced migration course inorder to bring forward a South Asian perspective on how to conceptualize and address the concernsof forced migrants.4 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons In addition to university course syllabi, this collection includes training modules on internal displace- ment and on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the first international standards forIDPs. The modules reproduced include those used by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)'sGlobal IDP Database and by the agencies in the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee(IASC). To date, the NRC has conducted training workshops in Angola, Burma, Burundi, Colombia,Georgia, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Nigeria, Liberia, Philippines, Sierra Leone, and Uganda (seewww .idppr oject.or g). OCHA's Internal Displacement Unit regularly uses the IASC training modules to train UN staff and local actors to better understand and respond to IDPs. In particular, the Unit'straining has served to support the development of national policies that address the protection andassistance concerns of the internally displaced. To date, the IDP Unit has conducted training in manycountries (for the reports of the Unit training, including lessons learned, see www .reliefweb.int/idp ). The author wishes to thank the faculty members and trainers who submitted their syllabi and mod- ules for inclusion in this compilation. Appreciation also goes to the staff of the Brookings-SAISProject on Internal Displacement and to Co-Director Roberta Cohen for encouraging and editingthis volume. We are aware that there may be other universities with courses not listed here and wouldtherefore appreciate receiving any additional syllabus or training materials. The Brookings-SAISProject's support of educational initiatives on the subject of internally displaced persons is an ongo-ing effort. I would therefore very much appreciate receiving from you any syllabus or training mate-rials, for future editions. Internal displacement can now be found in more than 50 countries throughout the world. There are an estimated 25 million persons displaced due to conflict alone most of whom are in urgent need ofprotection and assistance. These large numbers of women, men and children who find themselves inthis complicated and vulnerable state point to the need for increased education on this subject.Further development of course syllabi on internally displaced persons (IDPs) is encouraged in orderto stimulate more effective global, regional and national strategies among the actors. Education is thefirst step in the process of consciousness raising and providing inspiration for action.

Cernea1 Social science research on population displacement has vastly expanded in recent decades, in all respects: more published empirical investigations; broader territorial coverage; increasing efforts towards theory building; methodological innovations in research; and visibly stronger influence onactual policies and on operational programs. Now, due to the present compendium of University syl-labi, we receive convincing testimony about yet another dimension of this growth: the expansion anddiversification of academic teaching about displacement and resettlement. This is an important bodyof research-accumulated knowledge about displacement, not only claiming, but also legitimately stak-ing, its own territory in the academy. Specialized university courses multiply, achieve clearer didacticstructure and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 gain access to more minds eager to learn. The present compendium of University syllabi, tenaciously collected and organized by Gimena Garzoli-S\u00e1nchez for the Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement, is indeed a very timely andimportant academic publication. It makes possible for the first time an intellectual stock-taking of theprogress accomplished to date in the academic reproduction and communication of knowledge aboutpopulation involuntary displacement. It also enables the exchange of experiences, between those atgreat distance of each other from the US to Bangladesh, from China to South Africa, from India toNorway, and to and from many other countries \u2014 who now teach, or would teach these topics in thefuture. The international community of scholars, researchers and practitioners in this domain there-fore owe a debt of gratitude to the Brookings-SAIS Project and its leaders, Francis Deng and RobertaCohen, and to Garzoli-S\u00e1nchez as editor, for undertaking this stock-taking and making the resultspublicly available. This contributes to intellectual exchange and reciprocal learning, gathers building-blocks for promoting more such courses elsewhere in the world, and helps develop a shared concep-tual vocabulary and interdisciplinary exchanges. Even a brief immersion in this rich collection stimulates many ideas on how this line of teaching can be advanced further. I share some personal thoughts here, in the hope that they may trigger a broad-er discussion about the substance of educating skilled professionals in refugee assistance, reducing andmitigating development-caused displacement, risk-management, and development and reintegration. The T ypology of Population Displacements What are the basic concepts and propositions around which these syllabi revolve? To what extent isthere a common theoretical foundation to these courses? The syllabi in the present volume explore various types of displacement processes. To define and cat- egorize them, they use, by and large, the same broad concepts, yet not always in the same sense. One 1Research Professor of Anthropology and International Affairs, George Washington University,Washington, DC.6 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons basic conceptual distinction holds, apparently, throughout most syllabi \u2014 the distinction between \"refugees\", as forcibly displaced people who have crossed a national border, and \"internally displacedpopulations\" who \u2014 although dislocated from their places of origin against their will \u2014 have notcrossed a border and have relocated (temporarily or permanently) inside their own country. The syl-labi reveal, however, divided teaching preferences when it comes to subsuming these two categoriesinto one broader notion: the terms employed are either \"forced migration\" or, simply, \"populationdisplacement\". Significant currency has been gained in recent years by the newly coined term \"forcedmigration\", as a big-tent concept able to encompass all forms of involuntary displacement. But thereare perceived problems with this concept: the recourse to a qualifier (\"forced\") in addition to thenoun (migration) and the risk of confusion, of inadvertent overlap and conceptual contamination withthe classic concept of \"population migration\" that is voluntary (such as in \"rural-urban migration\",\"international migration\", etc.) has made some of the syllabi studiously avoid the ambiguities of the\"forced migration\" term. Instead, we can clearly note the visible ascent of the clear and unqualified concept of \"population dis- placement\" as the encompassing term of choice, obviously not burdened by any overlap and contam-ination with \"regular\" migration. This ascent is primarily due to the expanding use, in teaching as wellas in practice, of the UN \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement 2(recommended as reading in virtually all syllabi).3It is too early to conclude, however, and more scholarly discussion of these two broad concepts forced migration and population displacement will surely lead to more consensus asto which one is more precise, and adequate for both teaching and theory building. Yet clearly, termi-nology problems remain still acute in displacement research and teaching. The divide betweenresearchers of refugee movements from wars and conflicts, on the one side, and researchers of devel- opment-caused displacement and resettlement, on the other side, and the gaps in connectionsbetween them are still far from being enduringly bridged, despite positive steps in this direction. 4This perpetuates ambiguities in teaching, when the same concept (e.g., resettlement) is used in a certainone-sided sense, without care to at least signal the alternative meanings and uses of the same concept.Clearly, the \"resettlement\" of refugees, and the \"resettlement\" of development-displaced people areprocesses that differ profoundly in their dynamic and content, despite the use of the same term. Onewould hope that the obligation for stringency in classroom teaching will put constructive pressuretowards more terminological precision and closer bridging of concepts used in various sub-areas ofdisplacement research. Internally Displaced Populations To the observers of what Universities have been offering over the last 10 to 15 years on population displacement issues, one important new trend is fully obvious in the present compendium. Ten ormore years ago the dominant theme was \"refugees\", while the populations internally displaced by thesame causes did not come under the lens of research and teaching. Gradually, however, the researchcommunity realized the huge magnitude of internal displacement and its distinct status and charac- 2Francis Deng, Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, Addendum to the Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General, submitted pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/39, February 1998, UN Doc.

Over time, this led to changes at Universities as well. Currently, the academic landscape is enriched by many courses about just such internal displacement, parallel with courses on trans-border refugees. This compendium did not propose to collect courseson refugees, even though refugee issues are far from absent and are included in the numerous aca-demic offerings on conflict, war, and related issues. Yet definitely the multiplication of internal dis- placement courses, dedicated to the different forms such internal dislocations take, are a new trend. Sure enough, there are many ways to tailor course content. Some faculty choose the intensive, focused approach, and offer well circumscribed courses on one or another type of displacement, while othersprefer the broader approach, offering integrated courses that condense in one syllabus information onboth refugees and internally displaced persons, promoting comparative examination. What seems tome novel and significant is primarily the distinctiveness acquired by internal displacement as an objectof study. I think that this trend mirrors growing specialization within the field and portends the ori-entation for the future, without reducing the intrinsic importance of refugee studies. Development-Caused Displacement Another novel trend reflected in the present compendium is the presence of courses and sections ofcourses devoted to development-caused displacement. The subject is not new in academia. It hasbeen, and continues to be, present in numerous courses dedicated to development in general. But inthe area we consider, courses specially dedicated to development-imposed dislocations are gainingindependent status. Obviously, this is not by happenstance. Available statistics indicate that develop-ment-displaced groups are massive and, in totality, represent the single most numerous subcategory among all internally displaced categories. This is well documented particularly for the most populous,and relatively politically stable countries, such as India, China, Brazil, and others. Research into devel-opment-caused displacement has also crafted in recent years a set of important new concepts apt tocapture the inner typology of these processes: their characteristics by sector of displacement, by extentof dispossession, by type of resettlement, etc. However, this refined conceptual apparatus is still notfully reflected in most syllabi, and this may suggest an area of needed improvement. In substance, the content of the development-displacement syllabi is heavily weighted toward the par- adox that some of the development projects designed to achieve poverty reduction end up impover-ishing (compensation payments notwithstanding) the populations they displace and relocate. Theconnection between the impact of internal displacement, on the one hand, and impoverishment risks,on the other hand, highlighted in a number of syllabi, proves instrumental for linking the theme ofdisplacement to what is currently the most powerful paradigm in contemporary policies and politics:the poverty reduction paradigm. The inner links between the two are objective, inherent, and intrin-sic. Yet they need to be made explicit and obvious in teaching about involuntary displacement as acontroversial issue on internal and international agendas. That an increasing number of courses makethis link with poverty and impoverishment bodes very well, in my view, for the relevance of this teach-ing and for equipping students intellectually and morally. Ethics and Human Rights Remarkably, ethical issues and human rights issues come up frequently as explicit themes in the syl-labi and, in my value-laden view, this is indeed how such courses should be taught. The knowledgegenerated by research on displacement and communicated through teaching is never just knowledge8 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons for knowledge, but is knowledge for action. This knowledge should inform measures to avoid or reduce displacement, and mitigate impoverishment and other perverse effects. The moral argument is germane to this orientation. Courses that emphasize it educate and better equip their students forpractical operational work in this domain. The Argument Against T eaching Displacement While the interest in teaching and studying population displacement processes is measurably expand-ing, I have heard also \u2014 from some colleagues in the broader social science community \u2014 an oddargument against courses dedicated to this subject. This argument contends that refugee crises orinternal population displacement are not \"anthropological\" enough to qualify as subjects for full-fledged academic courses. These would be rather topics \"suitable for classes on social work\", ratherthan for higher-level graduate courses in sociology or anthropology. I couldn't disagree more with such an argument. It only reflects the detachment of some of our pro- fessional colleagues from major processes indelibly imprinted on today's world agenda, that whichdevelopment, civil wars and environmental disasters posit for resolution. In fact, population displacement resulting from violent conflicts or from \"routine\" development pro- grams represents a strategic window into our societies and into the construction of our lives and future. Perhaps even more than some other topics, they allow students to understand profoundly the contra-dictory facets of progress, the good and the bad, the desirable and the undesirable, what is worth sup-porting, and what must be prevented or mitigated. It is surely necessary, for instance, foranthropologists to understand the structure of kinship systems, cross-cousin marriage patterns or funer-al rites in various cultures, in order to grasp the architecture of social systems and how people live. Butit is no less important, or less prone to intellectual endeavor and to theorizing, to study the thornyprocesses of civil wars and their causes, or the adverse displacement effects of some major developmentprograms, which at the same time help secure energy, drinking water, transportation, health services,and other benefits. The intrinsic intellectual content of all syllabi in this compendium convincinglyrefute any contention that these issues are not a legitimate subject for academic endeavor. Reaching Beyond the Immediate Another observation along the same line, in light of the many provocative syllabi in this collection, is that population displacement courses, when taught to graduate students, offer many possibilities forreaching into intellectual areas that at first sight may seem unrelated. Yet the connections are deep and easy to make. Speaking from the experience of my own course on development and population displacement, I'd mention that both its students and myself as instructor enjoyed opening wider \"windows\" into devel-opment issues, and into the contribution of related disciplines, like economics, geography, or evenlegal doctrines. Of course, the time for lectures is limited, but there are ways of involving graduatestudents themselves in developing the topics which the lecturer can only mention fugitively becauseof time limitations. In my course, I invited the students to choose topics for their final term papersamong a wide range of themes which would require them to do independent library study beyondthe intellectual territories that we managed to cover in the classroom. Such difficult topics provedCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 9challenging and attractive. The subjects for term papers ranged over a vast spectrum: for instance, the relevance of Rawl's theory of justice to resettlement policies; or Amartya Sen's entitlement theory and the deprivation of displaced people of their income-earning capacities; or a comparison betweenIndia's original and revised Land Acquisition Acts of 1894 and of 1984 or a comparison amongEuropean, American, and African approaches to establishment of Natural Parks/Protected Areas, withor without the forced displacement of their resident populations; or the secondary analysis of findingsreported in the anthropological literature about displacement caused by biosphere reserves in Latin America; or the origins of the doctrine of eminent domain law and its adequacy, inadequacy andeffects today in expropriations done for development programs; and so on. Of course, the range ofdisplacement topics is unlimited, and so is the potential for intellectual gain. Learning for Practical Work Some of the most interesting syllabi about internal displacement reproduced in this compendiumclearly aim to equip students with concepts, methods, and knowledge potentially useful in practicalwork, during or immediately after completing their degrees, in assistance programs of people inter-nally displaced by civil wars, development programs, or disasters. This gives more confidence to manystudents who love studying sociology or anthropology, for instance, but don't quite know exactlywhat kind of jobs they can perform, other than teaching, when they finish their studies. In light of thereviewed syllabi, it may be worth emphasizing this practical orientation within this family of academ- ic course-offerings. While these are definitely not courses in social work, absorbing information andconcepts usable as professional tools can only enrich students' preparation for value-oriented human-itarian work and for negotiating fickle job markets. Surely, not all students who take courses of thekind described will do practical work in this field. But those of them who would be much better pre-pared for such work, while those who won't would have gained an understanding of importantprocesses buffeting our societies. Non-University Training Courses The Brookings-SAIS collection of syllabi brings us also a section containing training modules on inter-nal displacement designed for non-University courses. This brought to mind a situation that Iobserved initially with surprise, but which I noticed again and again during my field work on devel-opment projects entailing displacement and resettlement. Frequently, the responsibility for imple-menting these components are entrusted to an operating \"Resettlement Unit\" or \"ResettlementCell\". Having met many managers of such resettlement units, I discovered with astonishment that inthe majority of cases it was for the first time in their professional careers that those individuals werecalled upon to conduct such multisided, complex social processes. Most had no prior experience,whatsoever. Nor was access to management training made available to them before being given theirdemanding managerial jobs. In the organizational structures of projects that are dominated primarilyby technical expertise, the social content of managing resettlement tends to rank low on the totem-pole of project skills. The inordinately high proportion of resettlement project managers who are in first contact with this kind of work is partly explained by a high rate of turnover. Many who had previously held suchresponsibility in a prior project, and failed, prefer to take on a different job in a subsequent project rather than continue in the same kind of work \u2014 so that even that hard accumulated experience isbeing lost. There isn't yet, in this kind of work, a professional \"career line\", which would encourage10 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons and reward continuity, while also building lessons of past work into confronting similar challenges elsewhere. This situation is unfortunately compounded by the availability of only a few options forspecialized, regular long term study of resettlement issues, or of sporadic opportunities for intensiveshort-term training on displacement and resettlement 5. Good management, able to help improve the disrupted livelihoods of forcibly displaced populations, demands a combination of skills and knowl-edge that is neither possessed by many nor easy to acquire \"on the job\" without professional training.It is not surprising that inexperienced management turns out to be, as many project evaluation stud-ies have revealed, one of the main causes of failure to achieve resettlers' socio-economic redress anddevelopment 6. In sum, my empirical observations find that countless \"managers of resettlement operations\" practice their managerial jobs while being handicapped by unsystematic or absent training and preparednessfor managing either the socio-cultural substance of such risky and complex processes, or their hard logistics . I see here a vast opportunity for those teaching academic classes on displacement and reset- tlement, and for Universities to consider extending their range of offerings, adding courses respon-sive to the needs of project managers, aid workers, volunteers in humanitarian assistance and so forth.Innovative institutional venues would need to be found, of course, but surely the teaching experienceand knowledge embodied in the present compendium suggest that such expanded reach is feasible. In conclusion, the above observations address only a few aspects of the many experiences revealed by the Brookings-SAIS compendium of syllabi. Further discussion can be expected to take place aroundthis important publication, towards continuous improvement of academic teaching on population dis-placement issues. 5Universities across the world, in both developed and developing countries, offer only very seldom training to practitioners (non- regular students) on issues of population displacement and resettlement. One important exception is China, where the National Research Center on Resettlement (NRCR) at the Hohai University in Nanjing does offer regular courses to project managers onresettlement issues. In turn, development agencies such as the World Bank or Asian Development Bank have organized short-term ad-hoc courses for project officials , very useful but providing only a drop into the large bucket of needs because establishedUniversities do not aim yet to train full-time specialists in resettlement for work as planners, managers, project officers. In In dia a remarkable initiative was recently taken for facilitating \"learning-at-distance\" on resettlement: the India Ghandi Open Universi ty (IGNOU), and with assistance from the World Bank, has introduced postgraduate courses on resettlement by development proj-ects. IGNOU currently offers an online \"Post graduate certificate Program in management of Displacement, Resettlement andRehabilitation\", developed by the Sociology and Economics faculties of IGNOU's School of Social Sciences (see Kumar, Kapil andSwarankar, R.C. 2002 Evaluation Report on the Post-Graduate Certificate Program in Management of Displacement, Resettlement and Rehabilitation.

Deng TA:Gimena S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli Spring 2003United States of America Course Description: The principle of sovereignty as a concept of state responsibility to guarantee the protection and gen- eral welfare of citizens and those under state jurisdiction is becoming increasingly accepted in inter-national law. And yet, this concept poses serious practical problems in countries experiencingethno-cultural pluralism, often characterized by acute crises of national identity which create cleavagesamong the various ethnic, cultural, and religious groups in the country. While those who cross inter-national borders and become refugees are protected by the 1951 Convention, the internally displacedfall into the vacuums of the national identity crisis. What principles of international law provide a basis for their protection and assistance? What durable solutions (including the options of return, resettlement, and reintegration) are open to them? Whatnormative standards can be applied to addressing the root causes of the tensions, conflicts, and egre-gious violations of human rights that generate displacement? What principles should govern the man-agement of identity differences based on ethnicity, religion, language, and culture within a state?Should the overriding norm be to assimilate, integrate, or co-exist? And under what conditions arediscriminated or marginalized groups entitled to the exercise of the right to self-determination,whether within or outside the state framework? The course will explore these and other questions in the context of such theoretical and practical issues as the role of law as a regulator of political, economic, social, and cultural processes, involvingvalues, institutions, and patterns of behavior, the status of individuals and groups as competing sub-jects of legal recognition, the principles for protecting and assisting minorities and those displacedwithin the borders of their own countries, and the search for durable solutions by addressing theroots of displacement. Syllabus: The course will be constructed around categories of issues and empirical questions. These will include, but will not necessarily be limited to, the following:14 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons January 29 I.

What factors determine the extent to which national authorities respond positively or nega- tively to the needs of their displaced populations? In particular, what role do ethnic, racial, religious, cultural or class differences play in the response by national authorities? T o what extent is response to displacement caused by inter-state conflict different from that caused by internal conflict? How should the international community address the paradox of internal displacement being perceived as primarily the responsibility of the state, while, oftentimes, the state not only neg-lects its displaced populations, but may in fact cause the displacement, persecute the dis-placed, and then shield itself from international scrutiny through the conventional notion ofnational sovereignty? How should the international community engage non-state actors in the context of national sovereignty?

Le Xuan Khoa and Judith Mayotte 1997United States of America Course Description: In a world population of 5.8 billion, roughly one out of every 115 to 120 persons is displaced by war, civil strife, or persecution. While we continue to hope refugee flows will abate, we see sore people onthe move. In 1960 there were 1.4 million refugees. By 1980 the number swelled to 82 million. Inour world today there are between 15 and 20 million refugees and approximately 25 to 30 millioninternally displaced civilians. Fully 80 percent of the displaced are women and children. Today, refugee movements from countries in distress are greater in numbers, frequency, and complex- ity. The vast majority of people who are displaced, are displaced because of generalized violence. Whileindividuals per se may not be targeted, whole communities are forced to flee armed, civil conflictbecause their lives are totally disrupted. To destroy the source of livelihood, opponents kill villagers,burn villages, steal cattle, destroy crops, poison water sources, and strew landmines. Civilians becometargets of war, part of the military strategy in these civil wars even though the Geneva Conventionsexpressly forbid the purposeful uprooting of civilian populations. The cost in human lives and money is immense. 'When a large-scale humanitarian crisis arises, such as we witnessed in Rwanda, the UNHCR, NGOs, and governments must respond rapidly to assist andprotect massive numbers of people, often in critical condition, who are crossing international bordersat the same time. Today, more victims of conflict become internally displaced within their own borders than seek asy- lum by crossing an international border. For the internally displaced there is no U.N. body mandat-ed to protect and assist them as there is for refugees who cross an international border. With morethan 25-30 million civilians internally displaced, the international community is forced to grapplewith the complex issue of conflict between national sovereignty on the one hand, and protection ofthe basic human rights of and humanitarian access to the internally displaced, on the other. It is crit-Collection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons ical that humanitarian relief workers have unlimited, uninterrupted, and unimpeded access to inter- nally displaced civilians. Millions of refugees are returning home to devastated homelands after years in exile. In countries like Mozambique, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, reconstruction and reconciliation is criticalif these countries are not to tip over again into conflict. If we do not want to witness one humanitarian crisis after another, each more brutal than the one before, we must set new priorities and principles and find new. nonviolent ways to respond to con-flict. In reshaping the future, one of our greatest challenges is to work for conflict resolution and cri-sis prevention. Addressing root causes of conflict is essential. During the thirteen weeks of this course, we will address the many issues surrounding the forced dis- placement of people caused by war, civil strife, and persecution. We will seek ways to better protectand assist those who are displaced and consider how conflict resolution and preventive action canbecome a key element in US. foreign policy and in the activities of grass roots NGOs. Syllabus: Week 1: Overview of World Refugee Movements A complex variety of conflict and political situations cause massive numbers of people from almost every continent to flee their homes to survive. Increasingly, the movements of refugees and internal-ly displaced civilians are having a greater impact on international peace and security.

UNHCR and NGOs are responsible for planning, providing and distributing adequate basic human needs, such as food, shelter, potablewater, clothing, sanitation, and medical treatment. to refugees. In addition, they must be concernedwith maintaining order in refugee camps as well as encouraging education and vocational training.UNHCR and NGOs most work with host governments who often want to coerce voluntary repatri-ation by making living conditions in the camps inhospitable and reducing NGO assistance programs.Refugees must also be protected against gang members. armed insurgents. and local security forcesand/or camp guards.

Week 5: Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons: Conflicting Policies by Governments and by International Relief Agencies There are a number of reasons why protection and access to internally displaced civilian is difficult and, in some cases, almost impossible for international organizations and NGOs gad extremely cost-ly. Oftentimes, the internally displaced are trapped in the midst of armed conflict or live in a countrythere all governance has broken down. In some cases, the very governments charged with protectingits citizens may refuse access to those in territory held by rebel factions. UNHCR. The State of the World's Refuges 1993.

We know from history that humans developed the first civilizations in the great river valleys to which they had migrated. They spread civilization far and wide from these initiallocations. Movement has always been a key factor in the creation of new civilizations, new mixes ofpeoples. People are still on the move \u2014 in ever greater numbers, faster, and due to many different cir-cumstances. Economics, better river valleys if you will, has always been the major factor, but violenceand now anarchy make people move. Today, forced migrations, which create movements of refugees and internally displaced civilians from and within countries in distress, are greater in numbers, frequency, and complexity. In this course, bylooking at some of the contemporary forced movements of peoples and the historical underpinnings\u2014 political, social, economic, and religious \u2014 of why they fled their homes and homelands, we willcome to understand how cultures are changed and evolve into new or altered entities. In a world population of 5.8 billion, war, civil strife, or persecution displaces roughly one out of every 115 to 120 persons. The vast majority of people who are displaced, are displaced because of general-ized violence. The cost in human lives and money is immense. Lives and cultures are irrevocablychanged, for when wars end, millions of refugees return home to devastated homelands or resettle indifferent countries after years in exile. During the course of the quarter, we will move through three phases of the refugee experience and analyze and interpret some themes common to societies changed through conflict. Among them willbe the following: 1. As we consider why people flee, we will look at the evolution of altered societies \u2014 for example, the break-up of the former Yugoslavia and the emergence of the small African nation of Eritreaas an independent nation-state. We will consider, too, the impact of one nation's upheaval on anentire region, as Vietnam on Southeast Asia and Rwanda on Central Africa, as well as the para-doxical concurrent movement toward globalization and local or tribal loyalties. 2. In our considerations of life in exile, we will look at the effect of war on civilians, particularly the most vulnerable members of a population \u2014 women, children, the elderly and infirm. We willCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons take a hard look at the disregard for human rights and consider genocide as the ultimate affront to our common humanity. 3. In the aftermath of war, we will look at efforts by nations to reconstruct devastated lands and to reconcile with former enemies. We will see how, with the end of the Cold War, the United States and other developed nations are changing national strategic interests and reflect on the challengebefore all nations to incorporate conflict resolution, preventive action and preventive diplomacyas vital elements of foreign and national policy. Core Course Objectives: History 121 is part of the Core Curriculum Phase I: Foundations of Wisdom. Thorough this courseand our reflections on how the refugee experience is critical to our understanding of the forces andevents that shape our modern world, you will be given the opportunity to form and sharpen your abil-ities to think critically and ethically. Your readings, class discussions, and writing assignments will lead you into the historian's way of ask- ing appropriate questions, interpreting texts, and dealing with significant issues so that you can applythis mode of thinking to other areas of learning. Through the readings and your discussions and writing assignments, you will be able to reflect ethically on the human condition. Among others, you will deal with human rights issues, the diversity of peoplesof history (refugees become peoples bereft of their histories), and responsibilities of the international com-munity to insure a safe and habitable world for all peoples so that they will not have to flee to survive. This course will prepare you well for courses in the Core Curriculum Phase II: Person in Society. This phase includes courses in political science, anthropology, and sociology, economics, and psychology. Syllabus: Calendar Introduction: Who is a refugee?

A central theme of the course is that forced migration is anintegral part of the relationship between poor and rich countries in the current context of global-isation and social transformation. This implies that forced migration is not just a product of inter-nal wars and local impoverishment, but is also closely linked to the fundamental economic andpolitical structures and processes of the contemporary world. The consequence for forced migra-tion studies is the need to understand the relationship between the local and global in every spe-cific displacement situation. The first three weeks of the course examine macro-social relationships underlying forced migration processes. Weeks 4 and 5 focus on two specific types of displacement: environmental and develop-ment-linked mobility. The last three weeks deal with response to forced migration by states, interna-tional organisation and the forced migrants themselves. Syllabus: The course will be constructed around categories of issues and empirical questions. These will include,but will not necessarily be limited to, the following: Week 1 Central issues in forced migration studies Who is a refugee? Who is a forced migrant? Types of forced migration and basic statistics. The mechanisms for defining categories and assigning individuals to them. How are forced migrantsproduced? Individual agency, national regimes and international regimes. The nature of forcedmigration studies and the need for interdisciplinarity.

These include the legal, political, economic, social and cultural conse-quences of forced migration, which find statement on international, national and local level of society.After sketching a concise appreciation of the national and international institutional frameworks thattypically develop around situations of human displacement, the bulk of the course examines forcedmigration from the perspectives of the affected migrants themselves. In an attempt to develop anappreciation of regional dynamics, case studies are drawn mainly \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 fromAfrica. At the end of the course, students are expected to have achieved the following: A critical appreciation of the conceptual approaches and theoretical models that have been used to make sense of forced migration; A comprehensive understanding of the wide-ranging set of consequences of forced migration; A good overview of documented case material on forced migration and the nature of the responses that these situations have elicited; A strong sense of the potentials and ethical limitations of working in this section of the 'devel- opment industry' in a professional capacity, outside of a university environment. Syllabus: Part 1: Forced Migration: Conceptual and Theoretical Overview Seminar 1: Evolution of Forced Migration as a Global Crisis Definition of a refugee/forced migrant, Distinction between voluntary and forced migration. Nature and types of forced migration. Development of the international refugee regime. Causes of displace-ment. Policies on refugees (national, regional and international issues). Bureaucratisation and profes-sionalisation of protection and assistance in forced migration. 50 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Cernea, M.

We examine the causes and types of displacement;the economic, social and security impacts on host countries and regions; and the response of govern-ments, international organizations and nongovernmental organizations to displacement. We explorethe role of refugees and other forced migrants in international and domestic politics, and the contri-bution and problems of humanitarian assistance. The course is grounded in political science (specifically international relations, IPE and comparative politics), but our approach will be interdisciplinary, incorporating perspectives from anthropology,political geography, and law. Our time frame begins with the end of the Second World War, and focus-es on the post-Cold War period. Course materials will be derived from all regions of the world. The course has a strong case study and policy emphasis. Students are required to participate in a group project that will include outside research. The Research Paper Research Paper Questions: W hat role can and should the military play in refugee protection? Examine the role of UNHCR as an actor in international refugee affairs. Should UNHCR try to be a politically neutral organization? How did UNHCR's assumption of the lead agencyrole in former Yugoslavia and its relief activities there involve it in the politics of the war? Was this different in the Kosovo case? Explore the concept of asylum . To what extent is the institution of asylum under threat? How does this differ regionally? Why are IDPs a particular (legal and humanitarian) problem in international affairs? D o a 'state of the art' paper on human trafficking. What consequences might anti-trafficking measures have for refugee protection? 64 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Do a 'state of the art' paper on statelessness. Is this an emerging problem in the 21st century? Discuss institutional responses, new problems, etc. What are the moral issues underlying the concept of asylum? Discuss some of the moral and ethical dilemmas facing asylum countries and relief organizations today. What is meant by 'refugee economies'? How does an influx of refugees transform a border zone? Syllabus: January 22 (Tuesday) Week 1. First Class Meeting: Introduction, Definitions and Statistics January 28 Week 2. Forced Migration in the post-Cold War Era: Patterns and Causes. How is forced migration (FM) different from other kinds of international migration? In what sense is FM different now from what it was during the Cold War, or before? What are the 'root causes' of FM?(and should we focus on them?) Reading: UNHCR 1997. The of the 99-114. Schmeidl, S.\"Conflict and Global Refugees ., pp. 62-94.

The Institutional Response to Refugees We discuss the response to refugees by the international community, nation-states, and nongovern- mental organizations. What is meant by the international refugee regime, who are the main actors,and how effective are they in coping with the problems of forced migration? What is meant by \"asy-lum\" today and how has asylum changed since the 1960s? We will consider how the tension betweenstates and relief organizations like UNHCR and NGOs mediate the response to forced migration. 2/4 Week 3. The Response of the International Community.

Once an issue largely at the periphery of international politics, displacement has increas-ingly become a more central geo-strategic concern. Since World War II an ever more elaborate inter-national regime has developed to codify and structure responses to displacement. In tandem withthese developments refugees and displacement have also increasingly emerged in particular ways as\"issues\" and research subjects within anthropology and the broader social sciences in general. This course will provide a critical understanding of displacement processes (the complex causes, char- acteristics, and consequences of forced migration experiences) and of the \"displacement problem\"(how international policy-makers and scholars have constructed displacement as an object for analysisand action\u2014and some of the consequences of this construction). It will also explore how the study ofdisplacement as a process and as a problem may provide a \"strategic research site\" for critically inter-rogating broader concepts and theories within anthropology and the social sciences. Students in this course will gain an understanding of how local social and larger geo-political forces interact to produce refugees, and are in turn also affected by displacement processes. They will alsoexamine how social relations and identities at various intersecting levels are influenced by displace-ment. Particular attention will be played to how gender relations are affected by displacement. Thecourse will examine the contrast and contest between local interests and those of national and inter-national-level actors (such as state governments, intergovernmental agencies and NGOs) in the for-mulation of solutions to displacement. The course will also review how \"refugees\" have beenhistorically constructed as a \"problem\" within international relations and how the internationalhumanitarian and political system of response has developed and changed in response to the growthof displacement. Finally we will consider some of the ethical dilemmas and methodological challengesraised by studying displacement processes and problems. While drawing on a wide variety of cases from across the globe the course will focus in particular on displacement processes in Africa as well as on the experience of refugees in North America. Thiscourse is designed to provide graduate or advanced undergraduate students who have had previouscoursework in anthropology with an understanding of how forced migration is organized and linksglobal political-economic and local social processes in ways that increasingly bear on the central sub-jects of the discipline.70 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Syllabus: Week 1: Introductory Lecture: Why Study Displacement?

Sr Maryanne Loughry (RSC) In this week we consider challenges to programmes that have been designed to address 'posttraumat- ic stress' in war zones. We concentrates on the contribution the diagnosis Post Traumatic StressDisorder (PTSD) has made to our understanding of the experiences of refugees and those who havebeen subjected to torture. There is an argument for a stronger focus on the social rather than psychological needs of refugees. Friedman, M.J. & Marsella A.J. (1996).

Shvedova Spring 2004United States of America Course Description: To introduce you to the significant effect on the migration phenomenon, examining trends that have emerged since the end of the Cold War and collapse the Soviet Union and to provide students withnecessary analysis of migration process in contemporary Russian society. Familiarity with the processof migration in Russia, based on gender approach, is promoting the better understanding the wholeInternational Migration process all over the world. The course explores the wide spectrum of topics to create vital panorama of the migration process in the world through present day situation in Russia. We will: Examine the almost unprecedented situation in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union in terms of the scale of the problem and the geographical area in which they located. E xamine a situation that there has never before been in which several million persons have suddenly found themselves to be foreigners in a country where they had been living for sev-eral generations and, besides, tens of thousands of persons, who are in need too, have beendisplaced within Russia as a result of ethnic conflicts. E xamine social crisis getting worse while women and children becoming impoverished, the issues in area of sharp political activities and struggle. Examine how specific situation in Russia resulting from many factors, the collapse the Soviet Empire and traditional neglect of gender interests, impacts on labor migration, forced migra-tion, international migration flows from a gender perspective. Examine how the reforms and politics are dangerous for the interested groups, state bureau- cracy with their old ineffective methods to solve problems. Examine how since September 1999, UNHCR has been providing support to the Government of the Russian Federation in the relief effort aimed to assist the affected popu-lation in the Northern Caucasus. Examine an active participation of the UNHCR in the United Nations Consolidated Inter- Agency Appeal for the Northern Caucasus and its support to governmental and non-govern-mental agencies dealing with protection of IDPs in Chechnya. Examine how asylum seekers are treated and the changing conditions for asylum.86 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons E xamine women specific conditions generating asylum requests and the vulnerability of refugee women and children. Examine government response to the shifts in migration trends and the specific feature of the new migration legislature in Russia.

Ensor Proposed CourseUnited States of America Course Description: The scale of forced migration is of growing concern as millions of people are displaced by factors such aswar, repressive regimes and natural disasters. Whilesome have been forced to take refuge across nation-al borders, many others are displaced within theirown countries. This course is designed to providestudents with an understanding of the causes, pat-terns and consequences of forced migration world-wide. We will trace the emergence of the currentregime of humanitarian action on behalf of displaced populations, analyze the differences and similaritiesbetween refugees and internally displaced persons(IDPs), and discuss the most significant theoreticaland practical dimensions of the field of forced migra-tion. The major humanitarian crises of the last 50years will also be examined. Goals: Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to: T race the historical emergence of the current refugee regime, and identify the many dilem- mas that have been faced by governments, humanitarian organizations and other actors indealing with the issue of human displacement. D emonstrate a clear understanding of the most important definitional, institutional, legal, political, and socio-economic dimensions of the forced migration experience. U nderstand the complexities involved in providing humanitarian assistance to displaced pop- ulations including the practical issues involved in managing a refugee/IDP camp.

Humanitarian assistance: the price of international political complacency and inertia? Is the International community obliged to respond to each and every crisis? Why is there a mismatch between the need and the provision of humanitarian assistance? What is the UN? Is it the world parliament or a meeting place? What and where do you want it to be? Regional problems. Regional solutions? The UN and its agencies: mechanisms of accountability. Are there any? Do they function? Is misappropriation and misuse of donor funds and resources inevitable? Preventive Diplomacy - Cohesion through coercion? Is asylum seeking a lost cause? WEEK 2. Is an integrated multidisciplinary response an impossible ideal? Who should be responsible for independent research and evaluation in acute and chronic crises? Central Africa. What would have happened if the world had done nothing? Competition or cooperation: How can aid organizations optimize their effectiveness? Should refugees be kept in camps? Should professional registration be mandatory in emergency situations? What problems do borders in provision of humanitarian assistance pose? WEEK 3. Donor driven humanitarian assistance - Do funds meet needs or needs meet funds? The aftermath of ethnic conflict: oblivion, justice or revenge? Can the International Community negotiate with key players if they have \"blood on their hands\"? Child soldiers - what could be the long-term impact on development? Is there a need for harmonization of refugee procedures and legislation? Can this need be met? Forced repatriation: How do we respond? How should we respond? How can we respond? Humanitarian assistance through partnership with host governments and services - rhetoric or reality? How to optimize opportunities for training of staff in countries afflicted by humanitarian crises? Humanitarian action in situations of conflict: Relief for victims or sustenance for perpetrators? Interaction between expatriates and local staff WEEK 4. Institutional amnesia, inertia or impotence? Advocacy and neutrality: A dilemma for international agencies Red Cross/Red Crescent and NGOs? Humanitarian assistance: Always positive? How can we reconcile national security and human rights? Is distortion of reality acceptable in the interests of advocacy? Is the military logistic machine the best response to a humanitarian crisis? Is breach of national sovereignty justifiable in the interest of humanitarian action?124 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons - 29 - Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Director, CIHC; Former UN Secretary-General; Former Secr\u00e9taire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie Ed Bradley, Co-Editor, 60 Minutes CBS News Correspondent Col.

Students in this course will acquire skills critical to pursuing professional activities in and around the field of humanitarian assistance: They will gain an understanding of the political dimensions of emergency aid programs with respect to both international and local politics. T hey will develop a feel for the practical analysis of the political repercussions of emergency assistance programs. They will learn to think critically and creatively of how external actors \u2014 donors, multilater- al organizations, non-profit agencies and for-profit contractors, peace-keepers, and so on \u2014intervene in the lives of local people and local societies. The course, rooted in the extensive field experience of the professor, emphasizes a field-based, ground- up focus while including a balance of discussion on the dominant literature and theoretical debates. The course is relevant to professionals and aspiring professionals in humanitarian assistance, human rights, foreign policy, academia, and the military who intend to work with societies in crises. Purpose of the Course: The course will review the relationship between humanitarian aid and politics \u2014 both local and inter-national \u2014 with a special emphasis on conflict-related crises and so-called complex humanitarianemergencies (otherwise known as wars). While the international arena has changed dramatically following the September 11th attacks in the United States, the transformation that has occurred since the end of the cold war is nearly as impres-sive. Over the course of the last decade, the attention given to the humanitarian consequences of con-flict has risen considerably, thanks in part to media technology advances. These so-called'humanitarian crises' are marked by large numbers of civilian casualties, massive population displace-142 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons ment, widespread food insecurity, the breakdown of traditional political and economic structures, war- lordism, widespread insecurity and human rights abuses, conflict over natural resources such as oil,diamonds, timber, or poppy, and so on. The increased visibility of the human toll of these conflictshas placed enormous public pressure on donor nations and aid agencies to respond with rapid andeffective assistance, at a time when foreign aid levels are at their lowest since the 1960s. This assis-tance carries huge political repercussions, both at the local level, and at the international level. This course examines these repercussions, their causes, and the tendency of the humanitarian commu- nity to disengage from the political sphere. It provides a foundation for understanding the context ofconflict and humanitarian emergencies, laying out such components as the nature of conflict, forcedmigration, humanitarian law, how the international aid community, and the use of militaries inhumanitarian interventions. The course also follows current trends in humanitarian action and trackthe dynamics in specific crises. The course draws on the experience of the professor, who has worked in a variety of functions and settings in the field over the past 12-15 years, and also has extensive analytical experience in writingand teaching about humanitarian aid and related subjects.

Module 1: Introduction to the International Protection of Refugees and its Evolution. This first session will start with an overview of the course, which will be followed by a discussion of the nature, the rationale and the legal basis of international protection of refugees. This willserve as background to an exploration of the evolution of the international regime of protectionof refugees, emphasising the development of the institutions, norms, values, and policies that havecharacterized it since the creation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Russian Refugeesby the League of Nations in 1921. Module 2: Introduction to Contemporary International Refugee Law. Building on the groundwork laid in the first module, we will discuss the normative framework ofrefugee protection, i.e. refugee law at the universal, regional and national levels, emphasizing at the international levels not only the refugee instruments, but also the international human rightsinstruments. This survey will also include an examination of the role of the Conclusions on inter-national protection of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's programme(EXCOM Conclusions). Module 3: The Refugee Definitions and Refugee Status Determination. The determination of refugee status is a core function of refugee protection. It is the act fromwhich flows the full enjoyment of the rights and protection provided by refugee law. It is basednormatively on the criteria contained in the applicable refugee definition. One of the principal dis-Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 155tinguishing characteristics of the instruments analyzed in the previous module is the extent to which they modify or deviate from the refugee definition of the oldest still valid refugee defini-tion, that contained in the Statute of UNHCR. A rapid comparison of these refugee definitionswill be followed by a discussion of the legal basis of refugee status determination and of its crite-ria and procedures. As the bulk of refugee litigation is linked directly or indirectly to refugee sta-tus determination, it will be necessary to discuss in some depth the notions of persecution,persecution by non-state agents, discrimination vs. persecution, effective nationality, membershipof a particular social group, as well as the related notions of internal flight alternative and safethird country. Module 4: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\u2014Mandate and Work. UNHCR is the international organisation mandated by the General Assembly of the United Nations to provide international protection to refugees. It plays a crucial role in the operation ofthe international regime of refugee protection. It has undergone considerable transformation insize and approaches since its creation by General Assembly Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December1950. As the organization responsible for monitoring the implementation of international con-ventions relating to refugees, and one that is almost totally dependant financially on a handful ofWestern donor countries, UNHCR faces a major challenge in our times in trying to conciliate state interests with its refugee protection mandate. Module 5: Human Rights and Refugee Protection. The refugee issue is intimately linked with that of human rights. Refugee flows are often due tolarge-scale violations of fundamental human rights. The protection of the human rights ofrefugees is a major objective of refugee protection. Indeed, the rights protected by the various human rights instruments are available to all human persons. Yet, only in recent years has evenUNHCR acknowledged openly the usefulness of utilizing the human rights mechanisms of theUnited Nations to achieve the protection of refugees. Meanwhile, a considerable jurisprudenceon refugee and asylum cases is developing in the European institutions of human rights on thebasis of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and FundamentalFreedoms of 4 November 1950 and its Protocols, especially of the prohibition against torture andother inhuman or degrading treatment contained in Article 3 of the Convention. There and else-where recourse is also had to Article 3 against refoulement in the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of 10 December 1984. Practical ways of utilizinghuman rights to protect refugees will be discussed. Module 6: Asylum. Asylum is the core principle and objective of refugee protection. Yet, because it implies givingthe asylum-seekers the full enjoyment of rights in the country of asylum whether the authoritiesof that country wish so or not, that puts it at odds with the principle of state sovereignty. Forthis reason, States are reluctant to acknowledge an individual right to asylum and prefer to asserttheir right to grant or not to grant it. The efforts of the High Commissioner for Refugees toobtain the adoption of a Convention on Territorial Asylum ended in failure and what we stillhave at the universal level is a United Nations Declaration on Territorial Asylum of. 14December 1967. Nevertheless, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December156 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 1948 proclaims in Article 14 everyone's \"right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.\" This is echoed by Article 22(7) of the American Convention of HumanRights of 22 November 1969: \"right to seek and be granted asylum.\" There is, furthermore, avibrant Latin American tradition of conventions and treaties on territorial and diplomatic asylumdating back to the late 19th century, which the United States has more or less consistentlyshunned. And the OAU Convention governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem inAfrica of 10 September 1969 has dared, in Article II on asylum, tread where neither of the twouniversal refugee instruments, nor the EHCHR have ventured. The uncertain status of the rightto asylum will be examined. Module 7: Non- refoulement under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and general human rights law. More firmly established would seem the principle of non- refoulement , which many international jurists consider to be a peremptory norm, a norm of jus cogens . It is a norm without which refugee law and protection would be without efficacy and it replaces advantageously the principle of asy-lum. Unlike asylum, the norm of non- refoulement holds its rightful place in the 1951 Convention. It is proclaimed by the above mentioned African and American conventions as well. Yet it is notwithout controversy as to its extent and application, in particular as to whether is encompassesnon-rejection at the frontier. The juridical basis, nature and applications of the norm will be stud-ied, in particular the practical ways of protecting refugees and asylum-seekers from refoulement . Module 8: Refugee Rights and Freedoms to be Protected. Having discussed the two most fundamental principles of refugee protection, we will examine such other principles of interest to refugees as those of freedom of movement and freedom fromdetention, access to court, the right to family reunification, the right to non-discrimination, theprotection from expulsion and extradition, and the right not to be penalized for illegal entry orstay. Module 9: Temporary Protection and \"Subsidiary\" Protection. Temporary protection is the term applied to the status accorded the persons fleeing from the for- mer Yugoslavia conflicts on the ground that they did not meet the conditions for refugee statussince their problem was not a fear of persecution in the terms of the definition of the 1951Convention, but rather a fear of conflict or mass violence. It was thought nevertheless that, whilethese persons did not qualify for refugee status under the Convention, they deserved some sortof protection. That protection is limited in time and in substance. The recently coined term of\"subsidiary protection\" refers to what used to be called B status or humanitarian status, that wasaccorded to individual cases that could not meet the criteria of the 1951 Convention's refugeedefinition as interpreted by Western governments. Due to their limited nature, temporary andsubsidiary protection poses many problems that will be explored in this module, in particular fortemporary protection the fact that many people being given it could in fact qualify under therefugee convention and the thorny problem of when to end this protection and send the protect- ed persons home.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 157Module 10: Refugee Protection in Armed Conflict and Complex Emergencies. A defining characteristic of refugee emergencies in the post-Cold War period is for them to occur increasingly in the midst of violent conflict situations. This present a number of problems, includ-ing the presence of armed elements in the camps and the need to disarm them and/or separatinghem from the rest; the increasing problem of military or armed attacks on refugee camps and set-tlements, and more recently the targeting of UNHCR staff and other humanitarian workers forkidnapping and assassination., not to mention the mixing up of humanitarian with military ele-ments. The examination of these problems and of the possible solutions thereto will be the focusof this module. Module 11: The Protection of Particularly Vulnerable Persons: Refugee Women, Unaccompanied Minors, and Seniors. These categories of persons show vulnerability at all stages of the refugee trajectory, from flight to arrival to refugee status determination to the recognized refugee stage to solutions. The par-ticular problems of these categories of persons and the search for their solution will be the focushere. This is without prejudice to these persons' capacity to intervene and to act for their ownprotection and the benefit of their communities. Module 12: The Developing Law of Internally Displaced Persons. It is often pointed out that there are more internally displaced persons (IDPs) than refugeesaround the world. It is also true that, while their situation is, legally, essentially different from thatof refugees, they share the same distress, destitution and vulnerability. Furthermore, the twogroups often live side by side in the same physical settings. The same persons sometimes movefrom one status to the other or vice versa. It is therefore imperative for the international commu-nity to accord its protection and assistance to IDPs. For these reasons, UNHCR often finds itselfhaving to extend its care to IDPs, in spite of its own mandate limitations. This, however, can onlybe done under certain conditions. Internally displaced persons therefore remain especially vulner-able for lack of an established body of law protecting them or of a specific international organi-zation charged with implementing it or monitoring its implementation. The efforts to developsuch a body of law and how to mobilize it are the subjects of this discussion. Module 13: Solutions to the Refugee Problem and the Challenge of Voluntary Repatriation. Refugee status is not meant to last for ever, as it is abnormal that a person should be without the protection of his own country or of a country of adoption. For this reason, one charged with theprotection of refugees must start from the beginning to seek for a solution to their problem.UNHCR has traditionally, with the support of the States concerned, sought solutions in volun-tary repatriation, local integration, and third-country resettlement. In recent years, it has shiftedits interest to voluntary repatriation after a period of intensive recourse to resettlement, firstimmediately after World War (first under the International Refugee Organization) then inSoutheast Asia in the 1970s and early 80s in the wake of the Indochina Wars. It has been pro-claiming that voluntary repatriation is the preferable solution, or perhaps even the only solution.The voluntary character of repatriation has come under heavy strain in recent years, however, as158 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons a result of various factors linked with the numerous civil conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Balkans; hence the recently minted concepts of \"repatriation under less than ideal conditions\", or evensuch aberration as \"forced spontaneous repatriation.\" We will discuss the protection implicationsof these solutions, with special reference to the mounting challenge of repatriation. Module 14: The Future of International Protection (reconciling state interests, organizational interests, and the norms of refugeeprotection?). The foregoing leads us to the necessity of engaging in some reflection on the future of refugee protection, taking into account the continuing refugee problem, the mounting violence of civilconflicts, the increasing disregard for international humanitarian law, the growing awareness ofthe resort of many to the refugee avenue as a means to migration, the ceaseless efforts of the richcountries to fend off the perceived hordes at the door, the ability of those countries to use theirfinancial and power leverages to influence UNHCR's orientation, but also the rising awareness ofhuman rights and the growing resourcefulness of the advocacy community.

The course will not concentrate on the asylum laws of one country in particular, rather theapproach is multinational in order to provide an overview of the commonalities and conflicts within theworld system. Students will attain thorough understanding of the Convention relating to the Status ofRefugees (1951), as well as the principal regional conventions. Main areas of discussion include the basicU.N. criteria for the attainment, denial, and withdrawal of refugee status, the development of the non-refoulement principle, and the standard of treatment of refugees. Students will be asked to address the role of human rights within the pre-flight and post-flight cycles of the refugee experience. In addition, the political, social, and economic context of prevention, protection, and solution strategies will beexplored. A basic review of jurisprudence within international, regional, and national courts will providean understanding of how refugee and asylum law is interpreted and implemented. This course will alsoanalyze the drawbacks and benefits of alternative forms of protection, e.g. temporary protection and safehaven. Trends vis-a-vis the expansion of the refugee definition will be assessed by studying regionalapproaches to mass flight, gender persecution, the rise of Non-State actors, and \"development/environ-mental\" refugees within Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Progressive issues such as internally dis-placed persons, restitution rights, sanctuary, and will also be presented. Requirements: Students are expected to have prior knowledge of international law. Previous study of human rights law, regional law, or the law of international organizations is helpful, however it is notrequired. Recommended Reading: Martin Dixon, Textbook on International Law , (Blackstone Press 1996). The course and examination will be conducted in English, however you may answer the ques-tion in either Norwegian or English.

Development interventions do not occur in a vacuum but instead act upon and are influenced by theprevailing social and cultural systems. It does not take much to say that some place needs to increasethe productivity of agriculture, or that in another place primary education has to be provided. Butbeyond that first diagnosis, the specification of the problem, its magnitude, possible ameliorationstrategies, and the likely outcome of particular approaches to its solution, are all topics on which youwill find considerable disagreement. In this disagreement you will witness conflicting world views andperspectives. How people articulate and justify their politics will reveal further the cultural values thatshape their perceptions and the social and power relations underlying them. Politics, culture, powerand social organisation are very important if we are to define development problems, identify just andviable solutions, and propose ways and means to carry out those solutions in a fair and humane man-ner. Which means we need to develop some specialised skills of social analysis. To help you developsome of the requisite skills this course will: Introduce key approaches and debates in social theory in historical perspective and examine how they have influenced development thought Understand how questions concerning knowledge, power and difference are key themes in social analyses Illustrate the application of these questions to selected areas in development studies such as the household, knowledge, gender, identity, health, technology, economy, power and partic-ipation. Examine in detail selected cases so that the approaches and topics can be understood in terms of concepts and ideas specific to social-anthropological analyses (in contrast to purely neo-classical economic and rational choice analyses). Constraints of time, and the compulsions of covering many topics, will not make it possible to pro- vide a thorough treatment of all anthropological and sociological theories and approaches. But it willgive you ample opportunity to grasp what is meant by sociological and anthropological approaches todevelopment. The introduction provides the overview to the course and outlines a brief history ofsociology and anthropology and discusses similarities and differences. This will be followed by 15 two-hour sessions where we explore different themes such as power, participation, knowledge and institu-208 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons tions which will outline theoretical insights in historical perspective and draw on case study material. There will be no separate tutorials; rather the classes will consist of a mixture of short lectures, smallgroup discussions, student presentations, and the use of audio-visual materials. Building on the coursework from terms one and two this course will also maintain a critical focus on the development processitself turning the analytic lens on developers as well as the targets of development. The course will be assessed by means of a 5,000 word term paper. There is no text book for the course but the books listed for session one may be useful as basic reference for providing overviews.

We will also review the emergence of the disciplines of sociology and anthropology in historical context and tease out the similarities anddifferences between them. Sociology and anthropology had very distinct origins and traditionallyCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 209appeared to focus on different key issues and underpinnings despite some obvious commonalities. Today, however the boundaries are blurring not least because both sociology and anthropology draw on the same body of theory. However there still remain some distinct approaches. Through a paneldiscussion, two anthropologists and a sociologist will help stimulate discussion on the nature of thetwo disciplines, their boundaries and overlaps.

Session Title: Place And Displacement Lecturer: Lyla Mehta Date: 16 May 2002 Recent trends in post-modern literature have convincingly argued that place and culture are fluid and identity is performative and increasingly deterritorialised in a globalised world. As mobility is one ofthe definitive characteristics of the contemporary world, identity, it is argued by Appardurai, Guptaand Ferguson and others, can no longer be seen as tied to place but instead must be viewed as increas-ingly fluid and adaptative Displacement is thus seen to be a natural condition in an increasingly glob-alised world. However, displacement often means involuntary uprootment from ancestral homes and dramatic changes in social and cultural relations. It has also entailed a gross violation of a variety of rights: theright to livelihood and a decent standard of living, the right to information and the right to first andinformed prior consent. Indeed, the struggles around spatial practices and the identity associated witha particular place are the key assertions of protest movements against forced migration. Thus rightssuch as access to sources of livelihoods, land and occupation are linked to what Kibreab calls 'territo-rially anchored identities', the lack of which can lead to impoverishment and deprivation. The rangeof this displacement has been document by numerous studies on development-induced-displacementby authors such as Cernea, Scudder, Colson and others. Thus arguments that notions of place are largely 'imagined' and idealised would be to deny the strong links between displaced peoples' rights to resources and livelihoods and spatial rootedness and well-being. Currently 10 Million worldwide are affected by 'development' projects such as mines, damsand roads. Resettlement theory has tended to be largely applied and blind to questions concerningidentity, difference and contestation. This lecture draws on IDS research on forced displacement,place and gender to examine the legacy of post-modern thinking on identity and place for resettle-ment and displacement theory and map out what this means in concrete terms for displaced people'srights and sense of well-being.

DIDR has had overwhelmingly neg-ative economic, health, psychological and social consequences for the vast majority of those displaced,has evoked widespread resistance, and has become a highly contentious and politicised issue. The lasttwo decades have seen the development of policy guidelines by international bodies such as The WorldBank and the OECD, as well as by several countries, resulting in positive outcomes in some cases.Deep divisions remain as to whether the model of development presupposed by DIDR is sustainable,whether the (usually involuntary) displacement to which it gives rise constitutes a serious violation ofhuman rights, and whether it can ever be justified. In this module, we look at theoretical perspectives on the nature of DIDR, and analyse examples from Africa and Asia. We ask whether and how we could translate the lessons learned from previous mis-takes into sound policy which could improve the outcome for all concerned. Outcomes On completion of the work covered in this course, students will have a basic knowledge of the main theoretical approaches through which we seek to understand and improve DIDR a knowledge and understanding of different kinds of DIDR, and of the way they have taken shape in Africa and Asia an understanding of some of the complexities involved in trying to formulate and implement sound resettlement policy Assessment See general criteria for assessment on page B of this guide214 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Essays ESSAY No .......................

Cernea Fall 2003 United States of America Course Description: Development programs, large and small, frequently cause population resettlement, voluntary or invol- untary. This course focuses on the study of development-induced involuntary population displace- ment, both economic and physical, and on post-displacement resettlement and reconstruction. Suchpopulation movements will be analyzed in the course not as idiosyncratic, accidental side-effects of par-ticular projects, but as a category of complex social processes inherent to development. They exhibitdistinguishable structural regularities in their content, unfolding, social mechanisms, and conse-quences, despite the wide spectrum of specific country and project contexts within which they occur. By their high frequency, cumulative magnitude, and destructive socio-economic and cultural effects, forced displacements have come to be recognized as a severe pathology of development, of growingconcern and visibility on international and national agendas. These processes give rise to massivesocio-economic losses, to pain and suffering, to growing resistance movements, and also to policiesand programs intended to restrict and temper their effects. Anthropology and sociology are at the forefront of the social sciences exploring these processes. These disciplines have generated a massive body of scholarly knowledge about the patterns, content, andeffects of displacement. Arguably, resettlement is the domain in which development anthropology hassucceeded in exercising its single strongest influence on policies and practice. Therefore, understand-ing this body of knowledge is indispensable for anthropologists engaged in development. This studyequips students theoretically and methodologically, and cultivates skills for influencing social practice. The course will approach displacement/resettlement as a strategic window through which to explore broader theoretical and policy issues in development, especially \"the makings of induced develop-ment.\" Students are encouraged to take advantage in their learning and thinking of the fact that dis-placement processes are a propitious \"site\" for grasping the dialectic of development's benefits andlosses, its strengths and its pathologies, inner contradictions, conflicts, and trade-offs. The course will place development-induced displacement and resettlement (DIDR) within the broad- er taxonomy of population displacements. It will compare development-displacees to other major cat-egories of displaced populations, from conflict-generated refugees to environmentally relatedmigrants, in order to identify common characteristics and substantive differences.222 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons The course requires, and aims at, a deep immersion into the anthropological analysis of displacement processes, through consistent student reading, absorption, and discussion of the anthropological andsociological literature on resettlement\u2014its empirical findings, concepts, and methods. The course bib-liography also includes items of a different type\u2014project appraisal reports, evaluation reports, policystatements on resettlement, development agency documents\u2014intended to complement the scientificbibliography (available in the Course-pack or placed on reserve at GWU Library). Finally, this course is given with a strong commitment to active engagement, rather than passive con- templation, towards avoiding or reducing displacements whenever possible, and towards improvingthe standards and processes of induced displacements. It also aims to convey and build this commit-ment among the participating students as\u2014possibly\u2014future practicing social scientists. The courseand class debates will reach into the ethics of development and\u2014vastly\u2014into the political, policy andoperational hard questions of how to prevent/reduce impoverishment risks and social disorganizationin forced resettlement. Education for Operational Work Beyond academic knowledge, this course will explain project-design and operational issues in devel-opment interventions causing displacements. The aim is also to introduce students to the options andrequirements of practical development work in possible future jobs in this domain. The study of real- life \"Resettlement Action Plans\" of some major development projects is included. Course Syllabus: September 8, 2003 1. Development and Human Settlement Patterns: The Place of Displacement in the Paradigm of Induced Development. The first session will place development-induced displacement and resettlement (DIDR) within the broader perspective of induced development. The ethical challenges will be emphasized together with thereasons for studying the topic. Students will introduce themselves and their reasons for taking this course. September 15, 2003 2.

Overview/Course Synthesis: Main Themes in the Anthropology of Involuntary Displacement and Resettlement.228 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Anthropology 222.10 Development and Population DisplacementFall Semester 2003 Masters Degree Course Suggested Themes for the T erm Paper A term paper 20-30 pages is intended to demonstrate how course participants have understood key ideas, concepts, and arguments developed by scholars, researchers, and policy makers working onresettlement, and are able to use them in their independent analyses of empirical data about displace- ments. Students can select from the list of topics below or, alternatively, propose other subjects withan abstract. Each of the themes, whether proposed below or by the student, must be anchored in ideaspresented in lectures during the course. Each paper must cover the issues in-depth and critically, andinclude independent thinking by the student. Creative personal treatment, including iconoclasticviews and \"crazy ideas\" are encouraged, with supporting argumentation. For those who want to develop the material in more detail, an upper limit of 40 pages is acceptable. The paper should be delivered in hard copy, typed double-spaced, between November 15-20, 2003, to allow for class presentation and discussion. Proposed themes are: 1. Applying the Eminent Domain Principle to Land Acquisition for Displacements: \"Pros\" and \"Cons,\" Strengths and Weaknesses. 2.History of the \"Eminent Domain Principle\": Origin, Contexts, and Issues in Its Contemporary Application. The student will research the origin of the principle and will ana-lyze it in light of anthropological perspectives on state and social contexts. 3. Strengths and Fallacies of Compensation Expropriation and Displacement: Secondary Analysis of Empirical Research. (Three or four terms papers are possible on this topic) A frica South Asia (India) China and East Asia Latin America Note: Three or four students can develop jointly or independently the methodology for secondary analysis and carry out their analyses separately. Findings will be presented for a comparative discussionin a class session. 4. Population Displacement for Biodiversity Parks Establishment: Synthesis, Analysis, and Discussion of Findings/arguments from Anthropological Research Literature. Note: This topic can be taken up by two or three students, in distinct papers about research in: Latin America Asia USA/EuropeCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 229Findings will be presented and discussed in a comparative manner in a class session. 5. Ethics, Law, and Development: A discussion of forced displacement and the \"greater good for the largest number\" principle in light of John Rawls and Amartya Sen. Note: If two students are interested, one can focus on Rawls \"Theory of Justice,\" the other on Amartya Sen's theory of entitlements and on development as freedom. Course Readings: Cernea, M.

How does one define and understand international human rights? What role do these rights play in assuring the World HealthOrganization's definition of health\"? How can health professionals, lawyers, social scientists, and oth-ers concerned with human rights improve individual and community health and well-being by pro-tecting and promoting human rights? The course provides an overview of the epidemiology of human rights violations in the world and an analysis of the psychology of abuse. The course considers the role of health professionals and otherhealth promoters in: documenting the health consequences of human rights violations, treating sur-vivors of state-sponsored abuse, addressing specific human rights concerns of women and children,identifying the impact of health policy on human rights, and participating in human rights educationand advocacy. It examines the relationship between bioethics and human rights and the relationshipbetween human rights, the environment and multinational corporations. Also, the contemporaryhuman rights issues of universality and accountability are addressed. The course aims to provide students with a basic understanding of human rights issues relevant to health professionals. Lectures and in-class discussions will enable students to acquire knowledge and skills nec-essary for preventing and alleviating the human suffering caused by human rights abuses. In addition,research assignments will provide students with opportunities to raise meaningful questions by pursuing the study of original ideas. Students' conceptual understandings and knowledge will be assessed throughtheir participation in class. Their abilities to develop original ideas and engage in critical thinking onhuman rights will be reflected in their research assignment selection, presentation and writing.

The training package is divided into several modules. This module focuses on the descriptive definition of an internally displaced persons. It looks at how the Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons has defined the term and how other agencies who work closely with internally displaced define or choose not to define the term. Arriving at a definition of an internally displaced person The definition in the UN Guiding Principles It is important to acknowledge that there are several ways of describing who is an internally displaced person and that they fulfill different purposes. The definition presented in the Guiding Principles is generally acknowledged to be the current UN definition, but it is rather a descriptive definition than a legal definition. It does not assign special rights to IDPs under international law, simply restates and reflects already existing rights. The coverage of the definition in the Guiding Principles will be discussed in more detail below. Definitions of IDPs under national legislation Countries affected by internal displacement sometimes develop national IDP legislation or decrees defining who is entitled to special assistance and protection by the state. Such a person may be granted emergency assistance in the form of food rations, immediate access to health care and temporary shelter. The definition of a displaced person used in national legislation sometimes differs from the one in the UN Guiding Principles. The Colombian IDP legislation for example is somewhat narrower than the Guiding Principles. It includes victims of war and human rights violations, but does not include individuals displaced as a result of natural disasters or misguided development projects. National IDP legislation generally affords specific legal rights to assistance and protection for those who fall within the definition, while the UN Guiding Principles simply uses the definition to identify vulnerable groups in need of special attention by the national and international community. Civilian victims of war targeted for support by the ICRC Since its formation the ICRC has been providing protection and assistance to non-combatants affected by war and internal conflict, many of whom are internally displaced. The ICRC however extends its services to all civilian victims of conflict whether they have been obliged to move or not, so they do not treat internally displaced persons as a special category.T258 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 6The Definition in the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement This definition is generally recognized as the UN definition. For the purposes of the Guiding Principles (1998), internally displaced persons are defined as: \"...persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\" Further more, Principle 6.2 (c-d) reads: \"The prohibition of arbitrary displacement includes displacement: (c) In cases of large-scale development projects, which are not justified by compelling and overriding public interests; (d) In cases of disasters, unless the safety and health of those affected requires their evacuation;\" As already mentioned above, the definition of an internally displaced person under the Guiding Principles is not a legal definition conferring special legal status in the same way the Refugee Convention assigns special status to refugees. Walter Kalin has explained this difference in his annotations to the Principles: \"In international law, refugees are granted a special legal status because they have lost the protection of their own country and, therefore, are in need of international protection not necessary for those who do not cross international borders. Internally displaced persons do not need such a substitute protection. Rather, as human beings who are in a situation of vulnerability they are entitled to the enjoyment of all relevant guarantees of human rights and humanitarian law, including those that are of special importance to them.\" (Kalin, p.3) The two most important components of the definition in the Guiding Principles are: 1) the fact that the victims have not crossed an international state border , and 2) the element of coerced or forced movement . These and other aspects of the definition are quoted and briefly commented on below: 1) \"have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\"Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2597/g37/g3The most obvious characteristic of the internally displaced persons is the fact that they still remain within the borders of their country, as opposed to refugees who have crossed an internationally recognized border. 2) \"Forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence\" /g37/g3Forced or obliged to flee does also include the possibility of being expelled or intimidated to leave by threat. Most importantly, displacement is coerced or involuntary in this case. /g37/g3Someone voluntarily leaving their home to seek better economic conditions in a different part of the country would therefore not fall within the definition. /g37/g3Habitual residence is not necessarily a house or a building, but could also be a territory, which for example nomadic groups consider their \"habitual residence\". 3) \"As a result of or in order to avoid \" /g37/g3This phrasing allows for a person who has fled threats of violence to fall under the definition of the Guiding Principles. It is clear that \"...as a result of\" implies that the violent acts have already taken place while \"in order to avoid\" implies fear that they will take place. It is of course understandable that many people flee before the fighting reaches their area, which does not make them less of an IDP under the definition in the Guiding Principles. 4) A very important element of the definition and GP 6.2(c) is the delineation of causes: \"In particular as a result of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters\" /g37/g3 The Guiding Principles list the causes of displacement falling within the definition. Most are self-explanatory. However, \"situations of generalized violence\" leave open the nature and extent of the violence. Such situations are not considered armed conflict but involve the use of force by government agents to restore public order. 1 /g37/g3 Natural disaster is included because in some disasters governments respond by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups of victims on political or ethnic grounds or by violating their rights in other ways. 1 \"Examples of tensions and disturbances include riots, such as demonstrations without a concerted plan from the outset, isolated sporadic acts of violence, as opposed to military operations carried out by armed forces or armed groups; and violent ethnic conflicts not amounting to hostilities\" (Francis Deng, Compilation and Analysis ofLegal Norms, par.28)260 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 8/g37/g3 Human-made disasters (nuclear, chemical accidents, etc.) or large-scale development projects (which are not justified by compelling and overriding public interests) are included for the same reason. In other words, persons displaced by for example a large hydroelectric dam would fall under the definition of the UN Guiding Principles if the project can not be considered of \"compelling and overriding public interest\", or if the government does not resettle or compensate those displaced. /g37/g3 \"In particular\" emphasizes that other causes may be considered. Categories of people that have left their homes The definition of an internally displaced person according to the UN Guiding Principles has been provided above. Below, this definition (middle circle) has been compared to a narrower group of IDPs prioritized by the UN Representative on Internal Displacement (conflict-induced IDPs), and a very broad category made up of economic migrants. The UN Representative actively uses the Guiding Principles in carrying out his mandate but has so far focused on conflict-induced displacement. All displaced persons, including economic migrantsInternally Displaced Persons according to the Guiding PrinciplesConf lict- induced -UN Special Rep (F.Deng)Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2619To summarize... /g37/g3 The definition of an internally displaced person in the Guiding Principles seeks to provide a balance between being inclusive enough to capture complex and interrelated causes of displacement and narrow enough to be manageable. /g37/g3 It is important to recognize that it is a descriptive definition, not a legal designation. The Guiding Principles do not provide additional rights to IDPs that are not enjoyed by other citizens. However, national IDP legislation sometimes includes a definition of those persons entitled to special assistance and protection as displaced persons. /g37/g3 Some international organizations, particularly the ICRC, prefer to not classify the displaced as a separate group. The ICRC provides assistance to all persons affected by war, including a large number of internally displaced. /g37/g3 The Guiding Principles apply to persons displaced by armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters and large-scale development projects, which are not justified by compelling and overriding public interests. /g37/g3 The definition of an IDP in the Guiding Principles can be applied to many situations, although not all situations will be of concern to the international community. Only in situations where government asks for assistance or if IDPs are facing \"persecution, discrimination or neglect\" 2 for example, would international community become involved. /g37/g3 The definition does not encompass persons who migrate because of economic causes. Persons forced from their homes because of economic injustice and marginalisation tantamount to systematic violation of the economic rights would however come under the definition. 2 The terms used in \" Masses in Flight \" the Brookings Institution, 1998 pg 18 to denote when the representative of the secretary general on IDPs has a responsibility.Why do we need a definition? /g37/g3Internally displaced share problems and characteristics specific to their situation that need to be delineated /g37/g3Up to now the protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons have often been overlooked and cannot be addressed if the beneficiaries themselves and the nature of their situation is not defined. /g37/g3The development of a normative framework requires a definition.262 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 10Application of the definition - Items for Discussion Developing a profile of an internally displaced person in your region According to the UN definition try and develop a profile of the internally displaced in your region or country. If national legislation or government policy provides a different definition, please compare that to the one in the Principles. Describe who is displaced, where are they displaced from and where are they displaced to. Where possible, explain the causes and pattern of displacement (rural to urban, individual and mass displacement etc.). In the process of discussions you may wish to consider some of the following questions in developing a profile. The list is meant to stimulate discussions on applying the definition and developing a profile and is not exhaustive. Limits on Duration or Frequency of Displacement i) When does the status of displaced begin or end? Does it depend on the number of times one is displaced? ii) Does, for example, a family living in a permanent structure for several years within a camp setting satisfy the definition of displacement or could they be considered resettled? iii) Is someone who is forced or obliged to flee his or her home every night displaced? iv) Does someone who has just returned home from being internally displaced and is still considered vulnerable meet the definition of an internally displaced person, if so for how long? Forced displacement vs. economic migration i) How do you define what is considered voluntary departure because of difficult living conditions and what is involuntary forced displacement. Is the line clearly defined in your region? Discrimination and neglect i) In your region, are you aware of discrimination against displaced victims of natural disasters? ii) If large numbers of citizens have been displaced by development projects, have they been resettled or compensated?Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 263 Module Two: Legal Origins and InternationalObligations264 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 2Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2653INTRODUCTION: THE AIM OF THIS MODULE 4 LEGAL ORIGINS 4 INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW 4 WHO DOES INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS APPLY TO ?5 INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 5 WHO DOES INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW APPLY TO ?7 INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE LAW 7 WHO DOES INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE LAW APPLY TO ?7 WHAT RIGHTS ARE APPLICABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY ?7 BINDING CONVENTIONS AND THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 7 WHO DO THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES APPLY TO ?8 TO SUMMARIZE .... 9 EXERCISE 10 ANNEXES 11266 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 4Introduction: The aim of this Module This module will introduce participants to the legal basis for the Guiding Principles on Internally Displaced Persons in international law. Participants will gain an understanding of human rights law, humanitarian law and refugee law, by analogy applicable to internal displacement situations. It will also highlight the parallel provisions of the GuidingPrinciples in regional human rights instruments and national law. Legal Origins to the Guiding Principles The Guiding Principles have not been developed, signed and ratified by States and are therefore not considered binding international law. However, they restate and reflect international conventions in the fields of Human Rights Law, Humanitarian Law and Refugee Law. Practically all Principles can be traced to a particular instrument under one of these three categories of binding international law. Some general rights have been developed and made more explicitly relevant to displaced persons (See Example 1-2 in Annex No.1). For practical purposes, rights relevant to the internally displaced but scattered in a number of conventions have been gathered in one instrument: the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. However, one could defend these same rights making reference to their original source (Human Rights Law, Humanitarian Law and Refugee Law). Thanks to the drafters of the Principles we now have a comprehensive tool, which not only gathers all rights relevant to the displaced but also expands and make them more explicitly applicable to IDPs. To fully understand the Guiding Principles it is useful to have a clear idea of their sources. Let us therefore look at the three main sources mentioned above: International Human Rights Law Human Rights Law consists of a large number of instruments addressing general and specific human rights. The most important being: /g37/g3Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) /g37/g3International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) /g37/g3International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) /g37/g3Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) /g37/g3Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) /g37/g3Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) /g37/g3Convention against Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has not been signed and ratified by States, but it is considered an interpretation of the human rights articles in the UN Charter (Art.55-56), which has become somewhat of a constitution for the international community. The UDHR could therefore be seen as binding on UN member states.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2675The two international covenants on civil/political rights and economic/social/cultural rights make up the basis for many of the more thematic and specialized human rights conventions. The right to life and freedom from torture are some of the most important civil rights, while the right to vote is an example of an important political right. States are expected to implement these rights as soon as they become a State Party to the covenant. The implementation of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights often requires resources (to improve access to food, health care, and housing for example), which are not at hand in many countries. The implementation of these rights is therefore likely to be progressive and often in close collaboration with the international community. However, State parties to this covenant have the obligation to prioritize vulnerable groups and to take steps to the maximum of its available resources to realize all the rights covered by this covenant. Among the more specialized conventions, four of them have constituted particularly important sources for the Guiding Principles: Convention on the Rights of the Child, Convention against Torture and the two conventions against racial discrimination anddiscrimination against women. In addition to the international human rights instruments developed by member states of the United Nations, a number of regional human rights instruments have been drawn on during the development of the Principles. These conventions - the Inter-AmericanConvention on Human rights, the European Convention on Human rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights - have been developed by the respective regional intergovernmental body. A regional human rights instrument for Asia is yet to be developed. Who does international human rights apply to? /g37/g3States generally owe human rights to individuals. State parties to the UN conventions have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfill the rights included in the human rights conventions and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This concept is clearly linked to the States' traditional monopoly on the use of legitimate force to maintain law and order in a democratic society.Consequently, only state agents, and sometimes individuals acting on the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official, are said to violate human rights. On the other hand, violent acts committed by private individuals would normally be classified as a common crime and would therefore fall under the Criminal Code of a particular country. /g37/g3Some exceptions apply to this traditional concept of human rights. For example, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide explicitly applies to individuals, whether they are state agents or not.Furthermore, the possible responsibility of illegal groups under human rights law has long been the subject of discussion. International Humanitarian Law (IHL)268 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 6Humanitarian law can somewhat simplified be characterized as the internationally accepted norms determining certain limitations on how warfare can be conducted by the warring parties. These international laws strive to protect non-combatants from the effects of war and to limit the use of certain methods of warfare. The main instruments are made up of the four Geneva Conventions and their two additional protocols. The fourth Geneva Convention is explicitly dedicated to the protection of civilians and therefore contains important protection provisions applicable to internally displaced persons. In the fourth Convention, Article 3 dealing with internal conflicts and the treatment of persons taking no active part in the hostilities is particularly relevant to IDPs. 1 The full text of this article is reproduced in an annex to this module (Annex No.2). The content of Article 3 is developed in more detail in the II Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, the Protocol on Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. In the II Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, particular attention should be paid to Article 17, which explicitly prohibits the displacement of the civilian population \"unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand\". The full text of this article as well as a commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross is included in the box below. Also, from the IV Geneva Convention you will see that persons evacuated for their own protection have the right to be returned as soon as possible. Because internal displacement so often occurs in situations of internal armed conflicts, the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols have been an important source for the UN Guiding Principles. 1 Because the third article in each of the four Geneva Conventions reads exactly the same, this article is often referred to as \"Common Article 3\".II Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions Art 17. Prohibition of forced movement of civilians : 1. The displacement of the civilian population shall not be ordered for reasons related to the conflict unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand. Should such displacements have to be carried out, all possible measures shall be taken in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition. 2. Civilians shall not be compelled to leave their own territory for reasons connected with the conflict. ICRC commentary to Art 17 of the II Additional Protocol: Clearly, imperative military reasons cannot be justified by political motives. For example, it would be prohibited to move a population in order to exercise more effective control over a dissident ethnic group. Art 49 IV Geneva Convention: ...Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2697Who does international humanitarian law (IHL) apply to? /g37/g3IHL applies to Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions and the additional protocols. In addition, armed opposition groups (as citizen of a country Contracting Party to the conventions) are also bound by internationalhumanitarian law, particularly Article 3, Common to the four Geneva Conventions (see above). Armed opposition groups fulfilling certain minimum conditions regarding military capacity and capacity to implement IHL are also bound by the II Additional Protocol on Protection of Victims of Non-InternationalArmed Conflicts (see II Additional Protocol Art.1.1). /g37/g3In addition, the 1998 Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court provides for individual responsibility for war crimes committed in internal or international conflicts. International Refugee Law We have already seen in Module 1 that one of the key elements in the definition of an internally displaced person is the fact that he/she has not crossed an international border, as opposed to refugees who by definition have left their country. Therefore, refugee law is not directly applicable to IDPs. However, given the similarities of the causes for flight, the living conditions in reception areas and the challenges faced during return and resettlement, refugee law provided important guidance when the Principles were elaborated. The most important source is the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. The application of refugee law by analogy has clearly enriched the content of the Guiding Principles. One crucial concept borrowed from the refugee regime is the protection against forcible return to situations of danger, the principle of non-refoulement. The prohibition against forced return of IDPs is based on refugee law, by analogy, but also has its counterpart in human rights law. Who does international refugee law apply to? /g37/g3Refugee law applies to State parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. What rights are applicable in your country? Binding conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Most basic rights enjoyed by all citizens, including IDPs, are universally applicable in all UN member states (see Customary Law below). However, not all states have signed and ratified the most important human rights and humanitarian law conventions listed in this 270 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 8Module. In case your country is not a State Party2 to one or several of the conventions on which the Guiding Principles are built, you still enjoy protection through the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The UDHR, which contains some of the basic human rights concepts, applies to all UN member states. Furthermore, the UDHR is seen as an authoritative interpretation of the human rights provisions in the UN Charter (Art. 55-56), which is legally binding on all UN member states. Customary International Law In international law, universally accepted and applied norms have developed and gradually become part of binding international law. This law, referred to as customaryinternational law, has developed based on its moral force and on its widespread acceptance in different national and international judicial systems. A growing body of international human rights law can be classified as customary international law. Many of the most important rights under the UDHR are today considered customary law. These rights are therefore binding on states, despite the UDHR not being signed and ratified by States as other binding human rights instruments. As a minimum, the followingviolations would be prohibited under customary international law: genocide, murder, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, racial discrimination, forced return of IDPs and refugees (\"refoulement\"). Who do the Guiding Principles apply to? Given that the Principles build heavily on international humanitarian law, which applies to state and non-state actors, they are designed to give guidance to both these groups of actors. As stated in the introduction to the Principles, they are intended to provide guidance to states, other authorities (e.g. armed insurgent groups), intergovernmental organizations (UN etc.), non-governmental organizations, groups and individuals. Even if the Principles are designed to provide guidance to a broad group of players interacting with IDPs, the primary responsibility to protect and assist IDPs lays with the national authorities. This is clearly spelled out in Principle 3: Guiding Principle 3 1. National authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction. 2. Internally displaced persons have the right to request and to receive protection and humanitarian assistance from these authorities. They shall not be persecuted or punished for making such a request. 2 To become a so-called \"State Party\" to an international human right or humanitarian law treaty, a governments signs the international instrument, followed by the ratification of that decision by the national parliament.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2719The Guiding Principles recognize the central duties and responsibilities of states in promoting and protecting the rights of internally displaced persons within their territoryin relation to both protection and humanitarian assistance. Adequate domestic protection is the prime responsibility of a sovereign state, however if that state is unable or unwilling to fulfill its duties, it is obliged to invite or accept international assistance. To summarize..... /g37/g3Even if the Guiding Principles themselves are no t binding international law, they are derived fro m binding instruments /g37/g3The Principles are consistent with and derived from human rights law, humanitarian law and refugee law (by analogy) /g37/g3Most governments have formally committed to respect human rights and humanitarian law (signe d and ratified conventions), others are responsible through the UN Charter and Customary Law /g37/g3The Guiding Principles apply to both state and no n state actors272 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 10Exercise As a group, participants are asked to familiarize themselves with the Guiding Principles and the international instruments from which the Principles are derived. Each group will be assigned a number of Guiding Principles to work with. First, all members of the group read and make sure they understand the Principles assigned.Participants should then look fore and identify one or several original sources of eachrespective Principle in a number of key human rights and humanitarian law instruments.For that purpose the following main instruments will be distributed: /g37/g3Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) /g37/g3International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) /g37/g3International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) /g37/g3Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) /g37/g3Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) /g37/g3Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) /g37/g3Convention against Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) /g37/g3Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions (Protocol II) The purpose of the exercise is to: 1. Make participants aware that the Guiding Principles are derived from international law. 2. Provide the participants with a hands-on experience with international law 3. Demonstrate the clear and plain language used in international law 4. Ensure participants understand the relevance of human rights and humanitarian law to internally displaced persons. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 27311Annex No.1 The Guiding Principles further develop existing rights and make them more explicit to IDPs Example 1: Discrimination based on a person's status as displaced is not explicitly prohibited in international law. However, both human rights law and international humanitarian law prohibit discrimination based on conditions such as for example race, color, sex, language, religion, national origin or \"other status\" or discrimination based on \"similar criteria\". It has therefore been considered that discrimination based on a person's situation as displaced fits into these last categories, and would therefore be prohibited under international human rights and humanitarian law. The Guiding Principles makes this prohibition explicit in Principle 1. Guiding Principle 1 1. Internally displaced persons shall enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country. They shall not be discriminated against in the enjoyment of any rights and freedoms on the ground that they are internally displaced. Example 2: The general rights of freedom of movement and right to choose one's residence are expressed in Guiding Principle 14.1. In the same Principle, an important consequence of this right is applied to the IDP situation in camps. Principle 14.2 explicitly guarantees the residents of camps the right to freely move in and out of these, prohibiting the arbitrary detention of IDPs in closed camps. Guiding Principle 14 1. Every internally displaced person has the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his or her residence. 2. In particular, internally displaced persons have the right to move freely in and out of camps or other settlements.274 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 12Annex No 2 Geneva Convention relative to the protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War Common Article 3 In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: 1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, color, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: (a) Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; (b) Taking of hostages; (c) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; (d) The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. 2. The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 27513276 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Module Three: Protection from Displacement, and Protection during Displacement .Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2772(Produced by the Norwegian Refugee Council in association with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights)278 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Key Concepts in this module: /g137/g3Non Discrimination /g137/g3Movement related rights /g137/g3Protection against being displaced /g137/g3Movement rights during displacement - closed camps /g137/g3Leaving one's country and return /g137/g3Physical Security /g137/g3Life, acts of /g137/g3Personal liberty needs: /g137/g3Subsistence needs /g137/g3Health related needs /g137/g3Need for identification and documentation /g137/g3PropertyCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2794INTRODUCTION 5 THEME 1: NON DISCRIMINATION 5 NON DISCRIMINATION ON ACCOUNT OF RACE ,RELIGION ,ETHNICITY ,OPINION ,SEX,LANGUAGE 6 NON DISCRIMINATION ON ACCOUNT OF DISPLACE MENT 6 THEME 2: MOVEMENT-RELATED RIGHTS 8 ISSUE I: P ROTECTION AGAINST BEING ARBITRARILY DISPLACED 8 THE RIGHT NOT TO BE DISPLACED 8 LIMITATIONS TO THE RIGHT TO NOT BE DISPLACED 9 DISPLACEMENT IN SITUATIONS OTHER THAN EMERGENCIES 12 ISSUE II: M OVEMENT RIGHTS DURING DISPLACEMENT 13 ISSUES PARTICULAR TO CAMP SITUATIONS 13 THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND PHYSICAL SECURITY 13 ISSUE III: L EAVING ONE 'S COUNTRY AND RETURN 15 THEME 3: PHYSICAL SECURITY 17 ISSUE I: T HREATS TO LIFE -AND OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE 17 ISSUE II: P ERSONAL DIGNITY 21 ISSUE III: F ORCED RECRUITMENT 23 RECRUITMENT OF CHILDREN 24 RECRUITMENT OF ADULTS 24 THEME 4: SPECIAL NEEDS 25 ISSUE I: SUBSISTENCE NEEDS 25 ISSUE II: H EALTH RELATED NEEDS 27 ISSUE III: T HE NEED FOR IDENTIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION 28 ISSUE IV: P ROPERTY 29280 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Introduction Internally displaced persons all share general protection and assistance needs. Protection needs are those relating to ensuring that basic human rights are respected in other wordsprotecting the physical, material and mental security of all individuals includinginternally displaced persons. Assistance needs are those that relate to the delivery ofhumanitarian aid. In practice, protection and assistance needs are inextricably linked -both affecting the other. In this module we will consider sections II and III of the Guiding Principles, namely the principles relating to protection from displacement and protection during displacement. While the Guiding Principles themselves are structured through the phases ofdisplacement - before and during displacement and return/resettlement - this module will look at the Principles by considering the major themes which cut across all phases ofdisplacement, namely: /g37/g3Non discrimination /g37/g3Movement related rights /g37/g3Physical security /g37/g3Special needs of internally displaced persons. It should be noted that most of these concepts reoccur throughout the Guiding Principles however, this module will consider how these themes relate specifically to protectionfrom and during displacement. Theme 1: Non Discrimination The fundamental right to equality and non-discrimination is the pillar of human rights law and, as such, is reflected throughout the Guiding Principles. Internally displaced peoplemust not be discriminated against on the basis of: 1. their status as internally displaced persons; or 2. their race, sex, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Later Principles reiterate this right in the context of particular situations to reinforce the concept that internally displaced people are entitled to be treated in the same way as allother persons in a given territory. Discrimination is generally defined as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, decent, or national ethnic origin which has the purposeor effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equalfooting, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social,cultural or any other field of public life\". [CERD, article 1]Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2816Non discrimination on account of race, religion, ethnicity, opinion, sex, language Principle 22 1. Internally displaced persons, whether or not they are living in camps, shall not be discriminated against as a result of their displacement in the enjoyment of the following rights: (a) The rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, opinion and expression; (b) The right to seek freely opportunities for employment and to participate in economic activities; (c) The right to associate freely and participate equally in community affairs; (d) The right to vote and to participate in governmental and public affairs, including the right to have access to the means necessary to exercise this right; and (e) The right to communicate in a language they understand. Human rights protect all people against being treated in a different way to others, entitling all people to enjoy their human rights in the same way. All persons are equalbefore the law and are entitled without any distinction to the equal protection of the law.Distinction means that a persons is treated in a different way based on their race, colour,sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. This is closely linked with the rights of women to be treated equally to men. Temporary special measures aimed at accelerating the equality between men and women, sometimesreferred to as \"affirmative action\", is permitted and not considered discriminatory. Non discrimination on account of displacement As internally displaced persons are frequently forced to relocate to unfamiliarsurroundings, they are often viewed with suspicion by local authorities or residents.Sometimes the cause of discrimination may be their race, religion, ethnicity or lack ofcommon language, but internally displaced persons can also face discrimination merelyon account of their displacement. It is important to note that fundamental human rightsare not suspended on account of a persons being displaced and therefore internallydisplaced persons are entitled to the same freedoms as all other people. Should any of these rights be denied to internally displaced persons and not to other persons, such treatment will be considered discriminatory because it applies to oneportion of the population unequally - on the basis of their situation of being displaced.282 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 7In some situations, the local authorities and residents may suspect internally displaced persons of collaborating with a dissident group. Arrest, detention or ill-treatment ofinternally displaced persons by the authorities on the basis of their displacement is prohibited because it is considered discriminatory. Principle 12 3. Internally displaced persons shall be protected from discriminatory arrest and detention as a result of their displacement.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 2838Theme 2: Movement-related Rights The most obvious need of internally displaced persons is protection against violations of their right to choose their own residence and to move freely within their own country.Likewise, they need also protection against forced relocation and mass transfers, whichcan be considered movement-related rights. Finally, circumstances may require displacedpersons to leave their own country and they therefore need to exercise their rights to seek asylum elsewhere. This section will therefore examine how the right to freedom of movement applies to internally displaced persons according to these issues. Key issues Protection against being displaced Movement during displacement Leaving one's country and return Issue I: Protection against being arbitrarily displaced The right not to be displaced States are required to take all measures to avoid conditions, which might lead todisplacement. The Guiding Principles require States to adhere to international law as soto prevent or avoid situations that might lead to displacement. Principle 5 All authorities and international actors shall respect and ensure respect for their obligations under international law, including human rights and humanitarian law, in all circumstances, so as to prevent and avoid conditions that might lead to displacement of persons. All people have the right to freedom of movement and the right to choose his or her place of residence. In situations of internal displacement the right to freedom of movement and freedom to choose one's place of residence is restricted during the period ofdisplacement. The right to freedom of movement is reflected in Principle 6 of theGuiding Principles which elaborates the right of all people not to be displaced arbitrarily- or in other words to protect their freedom of movement. 284 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 9Principle 6 1. Every human being shall have the right to be protected against being arbitrarily displaced from his or her home or place of habitual residence. Legal Foundations of the Principle The right to protection from displacement is derived from the right to freedom of movement and choice of residence contemplated in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR-see list of acronyms inannex) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) which guarantees that \"everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement andfreedom to choose his residence\". A similar guarantee exists in theAfrican Charter. Protection against displacement is also derived from theright to housing under the Covenant on Economic, social and CulturalRights (CESCR). In situations of armed conflict Additional Protocol II ofthe Geneva Conventions specifically states that \"displacement of thecivilian population shall not be ordered for reasons related to theconflict...\". Displacement by force is a denial of the right to freedom of movement and choice of residence since it deprives a person of the choice of moving or not and of choosing where to reside. Limitations or restrictions to this right Most human rights instruments permit States to place restrictions on freedom of residence and movement during situations of tension and disturbance in limited situations.However, failure to comply with the limited restrictions will make a decision to displacea population arbitrary - in other words a decision that was not in accordance with the law and incompatible with standards protecting liberty and security of person will be inviolation of the right to freedom of movement. Freedom of movement may only belimited where such restrictions are: 1. Provided by law - that is to say the power to move a population is written in national legislation, and 2. are necessary to protect: /g37/g3national security - which is only endangered in cases of grave political ormilitary threat to the entire nation; /g37/g3public order ( ordre public ) /g37/g3public health or morals - which can only be justified if the health dangers are acute /g37/g3the rights and freedom of others - which may only be justified in cases ofeviction to respect private property in which case States must ensure thatinterference in favor of private owners is proportional, reasonable andapplied in a non discriminatory way: andCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 285103. must not be inconsistent with other State obligations under international law. Therefore any interference with the rights to freedom of movement and choice of residence must be balanced. It must pursue a legitimate aim and be proportional to that aim. In the event that a decision to displace is made, the displacement should not lastlonger than is required: Principle 6(3) Displacement shall last no longer than required by the circumstances. Derogations from rights in situations of public emergency The right to freedom of movement and choice of residence can be derogated from according to the ICCPR. However there are strict limitations including that anyderogation is not inconsistent with a States obligations under international law and doesnot involve discrimination. For example, a population therefore cannot be displaced intimes of emergency based on discrimination. Principle 6(2) of the Guiding Principles further elaborates when limitations on people's freedom of movement are considered arbitrary. Principle 6(2) 2. The prohibition of arbitrary displacement includes displacement: (a) When it is based on policies of apartheid, \"ethnic cleansing\" or similar practices aimed at/or resulting in altering the ethnic, religious or racial composition of the affected population; (b) In situations of armed conflict, unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand; (c) In cases of large-scale development projects, which are not justified by compelling and overriding public interests; (d) In cases of disasters, unless the safety and health of those affected requires their evacuation; and (e) When it is used as a collective punishment. In situations of non-international armed conflict persons are protected from forceddisplacement in international humanitarian law under article 17 of Additional Protocol IIof the Geneva Conventions, which state that: The displacement of civilian population shall not be ordered for reasons related to the conflict unless : 1. The security of the civilians so demands, or286 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 112. For imperative military reasons. Imperative military reasons require a meticulous assessment of a situation, which could not be justified on political motives. The burden of justifying such action falls on theinitiating party. Procedures in the event of displacement In light of the narrow circumstances in which a State can make a decision to displace a population the Guiding Principles provide for the following steps to be taken to ensurethe protection of internally displaced persons from a violation of the right to freedom ofmovement. Principle 7 1. Prior to any decision requiring the displacement of persons, the authorities concerned shall ensure that all feasible alternatives are explored in order to avoid displacement altogether. Where no alternatives exist, all measures shall be taken to minimize displacement and its adverse effects. 2. The authorities undertaking such displacement shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to the displaced persons, that such displacements are effected in satisfactory conditions of safety, nutrition, health and hygiene, and that members of the same family are not separated. \"Ensure that all feasible alternatives are explored in order to avoid displacement \" Since internally displaced persons, like all other persons within a territory, have freedom of movement, which can only be restricted in limited situations provided by law, allfeasible alternatives must be explored before a decision to displace a population can betaken. It might include considerations of reinforcing local security or diverting conflictfrom the area. \"Where no alternative exists - minimize displacement and its adverse effects\" If internal displacement is deemed necessary in situations of non-international armed conflict, States must take particular measures to ensure that \"all possible measures shallbe taken in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactoryconditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition\". [Protocol II article 17] Principle 7 therefore specifies that the authorities shall ensure to the \"greatest practicable extent\" that internally displace person receive: /g37/g3Proper accommodation (see Principle 18: the right to an adequate standard of living) /g37/g3Satisfactory conditions of safety, nutrition, health and hygiene (see Principle 19 - the right to an adequate standard of care) /g37/g3Family unity (see principle17 - family as the fundamental unit)Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 28712States must also ensure that protection is provided during displacement: Principle 8 Displacement shall not be carried out in a manner that violates the rights to life, dignity, liberty and security of those affected. Displacement in situations other than emergencies If displacement takes place during times other than in emergencies or disasters, additional procedural guarantees are expected of States. 1. The decision to displace a population must be made by the authorities authorized to make that decision on behalf of the State. This ensures accountability, transparencyand predictability. 2. The authorities must: (a) Provide full information to displaced persons on issues surrounding their displacement. Full transparency of the process also allow displaced persons to prepare for orderly relocation. It also provides an opportunity for displacedpersons to become involved in the matters that effect their lives. 1 (b) Authorities will gather the free and informed consent of those to be displaced(c) Involve women in the planning and management of the relocation. 2 (d) Law enforcement measures carried out by competent legal authorities. (e) The authorities will respect the right to an effective remedy, including review of decision by appropriate judicial authorities. Special protection of vulnerable groups The Guiding Principles recognize a special dependency or attachment to the land among some members of the population compared to others. As such, the Principles placeadditional obligations on States to protect those people against displacement as theprocess would have additional negative impacts. Primarily the principle requires respectfor the special importance of spiritual, cultural and moral connections to the land. [ILOConvention No 169 16 (1)] To give effect to this Principle, States have additional responsibilities to the people in the event of displacement. If relocation of indigenous people is considered necessary, it must be in accordance with legal requirements 3 and as an exceptional measure shall only take place with: /g37/g3the free and informed consent of the affected communities; 1 This right is protected in the African Charter which states at article 9 that \"Every individual shall have the right to receive information\". 2 This issue is elaborated in Module 5 3 See Theme 2, section 1288 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 13or /g37/g3if consent cannot be obtained, the decision to displace can only be made if there was an opportunity for effective representation of the people concerned in the decisionmaking process, which may also include public inquiries where appropriate. [ILOConvention 169 16(2)] Principle 9 States are under a particular obligation to protect against the displacement of indigenous peoples, minorities, peasants, pastoralists and other groups with a special dependency on and attachment to their lands. Issue II: Movement rights during displacement The right to freedom of movement and chose of residence does not cease when a person is displaced. The Guiding Principles acknowledge that this right applies equally to situations of displacement. Principle 14 (1) 1. Every internally displaced person has the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his or her residence. Issues particular to camp situations Principle 14 (2) 2. In particular, internally displaced persons have the right to move freely in and out of camps or other settlements. Relocation for internally displaced persons frequently involves internment in a compound or camp where their freedom of movement is sometimes illegally restricted. In situations of tension and civil disturbance, internally displaced persons have the right to freedom of movement during the period of displacement, which means that they have the right tomove freely in and out of the camp. The right to liberty and physical security Freedom of movement for internally displaced persons is often closely connected with the right to liberty. There is a violation of the right to individual liberty when the Statedeprives a person, without a valid reason of his or her liberty by confining him or her in a prison or any other place such as a closed internal displacement camp.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 28914Principle 12 1. Every human being has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention 2. To give effect to this right for internally displaced persons, they shall not be interned in or confined to a camp. If in exceptional circumstances such internment or confinement is absolutely necessary, it shall not last longer than required by the circumstances. 3. Internally displaced persons shall be protected from discriminatory arrest and detention as a result of their displacement. 4. In no case shall internally displaced persons be taken hostage. Legal Foundations of the Principle The right to life and liberty is derived from UDHR article 3 which states the \"everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\" andsimilarly ICCPR 9 (1) and the African Charter. From this right stems theright not be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. Generally a violation of the right to security of person occurs when a person is arrested, detained, abducted or confined by the State (public official or any person acting in anofficial capacity) and where the State refuses to acknowledge the arrest or admitknowledge of the person's whereabouts or where the State fails to permit the personaccess to his or her rights. In these situations any confinement would be consideredarbitrary arrest or detention because the right to liberty is restricted. What is arbitrary detention? Detention will be considered arbitrary where there is a denial of the right to challenge the loss of liberty. In accordance with the UDHR article 8, \"Everyone has the right to aneffective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamentalrights granted him by the constitution or by law\". Similar safeguards exist in the ICCPR, which states that: /g37/g3An arrested person shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him or her; /g37/g3Anyone arrested or detained on criminal charges will be brought promptly beforea judge or other authorized officer within a reasonable time. /g37/g3Anyone arrested or detained shall be entitled to proceedings before a court inorder that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of the detentionand order release if the detention is not lawful. /g37/g3Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have anenforceable right to compensation. 290 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 15Issue III: Leaving one's country and return Internally displaced persons often find security in their own country, however because of religion, race or ethnic origin or political opinion they sometimes face persecution andtherefore need to find protection abroad. They also might wish to emigrate in order tofind a better future for themselves and their families in another more peaceful country.Therefore, an underlying issue of these principles is to maintain the right of internallydisplaced person to seek asylum or to leave their country. Principle 15 Internally displaced persons have: (a) The right to seek safety in another part of the country; (b) The right to leave their country; (c) The right to seek asylum in another country; and (d) The right to be protected against forcible return to or resettlement in any place where their life, safety, liberty and/or health would be at risk. (a) Right to seek internal safety Frequently internally displaced persons are relocated several times during their period of displacement. This Principle recognizes that internally displaced persons maintainfreedom of movement to relocate to another part of the country during displacement. (b) The right to leave Internally displaced persons lawfully within the territory of a State have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose their place of residence. They are also free to leave their own country. 4This right may only be limited if restrictions are: 1. provided by law and 2. are necessary to protect /g37/g3national security, /g37/g3public order /g37/g3public health or morals /g37/g3the rights and freedoms of others 3. And must be consistent with other rights recognized by international law. 4 [13(2) UDHR, 12(2) ICCPR which states that \"everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. Article12(2) African Charter]Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 29116(c) The right to seek asylum The right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries is particularly important for internally displaced persons. The right to seek asylum is derived from 14(1) UHDR which states that \"everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countriesasylum from persecution\". The right of internally displaced persons to seek asylum can not be claimed in cases where the persons fear criminal prosecution genuinely arising from a non-political crimeor has committed acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.292 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Theme 3: Physical Security The physical security of internally displaced persons is a matter of grave concern. States have an obligation to protect internally displaced persons from a variety of attacks andhuman rights abuses, which violate their fundamental human rights. The duty of physical protection also means that a State is responsible to protect people from crimes committed by other persons in the territory of the State. If a State fails to take measures toinvestigate and punish the crimes of others, the State is considered to have failed in its prime protection obligations and is therefore responsible for those crimes. Key Issues Threats to life - and other acts of violence Threats to personal dignity - closed camps Forced recruitment Issue I: Threats to life - and other acts of violence Internally displaced persons are frequently at risk from various acts of violence, which may include killings, torture, genocide, rape, the use of particularly dangerous weaponsand land mines and forcible disappearance. The right to life is guaranteed to all persons at all times. The right to life can never be arbitrarily restricted. Therefore internally displaced persons are guaranteed the right to life in the same way as all other citizens. This right is non-derogable and therefore States can never take measures to limit this right in times of national emergency. Arbitrarydeprivation of life is never allowed, including use of force by law enforcement officialswhich is in excess of the principles of necessity and proportionality [HRC]. To prevent violations of the right to life, States must take measures to: /g37/g3Prevent and punish deprivation of the right to life by criminal acts /g37/g3Prevent killing by their own security forces /g37/g3The law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of life (death penalty). Principle 10 1. Every human being has the inherent right to life, which shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. Internally displaced persons shall be protected in particular against: a) Genocide; b) Murder; c) Summary or arbitrary executions; and d) Enforced disappearances, including abduction or unacknowledgedCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 29318 detention, threatening or resulting in death. Threats and incitement to commit any of the foregoing acts shall be prohibited. 2. Attacks or other acts of violence against internally displaced persons who do not or no longer participate in hostilities are prohibited in all circumstances. Internally displaced persons shall be protected, in particular, against: a) Direct or indiscriminate attacks or other acts of violence, including the creation of areas wherein attacks on civilians are permitted; b) Starvation as a method of combat; c) Their use to shield military objectives from attack or to shield, favour or impede military operations; d) Attacks against their camps or settlements; and e) The use of anti-personnel landmines. Legal Foundations of the Principle The right to life is protected under UDHR 3, African Charter 4 and ICCPR 6(1), which states that \"every human being has the inherent right to life.This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprivedof his life\". Further more, ICCPR 9(1) states that \"everyone has the rightto liberty and security of person\". Some acts which violate the right to life: a. Genocide The act of genocide is an internationally recognized crime. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines \"genocide\" in article II: Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group: (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. The crime of genocide applies to any public official or private individual [Genocide Convention article IV]. b. Summary or arbitrary executions Outside of their normal home regions and communities internally displaced persons may be particularly vulnerable to summary or arbitrary execution.294 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 19Anarbitrary execution is the killing of a person perpetrated by an agent of the State or any other person acting under Government authority or with its complicity, tolerance oracquiescence, and without any judicial process. Executions resulting from a deathsentence issued by a court are also arbitrary executions if the fair trial guaranteesprovided in Articles 14 and 15 of the ICCPR are not respected. Arbitrary executions are often killings under suspicious circumstances with the following characteristics: -death occurred when the person was in the hands of law enforcement officials, public officials, or other persons acting in an official capacity; and -the death was not followed by an official enquiry. The authorities did not carry out an adequate autopsy of the victim or did not take the necessary steps to obtain relevantevidence (medical report, signs of torture, etc). c. Enforced disappearances One of the risks facing internally displaced persons, whether they are adults or children, is enforced involuntary disappearance. Enforced disappearance violates manyfundamental rights including those relating to killings, ill-treatment, personal liberty andthe exercise of one's legal rights. In particular forced disappearance may violate the right to life [6(1) ICCRP, according to the HCR]. The Declaration on the Protection of All Person from Enforced Disappearances , which may be considered to form part of customary international law, considers enforced disappearance to be an offence to human dignity. The preamble describes forced disappearance as a situation in which: Persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their lives by officials of different branches or levels of government or by organized groups or private individuals acting on behalf of, or with thesupport, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, followedby a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons concerned or arefusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, thereby placing suchpersons outside the protection of the law. In the case of missing persons the authorities should establish effective facilities and procedures to investigate thoroughly the disappearance in circumstance which mayinvolve a violation of the right to life. [HRC] Threats and incitement to commit these offenses prohibited The Guiding Principles protect internally displaced persons from threats or incitement to commit genocide, murder, summary or arbitrary executions or enforced disappearances. A \"threat\" to commit the above offences is any action or statement explicit or implicit likely to instill in a person a justified fear of becoming the victims of one of the abovecrimes. The term \"incitement\" refers to actions or words which actively encourage othersto commit offences. Violence against those who do not or who no longer take part in hostilitiesCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 29520Internally displaced persons who never participated in the hostilities or who no longer take part in the hostilities are entitled to protection against acts of violence and must in all times be treated humanely [Protocol II article 4(1)]. Those who no longer take part in the hostilities include: /g37/g3Armed forces who have laid down their arms /g37/g3Those who are hors de combat by sickness, wounds or detention [Common article 3] These minimum standards will apply regardless of whether or not a person who no longer takes part in the hostilities is in detention, or not [Protocol article 4 (1)]. In particular, all internally displaced persons are protected against: a. Direct or indiscriminate attacks or other acts of violence b. Starvation as a method of combat Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for the purpose, objects,indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs,agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works. [Protocol II article 14] c. Being used as a shield for military objective All civilians must be protected against dangers arising from military operations [Protocol II 13(1)]. Use of civilians as a military shield may be regarded as torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment [CAT]. d. Attacks against their camps or settlements Internally displaced persons have the same protection against attacks and other violence inside a camp or settlement as outside. This Principle recognizes that the situation of displacement does not diminish the protection needs of displacedpersons - indeed the nature of relocation make them particularly vulnerable toattacks. e. The use of anti-personnel landmines Land mines pose two significant dangers to civilians both during and after the conclusion of hostilities. A party to the conflict might place land mines in anarea populated by displaced civilians. Second, land mines constitute a continuingthreat to non-combatants if they awe not removed or do not self-destruct but remain active after their military purposes have ceased. Such mines are especially dangerous to internally displaced persons who are in unfamiliar terrain, relocatingto camps, leaving camps for some reason, returning to places of residence ormoving to safe havens.296 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 21On 1 March, 1999, the \"Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction\" entered into force. Issue II: Personal Dignity Internally displaced persons have the right to dignity in the same way as all other people in a territory. Dignity generally means that there is no human being who is more\"human\" than others and therefore dignity requires respect for an individual and equalconcern for the protection of the individual. Human dignity is inherent. Physical actssuch as rape, slavery, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment violate the right to dignity. Personal integrity is the term used to refer to the body and mind of a person. A violation of the right to personal integrity occurs when the State applies torture or cruel, inhumanor degrading treatment, thus causing physical, psychological or moral suffering. Theextent to which the pain and suffering are serious and intentionally inflicted, the greaterthe likelihood that the treatment involves an attack on the integrity of the person. Principle 11 1. Every human being has the right to dignity and physical, mental and moral integrity. 2. Internally displaced persons, whether or not their liberty has been restricted, shall be protected in particular against: (a) Rape, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and other outrages upon personal dignity, such as acts of gender-specific violence, forced prostitution and any form of indecent assault; (b) Slavery or any contemporary form of slavery, such as sale into marriage, sexual exploitation, or forced labour of children; and (c) Acts of violence intended to spread terror among internally displaced persons. Threats and incitement to commit any of the foregoing acts shall be prohibited. Legal Foundations of the Principle This principle is derived from the right to dignity which includes the non- derogable rights to freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman and otherdegrading treatment or punishment - and freedom from slaveryguaranteed in article 8 ICCPR which states that \"no one shall be held inslavery; slavery and the slave-trade in all their forms shall be prohibited\". Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 29722 This principle is also based on provisions of the CRC and CEDAW relating to violence against women and children. Principle 11(1) restates article 10(1) ICCPR which ensures \"All persons who are deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person\". Therefore, the principle applies to all internally displaced peopleregardless of whether they are in detention camps, prisons or hospitals [HRC]. 11 (2) The right to dignity includes protection from: Regardless of whether the liberty of an internally displaced person has been restricted, an internally displaced persons is particularly protected against the following violations: \"Rape, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and other outrages upon personal dignity\" \"Gender-specific violence\" Gender specific violence includes any act of violence that results in or is likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering on account of one'sgender, including threats of such acts. The term will cover violence perpetrated by the State, family members or others in the community. Prevalent forms of genderviolence include rape and other sexual attacks, general physical attacks, domesticviolence, exploitation of prostitution and sexual harassment. Gender-specific violence affects women disproportionately - physically and mentally- and may constitutetorture. States have an obligation to protect women from gender violence perpetratedby State agents and private individuals. States should eliminate all forms of violence against women by taking special protection measures, including legislation. Women should be particularly protectedagainst discrimination, trafficking in women and exploitation of prostitution. [2-6CEDAW]. In times of non international armed conflict parties are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sex [ICCPR article 4, Common article 3, Protocol II article 2(1) -outrages on personal dignity, humiliating and degrading treatment includes genderspecific violence]. Women who are internally displaced are also protected againstrape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault [Protocol II article 4(2)] SlaveryFreedom from slavery is a non-derogable right, which applies to internally displaced persons at all times. The UDHR at article 4 states that \"No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms\". Thesame right appears in the ICCPR article 8 which states that \"no one shall be held inslavery; slavery and the slave-trade in all their forms shall be prohibited\", and \"no one shall be held in servitude\" [Protocol II article 4 (2) (f)].298 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 23Sale of women equal slavery The sale of women into marriage or forced marriage violates the right to be free from slavery and slavery like practices. The right to freely enter or consent to marriage isrecognized in several human rights documents. 16(1)(b).] \"Forced labour of children\" Freedom from forced or compulsory labour is guaranteed in the ICCPR. In relation to children the CRC prohibits child labour (article 32) which recognizes the right ofchildren to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any workthat is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. Itfurther places an obligation on States to take legislative measure to implement thatarticle. \"Acts of violence intended to spread terror\" In situations of non-international armed conflict the civilian population, including internally displaced persons, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats ofviolence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilianpopulation is expressly prohibited [Protocol II 13(2)]. Issue III: Forced recruitment Among the many dangers facing internally displaced persons - both adults and children -is forcible and involuntary recruitment into the country's armed forces or into those ofdissident groups. Such recruitment may also manifest itself in government coercion toform civil defense patrols. Displaced persons are of course not exempt from compulsory military service, but IDPs are protected from discriminatory recruitment into armed forces or groups. Principle 13 1. In no circumstances shall displaced children be recruited nor be required or permitted to take part in hostilities. 2. Internally displaced persons shall be protected against discriminatory practices of recruitment into any armed forces or groups as a result of their displacement. In particular any cruel, inhuman or degrading practices that compel compliance or punish non-compliance with recruitment are prohibited in all circumstances. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 29924Legal Foundations of the Principle This Principle is derived from article 38(3) of the CRC, which calls upon States to refrain from recruitment of children under 15 and for thosebetween 15 - 18 to select the oldest. Since the Guiding Principles were drafted, an Optional Protocol to the CRC has been adopted, which calls on State Parties to \"raise the minimum age in years\" for voluntary recruitment (previously set at 15) and to set the minimum age for direct participation in combat at 18. The non-discrimination articles discussed previously are also relevant to the situation for recruitment of adults. Recruitment of children Given the particular vulnerability of internally displaced persons Principle 13 restates the international protection afforded to all children - the right not to be recruited into thearmed forces under the age of 15. The CRC requires States to take measures to ensurethis right is protected. Under humanitarian law both States and dissident groups are prohibited from conscripting children under 15 years old in situations of armed conflict. 5 Recruitment of adults Military service is permitted by States. However the practice must not be carried out in a fashion that: 1. discriminates against internally displaced persons. [implied from ICCPR 26] 2. amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in order to compel compliance or punish non-compliance. Forced military service on conscientious objectors is considered forced or compulsory labour under the ICCPR. 5 [Protocol II 4 (3)(c )]300 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 25Theme 4: Special Needs Internally displaced persons, on account of being displaced, have particular needs. This is not to say that internally displaced persons should be treated in a different way to anyother vulnerable group, like women, children, indigenous people or the disabled. Likeother groups, internally displaced persons have special needs which the GuidingPrinciples highlight. Key Issues Subsistence needs Health related needs Need for identification and documentation Property Issue I: Subsistence needs Whether resettled in temporary camps or still in transit, internally displaced persons inmany cases are deprived of, and/or denied safe access to, one or more of the followingkey elements essential for a minimum standard of living: food, water, housing, clothing,health and sanitation. Such ingredients are necessary for an adequate standard of living. In a situation of non-international armed conflict Common article 3 requires \"human treatment\", which includes access to subsistence means necessary for survival. Principle 18 1. All internally displaced persons have the right to an adequate standard of living. 2. At the minimum, regardless of the circumstances, and without discrimination, competent authorities shall provide internally displaced persons with and ensure safe access to: a) Essential food and potable water; (b) Basic shelter and housing; (c) Appropriate clothing; and (d) Essential medical services and sanitation. 3. Special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation of women in the planning and distribution of these basic supplies. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 30126Legal Foundations of the Principle This principle is derived form the right to an adequate standard of living. UDHR states that everyone has the right to a standard of living that isadequate for health and well-being of himself and of his family, includingfood clothing housing, medical care and necessary social services. There is also a right to security in the event of unemployment sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstance beyond his control. Similar provisions are included in CESCR, CERD, and CEDAW. a. Essential food and potable water The right to food is a non derogable under the right to life. States have an obligation to ensure access to adequate food and water by using all the resources at its disposal, in aneffort to satisfy its minimum obligation to prevent hunger. States with limited resources are required to make maximum efforts to use all resources at its disposal to satisfy these essential needs [Committee CSCR]. Such resources willinclude not only those within the State but will include those available from theinternational community. Starvation of civilian populations as a method of combat is prohibited. This includes prohibition of attacks, destruction, removal or rendering useless of objects which areindispensable to the survival of the civilian population such as food stuffs, agriculturalareas for the production of foodstuff, crops, livestock, drinking water installations andsupplies and irrigation works. Deprivation of food is a crime under the Genocide Convention. b. Basic shelter and housing The Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights clearly guarantee the basic right to housing. Furthermore, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its General Comment No.4, discusses various aspects to be considered when fulfilling this right.While adequacy of housing is determined by many factors, the Committee recommendsStates to consider the following: legal security of tenure; availability services,materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; health threats; accessibility; locationand cultural adequacy. c. Appropriate clothing d. Essential medical services and sanitation (See Guiding Principle 19)302 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 27Issue II: Health related needs One of the serious consequences of internal displacement is exhaustion and illness. Those among displaced populations who are most in need of urgent or regular medicalcare are frequently denied such assistance. Internally displaced persons may face anumber of medical problems not only during the process of displacement where healthcare is hardly available but also in camps where access to health services may be limited.During hostilities, it is not unusual for internally displaced persons to become sick orwounded when caught in cross fire or subjected to indiscriminate weapons. Principle 19 1. All wounded and sick internally displaced persons as well as those with disabilities shall receive to the fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention they require, without distinction on any grounds other than medical ones. When necessary, internally displaced persons shall have access to psychological and social services. 2. Special attention should be paid to the health needs of women, including access to female health care providers and services, such as reproductive health care, as well as appropriate counseling for victims of sexual and other abuses. 3. Special attention should also be given to the prevention of contagious and infectious diseases, including AIDS, among internally displaced persons. Legal Foundations of the Principle The right to medical care and necessary social services is enshrined in the UDHR as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. The ICESCR also recognizes the realization of \"the right of everyone to the enjoymentof the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health\" Special needs groups /g37/g3Wounded and sick internally displaced Common article 3 calls for the humane treatment of those persons who do not take part in the hostilities and obliges the parties to care for the wounded and sick without distinction. In situations of armed conflict Additional Protocol II requires that whenever circumstances permit and particularly after an engagement all possible measures shall betaken without delay to search for and collect the wounded, sick and ship wrecked and toprotect them against pillage, ill-treatment and to ensure adequate care. /g37/g3DisabilitiesCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 30328Persons with disabilities may require special services and other kinds of assistance on a continuous basis. The UDHR provides that everyone has the right to security in the event of... sickness, disability... or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond hiscontrol\". Disabled children should not be discriminated against on the basis of his or her disability. A disabled child must receive education, training, health care, and rehabilitation toachieve the fullest possible social integration. /g37/g3Women Special attention to the health needs of women is highlighted in the CEDAW whereby it is stated that for equality, states must ensure to women appropriate service in connectionwith pregnancy, confinement and postnatal period. /g37/g3Contagious and infectious diseases Realization of the right to an adequate standard of living includes prevention, treatment and control of epidemics, occupational or other diseases. Issue III: The need for identification and documentation Internal displacement often results in the loss of personal papers and documentation. Italso makes proper registration of events such as births and deaths extremely difficult, ifnot impossible. Although registration in camps and relocation sites is often required forpurposes of documentation and to facilitate family reunification, many internallydisplaced persons are averse to being identified as internally displaced because suchlabels may have a discriminatory effect or jeopardize their safety. As a consequence,displaced persons often lack the legal protection and privileges extended to those whohold identifying documents. Principle 20 1. Every human being has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. 2. To give effect to this right for internally displaced persons, the authorities concerned shall issue to them all documents necessary for the enjoyment and exercise of their legal rights, such as passports, personal identification documents, birth certificates and marriage certificates. In particular, the authorities shall facilitate the issuance of new documents or the replacement of documents lost in the course of displacement, without imposing unreasonable conditions, such as requiring the return to one's area of habitual residence in order to obtain these or other required documents. 304 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 293. Women and men shall have equal rights to obtain such necessary documents and shall have the right to have such documentation issued in their own names. This Principle is derived from the fundamental right to legal personality which is enshrined in the UDHR: \"everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a personbefore the law\", as well as ICCPR article 16 Child Rights Children have the right to preserve their identity, including nationality and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful interference. The State has a duty toensure that an undocumented child can speedily re-establish his/her identity. Issue IV: Property Internally displaced persons regularly lose much of their property when displaced.Owing to their vulnerability, IDPs need protection for the property left to them oracquired during displacement. This will be considered in module 4. The destruction ortheft of crops and livestock, the bombing or burning of shelters and confiscation orforcible occupation of private homes by military or paramilitary forces are among theexperiences faced by internally displaced person. This section will consider the right toproperty during displacement. Issues surrounding compensation for property are found in domestic law and in Guiding Principle 29 (2). Principle 21 1. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of property and possessions. 2. The property and possessions of internally displaced persons shall in all circumstances be protected, in particular, against the following acts: (a) Pillage; (b) Direct or indiscriminate attacks or other acts of violence; (c) Being used to shield military operations or objectives; (d) Being made the object of reprisal; and (e) Being destroyed or appropriated as a form of collective punishment. 3. Property and possessions left behind by internally displaced persons should be protected against destruction and arbitrary and illegal appropriation, occupation or use. The right to own property is stated in the UDHR, which also prohibits arbitrarydeprivation of property, and in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.However, domestic law often provides better protection of property for internallydisplaced persons.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 30530Domestic laws normally provide for legal protection of property and protection against interference. It will restore property to its rightful owners in case of dispute. Everyone, including internally displaced persons, have the right to own property alone or in association with others. Property must not be subject to arbitrary deprivation whichmeans that a person can not have his or her land taken away with disregard for the law. However, the right to own property can be limited. It is subject to: /g37/g3Certain interests of society provided by law; /g37/g3Just requirement of morality, public order and general welfare in a democratic society [UDHR 29(2). Yet ownership of property can not be interfered with on the basis of discrimination [CERD 5(d)(v)] nor denied to women on the basis of their gender [CEDAW 16(1)(h)]. 306 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 31Annexes List of Abbreviations International instruments CAT Convention Against Torture CEDAW Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women CERD International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Common article 3 Common article to all Geneva Conventions - including Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War CRC Convention on the Rights of the ChildICCPR International Covenant on Civil and Political RightsICESCR International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural RightsProtocol II Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-InternationalArmed Conflicts (Protocol II) UDHR Universal Declaration of Human RightsCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 30732308 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Module Four: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration .

To start it is helpful to define terms. There are two basic solutions - Return or Resettlement. Reintegration or integration is the process that makes either choice sustainable. In this module, return is used to define the process of going back to one's original place of residence. Obviously return is the ideal durable solution but as noted by some observers is probably the most difficult solution to achieve. Too often after a conflict the clock simply cannot be turned back. Resettlement (different from refugee resettlement) is used to define the process of starting a new life in another part of the country. Resettlement is the option of a fresh start. Depending on the circumstances of displacement and root causes of conflict, a fresh start somewhere else maybe the only reasonable option for some internally displaced. Reintegration is used to describe the reentry of formerly internally displaced people into the social, economic, cultural and political fabric of their original community. According to UNHCR in order to be successful, reintegration, as it refers to returning refugees, requires access to reasonable resources, opportunities and basic services to establish a self-sustained livelihood in conditions of equal rights with other residents and citizens.1 To facilitate examination of this section it useful to see the principles according to severalthemes: /g37Voluntary return in conditions of safety and dignity /g37Participation and management of return/resettlement by the internally displaced themselves /g37Non-Discrimination /g37Recovery of property or compensation /g37Access by humanitarian organizations The first two themes impact on the process of return or resettlement while the second two themes impact on the durability of return or resettlement and help define successful reintegration or integration. The last theme defines the operational needs of international organizations in assisting return or resettlement operations and in some cases providingindependent verification of the conditions of return. 1 Drawn from concept of returnee reintegration in the Office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook Voluntary Repatriation: International Protection, 1996 Geneva ,section 6.4 4312 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Theme I - Voluntary Return in Conditions of Safety and Dignity Principle 28 (1) Competent authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow internally displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country. Such authorities shall endeavour to facilitate the reintegration of returned or resettled internally displaced persons. Legal Foundations of the Principle2 Concepts of voluntariness, return in safety and dignity drawn from refugee protection regime although not specifically stated in 1951 Convention. Voluntariness follows from principle of non-refoulement, (article 33) obviously in that involuntary return would be \"refoulement.\" 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa is the only international refugee instrument to date formally elaborating the principle of voluntaryrepatriation, although voluntary repatriation is mentioned in the UNHCR statute. Ie OAU Article V on voluntary repatriation UNHCR statute - Voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country or voluntarily reestablished himself in the country Definitions - some ideas from the refugee protection concept3 Voluntary The decision to return should be a voluntary one. This requirement is more than amatter of principle, a return which is voluntary is more likely to be lasting and sustainable. UNHCR defines a \"voluntary decision\" as implying two elements: freedom of choice and an informed decision. Safety Return in safety is one that takes place under conditions of /g37Legal safety: such as amnesties, public assurances of personal safety, integrity, freedom from fear of persecution or arbitrary punishment on return, citizenship status /g37Physical security: including protection from armed attacks and mines 2 Discussion of the legal foundations of the Guiding Principles are drawn from the Compilation and Analysis of legal norms, Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights 1996, E/CN.4/1996/ Add.2 3 Most of the discussion in this section is based on the Office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook Voluntary Repatriation: International Protection, 1996 Geneva. 5Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 3136/g37Material security: access to land and property, means of a livelihood and for children an education as well Dignity The concept of dignity is less self-evident than safety. The dictionary definition of dignity contains elements of \"serious, composed, worthy of honour and respect.\" According to UNHCR, in practice dignity means that: returning refugees are notmanhandled, that they can return unconditionally and if they are doing so spontaneously they can do so at their own pace, that they are not arbitrarily separated from family members; and that they are treated with respect by the authorities and full acceptance by the national authorities, including the full restoration of their rights. Obviously a similar definition of dignity can be applied to returning internallydisplaced. Theme II - Joint participation in planning and management of return The concepts and elements of 'voluntariness' and 'dignity' imply the participation of the internally displaced in the planning and management of their return or reintegration. Principle 28(2) Special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation of internally displaced persons in the planning and management of their return or resettlement and reintegration. Legal Foundations of the Principle While there are no legal foundations the principle it is in conformity with international law. Generally though it is more connected to programming principles of equal participation of internally displaced indecisions that affect their lives, a theme reflected throughout the Guiding Principles. Implications are that if the internally displaced play a greater role in managing their return or resettlement it will be more successful as well as more sustainable.Presenter's Notes: Within the principle highlight: -the role of government authorities as having the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions and provide the means.. . - Such authorities shall endeavor to facilitate reintegration or integration which leaves and reflects open nature of reintegration process and wider role of local community 6314 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 7Theme III - Non discrimination and Equality of Participation and Access Essential to the fulfillment of the needs of the internally displaced is the need to be free from discrimination. The concepts of equality before the law, equal protection of the law and non- discrimination form a cornerstone of international human rights law. Racial, ethnic, religious, gender-specific or political discrimination occurs, in one way or another, in every society however internally displaced persons, often living in strange surroundings, deprived of their security, property and social status, are particularly exposed and vulnerable to discriminatory treatment. Returning internally displaced persons can, for example, be treated as \"enemies\" or with a high level of suspicion and hostility. Principle 29(1) Internally displaced persons who have returned to their homes or places of habitual residence or who have resettled in another part of the country shall not be discriminated against as a result of their having been displaced. They shall have the right to participate fully and equally in public affairs at all levels and have equal access to public services. Legal Background and Foundation An explicit prohibition of discrimination against internally displaced persons because of their being displaced does not exist in human rights law. However, many international and regional human rights treatieshave clauses requiring States parties to respect and ensure the rights and freedoms recognized by those conventions are without discrimination. Specific grounds upon which discrimination is prohibited in many treaties include race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or \"other status\". Article 2 of the Universal Declaration for example states: \"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion,political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status... \". \"Other status\" becomes important because displacement may be considered \"other status\" International humanitarian law provides, for example, the principle for humane treatment without adverse distinction in situations of non-international armed conflict. Article 3 (1) common to the four Geneva Conventions reads: 7Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 3158\"Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.\" Definitions Although not many of the treaties define \"discrimination\", the term is commonly understood to imply: anydistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on any specified grounds, and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing, of all rights and freedoms. Not every distinction, however, constitutes discrimination but only those that are not based on reasonable and objective criteria.4 Areas where non discrimination most important /g37\"All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. \" (art. 26 of the ICCPR) /g37Access to public services such as education, health services /g37Access to public affairs /g37Freedom of access and non-discrimination of vulnerable groups such as women within internally displaced communities. /g37Returning IDPs not considered or treated as \"enemies.\" Theme IV - Recovery of Property or Compensation Internally displaced persons regularly loose much of their property when displaced. The destruction or theft of crops and livestock, the bombing or burning of buildings and confiscation or forcible occupation of private homes by military or paramilitary forces areamong the experiences faced by internally displaced persons, especially in situations of armed conflict. Because of their vulnerability, internally displaced also need protection for the property left to them or acquired during displacement. When internally displaced persons return to their homes they may find their properties occupied by other people. This is frequently an obstacle to return, and it raises questions 4 Compilation and Analysis of legal norms, Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights 1996, E/ CN.4/1996/ Add.2 8316 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 9concerning the right to restitution for the property or compensation for its loss. There is a certain trend in general human rights instruments, along with the progressive development of international law, to allow for restitution or compensation. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has, for example, recommended payment of just compensation to returning internally displaced persons for loss of their property including homes, crops, livestock and other belongings.5 Principle 29 (2) Competent authorities have the duty and responsibility to assist returned and/or resettled internally displaced persons to recover, to the extent possible, their property and possessions which they left behind or were dispossessed of upon their displacement. When recovery of such property and possessions is not possible, competent authorities shall provide or assist these persons in obtaining appropriate compensation or another form of just reparation. Legal Background and Foundation In human rights law the Universal Declaration (Article 17) grantseveryone the right to own property alone or in association with others. Paragraph 2 of that article prohibits arbitrary deprivation of suchproperty. Interestingly no comparable right is found in either the ICCPR or the ICESCR. The right to own and enjoy property is also supported and mentioned in other conventions such as International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination,International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the ILO Conventions and regional treaties such as Organization of American States' American Declaration, the European Convention and the African Charter. In the instruments mentioned, the individual's right to own, possess and/or use private property is not absolute and may be subject to certain interests of society as provided by law and/or under such limitations as \"the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.\" (Universal Declaration, Art. 29) The existence of an internal armed conflict can constitute a public emergency and can satisfy the requirements for derogation which can temporarily suspend the right to own, use and enjoy property. Humanitarian law does not directly address property rights but does prohibit, for example, pillage and reprisals. There is a general prohibition against the destruction or seizure ofproperty unless required by military necessity. 5 Compilation and Analysis of legal norms, Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights 1996, E/CN.4/1996/Add.2 9Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 31710Implementation The issue of property in the Guiding Principles is multidimensional in that it is focused not only on the protection of property occupied before displacement but also property acquired during displacement. /g37The return of personal property is of crucial importance for a dignified return. /g37In the process of return, property acquired must also be transported to areas of origin. (mention RSG comments on Mozambique ) /g37Access to land , (in most cases talking about rural populations) especially agricultural land is crucial for sustainability both in short term, medium and long term otherwise returning internally displaced become dependent on assistance. /g37Property conflict often becomes the source of continuing conflict so local conflict resolution techniques can be important ( Gacaca in Rwanda, Dayton peace Accord specifically mentions property and has a commission to decide on ownership). Presenter's Notes Within the principle highlight: -Competent authorities - not just state authorities therefore includes non-state actors - the duty and responsibility - legal and moral obligation -to the extent possible - realistic qualifier -left behind or were dispossessed of - items that they were forced to leave behind or which were confiscated. -shall provide or assist...in obtaining appropriate compensation or another form of just reparation. Mention: -Right to Property or sanctity of property mentioned in principles relating to protection from displacement (Principle six) -Right to property often most protected by domestic law 10318 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Theme V - Access by Humanitarian Organizations In order to deliver humanitarian assistance, relief workers and their organizations must be able to travel to, and have access to, the internally displaced. They may also need to establish communications with the displaced. Principle 30 All authorities concerned shall grant and facilitate for international humanitarian organizations and other appropriate actors, in the exercise of their respective mandates, rapid and unimpeded access to internally displaced persons to assist in their return or resettlement and reintegration. Legal Background and Foundations Conventional human rights law does not provide explicitly for access by relief workers to the victims of internal displacement who are in need of humanitarian assistance although various General Assembly and Security Council resolutions expressly address this aspect ofhumanitarian assistance. For example General Assembly resolution 46/182 reconfirms the pivotal role of access by calling upon all States whose populations are in need of assistance \"to facilitate the work of ... [intergovernmental and which work impartially andwith strictly humanitarian motives,\" in implementing humanitarian assistance, in particular the supply of food, medicines, shelter and health care, for which access to victims is essential\" (para. 6). According to humanitarian law the International Committee of the Red Cross has a right to offer its services, as do other humanitarian organizations. Consent to such access, which is indispensable to the provision of relief, must be presumed from the acceptance of the organization's offer of humanitarian services. Negotiating Access /g37Access reflected in several principles /g37important from an assistance point of view to ensure that internally displaced persons have access to assistance (General Principle 3 - right to receive and request assistance ) /g37Also Principle 25(3) granting free passage and access for humanitarian assistance (protects the delivery of assistance) /g37In return or resettlement situations access is important to ensure that assistance given is reaching and meeting the target beneficiaries' needs /g37From a protection point of view access is necessary to ensure return is according to conditions of safety and dignity. 11Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 31912/g37Reference to other appropriate actors is to facilitate monitoring of return by not only humanitarian organizations but also for example human rights organizations. ( ie UNHCHR). /g37Although based on access monitoring is in itself an important but large issue to be discussed and negotiated separately with the host government. From an operational point of view, monitoring can be a comprehensive program by a wide variety of organizations to observe whether return is occurring within conditions of safety and dignity or it can be a \"passive\" program whereby everyday observations are passed on by field workers to government authorities, institutions or organizations that can act upon the information. Conclusion: Return, resettlement, and reintegration revisited Like other sections of the Guiding Principles, one should not only look at the principles in isolation - to do would miss the fact that they all form part of the larger mosaic in this case of describing the essential components of durable, sustainable solutions. Return & Resettlement To review some of the main points: According to the Guiding Principles, Government authorities have the primary responsibility to establish conditions of return or resettlement by ensuring among other things an acceptable level of security, an environment and institutions that reflect and protect the rule of law andthe possibility or a self-sustained livelihood. The concepts of \"voluntariness\" and \"participatory approach\" are important in shaping the return and resettlement process and are crucial elements of lasting and sustainable return or resettlement. Place of habitual residence, for example may be interpreted broadly as long as itis a voluntary interpretation by the displaced themselves. Implementation of such an interpretation requires equal participation and management by the internally displaced in the process. The same is true in defining acceptable security standards for either return or resettlement. Reintegration &/or Integration Reference to non-discrimination and property is reflective of a needs based approach in the Guiding Principles. Non discrimination forms the cornerstone of reintegration or integration by attempting to ensure equal rights with other residents and citizens. Non discrimination is also the foundation for any efforts of reconciliation and conflict resolution. Reference to property is necessary because it is possibly the single largest resource returning internally displaced will have to ensure a self-sustained livelihood and is also, in situations of population growth and competition over scare resources, likely to be the largest cause of conflict. 12320 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 13Some Ideas to Consider /g37Assist representatives of displaced communities to assess conditions in potential areas of return or resettlement, by supporting visits to independently assess conditions; /g37convene consultations with: /g131populations residing in areas of return or resettlement to determine attitudes toward returnees; /g131leaders of displaced groups prior to return, ensuring representation of women and all important segments of the displaced community; /g131leaders of displaced communities, local authorities, and international organizations that will be involved with return; /g37prepare for landmine removal or awareness campaigns, where landmines are an issue; /g37assess legal statutes or other relevant documents to identify problems to recovery of property paying particular attention to the need to female heads of households; /g37design programs to rebuild community infrastructure in areas of return/resettlement; /g37design mechanisms to monitor human rights conditions in areas of return/resettlement; /g37design programs for women-headed households and other special needs groups in areas of return/resettlement; /g37consider the needs of resident, as well as returnee, populations in program design, to prevent stigmatization or resentment. 13Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 32114Part III: Items for Discussion - Key Themes/Concepts Focusing on the situation within your country or region identify and discuss possible durable solutions for the internally displaced.

It takes as its starting point that internally displaced persons are not passive \"recipients\" of assistance and protection, but can and should be key actors in identifying and addressing their own needs. Accordingly, programs responding to situations of internal displacement need to take into account theperspectives and capacities of internally displaced communities and design programs in a way that draws as well as builds upon these capacities. The importance of doing so will be shown to be a cross-cutting theme throughout the Guiding Principles, and all of the phases and aspects of internal displacement that they cover. To begin, the benefits of integrating a community-based perspective into program response in general will be highlighted. Specifically, doing so can help to ensure that program responses that are appropriate, effective and sustainable and thus less expensive, in the short and long-term. The meaning of applying a community-based perspective to program response to situations of internal displacement then is examined, with reference to the Guiding Principles, according to five main themes:T /g137Preserving family and community links /g137Supporting strategies of self-help /g137Empowering IDPs in the decision-making /g137Promoting self-reliance 4Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 3275Theme 1: Preserving Family and Community Links Community structures represent the most fundamental source of protection for internally displaced persons. \"Practical protection is provided first of all by and through the local community, through a complex social network including family, clan, village or tribe.\" (UNHCR) However, the experience of displacement is severely disruptive on community and familystructures: it disperses communities and often separates families. This weakening or severing of community and family links increases the vulnerability of the internally displaced. Activities that promote the maintenance or restoration of community links, including with thelocal communities in areas of refuge and return or resettlement, therefore is an important means of enhancing their security. Efforts to reunify families, create support structures for unaccompanied children and enable displaced persons to remain with or rejoin members of their clan, tribe or village should receive high priority. Preserving family links: Principle 17 1. Every human being has the right to respect of his or her family life. 2. To give effect to this right for internally displaced persons, family members who wish to remain together shall be allowed to do so. 3. Families which are separated by displacement should be reunited as quickly as possible. All appropriate steps shall be taken to expedite the reunion of such families, particularly when children are involved. The responsible authorities shall facilitate inquiries made by family members and encourage and cooperate with the work of humanitarian organizations engaged in the task of family reunification. 4.Members of internally displaced families whose personal liberty has been restricted by internment or confinement in camps shall have the right to remain together. Principle 16 (1) and (2) 1.All internally displaced persons have the right to know the fate and whereabouts of missing relatives. 5328 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 62.The authorities concerned shall endeavor to establish the fate and whereabouts of internally displaced persons reported missing, and cooperate with relevant international organizations engaged in this task. They shall inform the next of kin on the progress of the investigation and notify them of any result. Preserving community links: Regarding the preservation of community links, there are two facets to consider: 1. Preservation of community identity among groups of internally displaced persons 2. Participation of internally displaced persons in community affairs On the preservation of community identity, respect for the linguistic heritage, religion or beliefs and cultural identity of internally displaced populations is important. Principle 22 Internally displaced persons, whether or not they are living in camps, shall not be discriminated against as a result of their displacement in the enjoyment of the following rights: (a)The rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, opinion and expression; ... (e)The right to communicate in a language they understand. Principle 23(2) ... the authorities concerned shall ensure that ... in particular displaced children, receive education .... Education should respect their cultural identity, language and religion. The right of internally displaced persons in community affairs also is affirmed in the Guiding Principles: Principle 22 Internally displaced persons, whether or not they are living in camps, shall not be discriminated against as a result of their displacement in the enjoyment of the following rights: .... 5Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 3297(c)The right to associate freely and participate equally in community affairs; (d)The right to vote and to participate in governmental and public affairs , including the right to have access to the means necessary to exercise this right; ... Theme 2: Supporting strategies of self-help Equally important as enabling internally displaced persons to retain or recreate their previous family and community links is to recognize that the shared experience of displacement cancreate a sense of community among displaced persons who previously did not share family or community links. This new sense of community is manifest in efforts by internally displaced populations organize themselves to collectively undertake efforts to address their needs. Communitystructures often develop among the displaced to address their basic needs for protection, health care, psycho-social support and education, for example. In the return phase, displaced communities may send representatives to undertake preliminary assessment visits to areas of potential return or resettlement. Conflict resolution and reconciliation initiatives undertaken within displaced populations as well as with local communities in areas of return or resettlement can contribute to the securityof the internally displaced and facilitate their reintegration into these communities. Indeed, reinforcing community structures is a particularly important element of post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation efforts. The authorities and the international community can encourage the formation of self-help initiatives among the displaced as well as support and collaborate with those already in existence. Theme 3: Empowering the displaced in the protection of their rights Principle 3(2) Internally displaced persons have the right to request and to receive protection and humanitarian assistance from these [national] authorities. They shall not be persecuted or punished for making such a request . In a number of situations, internally displaced persons have formally organized themselves into groups for the purpose of collectively advocating for the protection of their rights. 6330 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 8To be sure, the relationship between the displaced and the authorities will influence the scope that the internally displaced have for undertaking such efforts. The authorities should be expected to ensure that organizations of the internally displaced can operate in an environment conducive to advocacy efforts. Theme 4: Involving the displaced in decision-making Internally displaced persons should, as a matter of course, be involved in the decisions that affect their lives. They know better than anyone else does what their needs are, and may have cultural preferences as to how these should be addressed. Taking into account the views and perspectives of the displaced in the design of programs for responding to their needs can helpto ensure the appropriateness and effectiveness of such programs. This is true in all phases of displacement, from prior to displacement to the return or resettlement and reintegration phase. Principle 7(3) If displacement occurs in situations other than during the emergency stages of armed conflicts and disasters, the following guarantees shall be complied with: ... (c) The free and informed consent of those to be displaced shall be sought; (d) The authorities concerned shall endeavor to involve those affected...in the planning and management of their relocation ; Principle 28(2) Special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation of internally displaced persons in the planning and management of their return or resettlement and reintegration . In considering the views of the displaced, it is essential to solicit the views of all segments of the population. Too often, the importance of consulting women is overlooked and their capacities ignored, notwithstanding the fact that women and children typically constitute the overwhelming majority of an internally displaced population. Principle 7(3) If displacement occurs in situations other than during the emergency stages of armed conflicts and disasters... .... (d) The authorities concerned shall endeavor to involve those affected, particularly women, in the planning and management of their relocation; 7Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 3319Principle 18(3) Special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation of women in the planning and distribution of ... basic supplies . Theme 5: Promoting self-reliance Especially with a view to the longer term, designing programs in a way that draws and build upon the resources and capacities of the displaced is essential. So long as the displaced lack the means to be self-reliant, they will remain dependent upon relief assistance, and long after the emergency phase. To be sure, the experience of displacement often poses particular challenges to efforts for promoting self-reliance. Displacement separates people from their means of livelihood, including their means of employment, markets and their land and livestock. Similar opportunities often do not exist in the areas to which they are displaced. The conditions in which the displaced live also can limit such opportunities. Closed camps with strict control over movement and activity, for example, will severely limit the options for self-sufficiency and income-generation compared with open camps that allow the displaced regular access to cultivable land, employment opportunities and markets. Principle 22 Internally displaced persons, whether or not they are living in camps, shall not be discriminated against as a result of their displacement in the enjoyment of the following rights: ... (b)The right to seek freely opportunities for employment and to participate in economic activities ; In protracted situations of displacement, the loss of skills becomes a serious risk. Where the opportunities for income-generation are different than the activities in which the internally displaced engaged in their areas of origin, the development of new skills may be required. Principle 23(4) Education and training facilities shall be made available to internally displaced persons, in particular adolescents and women , whether or not living in camps, as soon as conditions permit . 8332 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons 10The above Principle places special emphasis on the right of women to have access to education and training facilities. Attention to the type of skills training to which women have access also is important. Traditionally, skills training programs have relegated women to activities such as sewing and embroidery, which generate little income. In fact, displacedwomen often have proven adept in such non-traditional activities as quarry work, reforestation and reconstruction projects. Special efforts, such as gender clauses, may need to be taken to ensure that women have equal access to participate in skills-training and income-generating activities. Similarly, displaced women often demonstrate considerable resourcefulness and entrepreneurial initiative. To support these efforts, women require equal access to credit opportunities. Typically, the amount of credit required is minimal. Micro-credit programs for women therefore can be particularly important for promoting self-reliance. Assistance and development programs for internally displaced populations also can and should, to the extent possible, employ the internally displaced in programs undertaken on their behalf. \"Food for work\" programs in areas as diverse as education, health care, psycho-social support and shelter construction can reduce the sense of dependency and frustration among the displaced, promote skills retention or development and have the added benefit of beingmore cost-efficient. Conclusion While there is increasing recognition of the importance of viewing internally displacedpopulations as \"resources\" rather than mere \"recipients\", too often such a perspective actually is not applied, or at least not in a serious and systematic manner. However, adopting such a perspective from the outset - in the design of programs -- provides a number of important pieces of information that will help to ensure the appropriate and contribute to the effectiveness of responses to their plight: To be sure, there is no blueprint for the program response to emerge from such an analysis. Its exact nature will depend upon a number of situational factors, including the profile,/g137Insight into their priority needs and concerns, as well as socio-culturalsensitivities /g137Indication of their capacities /g137Identification of the constraints (political, legal, social, economic etc.)limiting the full use of these capacities as well as of possible ways of minimizing these 9Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 33311perspectives and capacities of the displaced, their particular needs, their level of organization and their relationship with the authorities.

Show Slide 1.1 Outline of the Training 1 This training course was developed under the coordi nation of the UN Intera gency Standing Committee Working Group (IASC-WG), with the participation of many agencies within and outside the UN system. 2 This work was led by the Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons, Francis M. Deng. 340 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-4 Facilitator Guide Introduction to the Training (Continued) Present the following information about the training. /g183/g32The training course you are undertaking, the Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff , organizes the training material in six modules: 1. Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement provides basic information on the internally displaced, their circumstances, critical policy issues, the international institutional framework for addressing internal displacement, and the \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\" (the \"Guiding Principles\"). /g216/g32After you complete this module, you will have a basic understanding of the internal displacement issue. 2. Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Humanitarian Principles describes the legal and other foundations for programmatic action by international agency staff on behalf of internally displaced persons. /g216/g32After you complete this module, you will understand how human rights law, humanitarian law and principles, and other international standards apply to the internally displaced and provide the foundation for your work with internally displaced persons. 3. Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons describes how UN agencies, international organizations, NGOs and other institutions can and must coordinate to support displaced communities. /g216/g32After you complete this module, you will understand the current international coordination mechanisms for managing programming on behalf of the internally displaced, how the current system evolved, and options for providing protection and assistance at the country level.

Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement discusses how international organizations can, when possible and appropriate (in the eyes of the displaced themselves), work to prevent displacement or, when necessary, coordinate to prepare for internal displacement. /g216/g32After you complete this module, you will understand critical steps to prepare for impending displacement and methods that can be taken by the international community to head off unwarranted internal displacement. 5. Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement covers the appropriate role of international organizations when displacement has taken place and displaced populations are at risk. /g216/g32After you complete this module, you will understand the critical importance of both assistance and protection activities, and techniques for accessing and assisting displaced communities. 6. Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration of Internally Displaced Populations , describes factors affecting the return of the displaced to their home areas or resettlement in a new permanent setting. /g216/g32After you complete this module, you will understand appropriate roles for international agencies in assisting prior to and during return/resettlement, and the importance of ongoing reintegration activities. /g183/g32As is clear from the structure of this training course, the first three modules are intended to provide a basic level of knowledge in the nature of internal displacement, the standards that underpin international programs, and mechanisms for institutional coordination.342 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-6 Facilitator Guide Introduction to the Training (Continued) /g183/g32The second set of modules -- which closely parallel the organizational structure of the \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\" -- are intended to suggest program priorities before, during, and after displacement. /g183/g32Since internal displacement is a diverse phenomenon and an evolving area of knowledge, the information presented in these modules is often suggestive, rather than definitive. /g183/g32You and other experienced international staff, carefully analyzing circumstances in the country context -- and working, of course, with the internally displaced themselves and relevant national authorities -- are the best designers of appropriate programming in your situation. /g183/g32What this course provides is important background material, relevant experience from other contexts, and information on evolving practice to assist your efforts on behalf of internally displaced persons, families and communities. /g183/g32At the end of this training, we will work together to synthesize the information we have learned by conducting a \"Capstone\" or final exercise. We will take a real world example of a displacement crisis\u2014the situation of Tajikistan from 1992-96\u2014and, working together as a Country Team, develop our own strategy for assisting displaced populations.

Show Slide 1.2 Why a Special Category? /g183/g32The argument advanced by the Representative of the Secretary General in favor of having a special category is that: /g216/g32The internally displaced share characteristics and face ordeals specific to their situation. In order to understand their situation, it is necessary to delineate the circumstances they face. /g216/g32Up to now, the protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons have not been fully met; those needs cannot be properly addressed if the beneficiaries themselves and the nature of their situation are not made distinct. /g216/g32The development of the \"Guiding Principles\" as a normative framework required a standard setting process. /g216/g32The essential thrust of the identification process is not to create new categories of people having special rights but to extend protection and respect of existing rights to persons in particularly vulnerable situations.344 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-8 Facilitator Guide Participant Introductions/Icebreaker Activity (Continued) Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32Work in your table groups to introduce yourselves to one another and write a group definition of internally displaced persons. /g183/g32Post your group definition on chart paper and appoint a spokesperson to introduce the individuals at your table to the larger group and present your definition. Debrief the activity by having each table group introduce its members and present its definition of the internally displaced. Show Slide 1.3 Descriptive Definition Present the following Descriptive Definition according to the Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons (1998): \"...persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human- made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\" Make connections between the groups' definitions and this definition. Emphasize the following: /g183/g32There are two essential components of the description: /g216/g32The element of coerced or forced movement, and /g216/g32The fact that the victims have not crossed an international state border.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 345Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-9 Facilitator Guide Participant Introductions/Icebreaker Activity (Continued) Show Slide 1.4 Earlier Definition Give participants the following earlier definition from the Analytical Report of the Secretary-General (1992): \"[P]ersons who have been forced to flee their homes suddenly or unexpectedly in large numbers, as a result of armed conflict, internal strife, systematic violations of human rights or natural or man-made disasters; and who are within the territory of their own country.\" Point out some of the most important features of the current definition and how the current and former descriptions differ. These include the following: \"Forced or obliged\" as opposed to just \"forced to flee\" /g183/g32 Forced to flee is too narrow because it doesn't include possibility of being expelled or intimidated to leave by threat. /g183/g32 The most important fact is that displacement is coerced or involuntary. \"As a result of \" is the same but \" in order to avoid \" added /g183/g32 This is more flexible in terms of proximity to conflict or whether conflict has taken place or not. \"...[A]s a result of\" implies effects have already taken place while \"in order to avoid\" implies fear that they will take place. \"within territory of their own country \" replaced by \" have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\" 346 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-10 Facilitator Guide Participant Introductions/Icebreaker Activity (Continued) /g183/g32 The more specific description was to address worldwide trends of state disintegration and formation. In the former Yugoslavia persons displaced could be considered refugees or internally displaced depending on whether the new borders they crossed had an international character. Discuss another important element of the description: the delineation of causes. \"In particular as a result of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters\" /g183/g32 The causes of displacement are listed as part of the description. Most are self-explanatory. The term \"situations of generalized violence\" leaves open the nature and extent of the violence. /g183/g32 \"In particular\" emphasizes that other causes may be considered. /g183/g32 \"Natural disaster\" is included because in some disasters governments respond by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups of victims on political or ethnic grounds or by violating their rights in other ways. Man-made disasters are included for the same reason. (i.e., where a dam is built but the government makes no attempt to resettle or compensate those displaced). /g183/g32 \"Disaster\" is also included to avoid situations where people are displaced to a potentially hostile area.

Show Slide 1.5 Why IDPs Are Especially Vulnerable /g183/g32Although all persons affected by conflict, human rights violations, and/or violations of international law suffer, displacement from one's place of residence may make the internally displaced especially vulnerable: /g216/g32Internally displaced persons may be in transit from one place to another, may be in hiding, may be forced toward unhealthy or inhospitable environments, or face other circumstances that make them especially vulnerable. /g216/g32The social organization of displaced communities may have been destroyed or damaged by the act of physical displacement; family groups may be separated or disrupted; women may be forced to assume non-traditional roles or face particular vulnerabilities. /g216/g32Internally displaced populations, and especially groups like children, the elderly, or pregnant women, may experience profound psychosocial distress related to displacement. /g216/g32Removal from sources of income and livelihood may add to physical and psychosocial vulnerability for displaced persons. /g216/g32Internal displacement may well disrupt schooling for displaced children and adolescents.

Show Slide 1.6 Departure and Duration Vary Enormously /g183/g32The intensity of departure and duration of internal displacement also vary enormously. /g216/g32Some displaced communities flee rapidly, in a group, to flee large-scale fighting or attack, often leaving all possessions behind.350 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-14 Facilitator Guide The Nature of Internal Displacement: Circumstances and Conditions of the Internally Displaced (Continued) /g216/g32Internally displaced persons may flee their homes individually or in family units as human rights abuses, violations of international law, threats, or attacks intensify. Families may send children or other groups to live apart from the remainder of the family as vulnerability mounts. /g216/g32Internally displaced persons may retain some portion of their possessions and tools of livelihood or be bereft of possessions. /g216/g32Certain internally displaced populations may have been forced by authorities or combatants into confined camps or settlements against their will. /g216/g32Displacement may be of short duration, until a crisis has passed, or -- in many circumstances -- may last for years. /g216/g32Internal displacement may be lengthened as authorities refuse to allow return to home areas controlled by opposing forces, or internally displaced persons judge that their home area is unsafe because of the presence of hostile forces. /g216/g32Internally displaced persons may face repeated cycles of displacement as conflict, human rights abuses, or violations of international law ebb and flow. /g216/g32Return may be made difficult by property or other damage in the home area, by hostility of those who did not flee, or due to seizure of property or homes by other individuals.

However, when states cause, encourage or condone displacement, they usually perceive the internally displaced as \"enemies\" rather than citize ns. Left to suffer in isolation and obscurity, the internally displaced can then not only be deprived of the protection of the state but also denied assistance. /g183/g32In some instances the same state authorities\u2014or armed opposition groups controlling territory in which the displaced are located\u2014deny assistance and access by the international community. In other situations the internally displaced can be caught in the middle of a conflict between rebel groups and government forces and are victimized or viewed with hostility and suspicion by both sides. /g183/g32All scenarios of internal displacement raise difficult questions with no easy solutions. The biggest and often most complicated questions revolve around the conception of sovereignty and its impact on access by international organizations. /g183/g32In what most perceive as a positive development, the Cold War/\"impregnable\" perception of sovereignty is undergoing a subtle transformation. States are becoming less and less able to hide behind claims of national interest and sovereignty if they abuse the rights of their citizens. 352 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-16 Facilitator Guide The Critical Issues of Sovereignty, Responsibility and Access (Continued) Ask participants to turn to page I-7 in their Participant Guide. /g183/g32Secretary General Kofi Annan in the 1999 annual session of the General Assembly stated: State sovereignty, in its most basic sense, is being redefined - not least by the forces of globalisation and international cooperation. States are now widely understood to be instruments at the service of their peoples, and not vice versa. At the same time individual sovereignty- by which I mean the fundamental freedom of each individual, enshrined in the charter of the UN and subsequent international treaties-has been enhanced by a renewed and spreading consciousness of individual rights. When we read the charter today, we are more than ever conscious that its aim is to protect individual human beings not to protect those who abuse them. /g183/g32 The Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons, who was appointed in 1992 following a request by the Commission on Human Rights, has further reinforced the view that states cannot hide behind borders with his \"sovereignty as responsibility\" concept. Under this concept, a state can claim the prerogatives of sovereignty only so long as it carries out its internationally recognized responsibilities to provide protection and life supporting assistance to its citizens. Failure to do so would cause it to forfeit traditional rights of sovereignty and legitimize the involvement of the international community .3 3 Roberta Cohen and Francis Deng, The Forsaken People , Brookings Institution Press, Washington, 1998 pg 6 Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 353Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-17 Facilitator Guide The Critical Issues of Sovereignty, Responsibility and Access (Continued) /g183/g32Notwithstanding the changing perception of sovereignty, it is a maxim for all issues of interna l displacement that ultimate responsibility rests with the state. Based on ultimate state responsibility, the challenge for the international community has been how to respond to crises of internal displacement while respecting state sovereignty. /g183/g32Unlike refugees, there is no single institution to respond to the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced. /g183/g32Scarce resources and a lack of a political will to create a new agency have hampered the international community's ability to respond to the problem. /g183/g32The magnitude of the task has also, up to now, precluded an existing agency from taking on the complete burden of dealing with the internally displaced. /g183/g32Out of political necessity, the international community has sought a collaborative approach to the problem by making better use of existing mandates. /g183/g32The collaborative approach requires that the capabilities of many international organizations, working together, be combined to address situations of internal displacement in a coordinated fashion. /g183/g32You'll learn how the collaborative approach works in Module III. 354 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to

requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a Representative on Internally Displaced Persons, Dr. Francis Deng, a well-respected African scholar and former diplomat, was selected. /g183/g32He was asked to study the causes and consequences of internal displacement, to review interna tional legal protection and institutional responses to internal displacement, and to search for ways in which their protection and assistance could be improved. /g183/g32In response to an analysis of legal norms affecting internally displaced4 and to remedy deficiencies in existing law, the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly requested the Representative of the Secretary-General to prepare an appropriate framework for the protection and assistance of the internally displaced. /g183/g32In collaboration with a team of experts, the Representative drafted the \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,\" which were presented to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-fourth session in April 1998. /g183/g32The Commission unanimously adopted resolution 1998/50, which took note of the \"Guiding Principles\" and requested that the Representative report back

Principles\" address the specific needs of internally displaced persons by identifying rights and guarantees relevant to their protection. /g183/g32The Principles reflect and are consistent with international human rights law and international humanitarian law. /g183/g32They restate the relevant norms applicable to the internally displaced, which are widely spread out in existing instruments, clarify any grey areas that might exist, and address gaps in protection. /g183/g32They apply to the different phases of displacement, including protection against arbitrary displacement, access to protection and assistance during displacement, and guarantees during return or alternative se ttlement and re integration. /g183/g32In terms of their use, the Principles are intended to provide guidance to the Representative in carrying out his mandate, to assist states and national authorities when faced with the phenomenon of displacement and to guide intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations when addressing internal displacement. /g183/g32TheGuiding Principles are also intended to be a persuasive instrument that provides not only practical guidance, but also acts as an instrument for public policy education and consciousness-raising. 356 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally

The argument advanced by the Representative of the Secretary General in favor of a having a special category is that: /g183/g32The internally displaced share characteristics and face ordeals specific to their situation. In order to understand their situation, it is necessary to delineate the circumstances they face. /g183/g32Up to now, the protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons have not been fully met; those needs cannot be properly addressed if the beneficiaries themselves and the nature of their situation are not made distinct. /g183/g32The development of the \"Guiding Principles\" as a normative framework required a standard setting process. /g183/g32The essential thrust of the identification process is not to create new categories of people having special rights but to extend protection and respect of existing rights to persons in particularly vulnerable situations. 362 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-5 Participant Guide Definitions of Internally Displaced Persons Descriptive Definition according to the Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons (1998): \"...Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\" An earlier definition from the Analytical Report of the Secretary-General (1992): \"[P]ersons who have been forced to flee their homes suddenly or unexpectedly in large numbers, as a result of armed conflict, internal strife, systematic violations of human rights or natural or man-made disasters; and who are within the territory of their own country.\" Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 363Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-6 Participant Guide The Nature of Internal Displacement: Circumstances and Conditions of the Internally Displaced /g183/g32By the year 2000, internal displacement affected between 20 and 25 million people in over fifty (50) countries, far more than the number of refugees worldwide. /g183/g32Often the result of violent ethnic conflict, civil wars and related violations of human rights or international law, displacement creates conditions of severe hardship and suffering for the affected populations. /g183/g32Although all persons affected by conflict, human rights violations, and/or violations of international law suffer, displacement from one's place of residence may make the internally displaced especially vulnerable: /g216/g32Internally displaced persons may be in transit from one place to another, may be in hiding, may be forced toward unhealthy or inhospitable environments, or face other circumstances that make them especially vulnerable. /g216/g32The social organization of displaced communities may have been destroyed or damaged by the act of physical displacement; family groups may be separated or disrupted; women may be forced to assume non-traditional roles or face particular vulnerabilities. /g216/g32Internally displaced populations, and especially groups like children, the elderly, or pregnant women, may experience profound psychosocial distress related to displacement. /g216/g32Removal from sources of income and livelihood may add to physical and psychosocial vulnerability for displaced persons. /g216/g32Internal displacement may well disrupt schooling for displaced children and adolescents. /g216/g32Internal displacement to areas where local inhabitants are of different groups or inhospitable may increase risk to internally displaced communities; internally displaced persons may face language barriers in their location of displacement. /g216/g32The fact that internally displaced persons have fled their traditional place of residence may suggest to the parties to a conflict that the displaced favor one side or the other, leading armed combatants to become suspicious about the loyalty of displaced populations. /g216/g32Internally displaced persons may lack identity documents essential to receiving benefits or recognition before the law; in some cases, displaced persons may have jettisoned such documents in fear of persecution. 364 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-7 Participant Guide The Critical Issues of Sovereignty, Responsibility and Access /g183/g32Secretary General Kofi Annan in the 1999 annual session of the General Assembly stated: State sovereignty, in its most basic sense, is being redefined - not least by the forces of globalisation and international cooperation. States are now widely understood to be instruments at the service of their peoples, and not vice versa. At the same time individual sovereignty- by which I mean the fundamental freedom of each individual, enshrined in the charter of the UN and subsequent international treaties-has been enhanced by a renewed and spreading consciousness of individual rights. When we read the charter today, we are more than ever conscious that its aim is to protect individual human beings not to protect those who abuse them. /g183/g32The Representative of the Secretary-General for Internally Displaced Persons, who was appointed in 1992 following a request by the Commission on Human Rights, has further reinforced the view that states cannot hide behind borders with his \"sovereignty as responsibility\" concept. Under this concept, a state can claim the prerogatives of sovereignty only so long as it carries out its internationally recognized responsibilities to provide protection and life supporting assistance to its citizens. Failure to do so would cause it to forfeit traditional rights of sovereignty and legitimize the involvement of the international community . 1 1 Roberta Cohen and Francis Deng, The Forsaken People , Brookings Institution Press, Washington, 1998 pg 6 Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 365Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-8 Participant Guide The Guiding Principles /g183/g32In 1992, after the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint a Representative on internally displaced persons, Dr. Francis Deng, a well-respected African scholar and former diplomat, was selected. /g183/g32He was asked to study the causes and consequences of internal displacement, to review international legal protection and institutional responses to internal displacement, and to search for ways in which their protection and assistance could be improved. /g183/g32In response to an analysis of legal norms affecting internally displaced 2 and to remedy deficiencies in existing law, the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly requested the Representative of the Secretary-General to prepare an appropriate framework for the protection and assistance of the internally displaced. /g183/g32In collaboration with a team of experts, the Representative drafted the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement , which were presented to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-fourth session in April 1998. /g183/g32The Commission unanimously adopted resolution 1998/50, which took note of the Guiding Principles and requested that the Representative report back regularly on their dissemination and implementation. /g183/g32TheGuiding Principles address the specific needs of internally displaced persons by identifying rights and guarantees relevant to their protection. /g183/g32The Principles reflect and are consistent with international human rights law and international humanitarian law. /g183/g32They restate the relevant norms applicable to the internally displaced, which are widely spread out in existing instruments, clarify gray areas that might exist, and address the gaps in protection. /g183/g32They apply to the different phases of displacement, including protection against arbitrary displacement, access to protection and assistance during displacement, and guarantees during return or alternative settlement and reintegration. 2United Nations, Compilation and Analysis of Legal Norms, Report of the Representative of the Secretary- General to the Commission on Human Right s 1996, E/CN.4/1996/Add.2 and Part II Compilation and Analysis of legal norms E/CN:4/1998/53/Add 1 and the Guiding Principles E/CN.4/1998/53/Add. 2 366 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module I: Introduction to Internal Displacement Page I-9 Participant Guide The Guiding Principles (continued) /g183/g32In terms of their use, the Principles are intended to provide guidance to the Representative in carrying out his mandate, to assist States and national authorities when faced with the phenomenon of displacement and to guide intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations when addressing internal displacement. /g183/g32TheGuiding Principles are also intended to be a persuasive instrument that provides not only practical guidance, but also acts as an instrument for public policy education and consciousness-raising.

The list is meant to stimulate discussions on applying the definition and developing a profile and is not exhaustive. Limits on Duration or Frequency of Displacement When does the status of displaced begin or end? Does application of the definition depend on the number of times one is displaced especially in, for example, nomadic societies? Does, for example, a family living in a camp setting for several years satisfy the definition of displacement or should they be considered resettled? If someone was forced to leave his/her home for a week because of fighting but then was able to return, were they displaced? Is someone who is forced or obliged to flee his/her home every night, returning during the day, displaced? Vulnerability Does someone who has just returned home from being internally displaced and is still considered vulnerable meet the definition of an internally displaced person? If so, for how long? If the male of the family returns home to farm a plot of land but the female and children stay in a camp, is the family displaced? If a single mother afraid for the security of her children goes to stay with her mother, is she displaced? Coercion How do you distinguish between what is considered voluntary departure because of unacceptable living conditions, such as a shrinking economy, declining security or official harassment, on the one hand, and involuntary forced displacement on the other? Is the line clearly defined in your region? 368 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons I-1Outline of the trainingOutline of the training /g108Module One: Introduction to Internal Displacement /g108Module Two: The Basis for Action in International Law and Humanitarian Principles /g108Module Three: The Institutional Framework for Activities on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons /g108Module Four: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement /g108Module Five: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement /g108Module Six: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Internally Displaced PopulationsCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 369 I-2Why a special category?Why a special category?

This module explains how the Guiding Principles take their authority from existing international law, both human rights law and humanitarian law. /g183/g32Since many relevant authorities represent nations that have signed treaties or otherwise are subject to international human rights or humanitarian law, understanding the basis in law of the Guiding Principles empowers staff to advocate and otherwise work on behalf of the displaced. 378 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-4 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide Introduction to Module II (Continued) /g183/g32Similarly, widely accepted humanitarian principles are found in the Guiding Principles , and these principles also provide a basis for action vis-\u00e0-vis the internally displaced. /g183/g32This module will not turn its readers immediately into international lawyers. Indeed, consulting with competent experts on international law is important when dealing with those whose actions put internally displaced persons at risk. /g183/g32This module will, however, help to familiarize you with key parts of the Guiding Principles , provide an introduction to the firm legal and ethical bases on which the Guiding Principles stand, and give you a general understanding of when relevant bodies of law and humanitarian principles apply. The Legal Basis for the Guiding Principles (15 minutes) Make the following points on the legal basis of The Guiding Principles: /g183/g32All human beings are entitled to fundamental rights and freedoms, including internally displaced persons. /g183/g32While internally displaced persons are entitled to the same fundamental rights as other persons, it remains the case that all too frequently the event of displacement makes internally displaced persons differentially at risk of human rights violations or violations of international humanitarian law during displacement, in the place of relocation, and on return. /g183/g32Universally recognized rights are not lost by virtue of being displaced . It is generally recognized that internally displaced persons have the same rights as all other persons within a state. States have primary responsibility for ensuring these rights are realized for all people, yet States are sometimes unwilling or unable to fulfill their primary protection responsibilities.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 379Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-5 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide The Legal Basis for the Guiding Principles (Continued) /g183/g32For these reasons, it became necessary to restate the rights and guarantees of internally displaced persons in a practical way to facilitate implementation. /g183/g32At the same time, it was necessary to identify the extent to which these rights and guarantees adequately address the particular needs of internally displaced persons - by seeking clarification on unclear areas and filling particular gaps. /g183/g32The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement consolidate into one document the relevant rights and norms, thereby providing a practical tool for implementation. They begin by explicitly confirming that internally displaced persons have the same legal entitlements as all other persons within a country. Read Principle 1. Show Slide 2-2 Principle 1. Princi ple 1 1. Internally displaced persons shall enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country.... Make the following points about the importance of law: /g183/g32In order to appreciate the status of the Guiding Principles , it is necessary to understand their underlying legal foundations. /g183/g32Strictly speaking, the Guiding Principles themselves do not constitute binding international law. However, many of the principles directly restate international law relevant to internally displaced persons embodied in treaties and customary international law, which is binding on States parties. 380 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-6 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide The Legal Basis for the Guiding Principles (Continued) /g183/g32In general, the Guiding Principles restate these existing rights and proceed to provide guidance on how best to implement them in practical terms. /g183/g32In essence, while the Guiding Principles do not technically form part of international law, they draw upon international law in such an extent as to make them an authoritative consolidation of recognized rights, norms and obligations relevant to internally displaced persons - bound together in one document to facilitate implementation. /g183/g32It is important to appreciate these legal foundations when advocating for the rights contained within the Guiding Principles . States hold prime responsibility for implementing the international treaties to which they are party, as well as adhering to customary international law. Should States fail to discharge these responsibilities, they may be in breach of international law. /g183/g32Understanding the international legal basis for the Guiding Principles will assist those working with internally displaced persons to: /g216/g32Deal with the Guiding Principles as being an authoritative restatement of international law to which a State may be bound; /g216/g32Use the Guiding Principles to facilitate implementation of existing law; /g216/g32Utilize the normative framework where gaps exist . Provide the following note of caution: Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 381Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-7 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide The Legal Basis for the Guiding Principles (Continued) The Guiding Principles are not a substitute for reference to the actual international instruments from which they are drawn. In particular circumstances, the specific provision or instrument of international law should be cited. As the name suggests, the Guiding Principles provide guidance on the array of rights and norms applicable in situations of internal displacement. Staff of international organizations should not hesitate to consult relevant legal or other experts to reference specific provisions of international law. Sources of International Law (60 minutes) Introduce the activity by making the following points: /g183/g32Over the past 50 years, a large body of international law has emerged which sets out rights of all human beings and obligations of States to promote and protect these rights. Internally displaced persons are not mentioned in international law as a separate category. /g183/g32In this section, we will explore the main \"sources\" of international, regional and national law relevant to internally displaced persons that form the basis of the Guiding Principles , namely: /g216/g32International human rights law --treaties law /g216/g32United Nations resolutions /g216/g32Refugee law by analogy /g216/g32Regional frameworks /g216/g32National law 382 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-8 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide Sources of International Law (Continued) Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32Work in three groups. /g183/g32Turn to \"Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons\" beginning on page 2-4 in the Participant Guide. This reading contains information about the main sources of law relevant to internally displaced persons. /g183/g32Group 1: Read the information on international human rights law and after you have finished reading, work together to summarize the information for the other participants. /g183/g32Group 2: Do the same for the information on international humanitarian law. /g183/g32Group 3: Do the same for the information on refugee law by analogy, regional frameworks, and national legal frameworks. Debrief the activity by having each group present to the rest of the class, adding to the information presented as necessary. Categories of Conflict and Relevant Bodies of Law, Plus Limitations on International Law (20 minutes) Present the following information on categories of conflict: /g183/g32Now that we have explored the main sources of law relevant to the internally displaced, we need to understand two additional aspects of the law: /g216/g32What categories of law apply in what types of conflict; and /g216/g32The circumstances when relevant authorities can claim that international law does not apply.

Therefore, we need to explore in a little more depth the categories of conflict and how they affect protection available to internally displacedpersons. Show Slide 2-3 Categories of Conflict /g183/g32The applicability of human rights law and international humanitarian law is different, according to whether there is peace, internal disturbances, or armed conflict. /g183/g32Human rights law is applicable at all time, i.e., in peacetime and in situations of armed conflict. However, it is possible for states to suspend the application of certain rights in times of public emergency. It is never permitted to derogate from a core body of rights, which include the right to life, the prohibition on cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, the prohibition on slavery and on retroactive criminal laws. /g183/g32International humanitarian law, on the other hand, applies exclusively in armed conflicts, be they international or non- international. As a body of law developed to provide protection in such situations, international humanitarian law does not allow derogations. /g183/g32As a consequence, a different set of legal rules apply in different situations of violence. These include: /g216/g32Tensions and civil disturbances (such as riots and demonstrations) or disasters. Human rights law is applicable in these situations; 384 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-10 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide Categories of Conflict and Relevant Bodies of Law, Plus Limitations on International Law (Continued) /g216/g32Non-international armed conflicts (when civil disturbances and tensions escalate within a country and are marked by prolonged use of force) either between the government armed forces and organized armed groups or between two or more organized armed groups. These situations are governed by the rules of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international conflicts and human rights law. It may be possible to suspend the application of certain rights; /g216/g32International armed conflicts between two or more states and including wars of national liberation. These situations are governed by the rules of international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts and human rights law. It may be possible, however, to suspend the application of certain human rights. Present the following information on limitations on enjoyment of human rights and so-called \"derogation\" from human rights: /g183/g32Representatives of international organizations working on behalf of internally displaced persons may encounter claims from relevant authorities that they can legitimately limit the rights of displaced persons under certain circumstances. /g183/g32Therefore, it is critical to understand the limited conditions under which human rights can be limited. Again, if advocacy, assistance, or protection programs encounter such claims, it may be useful to seek expert legal advice. However, there are certain basic definitions that you should know. /g183/g32Generally speaking, human rights trea ties contain limitation clauses that permit governments lawfully to restrict the enjoyment of many human rights in specific circumstances. However, in general, limitations on civil and political rights can only be imposed if: Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 385Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-11 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide Categories of Conflict and Relevant Bodies of Law, Plus Limitations on International Law (Continued) /g216/g32The limitation is determined by law /g216/g32But only for the purposes of: --Securing due recognition of the rights of others and --Of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. /g183/g32Permissible limitation of universally r ecognized rights, therefore, requires regard for proportionality. States are expected to act in good faith toward their international responsibilities so as not to abuse the limitation clauses. /g183/g32For example, a Government may impose a curfew in a riot torn area so as to restrict freedom of movement if its reasons for doing so accord with the criteria above, i.e., to protect the rights of others and public order in accordance with the law. /g183/g32Economic, social and cultural rights may also be limited by law, but only insofar as the limitation is compatible with the nature of the rights and solely to promote the general welfare in a democratic society. /g183/g32Some human rights treaties contain narrow \"derogation\" clauses (derogation is defined as deviation permitted from a standard). These derogation clauses permit States to take measures that suspend the enjoyment of certain rights. /g183/g32Such derogations are permitted only to the extent necessary for the situation and may never involve discrimination based on race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin. For example, article 4(1) of the ICCPR provides: 386 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-12 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide Categories of Conflict and Relevant Bodies of Law, Plus Limitations on International Law (Continued) In times of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed , the States parties to the present Covenant may take measures derogating from their legal obligation under the present Covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation , provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin. /g183/g32Any derogation must be reported to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. /g183/g32Situations of tensions and disturbances rarely justify a state of emergency that would permit derogation. /g183/g32The following treaties do NOT contain a derogation clause: Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. /g183/g32However, in accordance with article 4(3) of the ICCPR, certain human rights - non-derogable rights - may never be suspended or restricted even in situations of war and armed conflict.

Human rights law guarantees freedom of movement and the right to choose one's own residence. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at article 13(1) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at article 12(1) provide that \"everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.\" Article 11(1) the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also guarantees the right to housing. /g183/g32Although freedom from arbitrary displacement is not directly stated, it can be implied from the above provisions and from the spirit in which rights should be applied.

Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32Work in groups of three. /g183/g32First, identify and list five actual needs and rights that you might imagine an internally placed person would want and require. For example, fast responses might include food, firewood, transportation, identification documents, safe passage or seeds. /g183/g32Your group will be the custodian of a particular international instrument. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the central rights provision. For the purposes of the exercise, a selection of the following main instruments should be distributed, two or three to each group: /g183/g32Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) /g183/g32International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) /g183/g32International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) /g183/g32Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 393Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-19 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide The Principles in Action (Continued) /g183/g32Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) /g183/g32Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) /g183/g32Convention against Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) /g183/g32The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of Armed Conflict, and Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions /g183/g32Regional instruments, if applicable . /g183/g32On the basis of the identified list of \"wants and needs,\" comb your particular instruments to identify what it says about that issue. It will become evident that the list of \"needs and wants\" can be protected by the instruments. /g183/g32Once the international provisions are identified, find a corresponding principle in the Guiding Principles restating that right and providing greater detail relevant to the specific situation of displacement. In this way, the legal basis for the Guiding Principles should become apparent. Debrief the activity by asking each group to present its findings. What Are Humanitarian Principles and Why Do We Care about Them? (15 minutes) Present the following points about international humanitarian principles: /g183/g32The Guiding Principles reflect not only international law, but also international humanitarian principles. /g183/g32International humanitarian principles are ethical standards applicable to all humanitarian actors, which have their underpinnings in international human rights and humanitarian law, and seek to protect the humanitarian imperative and the integrity of humanitarian action.394 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-20 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide What Are Humanitarian Principles and Why Do We Care about Them? (Continued) /g183/g32Unlike provisions of international law that speak to the rights of the internally displaced, international humanitarian principles speak primarily to the rights and responsibilities of humanitarian actors , such as UN and partner organizations. /g183/g32The first explicit statement of humanitarian principles is to be found in \"The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent,\" which were adopted by the 20th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 1965. /g183/g32The principles agreed upon at that time were as follows: Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity and Universality. Since then there have been a number of developments and efforts made to give guidance to humanitarian actors on ethical standards in humanitarian action. /g183/g32There are several examples of where humanitarian principles documents have been developed to guide humanitarian actors. The \"Principles of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Response Programmes,\" and the \"The Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response\" developed by the Sphere Project are good examples of humanitarian principles instruments giving practical tools and guidelines on action in an emergency environment. Ask participants to turn to \"Principles of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Response Programmes\" and \"The Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response\" in their Participant Guide.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 395Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-21 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide What Are Humanitarian Principles and Why Do We Care about Them? (Continued) /g183/g32These last two documents -- the \"Principles of Conduct\" and the \"Humanitarian Charter\" -- illustrate important concepts about humanitarian principles. /g183/g32Both generally address many of the same topics, illustrating the widely shared notion of humanitarian standards. But the two documents express shared humanitarian principles in different language, illustrating the lack of formal codification of humanitarian principles. /g183/g32Both the \"Principles of Conduct\" and the \"Humanitarian Charter\" provide guidance to humanitarian organizations by addressing the \"humanitarian imperative,\" and by noting the need for access to affected populations. But let us look at how the language varies. /g183/g32The \"Principles of Conduct\" says: \"The humanitarian imperative comes first. The right to receive humanitarian assistance, and to offer it, is a fundamental humanitarian principle which should be enjoyed by all citizens of all countries. As members of the international community, we recognise our obligation to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed. Hence the need for unimpeded access to affected populations is of fundamental importance in exercising that responsibility.\" 396 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-22 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide What Are Humanitarian Principles and Why Do We Care about Them? (Continued) /g183/g32The \"Humanitarian Charter\" expresses the humanitarian imperative differently: \"We reaffirm our belief in the humanitarian imperative and its primacy. By this we mean the belief that all possible steps should be taken to prevent or alleviate human suffering arising out of conflict or calamity, and that civilians so affected have a right to protection and assistance.\" and, later in the document, speaking to the issue of access to affected populations: \"We understand an individual's right to life to entail the right to have steps taken to preserve life where it is threatened, and a corresponding duty on others to take such steps. Implicit in this is the duty not to withhold or frustrate the provision of life-saving assistance.\" Core Humanitarian Principles (5 minutes) Present the following information on the core humanitarian principles. Show Slide 2-10 Five Core Humanitarian Principles /g183/g32Based on international humanitarian law, human rights law, widely accepted codes of conduct, and the Guiding Principles themselves, the following five core humanitarian principles should guide sound programming in internal displacement: 1. Do no harm: that is, avoid prolonging conflict or creating a deleterious effect on any groups you come in contact with. As noted in the SPHERE Humanitarian Charter, \"...the attempt to provide assistance in situations of conflict may potentially render civilians more vulnerable to attack, or may on occasion bring unintended advantage to one or more of the warring parties. We are committed to minimizing any such adverse effects of our interventions....\" Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 397Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-23 Humanitarian Principles Facilitator Guide Core Humanitarian Principles (Continued) 2.

The Guiding Principles Speak to Humanitarian Principles (10 minutes) Present the following information on how the Guiding Principles speak to humanitarian principles. /g183/g32Principles 24 through 27 of the Guiding Principles are addressed to humanitarian actors and directly address the core humanitarian principles noted above. /g183/g32Notably, these principles not only guide how humanitarian actors should work with the internally displaced, but especially in principles 25 and 26, provide protection for humanitarian actors themselves. Ask participants to read Principles 24 through 27. /g183/g32The useful publication entitled \"Handbook for Applying the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\" provides an explication of the intent of Principles 24 to 27.

It is generally recognized that internally displaced persons have the same rights as all other persons within a state. States have prime responsibility for ensuring these rights are realized for all people, yet States are sometimes unwilling or unable to fulfill their prime protection responsibilities. /g183/g32For these reasons, it became necessary to restate the rights and guarantees of internally displaced persons in a practical way to facilitate implementation. /g183/g32At the same time, it was necessary to identify the extent to which these rights and guarantees adequately address the particular needs of internally displaced persons - by seeking clarification on unclear areas and filling particular gaps. /g183/g32The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement consolidate into one document the relevant rights and norms, thereby providing a practical tool for implementation.They begin by explicitly confirming that internally displaced persons have the same legal entitlements as all other persons within a country. /g183/g32In order to appreciate the status of the Guiding Principles , it is necessary to understand their underlying legal foundations. /g183/g32Strictly speaking, the Guiding Principles themselves do not constitute binding international law. However, many of the principles directly restate international law relevant to internally displaced persons embodied in treaties and customary international law, which is binding on States parties. /g183/g32In general, the Guiding Principles restate these existing rights and proceed to provide guidance on how best to implement them in practical terms.

States hold prime responsibility for implementing the international treaties to which they are party, as well as adhering to customary international law. Should States fail to discharge these responsibilities, they may be in breach of international law. /g183/g32Understanding the international legal basis for the Guiding Principles will assist those working with internally displaced persons to: /g216/g32Deal with the Guiding Principles as being an authoritative restatement of international law to which a State may be bound; /g216/g32Use the Guiding Principles to facilitate impleme ntation of existing law; /g216/g32Utilize the normative framework where gaps exist . The Guiding Principles are not a substitute for reference to the actual international instruments from which they are drawn. In particular circumstances, the specific provision or instrument of international law should be cited. As the name suggests, the Guiding Principles provide guidance on the array of rights and norms applicable in situations of internal displacement. Staff of international organizations should not hesitate to consult relevant legal or other experts to reference specific provisions of international law. 404 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-4 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons 1. Human rights law Human rights law contains some of the most central provisions relevant to internally displaced persons and is, therefore, heavily drawn upon in the Guiding Principles . The rights contained within this body of law are not lost by virtue of being displaced. 1.1 What are human rights? Human rights are commonly understood as being those rights which are inherent to human beings. The concept of human rights acknowledges that every single human being is entitled to enjoy human rights without distinction as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, nation or social origin, property, birth or other status. The following are some of the most important characteristics of human rights: /g183/g32Human rights are founded on respect for the dignity and worth of each person; /g183/g32Human rights are universal , meaning that they are applied equally and without discrimination to all people, /g183/g32Human rights are inalienable , in that no one can have his or her human rights taken away other than in specific situations, /g183/g32Human rights are indivisible, interrelated and interdependent , for the reason that it is insufficient to respect some human rights and not others. In practice, the violation of one right will often affect the respect of several other rights. All human rights should therefore be seen as having equal importance and of being equally essential to respect for the dignity and worth of every person. 1.2 International human rights law Human rights are legally guaranteed by human rights law , protecting individuals and groups against action or inaction by states, which interfere with fundamental freedoms and human dignity. It is important to emphasize that the law does not establish human rights. Human rights are inherent entitlements that come to every person as a consequence of being human. Human rights law generally serves to formally protect the rights of individuals and groups, regardless of being displaced, against actions or abandonment of actions by the State that interfere with the enjoyment of human rights.

Duties are derived from international treaties to which a State is party, as well as customary international law binding on all States. The notion of the duties of states includes the obligation to take proactive measures to ensure that human rights are protected by providing effective remedies for persons whose rights are violated, as well as measures against violating the rights of persons within its territory. A State cannot abandon these duties simply because a segment of the population is displaced. Where a State is unable or willing to fulfill this prime duty, it is expected to invite or at least accept international assistance. It is generally acknowledged that a State must fulfill its duties without invoking its national constitution or legal system as a means of avoidance. Only in situations where a national constitution guarantees great protection of rights can national standards apply before international standards. Therefore, States have prime responsibility for protecting, promoting and ensuring the rights of internally displaced persons in accordance with international law. Checklist for establishing a state's duties 1.Has the State ratified or acceded the main international human rights treaties? TIP: S earch by country or treaty for the status of ratifications at http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf 2. Did the State enter the reservations when it entered the treaty? If so, to what articles?

Given their significance in expressing these fundamental rights, we will explore each one in greater detail. THE MAIN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS /g183/g32The Universal Declaration of Human Rights /g183/g32The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights /g183/g32The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights /g183/g32The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination /g183/g32The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women /g183/g32The Convention against Torture and other Cruel and Degrading Treatment or Punishment /g183/g32The Convention on the Rights of the Child. 1.4.1 The Universal Declaration Of Human Rights The General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Universal Declaration) on 10 December 1948. It consists of a Preamble and 30 articles, setting out the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all men and women are entitled, without distinction of any kind. While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not a treaty and is not binding, it is widely regarded as forming part of customary international law. The Universal Declaration recognizes that the inherent dignity of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. It recognizes fundamental rights that are inherent rights of every human being including, inter alia , the right to life, liberty and security of person; the right to an adequate standard of living; the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries; the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the right to education, freedom of thought, conscience and religion; and the right to freedom from torture and degrading treatment. These inherent rights are to be enjoyed by every human being of the world - man, woman and child - as well as by all groups in society regardless of being displaced.

The Covenant embodies some of the most significant international legal provisions establishing economic, social and cultural rights, including, inter alia , rights relating to work in just and favourable conditions; to social protection; to an adequate standard of living including clothing, food and housing; to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health; to education and to the enjoyment of the benefits of cultural freedom and scientific progress. Significantly, article 2 outlines the legal obligations which are incumbent upon States parties under the Covenant. States are required to take positive steps to implement these rights, to the maximum of their resources, in order to achieve the progressive realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant, particularly through the adoption of domestic legislation. As of April 2000, 142 States were parties to the Covenant. 1.4.3 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) addresses the State's traditional responsibilities for administering justice and maintaining the rule of law.Many of the provisions in the ICCPR address the relationship between the individual and the State. In discharging these responsibilities, States must ensure that human rights are respected, not only those of the victim but also those of the accused. The civil and political rights defined in the ICCPR include, inter alia , the right to self determination; the right to life, liberty and security; freedom of movement, including freedom to choose a place of residence and the right to leave the country; freedom of thought, conscience, religion, peaceful assembly and association; freedom from torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery, forced labour, and arbitrary arrest or detention; the right to a fair and prompt trial; and the right to privacy. 408 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-8 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) There are also other provisions that protect members of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities. Under Article 2, all States Parties undertake to respect and take the necessary steps to ensure the rights recognized in the Covenant without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. The phrase \"other status\" is intended to be interpreted broadly and thus appears to include internally displaced persons 1. The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights authorizes a State to derogate from, or in other words restrict, the enjoyment of certain rights in times of an official public emergency which threatens the life of a nation. Such limitations are permitted only to the extent strictly required under the circumstances and must be reported to the United Nations. Even so, some provisions such as the right to life and freedom from torture and slavery may never be suspended . (See Part I, section c) As at April 2000, 144 States were parties to the Covenant, 95 States were parties to the Optional Protocol and 41 States were parties to the Second Optional Protocol. 1.4.4 International Convention On The Elimination Of All Forms Of Racial Discrimination The phenomenon of racial discrimination was one of the concerns behind the establishment of the United Nations and has therefore been one of its major areas of attention. Racial discrimination is a frequent cause of displacement. It restricts access to protection and assistance during displacement, as well as impeding safe return or resettlement and reintegration. Article 1 of the Convention defines the term \"racial discrimination\" as, \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin with the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights in any field of public life, including political, economic, social or cultural life\". 1Compilation and Analysis, para 52.

States parties undertake not to engage in acts or practices of racial discrimination against individuals, groups of persons or institutions and to ensure that public authorities and institutions do likewise; not to sponsor, defend or support racial discrimination by persons or organizations; to review government, national and local policies and to amend or repeal laws and regulations which create or perpetuate racial discrimination; to prohibit and put a stop to racial discrimination by persons, groups and organizations; and to encourage integration or multiracial organizations, movements and other means of eliminating barriers between races, as well as to discourage anything which tends to strengthen racial divisiveness. As at April 2000, 155 States were parties to the Convention. 1.4.5 Convention On The Elimination Of All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women The Convention was drafted to combat the continuing evident discrimination against women in all parts of the world. In addition to addressing the major issues, the Convention also identifies a number of specific areas where discrimination against women has been flagrant, specifically with regard to participation in public life, marriage, family life and sexual exploitation. The objective of the Convention is to advance the status of women by utilizing a dual approach. It requires States parties to grant freedoms and rights to women on the same basis as men. It encourages States parties to make use of positive measures, including preferential treatment, to advance the status of women and their ability to participate in decision-making in all spheres of national life - economic, social, cultural, civil and political. Frequently, the majority of internally displaced persons are women. The Guiding Principles affirm that special measures may be required to address the particular needs of displaced women. As at April 2000, 165 States were parties to the Convention.410 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-10 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) 1.4.6 Convention Against Torture And Other Cruel, Inhuman Or Degrading Treatment Or Punishment Over the years, the United Nations has developed universally applicable standards against torture which were ultimately embodied in international declarations and conventions. The Convention, article 1, defines \"torture\" as, \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" The overall objectives of the Convention are to prevent acts of torture and other acts prohibited under the Convention and to ensure that effective remedies are available to victims when such acts occur. More specifically, the Convention requires States parties to take preventive action against torture such as the criminalization of acts of torture and the establishment of laws and regulations to promote respect for human rights among its public servants for both the alleged victim and the accused. As at April 2000, 118 States were parties to the Convention. 1.4.7 Convention on the Rights of the Child The Convention codified child rights in a comprehensive and binding treaty. It embodies four general principles for guiding implementation of the rights of the child: non-discrimination ensuring equality of opportunity; when the authorities of a State take decisions which affect children they must give prime consideration to the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development which includes physical, mental, emotional, cognitive, social and cultural development; and children should be free to express their opinions, and such views should be given due weight taking the age and maturity of the child into consideration.

As at April 2000, an unprecedented 191 States were parties to the Convention: the largest number of ratifications of all international instruments. 1.5 Other Applicable Sources of Human Rights Law 1.5.1 The United Nations Treaty Bodies The two covenants and the four conventions listed above are each monitored by a United Nations committee, established by each of the treaties, except the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which was established pursuant to a resolution of ECOSOC. By ratifying a treaty, States parties willingly submit their domestic legal system, administrative procedures and other national practices to periodic review by the committees. These committees are often referred to as treaty bodies. By virtue of their responsibilities, treaty bodies serve as the most authoritative source of interpretation of the human rights treaties that they monitor. Interpretation of specific treaty provisions can be found in their \"views\" on complaints and in the \"concluding observations\" or \"concluding comments\" which they adopt on State reports. In addition, treaty bodies share their understanding on and experience of various aspects of treaty implementation through the formulation and adoption of \"general comments\" or \"general recommendations\". The drafters of the Guiding Principles drew upon this large body of general comments and recommendations for interpretation of rights relevant to internally displaced persons. 412 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-12 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) 1.5.2 United Nations Resolutions A number of resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council are also relevant to protecting the rights of internally displaced persons. For example, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances was adopted by resolution of the General Assembly 2 and the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners was approved by resolutions of the Economic and Social Council 3. Both instruments contain principles and guidance relevant to internally displaced persons. It must be noted that the legal effect of General Assembly resolutions is unclear. The term \"soft law\" is frequently used to describe documents, such as resolutions, which do not constitute legally binding treaties yet carry weight. It can be said that resolutions are binding on the work of the United Nations; however, the extent to which States are bound is generally determined by circumstances surrounding the adoption of the resolution, e.g. the content and context of the resolution. Additionally, the proportion of countries supporting a resolution will determine its value as evidence of customary law. If a substantial number of States dissent, the value of the resolution is diminished. On the other hand, consensus or near unanimous acceptance can provide a basis for the progressive development of customary law 4. Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council are legally binding on Member States, especially resolutions which fall under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter: actions with respect to threats to peace, breaches of peace and acts of aggression. There is increasing reference in Security Council resolutions to the rights of internally displaced persons. 2 GA resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992. 3 Resolution 663 C (XXXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2067 (LXII) of 143 May 1977. 4 Internally Displaced Persons Compilation and Analysis of Legal Norms, Francis M.

International humanitarian law The Guiding Principles are also firmly grounded and consistent with international humanitarian law. 2.1 What is international humanitarian law? International humanitarian law (sometimes referred to as \"the law of armed conflict\" or \"the laws of war\") is the body of law that protects persons not or no longer taking part in hostilities (i.e., the wounded and sick, captured combatants and civilians) and regulates the means and methods of warfare. It is applicable in international and non-international armed conflicts and is binding on both states and organized armed groups. Armed conflicts commonly cause the displacement of civilians. International humanitarian law protects civilian populations which are internally displaced during conflicts. For this reason, the Guiding Principles apply to internally displaced persons who have fled their homes \"as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict\" 5, among others. 2.2 The main instruments of humanitarian law Modern international humanitarian law is mainly embodied in the following four Geneva Conventions of 1949 (189 States Parties) and the two 1977 Protocols Additional to those Conventions (159 and 151 States Parties respectively). 5 Guiding Principles, Principle 2. 414 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-14 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) MAIN INSTRUMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW /g183/g32Geneva Convention (I)for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in the Armed Forces in the Field (1949); /g183/g32Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked members of the Armed Forces at Sea (1949); /g183/g32Geneva Convention ( III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War ( 1949); /g183/g32Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1949); /g183/g32Additional Protocol I relative to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (1977); /g183/g32Additional Protocol II Relative to the Protection of Victims of Non-international Armed Conflicts (1977). Other humanitarian law instruments prohibit or restrict the use of particular weapons, such as for example biological and chemical weapons and certain conventional weapons that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects. Recent instruments include the 1995 Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons to the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention and the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines. An important body of customary norms of international humanitarian law exists alongside these conventional rules. 2.3 The rules of international humanitarian law relating to internal displacement If they are in a state which is experiencing an armed conflict - be it international or non- international - and they are not participating in the hostilities, internally displaced persons are considered civilians and as such as protected by the body of rules of international humanitarian law which protect the civilian population. International humanitarian law aims to prevent the displacement of civilians in the first place and to ensure their protection during displacement should this have nevertheless occurred.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 415Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-15 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) 2.3.1 The express prohibition of displacement International humanitarian law expressly prohibits parties to a conflict from displacing civilians. This is a manifestation of the principle that the civilian population must be spared as much as possible from the effects of hostilities. In international armed conflicts, in situations of occupation, the Fourth Geneva Convention contains a wide prohibition on individual or mass forcible transfers, both within the occupied territory and beyond its borders, either into the territory of the occupying power or, as is more often the case in practice, into third states. There is a limited exception to this rule, which permits an occupying power to \"evacuate\" the inhabitants of a particular area either if this is necessary for the security of the civilian population or for imperative military reasons. Moreover, displaced persons must be transferred back to their homes as soon as the hostilities in the area in question have ceased. The basic prohibition on displacing the civilian population for reasons related to the conflict unless the security of the civilians or imperative military reasons so demand is also applicable in non-international armed conflicts. This express prohibition in Additional Protocol II extends to both transfers within a country and across a border. 2.3.2 Protection from the effects of hostilities in order to prevent displacement In addition to these express prohibitions, the rules of international humanitarian law which shield civilians from the effects of hostilities also play an important role in the prevention of displacement, as it is often violations of these rules which are at the root of displacements in situations of armed conflict.416 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-16 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) The following rules are of particular relevance: /g183/g32the prohibition on making civilians the target of attacks; /g183/g32the prohibition of acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population; /g183/g32the prohibition on conducting hostilities in an indiscriminate manner; /g183/g32the duty to take precautions in attack to spare the civilian population; /g183/g32the prohibition on the destruction and appropriation of civilian property; /g183/g32the prohibition of starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare and of the destruction of objects indispensable to its survival; and /g183/g32the prohibition on reprisals against the civilian population and its property. Also pertinent are the prohibition on collective punishments which, in practice have often taken form of destruction of homes, leading to displacement; the rules requiring parties to a conflict, as well as all other states to allow the unhindered passage of relief supplies and assistance necessary for the survival of the civilian population.; and the rules protecting cultural objects and places of worship and the natural environment. Internally displaced persons also benefit from the provisions of international humanitarian law on family unity - an issue that is particularly relevant in situations of displacement. These basic principles for the protection of the civilian population apply in both international and non-international armed conflicts. 2.3.3 Protection during displacement Although prohibited by international humanitarian law, displacement of civilians frequently occurs in practice. Once displaced or evacuated civilians are entitled to various basic protections and rights, In addition to special provisions relating specifically to persons who have been displaced, such persons are civilians and, as such, entitled, even during displacement, to the whole range of protection appertaining to civilians. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 417Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-17 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) The Fourth Geneva Convention lays down basic rules on the manner in which evacuations must be effected. These safeguards provide that such transfers must be carried out are in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, that during displacement persons must be provided with appropriate accommodation and that members of the same family must not be separated. Additional Protocol II lays down similar basic conditions to be ensured on evacuations in non-international armed conflicts. Although these provisions relate to conditions to be ensured on situations of evacuation - i.e. \"lawful\" displacements for the safety of the persons involved security or for imperative military necessity- these conditions should be applicable a fortiori in situations of unlawful displacement. 2.3.4 Return With regard to return, this is only expressly addressed by international humanitarian law in the context of evacuations in situations of occupation. In such cases displaced persons must be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area have ceased.However, a right of return can be inferred a fortiori following any arbitrary displacement. 418 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-18 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) 3. Refugee law The main distinction between refugees and internally displaced persons is that refugees have crossed an international border, while internally displaced persons remain inside their country. This distinction is significant in terms of protection responsibilities. Refugee law provides international protection to persons who are outside their country of nationality. It sets out the rights of refugees and obligations of host countries to afford protection. Being inside their own country, the duty to protect internally displaced persons rests with the State. Despite this important distinction, internally displaced persons are similar to refugees in that internally displaced persons have been forced to leave their homes and find themselves in refugee-like situations. Given the commonalities in the experience of displacement within or outside a country, it is useful to propose elements of refugee law by analogy to protect the rights of internally displaced persons 6, especially during displacement and on return. The main international treaty relating to refugees is the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Refugee Convention) and its subsequent Protocol of 1967. The Refugee Convention defines a \"refugee\" at Article 1 as a person who; Owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. The Convention sets the minimum standards for treatment of refugees, including the basic rights to which they are entitled. It also contains provisions on their rights to gainful employment and welfare and on the issue of identity papers and travel documents. For example, the Refugee Convention provides that a host country should respect acquired rights - such as rights attached to marriage 7. It also provides for refugees to receive documents or certification as would normally be delivered to aliens8. Such rights are equally applicable to internally displaced persons. 6 Compilation and Analysis of Legal Norms, paragraphs 24 - 25. 7 Refugee Convention, Article 12(2). 8 Ibid. article 25.

The elaboration of guidelines - such as the Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women and Guidelines on the Protection and Care of Refugee Children - offer guidance for the provision of relevant and specialized protection. Likewise the adoption of Conclusions by the Executive Committee of UNHCR (EXCOM Conclusions) provide guidance for States in implementing their obligations under the Refugee Convention. Many aspects of the UNHCR guidelines and EXCOM Conclusions are relevant to situations of internal displacement. 4. Regional frameworks Regional legal frameworks provide another important source of law embodying rights and obligations to all people in a region, including, of course, internally displaced persons. States in a region can be party to these regional treaties at the same time as being party to international treaties. Many regional treaties set out individual human rights and to some extent codify international treaties. The treaties also elaborate the responsibility of States. /g183/g32Africa The African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights was adopted by the Organization for African Unity (OAU) and entered into force in 1986. Almost all Member States of the OAU have ratified it. /g183/g32The Americas There are two regional sources of human rights law in the Americas. The American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man defines the human rights referred to in the Charter of the Organization of American States. The American Convention on Human Rights was adopted by the Organization of American States (OAS) and entered into force in 1978. An additional Protocol has been adopted in the area of economic, social and cultural rights. 420 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-20 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Main Sources of Law Relevant to Internally Displaced Persons (continued) /g183/g32Europe The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was adopted by the Council of Europe and entered into force in 1953. The European Convention sets out civil and political rights. The provisions have been expanded through the adoption of some 11 protocols to expand protection. Economic, social and cultural rights are set out in the European Social Charter. /g183/g32Asia Pacific The Asia and Pacific region is the only UN-defined region without its own human rights system. The vast religious and cultural diversity in the region partly explains the difficulties in developing regional arrangements. 5. National legal frameworks National legal frameworks apply equally to internally displaced persons as to all people within a territory and, therefore, serve as an important basis for determining rights and obligations relevant to internally displaced persons. That is to say, the vast majority of internally displaced persons are nationals of the state in which they find themselves and are therefore entitled to the full enjoyment of all rights granted to nationals/citizens under national law without any adverse distinction flowing from their displacement. Domestic rights and obligations are typically derived from national constitutions, legislation, regulations and decrees. Some countries have specific constitutional provisions or a bill of rights which guarantee certain human rights to all citizens - regardless of being displaced. These provisions should be in conformity with international obligations, and States hold prime responsibility for ensuring compliance. As international law does not specify how obligations are to be translated into domestic law, it is for each State to determine the best way to protect and guarantee rights at the domestic level in practical terms. Hence, when determining the rights of internally displaced persons and duties of States, an understanding of domestic law could be crucial. For example, in situations of return, internally displaced persons may have rights under domestic property law for restitution of property or compensation for loss that elaborates international property rights in practical terms. Similarly, issues surrounding collection and identification of remains of deceased persons are often provided by national legal frameworks.

However, it is possible for states to suspend the application of certain rights in times of public emergency. It is never permitted to derogate from a core body of rights which include the right to life, the prohibition on cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, the prohibition on slavery and on retroactive criminal laws. /g183/g32International humanitarian, on the other hand, applies exclusively in armed conflicts, be they international or non-international. As a body developed to provide protection in such situations, international humanitarian law does not allow derogations. /g183/g32As a consequence, a different set of legal rules apply in different situations of violence. These include: /g216/g32Tensions and civil disturbances (such as riots and demonstrations) or disasters. Human rights law is applicable in these situations; /g216/g32Non-international armed conflicts (when civil disturbances and tensions escalate within a country and are marked by prolonged use of force) either between the government armed forces and organized armed groups or between two or more organized armed groups. These situations are governed by the rules of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international conflicts and human rights law. It may be possible to suspend the application of certain rights; /g216/g32International armed conflicts between two or more states and including wars of national liberation. These situations are governed by the rules of international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts and human rights law. It may be possible, however, to suspend the application of certain human rights. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 423Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-23 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Principles of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Response Programmes 1: The humanitarian imperative comes first. The right to receive humanitarian assistance, and to offer it, is a fundamental humanitarian principle which should be enjoyed by all citizens of all countries. As members of the international community, we recognize our obligation to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed. Hence the need for unimpeded access to affected populations, is of fundamental importance in exercising that responsibility. The prime motivation of our response to disaster is to alleviate human suffering amongst those least able to withstand the stress caused by disaster. When we give humanitarian aid it is not a partisan or political act and should not be viewed as such. 2: Aid is given regardless of the race, creed or nationality of the recipients and without adverse distinction of any kind. Aid priorities are calculated on the basis of need alone. Wherever possible, we will base the provision of relief aid upon a thorough assessment of the needs of the disaster victims and the local capacities already in place to meet those needs. Within the entirety of our programmes, we will reflect considerations of proportionality. Human suffering must be alleviated whenever it is found; life is as precious in one part of a country as another. Thus, our provision of aid will reflect the degree of suffering it seeks to alleviate. In implementing this approach, we recognize the crucial role played by women in disaster prone communities and will ensure that this role is supported, not diminished, by our aid programmes. The implementation of such a universal, impartial and independent policy, can only be effective if we and our partners have access to the necessary resources to provide for such equitable relief, and have equal access to all disaster victims. 3: Aid will not be used to further a particular political or religious standpoint. Humanitarian aid will be given according to the need of individuals, families and communities. Not withstanding the right of non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) to espouse particular political or religious opinions, we affirm that assistance will not be dependent on the adherence of the recipients to those opinions. We will not tie the promise, delivery or distribution of assistance to the embracing or acceptance of a particular political or religious creed. 424 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-24 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide 4: We shall endeavour not to act as instruments of government foreign policy. NGHAs are agencies which act independently from governments. We therefore formulate our own policies and implementation strategies and do not seek to implement the policy of any government, except in so far as it coincides with our own independent policy. We will never knowingly - or through negligence - allow ourselves, or our employees, to be used to gather information of a political, military or economically sensitive nature for governments or other bodies that may serve purposes other than those which are strictly humanitarian, nor will we act as instruments of foreign policy of donor governments. We will use the assistance we receive to respond to needs and this assistance should not be driven by the need to dispose of donor commodity surpluses, nor by the political interest of any particular donor. We value and promote the voluntary giving of labour and finances by concerned individuals to support our work and recognize the independence of action promoted by such voluntary motivation. In order to protect our independence we will seek to avoid dependence upon a single funding source. 5: We shall respect culture and custom. We will endeavour to respect the culture, structures and customs of the communities and countries we are working in. 6: We shall attempt to build disaster response on local capacities. All people and communities - even in disaster - possess capacities as well as vulnerabilities. Where possible, we will strengthen these capacities by employing local staff, purchasing local materials and trading with local companies. Where possible, we will work through local NGHAs as partners in planning and implementation, and co-operate with local government structures where appropriate. We will place a high priority on the proper co-ordination of our emergency responses. This is best done within the countries concerned by those most directly involved in the relief operations, and should include representatives of the relevant UN bodies. 7: Ways shall be found to involve programme beneficiaries in the management of relief aid. Disaster response assistance should never be imposed upon the beneficiaries. Effective relief and lasting rehabilitation can best be achieved where the intended beneficiaries are involved in the design, management and implementation of the assistance programme. We will strive to achieve full community pa rticipation in our relie f and rehabilitation programmes.

All relief actions affect the prospects for long term development, either in a positive or a negative fashion. Recognising this, we will strive to implement relief programmes which actively reduce the beneficiaries' vulnerability to future disasters and help create sustainable lifestyles. We will pay particula r attention to environmenta l concerns in the design and management of relief programmes. We will also endeavour to minimise the negative impact of humanitarian assistance, seeking to avoid long term beneficiary dependence upon external aid. 9: We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources. We often act as an institutional link in the partnership between those who wish to assist and those who need assistance during disasters. We therefore hold ourselves accountable to both constituencies. All our dealings with donors and beneficiaries shall reflect an attitude of openness and transparency. We recognize the need to report on our activities, both from a financial perspective and the perspective of effectiveness. We recognize the obligation to ensure appropriate monitoring of aid distributions and to carry out regular assessments of the impact of disaster assistance. We will also seek to report, in an open fashion, upon the impact of our work, and the factors limiting or enhancing that impact. Our programmes will be based upon high standards of professionalism and expertise in order to minimise the wasting of valuable resources. 10: In our information, publicity and advertising activities, we shall recognize disaster victims as dignified humans, not hopeless objects. Respect for the disaster victim as an equal partner in action should never be lost. In our public information we shall portray an objective image of the disaster situation where the capacities and aspirations of disaster victims are highlighted, and not just their vulnerabilities and fears. While we will co-operate with the media in order to enhance public response, we will not allow external or internal demands for publicity to take precedence over the principle of maximising overall relief assistance. We will avoid competing with other disaster response agencies for media coverage in situations where such coverage may be to the detriment of the service provided to the beneficiaries or to the security of our staff or the beneficiaries.426 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-26 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide The Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response Humanitarian agencies committed to this Charter and to the Minimum Standards will aim to achieve defined levels of service for people affected by calamity or armed conflict, and to promote the observance of fundamental humanitarian principles. The Humanitarian Charter expresses agencies' commitment to these principles and to achieving the Minimum Standards. This commitment is based on agencies' appreciation of their own ethical obligations, and reflects the rights and duties enshrined in international law in respect of which states and other parties have established obligations. The Charter is concerned with the most basic requirements for sustaining the lives and dignity of those affected by calamity or conflict. The Minimum Standards which follow aim to quantify these requirements with regard to people's need for water, sanitation, nutrition, food, shelter and health care. Taken together, the Humanitarian Charter and the Minimum Standards contribute to an operational framework for accountability in humanitarian assistance efforts. 1 Principles We reaffirm our belief in the humanitarian imperative and its primacy. By this we mean the belief that all possible steps should be taken to prevent or alleviate human suffering arising out of conflict or calamity, and that civilians so affected have a right to protection and assistance. It is on the basis of this belief, reflected in international humanitarian law and based on the principle of humanity, that we offer our services as humanitarian agencies. We will act in accordance with the principles of humanity and impartiality, and with the other principles set out in the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations in Disaster Relief (1994). The Humanitarian Charter affirms the fundamental importance of the following principles:Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 427Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-27 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide The Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Continued) 1.1 The right to life with dignity This right is reflected in the legal measures concerning the right to life, to an adequate standard of living and to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. We understand an individual's right to life to entail the right to have steps taken to preserve life where it is threatened, and a corresponding duty on others to take such steps. Implicit in this is the duty not to withhold or frustrate the provision of life-saving assistance. In addition, international humanitarian law makes specific provision for assistance to civilian populations during conflict, obliging states and other parties to agree to the provision of humanitarian and impartial assistance when the civilian population lacks essential supplies. 1.2 The distinction between combatants and non-combatants This is the distinction which underpins the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols of 1977. This fundamental principle has been increasingly eroded, as reflected in the enormously increased proportion of civilian casualties during the second half of the twentieth century. That internal conflict is often referred to as 'civil war' must not blind us to the need to distinguish between those actively engaged in hostilities, and civilians and others (including the sick, wounded and prisoners) who play no direct part. Non-combatants are protected under international humanitarian law and are entitled to immunity from attack. 1.3 The principle of non-refoulement This is the principle that no refugee shall be sent (back) to a country in which his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; or where there are substantial grounds for believing that s/he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. 428 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-28 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Core Humanitarian Principles Based on international humanitarian law, human rights law, widely accepted codifications, and the Guiding Principles themselves, the following five core humanitarian principles should guide sound programming in internal displacement: 1. Do no harm: that is, avoid prolonging conflict or creating a deleterious effect on any groups you come in contact with. As noted in the SPHERE Humanitarian Charter, \"...the attempt to provide assistance in situations of conflict may potentially render civilians more vulnerable to attack, or may on occasion bring unintended advantage to one or more of the warring parties. We are committed to minimizing any such adverse effects of our interventions....\" 2. The humanitarian imperative, or the effort to accomplish what can be accomplished for those in need 3. Neutrality 4. Impartiality 5. The provision of protection, as well as assistance. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 429Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-29 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement Drawing upon Principles 24 through 27 in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, as well as upon international humanitarian law and human rights law, the following fundamental principles should guide sound programming in internal displacement. In each case, a recent example of field practice has been provided to enhance understanding of the fundamental principles. Do No Harm Humanitarian action (aid) becomes part of the dynamics of a conflict or other crisis and may even prolong it. The question then is: How can the humanitarian community do as little harm as possible? For, example humanitarian aid increases resources available in the society overall, and the argument is sometimes made that aid can, therefore, sustain a conflict. Or, more specifically, specific humanitarian policies may sustain one side or the other in a conflict, or create a deleterious impact on a group of aid recipients on non-recipients. The humanitarian actors need to be aware of this possibility and see how they can minimise the harm in, for example, the following situations: /g183/g32When aid is used as an instrument of war by denying access or attacking convoys. /g183/g32When aid is an indirect part of the dynamics of the conflict because it creates jobs, gives incomes in form of taxes, leaves no or little responsibility on the state for social welfare, [etc.], adds to the vulnerabilities of women or other groups in a society, or creates dependency in a recipient group. /g183/g32When aid exacerbates the root causes of the conflict by inadvertently boosting one or the other side in a conflict. \"Anecdotal evidence indicates that a disproportionate number of death occurred during the night [in the camps in Goma]. Though the levels of violence appear to have been reduced after the first month, they remained unacceptably high and stimulated collaborative action by 18 agencies that in November jointly requested the UN Secretary- General to deploy a UN security force in the camps and led to the withdrawal of at least two important NGOs (MSF-France and CARE) from the camps in the same month.\" From The International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience, Study 3: Humanitarian Aid and Effect, March 1996, Steering Committee of the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda, page 52.430 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-30 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement (Continued) The risk of humanitarian agencies causing unintended harm in a conflictive environment is explicitly noted in The Humanitarian Charter crafted by the Sphere Project. Section 2.4 of that Charter notes that: \"The frequent failure of warring parties to respect the humanitarian purpose of interventions has shown that the attempt to provide assistance in situations of conflict may potentially render civilians more vulnerable to attack, or may on occasion bring unintended advantage to one or more of the warring parties. We are committed to minimising any such adverse effects of our interventions in so far as this is consistent with the obligations outlined above [i.e., the humanitarian imperative]. It is the obligation of warring parties to respect the humanitarian nature of such interventions.\" The G uiding Principles on Internal Displacement themselves reinforce the notion that humanitarian agencies must be aware of how humanitarian assistance can cause unintended consequences. Principle 24.2, for example, states that \"Humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons shall not be diverted, in particular for political or military purposes.\" and principle 27.1 notes that international humanitarian organizations \"Shall respect relevant international standards and codes of conduct.\" It is nonetheless clear, however, that the essential, overarching framework for humanitarian action contained in the \"do no harm\" principle creates complex choices in particular circumstances. The Sphere Project's Humanitarian Charter also enjoins humanitarian agencies to \"Reaffirm our belief in the humanitarian imperative and its primacy. By this we mean the belief that all possible steps should be taken to prevent or alleviate human suffering arising out of conflict or calamity....\" it is when \"all possible steps\" confronts \"adverse effects\" that the most careful analysis is required of humanitarian agencies. Suggest other examples from your experience of the principle of do no harm. The Humanitarian Imperative The humanitarian imperative is to prevent and alleviate suffering; to protect life and health to improve the human condition; and to ensure respect for the human being. It implies a right to receive humanitarian assistance and a right to offer it as fundamental to humanitarian principles. The humanitarian imperative also implies an overall protection approach, based in respect for international humanitarian law and human rights law. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 431Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-31 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement (Continued) Contemporary interpretations of the humanitarian imperative are contained in The Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Response Programmes , and in The Humanitarian Charter of the Sphere Project. The former defines the humanitarian imperative by stating \"The prime motivation of our response to disaster is to alleviate human suffering amongst those least able to withstand the stress caused by disaster.\" The latter means by humanitarian imperative \"The belief that all possible steps should be taken to prevent or alleviate human suffering arising out of conflict or calamity, and that civilians so affected have a right to protection and assistance.\" The internally displaced, by definition, remain citizens of their own nation, and national authorities retain primary responsibility for their welfare. When lack of resources, or lack of will, limit assistance by national authorities, the humanitarian imperative may suggest support for, or advocacy with, those authorities as an appropriate first step in sound practice. The following example illustrates the responsibilities of both national authorities and opposition groups to permit access to civilians under their control, as well as the imperative of international organizations to assiduously seek access to persons cut off by conflict. ENGAGEMENT WITH BOTH GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION FORCES ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNALLY DISPLACED: [Sudan] \"Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS),\" launched in 1989, was an early effort to link both parties controlling access to internally displaced persons - the Government of Sudan, and the opposition Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) - into an agreement for relief delivery. Although the approach to a rebel force like the SPLA initially raised serious issues for UN agencies, the resulting agreement was the only hope of reaching 1.5 million displaced and war-affected, since both sides to the conflict controlled displacement sites and access. The OLS agreement, although it has continued to face problems in an ongoing conflict, permitted international humanitarian assistance in each side's area of operations, and guaranteed safe passage in designated \"corridors of tranquillity.\" Field Practice in Internal Displacement, IASC 1999 Suggest other examples from your experience of the principle of the humanitarian imperative.432 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-32 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement (Continued) Neutrality The principles of neutrality ensure that humanitarian actors do not take sides in the hostilities or in controversies based on political, racial, religious or ideological identity (non-partisanship/independence). Transparency and openness are key issues to maintain neutrality. For an organisation that has human rights principles at its core, neutrality does not imply, however, that behind an argument of wanting to stay neutral the organisation could decide to take no action at all in response to human rights violations. Neutrality for an organisation that has taken on a rights-based approach must therefore not be an obstacle to tackling human rights violations. Action does not necessarily mean speaking out, but might include confidentially approaching the authorities, submitting information to others who can take appropriate action, and so on. Although section IV of the Guiding Principles does not mention the word \"neutrality\" itself, the concept is implied throughout principles 24 through 27, for example in references to humanitarian assistance not being diverted \"for political or military reasons,\" and in the reference to non-interference in internal affairs by international humanitarian organizations. The following example illustrates how an international humanitarian actor displayed neutrality by working with both sides in the Sri Lankan conflict. DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION GROUPS ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNALLY DISPLACED: [Sri Lanka] : In situations of internal displacement, negotiations with opposition groups which control portions of national territory will always be sensitive. Nonetheless, active engagement with opposition forces by international organizations operating in Sri Lanka expanded substantially the protection available to the internally displaced. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, during a 1998 visit to Sri Lanka, so ught and obtained a number of commitments from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) regarding children's rights. These commitments included limitations on recruitment of children, and an agreement to train fighters in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The ICRC sought and achieved commitments from the LTTE on adherence to key portions of the Geneva Conventions. Field Practice in Internal Displacement, IASC 1999 Suggest other examples from your experience of the principle of neutrality. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 433Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-33 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement (Continued) Impartiality The principle of impartiality requires that aid be delivered to all those who are suffering, based solely on their need and the corresponding right. Human rights are the basis and the framework for an assessment of needs. The idea is, based on our definition of protection, that depending on which rights are to be fulfilled (for example, the right to health or the right to a fair trial), the aid community should respond with the appropriate assistance, advocacy and action. Accordingly, this principle can include both the proportionality to need as well as the principle of non-discrimination. Proportionality to the need also reflects accountability of the aid community to the beneficiaries as well as to donors. It is crucial to emphasise state responsibility in the context of ensuring that aid is delivered in an impartial way. In the internal displacement context, this principle includes addressing internal displacement within a broader humanitarian strategy : The factors causing internal displacement may affect other groups as well, including host communities, conflict-affected communities, refugees and returnees. Although the internally displaced may experience particular vulnerabilities related to their condition, assistance and protection for the internally displaced should be provided as part of a broader humanitarian strategy that takes into account the perspectives, rights and capacities of other affected groups within the society. Principle 24 of the Guiding Principles specifically addresses the \"principle of impartiality.\" The following example illustra tes an instance of impartiality by humanitarian actors by reaching out to both displaced and refugee communities, based on need, in Burundi. 434 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-34 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement (Continued) BALANCING THE PRIORITIES OF DISPLACED AND HOST COMMUNITIES IN CONFLICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS: [BURUNDI] The large-scale internal displacement crisis in Burundi has been characterized by continued mistrust between ethnic groups, and multiple attempts to politicize the needs assessment and aid distribution processes along ethnic lines. A particularly volatile aspect of this process was the hostility between Tutsi internally displaced persons in Burundi and the estimated 160,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees who entered Burundi in 1994. Burundian Tutsi displaced individuals associated the Hutu refugees with the prior genocide in Rwanda. Efforts by UNHCR to meet its responsibilities for care and protection of the Rwandan refugees had to be balanced -- in a very volatile milieu -- with the perception by Burundian displaced communities of an aid disparity in favor of the Hutu population. Although suspicion and violence -- both inter-communal violence and violence directed against aid organizations -- could not be avoided, UNHCR carefully monitored and analyzed the relationship between the refugee and internally displaced groups, and attempted to direct food and other resources to the internally displaced populations, in an attempt to show balance and impartiality. Field Practice in Internal Displacement, IASC 1999 Suggest other examples from your experience of the principle of impartiality. Protection, As Well As Assistance Activities Since internally displaced persons remain within the boundaries of their nation, international efforts to guarantee the types of protection listed in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement will encounter issues of national sovereignty. Yet, displaced populations may be especially vulnerable to abuse, and protection may be a higher priority than material assistance. Creative efforts to extend protection to the internally displaced are an essential element of sound field practice. TheGuiding Principles on Internal Displacement focuses primarily on the rights of internally displaced persons and on the protection of those rights. The clear implication for humanitarian actors is that these actors have a responsibility beyond the delivery of relief supplies. When the rights of displaced persons are violated, international humanitarian actors are required to note violations, report on violations, advocate with authorities on behalf of the rights of displaced persons, and examine other strategies that might protect the rights of the displaced, all while taking into account the mandates of international agencies with special protection responsibilities. Within section IV, relating to humanitarian assistance, Principle 27 specifically references the \"protection needs\" of displaced persons. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 435Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-35 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Five Fundamental Humanitarian Principles in Internal Displacement (Continued) The following example from Colombia illustrates how, in some cases, the requirement for physical protection may exceed the requirement for physical sustenance. \"Thus, in Colombia the main problem for the displaced population is one of protection, i.e. providing the displaced population, and those threatened with displacement with physical safety. The need for immediate humanitarian assistance (food, health, water, etc), while important, is not as severe as in many other displaced situations. When we speak of protection in this context, we include the need to prevent certain human rights violations against the physical integrity of the population, as well as providing durable solutions to those who have been displaced and are looking to settle down.\" Mission to Colombia with a View to Develop Field Practice in Internal Displacement, UNICEF Office of Emergency Programmes 1998 Suggest other examples from your experience of the principle of protection, as well as assistance. 436 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-36 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Six Cross-Cutting Themes in Internal Displacement That Support Humanitarian Action The four fundamental humanitarian principles outlined above are firmly rooted in international humanitarian and human rights law, generally or specifically addressed in the Guiding Principles, and widely noted in codifications of humanitarian principles.Also drawing upon these same sources, as well as the international community's growing experience with internally displaced populations, other standards have evolved that also deserve mention. These standards are not as universally proclaimed as the four fundamental humanitarian principles, and are more appropriately characterized as \"cross-cutting themes\" in work with internally displaced persons. They are, nonetheless, also targeted at the activities of international humanitarian actors and provide the same kind of ethical guidance to those actors. Most are explicitly rooted in the Guiding Principles. Six of these cross-cutting themes are noted below. Many displacement crises have an emergency phase, when immediate, life-saving assistance may be required. Many displacement crises, however, can last for years, as the internally displaced are caught in ongoing conflicts or political stalemates. Sound field practice is characterised by an early planning for durable solutions - such as return or resettlement - and a recognition that the solution to internal displacement may be related to national economic and political development. This section looks at humanitarian principles that make emergency action development-friendly. To Respect Culture And Custom Understanding local customs and traditions is, of course, important, not only in carrying out your work, but also in understanding local values when connecting them to internationally recognised human rights. Displaced communities, due to the disruption in normal social and cultural patterns that accompanies the process of displacement from homes and communities, displaced persons may require special sensitivity to their cultural traditions. However, in promoting human rights standards, it is always important to point out that human rights are not culturally relative, but that certain universally accepted human rights are applicable to all human beings, no matter what the cultural setting. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 437Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-37 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Six Cross-Cutting Themes in Internal Displacement That Support Humanitarian Action (Continued) Some interventions require particular sensitivity to local customs. For example, in dealing with victims of rape it is important to be aware of how rape and victims of rape are perceived in the local community. In the case of internal displacement, it is important to carry out careful analysis of local socio-cultural patterns: the fact of displacement will be perceived differently by different communities and individuals, depending on prior experience and on local social, cultural, religious and community traditions and beliefs. Sound field practice will be preceded by careful study of these factors, in order to understand what displacement means to those experiencing it. Within the Guiding Principles, numerous references support the theme of respect for culture and custom. Principle 23 notes the right to education that respects \"cultural identity, language and religion.\" Principle 9 addresses particular obligations to indigenous peoples and other groups with a special dependency on their lands. Principle 22 addresses language rights and the freedom of \"religion or belief.\" In addition the Red Cross \"Code of Conduct,\" cited earlier, addresses \"respect [for] culture and custom.\" The example below illustrates a case where an international actor used its knowledge of local culture to promote international humanitarian law in its work with displaced persons. \"Play Clean!\" Addressing Root Causes of Internal Displacement by Creatively Promoting Humanitarian Law: Most observers of the conflict in Colombia note that the violence is directed less between armed groups, and more by armed groups against civilians. In fact, the primary cause of internal displacement in Colombia is direct armed attack, or threat of armed attack, on civilian populations, rather than innocent populations finding themselves in the crossfire of military-versus-military operations. In this milieu, displacement could be significantly reduced if combatants respected the essential elements of international humanitarian law (IHL) -- a major goal of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) program in Colombia. ICRC's program to promote IHL is notable in its creative use of material relevant to the interests of combatants in Colombia, like football. Th rough the use of posters, training material and wallet-size summaries of key elements of IHL (written in plain language, and laminated in order to survive the weather), the ICRC reinforces its \"Play Clean!\" campaign by analogy to football matches. Given the intense interest in football in Colombia, IHL promotional materials display artwork of football games as an introduction to the rules of warfare. Although quantitative measurement of the success of this program is difficult, most observers believe the \"Play Clean!\" campaign and the use of culturally relevant symbols to attract the target population -- youthful male combatants -- make sense.

Because of breakdown of local service delivery and administrative structures there is reliance on external support. In our work it becomes important to focus on capacity building and participation of beneficiaries in all that we do. As a result, part of the strategy must be to empower civil society so that the beneficiaries are able to claim accountability from governing authorities and humanitarian agencies. At the same time, international actors should be prepared to assist governments and other competent authorities who wish to assist internally displaced persons, but have limited capacity to exercise their responsibilities. Recognising that displaced individuals, families and communities are key actors is important: In displacement situations, as in other circumstances when international organisations attempt to assist local communities, the perspectives, rights and capacities of the displaced themselves should guide appropriate interventions. In certain cases, the displaced will be in extremely difficult condition, and will require immediate relief. In other cases, the total effort of the international community might pale in comparison with what the displaced will do for themselves. Supporting displaced communities, understanding their objectives, seeking their input in planning, and enhancing their role in relation to local authorities are essential steps to sound field practice. TheGuiding Principles address the empowerment of displaced communities both in reference to involving local communities in decisions regarding their displacement (Principle 8) and in decisions affecting their return or resettlement (Principle 28). Moreover, by reference to the primary responsibility of national governments and other authorities toward the displaced, the Guiding Principles implies a responsibility on the part of international humanitarian actors to support government officials in the appropriate exercise of their duties. In addition, the Red Cross C ode of Conduct incorporates the theme of local capacity building in two articles: Article 6, which states \"We shall attempt to build disaster response on local capacities,\" and article 7, which states \"Ways shall be found to involve programme beneficiaries in the management of relief aid.\" Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 439Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-39 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Six Cross-Cutting Themes in Internal Displacement That Support Humanitarian Action (Continued) The example below notes the efforts of international humanitarian actors to support the efforts of a national government willing to undertake its duties to prevent internal displacement, in this case due to natural disasters. INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO BUILD LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAPACITY, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE DISPLACEMENT RESULTING FROM NATURAL DISASTERS: [Tajikistan] The prevalence of natural hazards, such as landslides and floods, contributes significantly to internal displacement in mountainous Tajikistan. Recognizing this threat, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) designed a training program to prevent or mitigate the effects of these natural threats. As part of its capacity building effort, IOM assisted Government and local officials to develop a model for adaptive resettlement of villages in high risk areas, and trained these officials in planning for and implementing resettlement activities. Field Practice in Internal Displacement, IASC 1999 To Coordinate Efforts for Maximum Benefit Not only must different international humanitarian agencies make sure they complement each other in the actual delivery of aid, but it is also important that decisions about, for example, stopping the delivery of aid are taken in a principled fashion. This may be cause for major disagreement between aid agencies, as it tends to be difficult to agree on the development of policies on some more sensitive areas of co-ordination. Nevertheless, humanitarian actors must have a common standpoint for maximum benefit. But co-ordinating for the maximum benefit also entails creating an alliance of partnership in government and civil society. Collaborative institutional arrangements among international organisations, and international and local non-governmental organisations, are particularly important in internal displacement. The complexity of displacement crises, the gap in international institutional leadership, and the evolution of systematic practice should all impel close working relationships among responding organisations. It is all too easy for the particular needs of internally displaced persons to \"fall through the cracks\" if international and national organisations, including governments and non-governmental organisations, are not talking with each other, sharing data, and rationally allocating tasks. Close and collaborative working relations among responding institutions - including the use of IDP working groups, and similar targeting arrangements - are essential to sound field practice. 440 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module II: The Basis for Action in International Law and Page II-40 Humanitarian Principles Participant Guide Six Cross-Cutting Themes in Internal Displacement That Support Humanitarian Action (Continued) Although the G uiding Principles do not address inter-agency coordination per se, this concept is implied in Article 27, which encourages all international humanitarian organizations to \"Respect relevant international standards and codes of conduct,\" and in the introduction, which notes that the principles apply to all \"Intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations when addressing internal displacement.\" Within the UN specifically, recent activities of the Inter-agency Standing Committee have emphasized the coordinated contributions of multiple agencies in addressing the situation of internal displacement. The following example discusses a program designed to achieve synergy in inter-agency work with displaced persons in the Sudan. AN INTEGRATED ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION PROGRAMME ON BEHALF OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS: [SUDAN] In order to improve programming for the internally displaced in the Sudan, in coordination with other UN agencies and NGOs, the UN Humanitarian Coordination Unit in Khartoum created a six-person team of IDP Coordinators, deployed in five locations. The team, assembled in 1997, neither managed separate programs nor attempted formal coordination of other agency operations. Rather, through collaborative efforts at information gathering, analysis and assistance in field coordination, the IDP program attempted to improve work in seven issue areas: /g183/g32Garnering a better profile of displacement through data collection and analysis /g183/g32Assisting in field coordination among UN agencies, NGOs and government /g183/g32Improving access for humanitarian assistance, and promoting humanitarian principles /g183/g32Assisting government authorities in protection of the internally displaced /g183/g32Ensuring that the displaced are involved in relief planning and implementation /g183/g32Improving relations between displaced and host communities /g183/g32Supporting self-reliance for displaced communities To gain local knowledge, cultural awareness and communications skills, Sudanese nationals were recruited to serve as coordi nators. However, recognizing that local officers might be susceptible to political pressure, international officers backed up the team through short-term field assignments[...].

Just as important, the experience of displacement is likely to affect the social relationship between genders. Recognition of this reality is a core element of sound field practice. The G uiding Principles reflect recognition of the gender aspects of displacement in several articles. Principle 4 refers to female heads of households, as well as mothers of young children, as among those \"Entitled to protection and assistance required by their condition and to treatment which takes into account their special needs.\" Principle 7 notes that affected persons, \"particularly women,\" should be involved in decisions on relocation. Principle 11 prohibits gender-specific violence. Article 20 notes that women and men should have equal right to obtain identity documents, the loss of which often are a hindrance to displaced persons. Article 23, recognizing that women and girls may be denied education because of displaced status, encourages \"special efforts\" by the authorities and international organizations for their participation in educational programs. The example below notes the value to the displaced community of seeking women's preference in food commodity provided to displaced persons. INCORPORATING COMMUNITY PREFERENCES AND THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF WOMEN INTO RELIEF FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO DISPLACED COMMUNITIES : [AZERBAIJAN] In Azerbaijan, the World Food Programme (WFP) provides food assistance to a large percentage of the estimated half million internally displaced. After discussions with displaced community leaders, WFP has modified the composition of the food ration to alternative -- equally nutritious and comparably priced -- commodities, based on the community's stated preferences. For example, a simple change in the pulse allotment from green peas to white beans, as requested by the community, boosted community morale and retained some element of community control over its diet.

Beyond the physical deprivation they may face, the process of displacement itself may be particularly disruptive to normal development during the formative years of life. Although the child can be addressed in a broader context, there may be certain interventions required to cater for children in need of special protection. The best interest of the child must always be a prime consideration in sound programming. Many children have had traumatising experiences because of the conflict, and may have lost an entire childhood. This must be recognised in the overall programming approach. TheGuiding Principles on Internal Displacement note, in Principle 4, that children are among those categories of displaced persons that \"Shall be entitled to protection and assistance required by their condition and to treatment which takes into account their special needs.\" Principle 11 prohibits forced labor of children. Principle 13 notes the right of children to avoid recruitment into armed forces. And other provisions note the special condition or requirements of children among displaced populations. The following example describes an initiative to address the special needs of displaced children -- in this case for vaccinations -- in the midst of the conflict in Sri Lanka. DAYS OF TRANQUILITY: UNICEF has negotiated, for the past four years, annual days of tranquility -- several days when the guns fall silent on all sides -- for nation-wide immunization campaigns in Sri Lanka. These efforts, requiring complex negotiations with all parties to the conflict, have maintained high levels of coverage for vaccine- preventable diseases in Sri Lanka, despite the long conflict and shifting conflict zones.

Identification of community leaders among the displaced, for example, is an important task, as is the development of displaced community profiles, focusing on vulnerable groups and other important sub-groups. However, the confidentiality of displaced persons must also be respected, especially in conditions where conflict or other violence may put the displaced at particular risk. Confidentiality of community leaders may be especially important, as singling them out as leaders may put them at special risk of being targeted by parties to a conflict. Certain records maintained by international organizations - on allegations of human rights violations or complaints emanating from the displaced; on the location of displaced community leaders; on the schedule for assessment visits prior to possible return - may need to be maintained in secure locations or in a confidential manner. Organizations with special expertise in documentation in high risk environments, such as the ICRC, UNHCR, or the OHCHR may be consulted on issues related to confidentiality vis-\u00e0-vis internally displaced persons. EXAMPLE: \"MAPPING\" URBAN AND PERI-URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS TO IDENTIFY AND ACCESS CONCENTRATIONS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS [PERU]: During Peru's long internal conflict in the 1980s and 1990s, many of the estimated 600 thousand internally displaced fled to urban shantytowns around Lima and other major cities. Some groups of displaced settled with others from the same home locale, while others dispersed in vast squatter communities. Fearful of being singled out as deserters from self-defense forces or as traitors, many did not readily identify themselves or their origins, some going so far as to destroy their personal identity cards in a quest for anonymity. To target resources to the neediest communities, international NGOs working in Peru were required to conduct community surveys and interviews - with sensitivity to the legitimate security concerns of individuals - to map concentrations of internally displaced persons in urban areas.444 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons II-1At the end of this session, you will be At the end of this session, you will be able toable to /g108Describe the \"general principles\" of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and principles related to humanitarian assistance /g108Explain how the Guiding Principles have a foundation in international human rights and humanitarian law, as well as humanitarian principles /g108Describe how the Guiding Principles (1) re-state existing law, (2) explain in greater detail sections of existing law, and (3) fill in gaps in existing law /g108Explain how the Guiding Principles can be used to advocate on behalf of internally displaced personsCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 445 II-2Principle 1Principle 1 /g108Internally displaced persons shall enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country....446 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons II-3Categories of conflictCategories of conflict /g108Tensions and civil disturbances, or disasters where human rights law is applicable /g108Non-international armed conflicts governed by some of the most central principles of humanitarian law and by many human rights guarantees /g108International armed conflict between two or more states and including wars of national liberationCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 447 II-4NonNon--derogablederogable rightsrights /g108Those rights that can never be suspended -The right to life -Freedom from torture and cruel and inhumane treatment or punishment -Freedom from enslavement or servitude -Freedom of thought, conscience and religion -Prohibition of retroactive application of penal law448 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons II-5Principle 12 (1)Principle 12 (1) /g108Everyone human being has the right to liberty and security of person.

Yet, the internally displaced often face particular circumstances that require focused analysis and well-designed program interventions to meet their needs and ensure their rights are protected. /g183/g32In response to the serious problem of internal displacement, the international community has developed a collaborative approach to guide its work vis-\u00e0-vis internally displaced persons. The collaborative approach requires that the capabilities of many international organizations, working together, be combined to address situations of internal displacement in a coordinated fashion. /g183/g32For you and your agency to assist internally displaced communities, you must understand the basic collaboration mechanisms that have evolved, and how to fit your efforts within a coordinated effort. /g183/g32You must also know what additional assets are available within the international community that you can draw upon to assist your efforts at the country level. Show Slide 3.1 Module III Objectives Make the following points about what is included in this session: /g183/g32To achieve this goal, Module III provides the following information: /g216/g32First, this module describes the key institutions within the international community with responsibilities to address internal displacement and how they fit together to achieve collaboration.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 457Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Page III-4 Activities on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Introduction to Module III (Continued) /g216/g32Second, the module outlines the central role of the resident coordinator (RC) or humanitarian coordinator (HC) at the country level in coordinating the role of the UN Country Team to deal effectively with internal displacement. /g216/g32Third, the module presents the two basic options available to the RC/HC to manage displacement crises at the country level, and explores the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The Collaborative Model and Its Key Institutions (20 minutes) Present the following information about the collaborative model and its key institutions: /g183/g32It is, first and foremost, the responsibility of national authorities both to ensure protection for and provide assistance to the displaced and those at risk of displacement. /g183/g32However, governments may not have the capacity to meet the needs of their displaced populations, or they may lack the will to do so. In such cases, the internally displaced have no alternative but to turn to the international community for help. /g183/g32Over the past few years, UN agencies and partner organizations have strengthened their capacities to address the needs of IDPs. /g183/g32Assistance and protection have been provided to such persons as a vulnerable population within the mandates of the UN agencies or, in the case of UNHCR, on a case-by-case extension of its refugee mandate. However, no agency has a global comprehensive mandate to assist and protect IDPs. /g183/g32The scale and the multi-faceted nature of displacement crises have led the international community to recognise that an effective and comprehensive response to the protection and assistance needs of displaced persons necessitates a collaborative approach.458 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Page III-5 Activities on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide The Collaborative Model and Its Key Institutions (Continued) /g183/g32Thus, the management model for assistance and protection in situations of internal displacement, rather than a single agency approach, is one that involves government officials, UN agencies, international organisations, and international and local NGOs. /g183/g32Such a collaborative approach implies a significant coordination role for the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group (IASC-WG). /g183/g32It requires the RC/HC to undertake an important assessment and task coordination role within the country setting; and further means the involvement of UN agencies and other international and national organisations, based on their areas of comparative advantage.

The analysis of and response to internal displacement within Appeal documents can be enhanced....Careful reading of the CAs suggests a disconnect between the frequent references to internally displaced persons as program beneficiaries and the relatively limited program initiatives, beyond traditional humanitarian aid, actually targeted to the displaced.\" /g183/g32The central role of the RC/HC is described in more detail in the IASC-WG's \"Operational Guidance to Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators.\" /g183/g32Let's review and see if critical responsibilities are addressed in this document. Give participants time to review the document. /g34Ask the following questions: What would you add? What problems do you foresee in your country in implementing this guidance? 470 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Page III-17 Activities on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide The Two Basic Options The RC/HC Has for Managing a Situation of Internal Displacement (5 minutes) Present the following information on the basic options of the RC/HC: /g183/g32As noted above, the IASC-WG \"Operational Guidance to Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators\" notes that s/he: \"Recommends to the ERC a division of tasks and responsibilities among agencies. S/he may also recommend to the ERC, in consultation with the UN Country Team, a 'lead agency' to assume responsibility for internally displaced persons in that country.\" /g183/g32If the RC/HC recommends the first option and determines to manage the UN response to internal displacement from within the Country Team (assuming ERC concurrence), s/he creates and supervises an in-country internal displacement task force; allocates responsibilities for assistance and protection among agencies with relevant expertise; and leads the Country Team in developing an integrated plan for responding to assistance and protection needs. /g183/g32If the RC/HC recommends the second option and determines to appoint a lead agency, that agency and its country director would assume responsibility for the UN's response to the needs of internally displaced persons. /g183/g32Under those circumstances, as outlined in the IASC-WG \"Operational Guidance to Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators, \" the lead agency would assume the coordination, task allocation, and integrated planning responsibilities otherwise taken on by the RC/HC. /g183/g32In some country situations, a coordinated effort by all relevant UN agencies may make the most sense to address internal displacement. In other situations, special competencies of individual agencies may argue for a lead agency to address the overall displacement situation.

In such cases, the internally displaced have no alternative but to turn to the international community for help. /g183/g32Over the past few years, UN agencies and partner organizations have strengthened their capacities to address the needs of IDPs. /g183/g32Assistance and protection have been provided to such persons as a vulnerable population within the mandates of the UN agencies or, in the case of UNHCR, on a case-by-case extension of its refugee mandate. However, no agency has a global comprehensive mandate to assist and protect IDPs. /g183/g32The scale and the multi-faceted nature of displacement crises have led the international community to recognise that an effective and comprehensive response to the protection and assistance needs of displaced persons necessitates a collaborative approach. /g183/g32Thus, the management model for assistance and protection in situations of internal displacement, rather than a single agency approach, is one that involves government officials, UN agencies, international organisations, and international and local NGOs. /g183/g32Such a collaborative approach implies a significant coordination role for the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group (IASC-WG). /g183/g32It requires the RC/HC to undertake an important assessment and task coordination role within the country setting; and further means the involvement of UN agencies and other international and national organisations, based on their areas of comparative advantage. 474 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-3 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide The Collaborative Model and Its Key Institutions (Continued) The Emergency Relief Coordinator: In ter-Agency Focal Point on IDPs /g183/g32The UN Secretary-General has designated the ERC as the focal point at headquarters level for the inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons. /g183/g32This responsibility includes: /g216/g32Global advocacy on both assistance and protection requirements; /g216/g32Resource mobilisation and the identification of gaps in resources for internally displaced persons; /g216/g32Promotion of the establishment of a database and global information on internally displaced persons in consultation with external institutions, including monitoring and issuance of periodic situation reports; and /g216/g32Support to the field on related humanitarian issues, including negotiation of access to internally displaced persons. /g183/g32As chair of the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the ERC ensures that appropriate arrangements are set up with regard to protection and assistance in specific situations of internal displacement.

The Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) /g183/g32At the global level the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC ), chaired by the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), is a primary mechanism for inter-agency coordination. /g183/g32The IASC facilitates inter-agency decision making in response to complex emergencies primarily by developing and agreeing on system-wide humanitarian policies; allocating responsibilities among agencies in humanitarian programs; advocating common humanitarian principles to parties outside the IASC; identifying areas where gaps in mandates or lack of operational capacity exist; and building consensus between humanitarian agencies on system-wide humanitarian issues. /g183/g32The IASC is formed by the Executive Heads of the following agencies : Full members OCHA UNICEF UNHCR UNDP FAOWFP WHOStanding invitation International Committee of the Red Cross International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies International Organization for Migration Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response INTERACTION International Council of Voluntary Agencies Representative of the Secretary General on IDPs Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights World Bank /g183/g32TheIASC-WG , formed by senior representatives of the same agencies, meets four to six times a year. 478 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-7 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide The Collaborative Model and Its Key Institutions (Continued) /g183/g32Its responsibilities include formulating the agenda for IASC meetings; making non- strategic policy and operational decisions; endorsing the yearly work plan; and preparing options and recommendations for the IASC on strategic policy and major operational issues. /g183/g32The IASC-WG also acts as the inter-agency forum for consultations on all aspects related to Internally Displaced Persons. The UN Resident/Humanitar ian Coordinator (RC/HC) /g183/g32At the field level, the UN Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) is, in full consultation with the inter-agency Country Team, responsible for the strategic coordination of assistance to internally displaced persons. /g183/g32This includes ensuring that humanitarian requirements before, during and after an emergency are adequately addressed, and advocating for assistance and protection. The Humanitarian Coordinator is accountable to the ERC.

At headquarters level, the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) , as chairman of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), is the focal point for the inter-agency coordination of protection/assistance to IDPs. 1.2. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee2 (IASC) is the inter-agency forum for consultations on all matters regarding IDPs. 1.3. At the field level, the Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC)3 is responsible for the strategic coordination of assistance to and protection of IDPs, in full consultation with the UN Country Team. In particular: /g167/g32The RC/HC ensures that humanitarian needs are met, taking into account the contribution of all relevant partners on the ground. /g167/g32The RC/HC recommends to the ERC a division of tasks and responsibilities among agencies. He/she may also recommend to the ERC, in consultation with the UN Country Team, a lead agency to assume responsibility for IDPs. /g167/g32The RC/HC serves as an advocate for protection/assistance to IDPs. 2.Coordination Mechanisms at the Outset of a IDP-Crisis 3.1. The RC/HC reports to the ERC on any evolving situation of internal displacement. The ERC shares relevant information with the IASC. 3.2. The ERC recommends to the IASC the appointment of a senior official responsible for the UN's response to the needs of the IDPs. This official will normally be the RC/HC or, when deemed appropriate, the Country Director of a lead agency for IDPs. 1The Operational Guidance is based on Section III and Section IV of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy on Protection of Internally Displaced Persons, endorsed on 6 December 1999. 2 The IASC mechanism consists of the Committee at the level of heads of agencies, its Working Gro up, and Reference Groups for specif ic issues. 3 The term Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) is used to reflect the fact that in most countries in crisis t he two functions are carried out by one official. In countries where the Secretary-General has designated an overall lead agency for humanitarian action, the Country Director of that agency takes is the responsible and accountable official. In those countries where the RC and HC functions are separate, responsibility for activities related to internally displaced persons is vested in the HC.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 481Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-10 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Operational Guidance to Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators (Continued) 3.3. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, initiates consultations with the UN Country Team and other international organisations and establishes in-country task forces on IDPs. 3.4. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency in consultation with the UN Resident Coordinator, conducts consultations with national and local authorities to assess the willingness and capacity of the government to respond to the crisis and to fulfil its obligations with regard to protection/assistance in situations of internal displacement and in order to establish a joint understanding of the measures required to respond to the crisis. 3.5. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, takes into account the availability of expertise related to the protection of IDPs from the OHCHR, the ICRC and agencies with a special experience or responsibility in protection matters. 3.6. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, leads the Country Team in developing an integrated plan for responding to the assistance/protection needs of IDPs, ensuring that such plan takes account of the policy guidance provided in the IASC Policy Paper on Protection of IDPs. 3.7. In developing the integrated plan on IDPs the RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, may call upon the ERC to send an expert mission to assist with the process. 3.8. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, presents the integrated plan on IDPs to the ERC, and through him/her to the IASC. The ERC reviews the proposed plan and recommends it to the IASC. 3.9. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, may encourage the development of Memoranda of Understanding or other institutional arrangements between key partners (governmental, non-governmental and international organisations) in the humanitarian response to displacement situations in order to clarify roles and responsibilities.482 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-11 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Operational Guidance to Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators (Continued) 3. Coordination Mechanism s in Ongoing IDP-Crises 3.1. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, supervises the in-country task forces on IDPs, ensuring that the Country Team maintains an integrated plan on IDPs that is updated according to the evolution of the crisis. 3.2. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, reports regularly to the ERC on the situation of IDPs, with input from the UN Country Team and other international organisations, highlighting gaps and other problems in assistance and protection measures, as well as lack of access or resources. 3.3. The RC/HC, or the IDP lead agency, also advises the ERC on possibilities for the Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons 4 (RSG) to intervene with national authorities in the country in question and with the international community in support of protection/assistance to the IDPs. 3.4. The ERC reviews the reports from the field and shares relevant information with the IASC in order to provide support and address problems, e.g. through inter-agency consultations, negotiations of access, advocacy with donors. 3.5. Where required the ERC, in consultation with the RC/HC or the IDP lead agency and with IASC agencies, field's expert missions in order to review the coordination needs on the ground and determine adequate measures in support of the RC/HC and the Country Team. 3.6. The ERC keeps the IASC regularly informed on situations of internal displacement by providing detailed updated accounts on the institutional arrangements for the provision of protection/assistance in each affected country. 3.7. The IASC reviews country arrangements with regard to IDPs and monitors the follow-up to field visits by the ERC, inter-agency missions or country-visits of the RSG. 4 The Representative of the Secretary-General on IDPs is a member of the IASC.

OCHA Mission Statement To mobilize and coordinate the collective effo rts of the internation al community, in particular those of the UN system, to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies. This involves reduc ing vulnerability, promoting solutions to root causes and facilitating the smooth transition from relief and rehabilitation and development. OCHA is part of the United Nations Secretariat and has the mandate to coordinate the provision of humanitarian assistance (particularly that of the UN system) in complex emergencies and natural disasters. Where a humanitarian crisis goes beyond the mandate or capacity of a single agency, OCHA works to ensure a rapid and effective response by all parties involved - including governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies. As a non-operational organization, OCHA may be viewed by some as more impartial and more objective than operational agencies whose primary concern is with their own particular field. Secondly, due to its strong links with the political, peacekeeping and human rights components of the UN, OCHA is well-placed to promote a holistic, integrated approach to complex crises and to peace-building, reconstruction and longer term development 486 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-15 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide At field level OCHA supports the coordination role of the RC/HC through its Field Coordination Units (FCU). In support of the Resident/ Humanitarian Coordinator, the FCU's responsibilities include liaising regularly with government counterparts, NGOs and UN Agencies on humanitarian programs and related requirements; analyzing and disseminating information on the humanitarian situation, including on access, to humanitarian partner and donors; planning, facilitating and monitoring the Consolidated Appeal (CAP); organizing field assessments to affected areas for the UN, NGOs, governments and donors, and ensuring appropriate follow-up; and supporting UN Agencies' efforts to build institutional capacity at national and local levels for adequate response to and management of humanitarian crises and disasters. Outline of Capacities (Continued) UN Development Programme (UNDP) Although UNDP manages a wide range of programs in furtherance of its broad goal \"to support all national and international efforts to achieve sustainable human development for the world's peoples\" it also plays a role in humanitarian emergencies. The Emergency Response Division of UNDP is responsible for coordinating such UNDP assistance. UNDP plays a significant role in the transition from relief to development, helping prepare the foundation for coherent recovery programs. In the post crisis-environment, UNDP helps to develop programs for rehabilitation. UNDP's work also includes building national government's capacity to prepare for, mitigate, manage, and respond to crisis. In performing these functions, UNDP supports the efforts of transitional authorities, governments and special interests, as well as donors and the relief and development community. UNDP also contains the UN Volunteers Programme. UNV is mandated to assist the UN system in collaboration with various UN agencies. Originally focusing just on development support, and thus coming under the auspices of UNDP, UNV in recent years has also given special attention to providing experienced volunteer specialist professionals to work in relief operations, including within governments of developing countries, UN agencies and NGOs. UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 487Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-16 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide UNHCR is mandated to lead and coordinate international assistance and protection for refugees. UNHCR's primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees - i.e. people who have fled their country due to a well-founded fear of persecution. In some cases UNHCR also undertakes assistance programs for internally displaced persons. As UNHCR's mission statement puts it, 'UNHCR is mandated by the United Nations to lead and co-ordinate international action for the world-wide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems.' Recognising that in many situations the plight, the needs and the causes of displacement of internally displaced persons are closely related to those of refugees or returnees and that it is not possible to resolve refugee problems without addressing simultaneously the issue of internal displacement, UNHCR has increasingly undertaken activities on behalf of the internally displaced as part of a comprehensive approach to address coerced population movements. Outline of Capacities (Continued) UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) UNICEF is mandated to advocate and work for the protection of children's rights, to help the young meet their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. In this it is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. UNICEF works to ensure special protection for the most disadvantaged children - victims of war (including child soldiers), disasters, extreme poverty, all forms of violence and exploitation, and those with disabilities. In emergencies, UNICEF's Office of Emergency Programmes is the focal point for emergency assistance, humanitarian polices, staff security and support to UNICEF offices in the field, as well as strategic coordination with humanitarian partners both within and outside the UN system. World Food Programme (WFP) WFP provides food to sustain victims of emergencies and disasters, to improve the nutrition of the most vulnerable people, and to promote the self-reliance of poor people and communities. WFP's dual relief and development mandate allows it to play a major role in the continuum from emergency relief to rehabilitation and development, where priority is given to disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation, as well as post-conflict rehabilitation activities. WFP's large-scale food aid operations has led it to develop a highly specialized and cost-effective logistics capability, including conventional surface and air transport, as well as barge and airdrop operations. In complex emergencies WFP plays an important role in the coordination of food aid and 488 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-17 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide logistics, through the collection and dissemination of information on global food aid deliveries and requirements and through in-country coordination structures. WFP also has a high level of expertise in the area of emergency telecommunication, in particular \"deep-field\" connectivity, and may in certain situation be in a position to address the telecommunications needs of other UN agencies in-country. World Health Organization (WHO) WHO is essentially a development organization, but one that may play an important role in emergency situations. The WHO Division of Emergency and Humanitarian Action is responsible for assisting in the coordination of the international response to complex emergencies and natural disasters in the health field, in close cooperation with other agencies. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 489Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-18 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Outline of Capacities (Continued) In this context, WHO provides expert advice on epidemiological surveillance, control of communicable diseases, public health information and health emergency training. Other emergency relief activities include the fielding of emergency assessment missions, organizational support for health emergency coordination, provision of specialized drugs and medical supplies, and stockpiling and standardizing specialized emergency health supplies. WHO's emergency preparedness activities include policy-making and planning, awareness-building, and the dissemination of technical advice, focusing particularly on training activities in the health sector. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) FAO is mandated to raise levels of nutrition and standards of living, to improve agricultural productivity, and to better the condition of rural populations. The organization works to alleviate poverty and hunger by promoting agricultural development, improved nutrition and the pursuit of food security - i.e. the access of all people at all times to the food they need for an active and healthy life. In addition to its development programs, FAO also plays a major role in dealing with food and agricultural emergencies. In relief operations, it focuses on the provision of agricultural inputs, such as seeds, farming tools, and emergency veterinary services. This involves working closely with relevant NGOs, and in some countries with UNICEF. Furthermore, the organization operates an early warning system for famine that assesses shortfalls in food production. It also conducts joint assessments with WFP in countries of concern to assess food security and food assistance needs. The Office of the High Co mmi ssioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) OHCHR has a field presence in several situations of internal displacement, which in a number of cases has specific responsibilities relating to promoting and protecting the rights of internally displaced persons. In addition to human rights monitoring, OHCHR can contribute to addressing protection needs of internally displaced persons through technical cooperation activities such as supporting the strengthening of judiciary and the creation and effective functioning of national institutions for promoting and protecting human rights, programmes of human rights education, providing training in human rights, and capacity-building for local non-governmental organisations. 490 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-19 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Outline of Capacities (Continued) Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) A Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) is sometimes appointed by the UN Secretary-General to act on his behalf in emergencies which are \"complex or of exceptional magnitude\" (as set out in the Standard Directives for SRSGs). In practice, the appointment of an SRSG is normally reserved for those complex emergencies which require UN involvement in major political negotiations and/or when UN peacekeeping forces are deployed. When an SRSG is appointed, he/she is recognized as having overall authority with regard to UN operations in the designated country. If heading a peacekeeping operation, the SRSG reports to the Secretary-General through the USG for Peacekeeping Operations or, if heading a political mission, through the USG for Political Affairs. At the same time the Humanitarian Coordinator is recognized as having the sole mandate for coordination of humanitarian assessment/ response, under the SRSG's strategic lead. The SRSG recognizes that mandate by ensuring that all concerned agencies and NGOs deal with his office through the HC. HCs report in parallel to the SRSG and the ERC: in particular to the SRSG on the day-to-day functioning of operational coordination, but remaining accountable to the ERC for coordination, programming and policy in relation to humanitarian assistance. This relationship was redefined in this way in April 1999 because of the inherent tension between two potentially conflicting policy goals where there are political and humanitarian elements of UN involvement in an emergency (and therefore between the SRSG and HC in a particular country or region). These policy goals are the need for the UN to achieve a substantially greater level of strategic coordination between political and assistance elements of its response to crises (illustrated by lessons learned from such operations as Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia and the former Zaire), balanced with the UN's mandate to deliver humanitarian assistance on the fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality and neutrality - i.e. to respond to victims of armed conflict solely on the basis of need. (*See Note of Guidance on Relations between Representatives of the Emergency Relief Coordinator and Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, April 1999). In certain circumstances the Secretary-General may appoint a Special Envoy , who would have a similar political mandate to that of a SRSG (but who would not head a peacekeeping mission). A Special Envoy is sometimes deployed for a specific mission or to address a particular issue (e.g. in the Great Lakes region, to participate in peace negotiations for the Democratic Republic of Congo). Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 491Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-20 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Outline of Capacities (Continued) UN Peacekeeping Operations UN peacekeeping forces can play important roles regarding humanitarian assistance. One is the provision of security, including for relief convoys. While this is sometimes controversial, (and some relief agencies contend that armed escorts often tend to draw fire more than they deter or protect from it), in some situations it may simply be impossible to operate without such protection. Peacekeeping forces can also provide major logistics support to relief efforts, especially in terms of truck and air transport. On the downside there is often an inherent tension between humanitarian and military operations due to their different objectives, roles, responsibilities and operating styles. This may be attributed to a basic lack of understanding between two essentially different cultures. In some situations this tension may be alleviated through the establishment of a Civil-Military Operations Center (CMOC). The CMOC is staffed with military and civilian personnel, and works in support of the Resident/ Humanitarian Coordinator. UN humanitarian coordination staff may also help to resolve such misunderstanding - for example by convening coordination meetings where humanitarian and military staff can work out issues of common concern, or by incorporating military liaison officers into the humanitarian coordination structures. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) International NGOs are private, non-profit organizations that operate in more than one country. Most have their headquarters in Western countries, although an increasing number are based in developing countries. Some NGOs are mandated exclusively for the provision of humanitarian relief (e.g. Medecins Sans Frontieres), whilst others normally have development-oriented programs (e.g. Care International, Oxfam, Save the Children Fund) but will become involved in humanitarian relief operations when a crisis occurs. The humanitarian relief component of major international NGOs is in part funded by private sources, and donor governments may use them to channel large amounts of humanitarian assistance. Some international NGOs also receive funding via UN agencies, as implementing partners of the UN agency in question. NGOs' participation in the UN inter-agency consolidated appeals process is crucial, as it allow collaborative programming to be undertaken within the large humanitarian community. Local NGOs operate only in their country of origin, and may have a wide range of programs, often with a development perspective. These organizations may act as implementing partner with international NGOs, and may be funded and supported by them (and in some cases by international donors). 492 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-21 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Outline of Capacities (Continued) Inter-Governmental Organizations Inter-governmental organizations are ones that exist outside the UN system, and which have executive boards composed of national governments. One important example is the International Organization for Migration (IOM). IOM assists with resettlement of IDPs Another important example of an inter-governmental organization is the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). ECHO has the task of administering humanitarian aid on behalf of the European Union (the biggest donor of humanitarian aid in the world) to non-European Union countries. This aid goes to victims of both man-made crises and natural disasters. In carrying out this task, ECHO works in collaboration with more than 170 organizations worldwide - including OCHA, UN agencies such as UNICEF, WFP and UNHCR, as well as the Red Cross family and NGOs dedicated to humanitarian causes. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), based in Switzerland, is the founding institution of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. This Movement includes three branches: ICRC, the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (National Societies), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). All three branches have distinct tasks: ICRC ICRC's mandate is to operate in areas of armed conflict and internal disturbance. It originally focused mainly on protection work, such as promotion among the conflicting parties of the various Geneva Conventions and Protocols, regarding such matters as the treatment of civilians and prisoners of war. In recent years, the provision of assistance in complex emergencies has become a very large component as well, especially inside conflict zones (and on both sides of conflict lines). National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies National Societies operate in more than 160 countries around the world (using the Red Crescent symbol in Islamic countries). These Societies act as auxiliaries to the public authorities in their own countries. They provide a range of services from disaster relief, health and social assistance to first aid courses. During wartime, National Societies may support the army medical services Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 493Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: The Institutional Framework for Activities Page III-22 on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Outline of Capacities (Continued) International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies The Federation (or IFRC) works around the world to support the actions of the various National Societies. It assists with coordination of international assistance provided via the Red Cross Movement to victims of natural disasters, and to victims of manmade disasters outside of conflict areas (where ICRC takes the lead). Donor Governments The great majority of international assistance is provided via donor governments. Some of these resources may be provided multilaterally (via the UN system) while others are channeled bilaterally or though other organizations such as the NGOs or the ICRC. While UN agencies will, of course, maintain their own direct donor contacts, meetings between the UN agencies as a group and with the main donors are generally arranged via the Resident/ Humanitarian Coordinator. Dialogue with donors in-country also takes the form of individual meetings, and of visits by donor representatives to field sites. The Office of the Resident/ Humanitarian Coordinator should encourage and facilitate such field visits, including providing support if needed. 494 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons III-1At the end of this session, you will be At the end of this session, you will be able toable to /g108Describe the collaborative model the international community has developed for working with internally displaced persons /g108Describe how key individuals and institutions within the UN system and in the larger international community can assist in meeting the needs of internally displaced persons at the country level /g108Explain the key role of the Resident Coordinator/ Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) in coordinating efforts of UN Country Team on behalf of the internally displaced /g108Describe the two basic options the RC/HC has for managing a situation of internal displacement: (1) allocation of responsibilities among the country team and (2) designation of a lead agency Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 495 III-2Emergency Relief CoordinatorEmergency Relief Coordinator /g108Global advocacy /g108Resource mobilization /g108Promotion of the establishment of a database and global information on internally displaced persons in consultation with external institutions /g108Support to the field on related humanitarian issues496 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons III-3Representative of the SecretaryRepresentative of the Secretary -- General of the UNGeneral of the UN /g108Monitors internal displacement worldwide /g108Undertakes country missions, /g108Establishes dialogues with governments, /g108Collaborates with intergovernmental, regional and non- governmental organisations, /g108Makes recommendations to improve international and regional institutional arrangements, /g108Assesses international legal protection, and /g108Publishes reports for action by Governments, the Commission, General Assembly, internationalorganisations and non-governmental organisationsCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 497 III-4Office for the Coordination of Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian AffairsHumanitarian Affairs /g108OCHA has appointed a Special Coordinator on Internal Displacement /g108OCHA may make available Field Coordination Support Units that can assist in the management of internal displacement emergencies498 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons III-5The Senior NetworkThe Senior Network /g108Reinforce operational response and coordination arrangements in critical crises of internal displacement by assessing field operations and recommending follow-up action as appropriate, by UN Country Teams and agency headquarters, as well as the wider humanitarian community on the groundCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 499 III-6InterInter--Agency Standing Agency Standing CommitteeCommittee /g108Facilitates inter-agency decision making in response to complex emergencies primarily by -Developing and agreeing on system-wide humanitarian policies;

Show Slide 4-2 Four Fundamental Considerations /g183/g32At the same time, you should keep in mind four fundamental considerations: /g216/g32First, while international agencies may contribute considerable analytical and program capacity in support of the internally displaced, the views of the displaced themselves, or those threatened with displacement, should be given maximum weight. In situations of conflict or human rights violations, the process for eliciting those views should be undertaken with great sensitivity, in order to avoid increasing the risk for individuals or communities. /g216/g32Second, since activities on behalf of the displaced undertaken during conflictive or threatening conditions may increase the risk facing the displaced and humanitarian agencies alike, interventions should be undertaken in full consultation with all partner agencies, within and outside the UN Country Team. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 509Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-5 Facilitator Guide Introduction to Module IV (Continued) /g216/g32Third, while recognizing that governments or other relevant authorities may not fully assist displaced individuals, international organizations should avoid the temptation to \"go it alone.\" International organizations should strive to engage such authorities in developing solutions, making efforts when appropriate to build national capacity to deal with issues of internal displacement. /g216/g32Fourth, although the approaches outlined in the following modules are addressed to all international organizations operating in countries affected by displacement, such organizations should recognize the special mandates and expertise of partner agencies. Especially when addressing protection issues, the special roles of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and other specialized agencies should be given due weight during consultations and program design. Introduction to Prevention Strategies (10 minutes) Make the following points about prevention strategies: /g183/g32The Representative of the Secretary-General has noted of the internally displaced that they \"nearly always suffer from severe deprivation, hardship and discrimination.\" Since these conditions frequently accompany the condition of displacement, it is desirable -- as a general rule -- that displacement should be avoided when possible. /g183/g32In addition, displaced persons often struggle for many years to cope with their losses during displacement and to regain self-sufficiency. Efforts to assist the recovery of their previous standard of living are expensive and complex, and success in not guaranteed. The greater part of this module, consequently, focuses on the rights of persons under international law to remain in their place of residence, and on what international organizations can do to assist them in avoiding displacement. 510 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-6 Facilitator Guide Introduction to Prevention Strategies (Continued) /g183/g32This module also addresses, in summary form, the work that agencies can undertake to prepare for internal displacement, with the goal of moderating the hardships of displacement. /g183/g32A very strong caveat , however, is that there may be situations when prevention activities should not be undertaken by international agencies. /g183/g32These situations occur when individuals or communities at risk of displacement make a conscious choice that fleeing -- either across an international boundary or within their own country -- is their safest and best alternative. Ask participants to turn to Principles 2-2, 1-1, and 14 of the Guiding Principles and ask a volunteer to read them. /g183/g32You will note that the internally displaced have a right to seek asylum if that strategy makes most sense to them. By extension of this Principle, and in light of the general guarantees embodied in Principle 1-1 and Principle 14 of the Guiding Principles, individuals and communities have the right to flee their residences when this appears to be in their interest. /g183/g32One final note before we begin: Since we have limited time for training, most of the discussion in this module speaks to the proximate, or immediate, causes of internal displacement and short-term interventions to prevent it. /g183/g32Clearly, however, there are strong links between long-term, ongoing problems of scarcity, inequality, and institutional weakness in a society, on the one hand, and the risk of conflict, human rights abuses, and displacement, on the other. /g183/g32The UN Development Programme's (UNDP's) Human Development Report , in noting this link, points out that the main cause of \"complex humanitarian emergencies,\" is inequality between groups in terms of participation, economic assets, and social conditions.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 511Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-7 Facilitator Guide Introduction to Prevention Strategies (Continued) /g183/g32It is essential that international organizations keep in mind strategies to address long-term inequality, even as they design strategies to meet immediate concerns of the internally displaced. The article \"Long Term Strategies\" beginning on page IV-2 in your Participant Guide provides important additional information on this topic. What the Guiding Principles Have to Say about Protection from Displacement (5 minutes) Make the following points about what the Guiding Principles say about protection from displacement: /g183/g32Guiding Principles numbers 5 through 9 offer a framework for the protection of persons from involuntary displacement. /g183/g32These principles are organized around two broad themes: (1) the prevention of displacement -- the rights of individuals to be protected against arbitrary displacement and the responsibilities of governments and other authorities to prevent such displacement; and (2) procedures to minimize the adverse effects of displacement when such movements take place. Show Slide 4-3 Prevention of Displacement /g183/g32Those principles that address prevention of displacement are especially interesting in that they speak both to the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of authorities. Among the key elements are: /g216/g32Authorities and international actors must respect their obligations under international law so as to avoid conditions that might lead to displacement. /g216/g32All human beings have the right to be protected from arbitrary displacement, whether from attempts to alter the composition of an area's population, from armed conflict (with limited exceptions), from development projects, in cases of disasters, or as a result of collective punishment. 512 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-8 Facilitator Guide What the Guiding Principles Have to Say about Protection from Displacement (Continued) /g216/g32When displacement is compelled by authorities, it will last no longer than necessary. /g216/g32Prior to displacement compelled by authorities, those authorities will consider alternatives to displacement. Show Slide 4-4 Minimizing the Adverse Effects of Displacement /g183/g32Those principles that address minimizing the adverse effects of displacement include the following key elements: /g216/g32If displacement is undertaken by authorities, it shall occur under proper conditions; shall avoid family separation; shall be accomplished with proper legal guarantees, review, and remedies; shall be accompanied by adequate information to the displaced, seeking their consent; and, shall involve the displaced in the move.

Show Slide 4-5 Prevent and Minimize Effects of Displacement Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32Please turn to page 19 in the publication Handbook for Applying the Guiding Principles . /g183/g32Individually, examine the ten action steps suggested there. /g183/g32Then indicate -- based on your knowledge and experience -- those you consider practical (indicate \"P\") or not practical (indicate \"N\"). For those you consider practical, also list whether you and your agency could undertake the recommended activity with your current level of knowledge (indicate \"OK\") or whether you would require more training (indicate \"T\") in order to attempt this task. /g183/g32Tabulate \"votes\" at your table group, posting your tallies on chart paper. Debrief the activity by asking table groups to report results to the large group. Exploring the Strategies for Preventing Displacement (10 minutes) Explore the first two strategies for preventing displacement recommended on page 19 of the Handbook for Applying the Guiding Principles, making the following points: /g183/g32The first recommended action step relates to data collection . To note increases in risk or vulnerability, agencies must be able to analyze data and compare new data against a baseline that represents a pre-crisis or more normal situation.514 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-10 Facilitator Guide Exploring the Strategies for Preventing Displacement (Continued) /g183/g32Several existing databases hold baseline and analytical information on internally displaced persons. The most comprehensive effort to gather such information is the database maintain by the Norwegian Refugee Council for the IASC. /g183/g32The content of this database should help agencies in a country setting to determine data requirements when planning their programs. /g183/g32Let's now go to the monitors in the room and take a look at that database now. (http//www.db.idpproject.org/ ) Review data sets for two selected nations. /g183/g32An important aspect of data collection on displacement situations is the need to disaggregate data by important subgroups. This task is essential to support recommended activity #4 on page 19: \"Identifying groups with special needs\" among the displaced. /g183/g32Accurate data are especially required for women and children among displaced populations, since they constitute the majority of displaced persons and often suffer disproportionately the consequences of displacement. Displaced women are vulnerable to threats to physical security, in particular sexual violence and harassment. Displaced children are susceptible to poverty, neglect of schooling, sexual violence, forced recruitment, or denial of assistance. /g183/g32Other vulnerable groups among the displaced include the elderly, handicapped or disabled, people with AIDS or other chronic diseases, members of political opposition groups, minority ethnic groups, and others. /g183/g32Of special note, the Guiding Principles (Principle 9) notes that \"States are under a particular obligation to protect against the displacement of indigenous peoples, minorities, peasants, pastoralists, and other groups with a special dependency on and attachment to their lands.\" Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 515Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-11 Facilitator Guide Exploring the Strategies for Preventing Displacement (Continued) Show Slide 4-6 Escalation Indicators /g183/g32Returning to the list on page 19 of the Handbook for Applying the Guiding Principles , suggested action step #2, \"early warning systems,\" may be especially important.

As data collection systems are designed, they should be structured to provide baseline information and data capture systems that will facilitate monitoring and evaluation of interventions on behalf of internally displaced populations, should displacement occur. Show Slide 4-9 Contingency Planning /g183/g32Contingency planning prior to internal displacement serves as the foundation for sound program design. A useful contingency plan -- which we will discuss in more detail in a few minutes - includes the following: 520 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module IV: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-16 Facilitator Guide Preparedness for Internal Displacement (Continued) /g216/g32Basic country information; /g216/g32Likely scenarios about how, when and where displacement will occur, to serve as the basis for planning assumptions; /g216/g32Policies and objectives of international organizations; /g216/g32An organizational plan to structure the response to the displacement crisis among responding agencies; /g216/g32Sectoral plans to provide guidance on program design; and, /g216/g32Informational annexes. /g183/g32Building response and protection capacity prior to the crisis is essential if the immediate needs of potentially large numbers of malnourished, sick, exhausted and/or traumatized displaced persons are to be met in a timely fashion. /g183/g32Building staff capacity to manage response -- both response to assistance needs and protection needs -- and stockpiling commodities, communications equipment, and other critical supplies are essential. /g183/g32Developing information and communications systems and networks is a fourth critical element in preparedness for displacement crises. Questions that must be answered include: What will be the mechanism for information sharing among agencies, and with the internally displaced themselves? Does the international humanitarian community have access to radio and other essential communications media? /g183/g32Developing the resource base requires analysis of where the displaced might flee to and whether they will be supported by host populations; what national government or local NGO capacities are available to support the internally displaced; what resources the displaced have been able to salvage prior to or during their flight; and what agency or donor assets (financial or commodity) are immediately available.

These instruments include: /g183/g32Universal Declaration of Human Rights /g183/g32International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights /g183/g32International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights /g183/g32The Convention on the Rights of the Child /g183/g32The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women /g183/g32The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination The instruments state that all citizens of the world have many rights. These include the right to an adequate standard of living, participation in government, recognition before the law, gainful employment, education, adequate nutrition, property ownership, security, personal and social development, and a clean environment. These rights, however, are far from being realized for a large percentage of the world's population, especially women and children. Long-term sustainable development works toward the actualization of these rights and forms the cornerstone for both crisis prevention and recovery from crisis. Initiatives for long-term prevention are often given high profile only after a crisis, when the need for stabilization is urgent and conditions are favorable for change. However, in view of the serious negative effects of internal displacement, actors should place more emphasis on the use of long-term strategies as tools to avert crises altogether. Developmental activities should also coexist with relief and rehabilitation assistance. Relief programs should be designed to lay the foundation for development while development-oriented programs should be planned during the emergency phase. This approach promotes a coordinated strategy for prevention that permits uninterrupted involvement of development actors in conflict or natural disaster areas. Development actors are already on the ground when a crisis unfolds and have much to offer in terms of early warning analysis and knowledge of cultural and traditional perspectives on human rights. They can identify local actors in protection and potential points of intervention. They can ensure the continuity and relevance of long term goals. 524 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-3 Participant Guide Long Term Strategies (Continued) The challenge to development and relief organizations is to design and implement programs and projects which both acknowledge and actualize rights to equitable development. \"Operationalizing\" the rights requires both an understanding of the human rights conditions and specific targeted actions to address the conditions. These approaches are needed to strengthen all systems - international, national, provincial and community. Targeted sectors are listed below with specific activities suggested to address legal, political, social and economic problems and inequities. These activities can significantly reduce the impact of conditions that may lead to internal displacement. They may be undertaken through a coordinated effort of governments, NGOs and other civil groups and with support of international technical and financial assistance. Supporting human rights institutions and training Governments should develop a plan of action to strengthen national human rights institutions such as ombudsman's offices and non -governmental groups such as research and training institutes. A comprehensive approach may include: 1. Effective and accessible mechanisms for resolution of conflicts between and among citizens and the government. Citizens must know how to access government offices and how they can file complaints without fear of retaliation. This education is best placed close to home where officials are known and trusted. 2. Full participation of the country in international human rights systems through the ratification of international treaties, training of government staff in reporting mechanisms, media coverage and public statements listing the human rights obligations of government institutions, civil servants, police and military, and participation in regional and international human rights conferences. 3. Human rights education for the military, law enforcement officials, civil society groups and NGOs, and incorporation of human rights curricula in primary, secondary and post-secondary education Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 525Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-4 Participant Guide Long Term Strategies (Continued) Strengthening legislative capacity A strong legal framework under a national constitution is needed to protect human rights, encourage the free and open development of governing institutions, and promote restitution for people who have suffered violations of their rights. Laws should be brought into conformity with standards identified in UN and regional human rights instruments. Review and reform activities should cover penal and criminal codes and regulations, laws regarding protection for minorities and women, laws affecting freedom of expression and association, immigration and nationality laws, laws relating to judiciary and legal practice, and, importantly, laws relating to security, such as special procedures which derogate from international human rights standards. For example, there must be justification for such measures as \"administrative detention\" or martial law. Strengthening tenure security All persons should possess security of tenure which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats. Provision of legal land titles is vital, particularly to protect indigenous groups or others with a dependency on land, such as pastoralists, peasants and minorities. During crisis situations, traditional land ownership mechanisms may become ineffective, legal ownership may be de-legitimized, or property may have been destroyed or put to other use. Vulnerable persons may find their ownership rights in question, or IDPs may return home to find their land expropriated and their property rights vacated. In addition, legislation and supporting procedures should be in place for property restitution when return is not possible. Lack of workable laws may result in tensions and conflict leading to further displacement. Removal of occupants from the homes of returning IDPs must be carried out in accordance with human rights standards. 526 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-5 Participant Guide Long Term Strategies (Continued) Strengthening national electoral systems While elections do not guarantee good governance, they are a major tool for promoting representation. Actors should support the implementation of elections and work to create conditions that promote fair elections. The systems should: /g183/g32Assure the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country either directly or through freely chosen representatives /g183/g32Assure equal access to public service, including elective public service /g183/g32Provide for periodic and genuine elections /g183/g32Guarantee universal and equal suffrage and secrecy of the ballot /g183/g32Secure an electoral atmosphere that is free of intimidation ELECTORAL SUPPORT SERVICES A study of the election processes in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Cambodia, Angola and Mozambique showed that international electoral assistance should focus on supporting political performances of local actors and building on national electoral capacities. UNDP and UNV can tailor assistance programs for election support. They can include material support, advisory services, funding for voter registration and media relations training programs. UNV helped with the actual balloting in Yemen, which held its first elections since the civil war in 1997. UNV can recruit personnel with experience in managing elections from a wide range of countries. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has developed a number of publication relating to human rights and elections. ( http://www.unhchr.ch) . Promoting administration of justice To be effective, justice systems must recognize and protect the rights of the individual, be accessible to all, and be impartial and politically independent. If a nation's justice systems are weak or corrupt, it may be difficult to achieve judicial reconciliation for citizens who have been victims of human rights violations. Security and justice systems should provide human rights training for judges, magistrates, lawyers, police, and prison officials and all who administer justice. Justice systems should streamline court operations, while promoting due process, and make their functions and staff accessible to the public. Violations of due process must be addressed, such as torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, secret detention, and deprivation of adequate legal representation. Court proceedings must be transparent except when confidentiality is necessary in order to protect individual rights as appropriate within the law.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 527Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-6 Participant Guide Long Term Strategies (Continued) To increase access to justice, the judicial infrastructure must be adequate at the community level. Traditional and local systems of justice should be utilized where they support human rights and be included in development programs and training to promote international standards. Civil society can be instrumental in integrating traditional or indigenous dispute resolution mechanisms into the formal system. (Roles of international systems of justice are described in Module 2.) Enhancing public security To have confidence in their government's protective capacity, citizens must feel secure and have freedom of movement. Programs to improve public security include: /g183/g32Defining the role of the military \u2014If the military controls internal security, a reduction in its role may be needed to further good governance. Negative aspects of military sectors can be minimiz ed by conversion of military assets to productive sector assets, training civil servants on security matters, military-to-military dialogs to establish legitimate mandates, and improving defense budgeting practices. /g183/g32Training civilian police forces \u2014Police should operate independently of the military. Training of police should include provision of information regarding international human rights law and domestic law relating to the legal rights of accused persons, methods of arrest and questioning, the prohibition of torture and the obtaining of forced confessions, and rules for the proper use of firearms. Judicial reforms must go hand-in-hand with and support police reforms. NGOs and the media can support public education programs to ensure that the public understands any new methods of policing. /g183/g32Small arms and light weapons control \u2014 Weapons control programs can include strengthening national, regional and international mechanisms to regulate the manufacture, transit and transfer of weapons; weapons collection and destruction mechanisms and disarmament programs; and public information and advocacy against small arms and support to ensure compliance with humanitarian law. /g183/g32Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former troops \u2014Disarmament of demobilized soldiers must be combined with other programs of weapons control. The ex-soldiers should be given initial support packages, skills training, and education to promote their reintegration and prevent their transfer into crime or mercenary activities. 528 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-7 Participant Guide Long Term Strategies (Continued) /g183/g32Mine clearance \u2014The presence of land mines acts as a major obstacle to the resumption of normal economic activities. External assistance can help to pay the high costs of de-mining and can help create a national capacity to carry out clearance operations. Community-based mine awareness programs are essential components of a long-term program. Promoting economic and social development Programs that promote economic and social development of individuals and societies form the foundation for peace and security and create confidence in national capacities. Key programs are those which strengthen infrastructure for provision of basic services, such as water and sanitation, and those which provide social safety nets, such as government support for the most vulnerable groups. Other priority program options include: Macro-economic reform \u2014 National programs may need strengthening to promote sustainable livelihoods and reduction in poverty and inequality. These include programs to revise fiscal and budgetary policies, control inflation, regulate taxation and foreign exchange, and promote investment and trade. These programs should avoid threatening livelihoods or essential social safety nets and services. For countries emerging from conflict, conditions for economic reform are usually stipulated in a peace agreement. Agricultural development \u2014Agricultural development contributes to self-sufficiency in food production and is an important source of employment. FAO's agricultural emergency and development activities are designed to reduce vulnerability by promoting strategies for improved nutritional security such as crop and livestock diversification, improved rangeland and water management, soil conservation, improved coastal fishing practices, pest and disease control measures and nutritional education. Equitable land policy is important in promoting equal access to agricultural and natural resources. Environmental protection \u2014Environmental protection programs promote good land use practices, conservation of natural resources, and preservation of biological diversity. They protect the environment and population against the effects of natural and human-made hazards. They can help to create mechanisms by which states and local cultures interact in decision-making for sustainable and equitable use of resources. Education and training \u2014Programs to improve knowledge and skills can significantly reduce a population's vulnerability. Education programs in schools and communities are strategic tools for building a culture of tolerance and generating awareness of human rights.

Sustainable livelihoods promotion \u2014Unemployment may increase dramatically if government economic policies are weak, during periods of structural adjustment, or conflict and disasters, or when demobilized combatants are reintegrated. Development of sustainable livelihoods can help to avert social tensions and conflict. Measures may include training and job creation, expansion of the private and informal sectors, and credit schemes. Constraints to long term prevention The development of long term preventive strategies is a work-in-progress for all actors. No ready-made solutions exist\u2014particularly for conflict-prone societies\u2014and elaboration of best practices is on-going. Constraints (and possible responses from actors to overcome them) include: Limited time and resources for prevention -Hindsight often governs the planning process, and foresight is limited by available time and resources. But if preventive measures are weak, recovery is often prolonged. The longer it takes a society to recover from a crisis, the more its citizens come to depend on resources and support from external sources\u2014resources that will eventually be withdrawn. This makes it more difficult for them to regain local self-sufficiency. Several years are usually required to effect political, social and economic changes in order to avoid relapse into crisis. Meanwhile, funds generally decrease or run out before recovery is complete. International resources for long-term development have been dwindling over the past 20 years. At the same time, donor response to emergencies is often generous, motivated by public outcry. Unfortunately, these donors may earmark their contributions without regard for the need for prevention. Thus far, development actors have been only marginally successful in making the case for the cost effectiveness of preventive development. There has been insufficient attention to gather and disseminate lessons learned and to develop joint guidelines for prevention and mitigation measures. Possible responses from actors : /g183/g32State clearly during the planning phases of programs that there will be a focus on addressing inequities and assisting the most vulnerable in all development activities. Write appeals to incorporate human rights language or humanitarian principles /g183/g32Address the need for prioritization of response in terms of who is at greatest risk in the short, medium and long term. Use worst case scenarios to determine protection strategies. Develop and use lessons learned to support strategic interventions. 530 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-9 Participant Guide Long Term Strategies (Continued) /g183/g32Identify strategies for informing donors about inequities and shifting their focus from immediate relief needs to long term projects that will reduce vulnerability. Substantiate time periods for recovery that are realistic and will provide needed stability. Lack of access to developmental resources - A society's ability to develop individual potential depends to some degree on having resources such as education and training, political processes, and infrastructure that offers protection and security. Vulnerable people who must be at the center of the development process often lack understanding of their basic rights and the means to access these resources. Possible responses : /g183/g32Identify persons or groups with the least access to programs and security. Determine ways to support them without increasing tensions in the community. /g183/g32Coordinate with implementation partners and share methods for human rights education and increasing security. /g183/g32Seek creative and practical ways to address problems of access to resources getting input from vulnerable persons on means to address inequities and security problems. Need for development alternatives - Individuals depend on states to protect them; assistance agencies work through central governments. However, situations of collapsed states such as in Somalia and Afghanistan have revealed the tremendous capacities of community and civil groups to mobilize prevention and development initiatives. Development actors need the flexibility to take advantage of all local opportunities and resources to enhance prevention. They need to have a variety of methods which enable them to successfully confront human rights abuses and work around possible interference. Possible responses : /g183/g32Identify effective local organizations and determine how they can be supported without endangering them. /g183/g32Collect priorities from persons under threat or who fear future insecurity. What ideas do they have to promote cooperation and coordination? /g183/g32Determine what types of programs are most acceptable to authorities. How might such programs be utilized or expanded to address inequities? How can actors avoid antagonizing authorities without sacrificing human rights principles? /g183/g32Form alliances to increase the political power or protection and security of informal networks. What other individuals or groups will lend support to such networks?

Weak Coordination - Coordinated efforts for preparedness and response have improved significantly in recent years, as partnerships have developed and multi-actor plans have been initiated. However, coordination for preventive development is not as widespread. Cooperative development most often occurs in the context of post-disaster actions rather than as preventive actions. Actors tend to pursue their own objectives in a non-crisis situation, working through their own channels and bureaucracies. Actors may not be aware of their actual or potential role in prevention. Possible responses : /g183/g32Create a working group to focus specifically on issues of inequity and human rights standards. /g183/g32Select a leader in the development of collaborative programs and projects to address inequities and risk factors. /g183/g32Develop arguments to convince organizations and people that pursuing objectives related to the prevention of protection problems serves their own best interests. Training questions 1. When long term needs seem so overwhelming, how can actors prioritize actions for prevention? 2. How can actors ensure that focus on long-term solutions is maintained during the pre- crisis, crisis and post-crisis phases? 3. How can you sensitize donors to the importance of prevention and protection issues? How might they be informed about the realities, in terms of inequities and vulnerabilities, faced by people in their every day lives in their communities? 532 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module III: Preventing, or Preparing for, Internal Displacement Page IV-11 Participant Guide Sample Outline for Sectoral Components of a Contingency Plan 1.

Internal Displacement Page V-3 Facilitator Guide Introduction to Module V (5 minutes) Show Slide 5.1 Module Objectives. Make the following points about what is included in this session: /g183/g32As we have discussed earlier, the circumstances and conditions of internal displacement can vary substantially, and the range of difficulties that the internally displaced may face is also very broad. /g183/g32Given this diversity, and different circumstances in different country contexts, what does it mean to offer \"protection\" to the internally displaced? /g183/g32In the simplest sense, from the dictionary, to protect is \"to keep from harm.\" Yet, the international community has many options to keep individuals from harm. When, where, on what basis, and how should the internally displaced be kept from what categories of harm? /g183/g32Module V explores these issues from the perspective of the protections delineated in the Guiding Principles , from the perspective of analytical tools developed by the High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and from the perspective of field practice: what agency staff like you are actually doing in the field when confronted with the need to offer protection. /g183/g32The objective of Module V is to provide the tools for you to analyze protection needs in your country context and, drawing upon current policies and examples, design a protection program that will make practical sense vis-\u00e0-vis the internally displaced persons with whom you are working. /g183/g32This session builds on the paper Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper . That document, found at page V-2 in the Participant Guide, is the definitive statement of policy, within the United Nations system, on protection.

(15 minutes) Ask the group to define 'protection'. /g183/g32Let's begin with a definition of protection. In your view, what does protection mean for internally displaced persons while they are actually displaced? /g183/g32As you respond, I will list the possible definitions on this flip chart. Try to make your definition as comprehensive as possible. Encourage participants to think in terms of what the goal or elements of protection are. Challenge participants to think not only of physical protection, but also how protection is also relevant to the assistance side of humanitarian work. You will also want participants to be inclusive in terms of the bodies of law they refer to (human rights, humanitarian and refugee law) and the partners, which should be included in doing protection work within this broader understanding of the term. Tell the participants that you will come back to the definition, but that you will first make a brief presentation on the overall approach to protection. Make the following points about the overall approach to protection. /g183/g32In the past, the international response to internal displacement has tended to focus on providing assistance, with less attention given to protection concerns. /g183/g32In recent years, there has been a growing awareness within the international community of the connections between protection and assistance. /g183/g32As a result, a number of important initiatives have been taken in this direction. Nevertheless, the meaning of protection at a general level, and for internally displaced persons in particular, is yet to be fully conceptualised. /g183/g32The following definition was adopted in 1999 after three years of deliberations at workshops organised by the ICRC on protection. 550 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-5 Facilitator Guide What Is 'Protection'? (Continued) Show Slide 5-2 Definition of Protection \"The concept of protection encompasses all activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the righ ts of the individual in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the relevant bodies of law (i.e. human rights law, international humanitarian law, and refugee law).\" /g183/g32It is important to understand that this definition encompasses civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. /g183/g32This definition is comprehensive in scope, both in terms of the legal framework for protection, (\"full respect\"), and in terms of the strategies and methods by which protection may be achieved (\"all activities\"). It is also comprehensive in that it recognises all bodies of law relevant to the protection of internally displaced persons. /g183/g32Although there is growing recognition among humanitarian and development agencies of their responsibilities in the area of protection, including to internally displaced persons, there remains a need to give practical meaning to such commitment. /g183/g32Traditionally, humanitarian and development agencies lacking an explicit protection mandate have tended to conceive of protection for internally displaced persons as falling outside the scope of their work. Their protection role has been limited to the extent that the provision of assistance does in itself constitute a form of protection. /g183/g32The traditional work of humanitarian and development agencies is, indeed, inherently rights-based and the distinction between protection and assistance is complex. However, human rights protection cannot be done by halves; it involves the assurance of the whole set of rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

(Continued) /g183/g32By saying that protection is an all-encompassing concept, we are not suggesting that all organisations become legal experts and start defending and visiting prisoners, or start drafting legislation on the protection of internally displaced persons. However, what we are saying is that the Country Team must have a clear vision and strategy for making sure that all areas of protection outlined in the Guiding Principles are addressed. /g183/g32Protection is difficult to impleme nt, particularly where displacement is inflicted as part of a deliberate policy, and where national authorities are unwilling to discharge their responsibilities toward their displaced populace. /g183/g32It is important to bear in mind, however, that although protection and human rights activities cannot in themselves cause the disappearance of oppression and violence, they highlight the fact that human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law are illegal and unacceptable, and thus play an important role in diminishing their occurrence. Protecting the Rights of Displaced Persons (10 minutes) Make the following points about what can be done in practical terms to help protect the rights of displaced persons. Show Slide 5-3 Categories of Protection Activities /g183/g32Let's pull this definition apart a bit more to help understand what we can do in practical terms to help protect the rights of displaced persons. /g183/g32The ICRC 1999 Workshop on Protection identified three categories of protection activities: 552 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-7 Facilitator Guide Protecting the Rights of Displaced Persons (Continued) /g216/g32Environment Building , to include any activity aimed at creating and/or consolidating a global environment conducive to full respect for the rights of individuals; /g216/g32Responsive Action , to include any activity undertaken in the context of an emerging or established pattern of abuse and aimed at prevention and/or alleviating its immediate effects; and /g216/g32Remedial Action , to include any activity aimed at restoring dignified living conditions through rehabilitation, restitution, and reparation.

I want one group to look at each of the following three sets of data: /g216/g32The field practices related to \"Enhancing Protection of Physical Security and Freedom of Movement,\" on pages 37 to 41 /g216/g32The field practices related to \"Protecting Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights\" among the internally displaced, on pages 42 to 49 /g216/g32The field practices related to \"Protecting Rights to Identity and Basic Freedoms,\" on pages 50 to 53. /g183/g32Please read over the examples cited, and discuss among yourselves which of the examples are \"environment building\" activities, which are \"responsive actions,\" and which are \"remedial actions.\" /g183/g32It is likely that there may be some overlap in these examples. But, our objective is to familiarize ourselves with how agencies confronted with concrete problems have attempted to deal with them, and to understand more fully the different approaches to protection activities that have been identified by the ICRC.

The comments are not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive, but to introduce the principles from a protection perspective. It should be reiterated that the Guiding Principles are best understood and practiced as an integral whole. Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32I want you to take about twenty minutes to read the comments on protection during displacement in your Participant Guide. /g183/g32Then, I want you to consider as a group the following questions: /g216/g32Which of these rights are most often protected by the international community, and why? /g216/g32Which of these rights are least often protected by the international community, and why? /g183/g32As you finish reading the comments, please note the three categories of rights you believe are most often addressed, and the three categories of rights least often addressed.556 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-11 Facilitator Guide What the Guiding Principles Say about Protection during Displacement (Continued) /g183/g32I have a tear sheet with the Guiding Principles 10 to 23 listed. As you finish your reading, please walk up to the sheet and place the letter \"F\" next to those three rights frequently protected by the international community and an \"I\" next to those three infrequently protected. Debrief the activity with a discussion of about fifteen minutes. Summarize the main reasons participants give for why certain rights are supported by the international community and why others are not supported. Be prepared to stimulate discussion of reasons. Is lack of protection due to : Lack of mandate? Lack of resources? Lack of training? Physical threat to international organizations? Lack of access or data? Lack of coordination among international agencies? Resistance by local or national authorities? Other reasons? A Planning Framework and Data Resources for Designing Activities during Internal Displacement (10 minutes) Make the following points about designing activities during internal displacement: /g183/g32This section suggests ways in which the standards for protection outlined in the Guiding Principles can be pursued in practice. Although examples of field practice from other country contexts can provide staff with stimulating ideas from existing or prior practice, appropriate interventions must be designed with a clear analysis of local conditions.

Groups at particular risk can be identified through careful study of the profile of displaced persons, the context, and activity analysis /g216/g32How the internally displaced persons themselves can be partners in ensuring protection. Activities analysis and resources analysis can help to identify areas where refugees can create and maintain aspects of their own protection systems /g216/g32How protection and assistance activities can be designed so as to have maximum effect. Activities and resource analysis can point to areas where activities and procedures employed by humanitarian staff can themselves become an impediment to protection. This may be the case, for example, with procedures for registration, food distribution, or issues of leadership and representation within the group. 558 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-13 Facilitator Guide A Planning Framework and Data Resources for Designing Activities during Internal Displacement (Continued) /g183/g32Beginning on page V-42 in your Participant Guide, you will find a very useful paper provided by UNHCR on the POP framework and, specifically, how it can be used to plot a direction for protection interventions on behalf of the internally displaced. /g183/g32The POP paper provided by UNHCR provides concrete checklists on factors to consider when designing an intervention. /g183/g32Let's turn to the \"Physical Security Context Analysis,\" for example.

Two Special Circumstances: Protection in the Emergency Phase of Displacement and Protection in Militarized Contexts (45 minutes) Make the following points about special circumstances: protection in the emergency phase of displacement and protection in militarized contexts: Show Slide 5-7 Two Particularly Demanding Contexts /g183/g32International agencies planning protection activities on behalf of the internally displaced may confront either of two particularly demanding contexts: /g216/g32The emergency phase of displacement, or /g216/g32Displacement in a militarized context. /g183/g32Both of these circumstances require special care and analysis by agency staffs. This section discusses particular considerationsduring emergency displacement or in militarized contexts.

At the height of any forced population movement, human needs are at their greatest and most urgent, while resources are invariably stretched. /g183/g32Given that emergency situations pose particular challenges for protection activities, it is important to consider what objectives should be kept in view, and what strategies may be usefully employed in urgent circumstances. Show Slide 5-8 Characteristics of the Emergency Phase of Displacement /g183/g32The emergency phase of displacement is characterised inter alia by: /g216/g32Rapid population movement, often taking place suddenly /g216/g32Large numbers of persons on the move /g216/g32High percentage of vulnerable groups among the displaced population /g216/g32High percentage of injured or traumatised persons /g216/g32Serious threats to life and physical security: As the internally displaced are still within their country of origin, they may still be within range of the agents of arbitrary displacement. /g216/g32Conditions of overall vulnerability for injured or traumatised persons, or those who have been forcibly separated from family members. 562 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-17 Facilitator Guide Two Special Circumstances: Protection in the Emergency Phase of Displacement and Protection in Militarized Contexts (Continued) Show Slide 5-9 Objectives That Guide Protection Responses during the Emergency Phase of Displacement Make the following points about objectives that should guide protection responses during the emergency phase of displacement: /g183/g32Rapid and secure access: /g216/g32The challenge of obtaining rapid and secure access can be especially daunting in situations of internal displacement. This is because displaced persons often find themselves in close proximity to the agents and causes of forced displacement. /g216/g32In situations of armed conflict where clear centres of national orde facto authorities may be lacking, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain guarantees of safe passage. Nevertheless, humanitarian personnel will often have to use whatever resources are available to negotiate access with de facto or other authorities. /g183/g32Involving displaced persons and empowering them from the outset : /g216/g32Strive to identify persons and groups among the displaced persons who can act as reliable sources of information, as channels of communication, and as partners in humanitarian interventions. /g216/g32It is important to treat the displaced persons with dignity and respect, to solicit their views and advice and to show genuine empathy for their preoccupations. A positive and collaborative approach can help to create a positive atmosphere, which can only enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian work.

This initial assessment will go a long way to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the humanitarian response, and will provide a foundation for longer-term planning. /g216/g32Still, emergency situations require that the assessment process should take place at the same time as attention is being paid to urgent needs .A quick response to obviously urgent needs must never be delayed because a comprehensive assessment has not yet been completed . Priority needs should be addressed with whatever resources are immediately available. /g183/g32Prioritisation of tasks : /g216/g32The following priorities are always key: involve the displaced persons from the start; secure food and food storage facilities; obtain water and water storage capacity; secure emergency shelter, using local materials wherever possible; and establish systems of health care, including preventive and environmental health measures. /g216/g32A holistic, multi-sectoral approach must be a fundamental feature of every emergency response. Issues should not be treated in isolation.564 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-19 Facilitator Guide Two Special Circumstances: Protection in the Emergency Phase of Displacement and Protection in Militarized Contexts (Continued) /g183/g32Ensure protection from forcible movement to situations of danger : /g216/g32This is a prime protection consideration. The displaced population should be made as stable as possible. They should be shielded from the factors that caused their displacement, and from being forced to return to, or to resettle in locations where they may be placed at serious risk. /g216/g32Particular attention should be paid to the fact that threats to the security of displaced persons could emanate from outsiders as well as from groups within their midst. Steps should be taken to ensure that locations in which displaced persons reside are not vulnerable to physical attack. Make the following points about objectives that should guide protection responses during displacement in militarized contexts: /g183/g32This section addresses strategies for supporting the rights of displaced populations when displacement has occurred in militarized environments -- a situation that frequently accompanies internal displacement. /g183/g32Such circumstances require special considerations by representatives of the international community, as well as by the displaced themselves. /g183/g32Internal displacement frequently occurs in circumstances linked to armed conflict. In some situations, the displaced persons and the humanitarian personnel who act on their behalf find themselves in close physical proximity to one or the other party to armed conflict. /g183/g32In such militarised environments, the pursuit of humanitarian and protection objectives often cannot proceed or be effective without some form of cooperative partnership between the humanitarian actors and the military entities. It is imperative, however, that such a partnership should not compromise the non-political and humanitarian nature of protection activities, or affect the impartiality and neutrality of the organisations that seek to carry them out.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 565Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-20 Facilitator Guide Two Special Circumstances: Protection in the Emergency Phase of Displacement and Protection in Militarized Contexts (Continued) Show Slide 5-10 Ensuring That Humanitarian Operations Are Distinguished from Activities of Parties to Armed Conflict /g183/g32The following are some measures that may be implemented to ensure that humanitarian operations are clearly distinguished from activities of parties to armed conflict. /g216/g32Humanitarian personnel and the premises and sites where humanitarian assistance and protection work are being undertaken, as well as vehicles transporting staff or humanitarian assistance, should all be clearly identified through the use of high visibility markings. On no account may they display any markings associated with an armed entity. /g216/g32Assistance activities may be undertaken by military personnel only in exceptional situations, in which case they should be supervised by civilian aid workers to ensure conformity with humanitarian objectives. If military personnel are seconded to humanitarian aid operations, they should not be associated with a party to the armed conflict, and should not use uniforms or other identifying marks that are associated with a party to the armed conflict. /g216/g32Locations where displaced persons reside should not be proximate to military installations of a party to the armed conflict. Areas where the displaced reside should not display any markings that are associated with a party to the armed conflict. /g216/g32In some situations, it may be necessary to deploy armed personnel to protect the physical security of displaced persons and humanitarian personnel.566 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance During Internal Displacement Page V-21 Facilitator Guide Two Special Circumstances: Protection in the Emergency Phase of Displacement and Protection in Militarized Contexts (Continued) /g216/g32Steps should be taken in such situations to ensure: (i) that the armed personnel are committed to the protection of the displaced, and are capable of discharging their functions in an impartial and non-discriminatory manner; (ii) that the armed corps is professional, well equipped and well trained, and are under responsible and accountable command; (iii) that their terms of reference and rules of engagement are clear, and that the displaced persons are informed of these terms and rules; (iv) that the number of such personnel and their circulation among the displaced persons should be kept to the minimum required for them to effectively discharge their functions. /g216/g32Measures should be implemented to ensure that armed elements do not reside in, transit through, or visit areas where displaced persons reside. The displaced population must be made aware of the risks of maintaining close ties with armed groups. /g216/g32Measures should be implemented to ensure that the areas where displaced persons reside are kept free of arms or weapons of any kind. /g216/g32Steps should be taken to ensure that displaced persons do not provide material aid, logistical support, the provision of rest and refreshment facilities, or other kinds of assistance to combatants. Make the following points summarizing the module: /g183/g32As we noted at the beginning of this module, protecting the rights of internally displaced persons is a complex, difficult effort.

They arise not only as a cause of flight, but also during displacement and in the search for durable solutions. In the past, international response has tended to focus on providing assistance, with less attention given to protection concerns. n recent years, there has been a growing awareness within the international community of the connections between protection and assistance. As a result, a number of important initiatives have been taken in this direction. Nevertheless, the meaning of protection at a general level, and for internally displaced persons in particular, is yet to be fully conceptualised. The Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons (RSG on IDPs) and the High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR), looking to enhance their collaborative efforts relating to the protection of internally displaced persons, agreed that it would be useful to prepare a joint policy paper on this subject. A first draft of this paper was presented to the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group (IASC-WG) at its 29 January 1999 meeting. It was suggested that this paper be further developed within the IASC-WG. A one-day inter-agency workshop was organised to review the paper and all IASC members were encouraged to contribute to the paper in order to ensure that it would reflect the views of the IASC as a whole. The objective of the paper is to outline the IASC policy on the protection of internally displaced persons. Section I of the paper examines the nature and content of protection for internally displaced persons. Section II sets out a number of strategic areas of activity for ensuring that these protection responsibilities are discharged effectively. Section IIIcontains a short analysis of the responsibilities for action. Finally, Section IV aims at developing basic principles for allocating responsibilities in specific country situations in the hope of increasing the predictability of response and facilitating the work of the Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators (RC/HC) in addressing gaps. For reference, an outline of the different approaches of agencies to assist in addressing these needs is presented in an Annex. 1 The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement define internally displaced persons as \"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalised violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognised State border.\" 570 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-3 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Flexible strategies for responding to situations of internal displacement will need to vary depending upon the competencies and comparative strengths of the actors and agencies, as well as upon the different contexts in which internal displacement occurs. In particular, strategies for addressing the protection needs of internally displaced persons will differ depending upon how national authorities respond in fulfilling their responsibilities towards the displaced. A number of scenarios are possible. National authorities may be willing to respond to the needs of internally displaced persons and possess the necessary resources, or they may be willing to respond but lack the required resources. In other cases, national authorities may be either passively unwilling to respond to the needs of the displaced, or even be obstructive of international efforts to address those needs. This paper seeks to broadly outline some major elements which together constitute the field of protection in internal displacement situations. It makes no attempt to provide definitive answers to all the complex questions posed by those situations . The paper is part of a growing effort on the part of the international organisations to address more proactively the needs of internally displaced persons, to assess and analyse those needs, and to act when the rights of internally displaced persons are being violated. I - Nature Of Protection Fo r Internally Displaced Persons The concept of protection encompasses all activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of the individual in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the relevant bodies of law (i.e. HR law, IHL, refugee law). 2 For the purpose of this paper we have adopted the above definition used in 1999 Workshop of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Protection. This definition is comprehensive in scope, both in terms of the legal framework for protection, (\"full respect\"), and in terms of the strategies and methods by which protection may be achieved (\"all activities\"). 2 Third Workshop on Protection, Ba ckground paper, ICRC (7 January 1999).Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 571Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-4 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Unlike refugees, internally displaced persons have not crossed an international border. As such, no single international legal instrument is exclusively devoted to their specific protection needs. Internally displaced persons are covered by the laws of their own country, and the State is responsible for assisting and protecting them. Under human rights law, which remains relevant in most cases of internal displacement 3, they are entitled to enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under domestic and international law as the rest of a country's citizens. Whenever internally displaced persons find themselves in a situation of armed conflict, they are also protected by international humanitarian law (IHL). In international armed conflicts this includes in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention and Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions, and in non-international armed conflicts Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and Protocol II thereto. IHL provides important protection for those who have already been uprooted, and, most importantly, against arbitrary displacement. This is done in several ways. First, the rules governing the conduct of hostilities prohibit attacks against civilians and destruction of objects indispensable to their survival, such as crops, livestock and drinking water installations. Second, humanitarian law provides that civilians be treated in a humane manner and protects them from abuses committed by the party under whose power they find themselves. Together, these rules seek to preserve a minimum of safety and a basis for subsistence, both of which are essential to allow persons to remain in their homes, and as guarantees for those who have already been displaced. In addition, humanitarian law contains express prohibitions against arbitrary displacement, and regulates the conditions under which evacuations can be carried out. Accordingly, the implementation of IHL constitutes an important form of protection. Efforts to promote such respect include drawing the attention of the parties to existing humanitarian problems, reminding them of their legal obligations and facilitating contacts between them for the purpose of enhancing the protection of civilians. 3 International human rights law nonetheless allows for derogation of certain guarantees under specific circumstances, including emergency situations. See Internally displaced persons: Compilation and Analysis of Legal Norms, UN Doc. E/CN.4/1996/52/Add.2 (5 December 1995); Internally displaced persons: Compilation and Analysis of Legal Norms, Part II, UN Doc. E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.1 (11 February 1998). Conversely the Convention on the Rights of the Child includes no derogation clause thus it is applicable to all children in all situations. 572 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-5 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Drawing upon the relevant provisions of these standards of international law, and refugee law by analogy, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, published in 1998, represent the first comprehensive attempt to articulate what protection should mean for the internally displaced. The Guiding Principles identify the rights and guarantees relevant to the protection of internally displaced persons in all phases of displacement. They outline standards for protection against arbitrary displacement, protection and assistance during displacement, and for safe return or resettlement and reintegration. Protection as elaborated in the Principles covers not only needs for physical security and safety but also the broad range of rights provided for in international law (including the right to food, to education and to employment, for instance). The Principles, it should be noted, do not seek to create a privileged category of persons or to establish a separate legal status for the internally displaced. Rather, they are based on the assumption that internally displaced persons have the same rights and obligations as other persons living in their own state. At the same time, however, they draw attention to the importance of recognising the particular situation and needs of internally displaced persons. Although not a legally binding document as such, the Principles reflect and are consistent with international human rights and humanitarian law, and refugee law by analogy, which arebinding. Having gained broad consensus, the Principles provide solid guidance on how protection activities should be oriented in order to be effective. Notwithstanding the importance of basing protection on principles of national and international law, it nonetheless is true that the protection of displaced persons \"frequently will depend on non-legal skills and initiatives\" 4. In other words, action is required to translate protection principles into effective protection on the ground. Action should also be focused on the search for durable solutions. For the essence of protection activities is the search for solutions which might ensure or restore rights. 4 Goodwin-Gill, 'The Language of Protection,' International Journal of Refugee Law , Vol. 1, No. 1 (1989), p.17.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 573Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-6 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) II - Strategic Areas For Protection While there is growing recognition among humanitarian and development agencies of their responsibilities in the area of protection, including to internally displaced persons, there remains a need to give practical meaning to such commitment. Traditionally, humanitarian and development agencies lacking an explicit protection mandate have tended to conceive of protection for internally displaced persons as falling outside the scope of their work. Their protection role has been limited to the extent that the provision of assistance does in itself constitute a form of protection. As such, the traditional work of humanitarian and development agencies is, indeed, inherently rights-based and the distinction between protection and assistance is false. However, human rights protection cannot be done by halves, it involves the assurance of the whole set of rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As the High Commissioner for Human Rights has said, it means ensuring \"all human rights for all\". The challenge of strategic programming in situations of internal displacement is therefore to ensure that this \"all\" includes the internally displaced and that \"all\" their rights are respected. The ICRC 1999 Workshop on Protection identified three categories under which different types of protection activities could be grouped: (i.) Environment Building , to include any activity aimed at creating and/or consolidating a global environment conducive to full respect for the rights of individuals; (ii.) Responsive Action , to include any activity undertaken in the context of an emerging or established pattern of abuse and aimed at prevention and/or alleviating its immediate effects; and (iii.) Remedial Action , to include any activity aimed at restoring dignified living conditions through rehabilitation, restitution, reparation. This typology helps explain the broadly defined meaning of protection. It is also useful for a clearer identification of the roles and collaborative arrangements in a comprehensive strategy for the protection of internally displaced persons. Following this outline, a number of strategic areas relevant to protection work in situations of internal displacement have been identified. 574 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-7 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Environment Building Dissemination and Promotion of the Guiding Principles: In its decision of 26 March 1998, the IASC encouraged member organisations to bring the Guiding Principles to the attention of their Executive Boards and to share them with their staff, especially those in the field. Since then, the Principles have been largely integrated into institutional policies and programmes. OCHA has published them as a booklet in various languages (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese). Translations also exist in Azerbaijani, Georgian (undertaken by local NGOs with the support of UNHCR) and Greek (undertaken by Amnesty International). In addition, a French translation of the Compilation and Analysis of Legal Norms 5 on which the Principles are based is planned. Yet, the effectiveness of the Principles as a protection tool depends on the extent to which they are respected by the various concerned actors, including the international community. The IASC, in its above-cited decision, has encouraged its members to apply the Principles in their activities. The Principles should be used by the agencies as a benchmark against which to assess assistance and/or protection activities in their areas of responsibility. An integrated country team approach should be adopted when applying the Principles at field level, the responsibility for which would fall to the RC/HC at field level, in cooperation with the IASC-WG. Advocacy: The main aim of advocacy is to give victims a voice and ensure that humanitarian issues and concerns are taken into account. Active and assertive advocacy for the rights of internally displaced persons can be an essential component of protection efforts. Greater awareness of the rights of internally displaced persons as well as of their condition and needs, must be promoted with national leaders, international organisations, the media, donors and parties to conflicts. 5 UN Doc. E/CN.4/1996/52/Add.2. Due to the length of the document, UN Conference Services could not provide translation of the document into the other official languages of the UN. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 575Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-8 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Where violations of relevant international provisions, as spelled out in the Guiding Principles, occur, field staff of UN agencies, NGOs and international organisations should ensure that the information is communicated to officials and/or institutions that are in a position to act upon it. These include the RC/HC, the OHCHR, the ICRC or other UN Agencies with a special expertise or responsibility in this field .In turn, these mandated actors should make representations directly to the competent authorities or other parties with influence over the territory where violations are occurring, including: UN Peacekeeping Forces, UN Police monitoring units, and bilateral or regional military contingents assisting with peacekeeping. When undertaking advocacy efforts, the situation must be carefully examined to determine what type of advocacy will be most effective and what are the possible points of entry. The safety and security of field staff must also be kept in mind. Common stands by human rights, humanitarian and development agencies can be particularly effective. At the same time they reduce the risks related to agencies acting separately or alone. Effective advocacy has to be done locally. Nevertheless, as a matter of course, information on internally displaced persons should be brought to the attention of the officials and/or institutions, at headquarters level, who are specifically mandated to engage in advocacy for the protection of internally displaced persons. In particular, the ERC's function enables him to effectively use mechanisms such as addressing the Security Council and contributing to the Secretary-General's reports to the ECOSOC and the General Assembly to draw the attention of the international community to such protection problems. Furthermore, the ERC and the HCHR, in their function as members of the Secretary-General's Executive Committees, are in a strong position to promote an active and concerted response from within the UN system to such problems as they evolve. The regular reports of the RSG on IDPs to the Commission on Human Rights, as well as his contacts during official country visits, provide additional platforms for high-level advocacy. 576 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-9 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Engaging non-state actors: With internal armed conflict constituting one of the main cause of internal displacement, strategies for engaging not only Government authorities but also other parties to the conflict in the protection of the internally displaced need to be developed. It is important that efforts at engaging non-state actors be linked to the dissemination, training and advocacy activities outlined in this paper. Such efforts should be integrated in the overall coordination efforts under the leadership of the RC/HC and should take fully into account on-going activities of other international organisation to avoid ineffective duplications. Dialogue with non-state actors should retain a strictly humanitarian character. Prevention of displacement, early warning and awareness: \"Today's human rights abuses are tomorrow's refugees and internally displaced \" 6. Sustained attention should be given to prevention activities, so-called preventive protection , to diminish the risk of displacement. In particular, activities to address root causes of conflict, and the mitigation of violations and abuses are required. A protection perspective and a displacement risk assessment should be integrated into all aspects of early warning analysis of countries and communities in crisis. Supporting early warning initiatives within the humanitarian sphere can strengthen the capacity and ability to anticipate and mitigate situations causing internal displacement. Therefore, field staff of UN agencies, NGOs and international organisations as well as local authorities should be encouraged to provide information on impending situations of internal displacement and communicate it to the RC/HC and other Agencies with a special expertise or responsibility at field level. In turn, these mandated actors, would be responsible for informing the IASC-WG, the ERC and the RSG on IDPs. Making populations at risk aware of their rights can serve as a preventive measure. Through human rights training, awareness campaigns, and advocacy with local leaders, communities can be empowered to protect themselves and reclaim their rights. In particular, local organisations and the internally displaced persons themselves should play an active role in providing information on imminent situations of internal displacement. 6 UNHCR, \"The World's Refugees: In Search of Solutions\", Oxford University Press, 1995.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 577Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-10 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Establishing an international humanitarian presence among internally displaced persons is often an important step towards ensuring their protection. Experience in this field suggests that in certain circumstances, the presence of expatriates \"watching and listening\" has, at times, been found to deter, or at least mitigate, human rights violations. Preparedness: To be effective, early warning capacity needs to be linked to timely and decisive response mechanisms on both the national and international level. Periodic review by the IASC-WG of situations identified as possibly leading to mass displacement could make an important contribution to ensuring appropriate contingency planning including technical cooperation with the authorities. Furthermore, the Country Team should be responsible for ensuring that the emergency pipelines are capable of meeting anticipated needs. Activities such as the pre-positioning of staff, transport, shelter, material and food and medical supplies should be ensured in impending situations of internal displacement. Strengthening local and national protection capacity: It is essential to assist the authorities in discharging their responsibility to internally displaced persons and to strengthen the national capacity, not only for emergency response but also for human rights protection. Such assistance is especially effective where the State experiencing displacement is willing but not able to discharge its protection responsibilities. The assistance may take the form of technical cooperation and advisory services programmes as well as programmes for good governance. Training: An integrated training programme on the protection, assistance and reintegration of internally displaced persons is essential for international staff, national authorities and non-State actors, local organisations and all other relevant actors. In line with its terms of reference, the IASC-WG has set out to develop a set of distinct yet complementary training modules on internal displacement. The primary target audience of the training modules will be middle-level management and field programme staff of UN agencies, NGOs and other international organisations. These modules, which will consist of adaptable teaching kits, can be adjusted to fit wider audiences. It is envisaged that a number of critical principles on the RC/HC's role vis-\u00e0-vis internally displaced persons will be distilled from the modules and fed into the RC/HC training program at the UN Staff College. 578 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-11 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Complementing the training package are other publications providing guidance on programming field activities and implementing the Guiding Principles. These include: the Manual on Field Practice in Internal Displacement, prepared by an IASC reference group under the direction of UNICEF; and a Field Handbook on the Guiding Principles, prepared by the Brookings Institution Project on Internal Displacement. These tools will enhance the ability of actors in the field to respond to crises of internal displacement in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The IASC-WG will also need to bring the training material to the attention of UN peacekeepers and civilian police who increasingly are undertaking activities of direct relevance to internally displaced persons. Operational Response and Remedial Action Vulnerability Assessment: An assessment of vulnerabilities and needs should always include protection. Surveys and assessment tools should analyse the protection requirements of internally displaced persons in a specific and systematic manner. The Guiding Principles are a valuable reference point for identifying the rights of the internally displaced, and for assessing the extent to which their protection needs are being addressed. Where these needs are particularly acute, the undertaking of specific needs assessment should be considered. Coordinated Programming of Assistance : Country teams, in formulating their Consolidated Appeals should ensure that the protection needs of internally displaced persons are addressed in the joint programming process. Further to its Terms of Reference, the IASC-WG is to ensure that the needs of the internally displaced are systematically taken into account in resource mobilisation processes. The IASC has recommended that the activities of agencies having a more specific protection mandate, such as the UNHCR, OHCHR and UNICEF, should be highlighted in the Appeals. To this end, the IASC-WG decided that the Sub-working group on the Consolidated Appeals Process should prepare improved guidelines aimed at helping Country Teams in drafting effective appeals. The IASC-WG should ensure that the improved guidelines include directions on how programming can systematically address the protection needs resulting from internal displacements. In addition Appeals should also embody programmes to address the need for durable solutions. On the basis of needs assessments, and where appropriate, resource mobilisation efforts should earmark funds specifically for addressing these needs. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 579Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-12 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Promoting protection in the design of assistance programmes: While the primary responsibility to provide protection rests with the competent authorities, humanitarian agencies have responsibilities of their own to ensure that protection features are integrated in their programmes and operations. A number of agencies have devised specific guidelines in this regard (e.g. prevention of sexual exploitation in camp situations, protection against child recruitment through schooling, integrating mine-awareness in assistance programmes, linking data collection for documentation and tracing with registration for relief assistance, etc .). Agencies should review their assistance programmes to avoid potential negative effects on protection as well as strengthen programme features that could positively effect protection. Agencies providing assistance should consult with other expert or mandated agencies operating in the country, to determine how their assistance programs could be strengthened to afford protection of basic rights. In setting out a programme Agencies should also take into account on-going activities of other international organizations to avoid all duplications. Supporting community-based protection: Community structures can be an important source of protection in situations of displacement. The needs of the internally displaced should be addressed within a broader humanitarian strategy which takes into account the needs of all segments of the population and in particular those of the host-community. \"Practical protection ,\" UNHCR has observed, \" is provided first of all by and through the local community, through a complex social network including family, clan, village or tribe. \" 7 Local coping mechanisms are particularly important in the absence of an effective government. Displaced communities should be involved, as the Guiding Principles affirm, in decisions taken on the design of programmes addressing their needs, and about their return or resettlement. Activities that encourage the maintenance or restoration of communal links or promote the integration of the displaced into the surrounding community can contribute to their security. In emergency situations, high priority should be given to efforts aimed at reuniting families, creating support structures for unaccompanied children, and enabling displaced persons to remain with or rejoin members of their clan, tribe or village. 7 UNHCR, \"Protection Aspects of UNHCR Activities on Behalf of Internally Displaced Persons,\" EC/SCP787 (Geneva, 17 August 1994), p. 26. 580 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-13 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Over the longer term, activities that strengthen civil society and facilitate conflict resolution and reconciliation among different cultural, ethnic and religious groups can contribute to the protection of displaced persons. They can also lead to the identification of durable solutions, in particular through the creation of conditions for the eventual safe return and reintegration, or resettlement and integration of internally displaced persons Protection strategies for women, children and other vulnerable groups: Humanitarian agencies must ensure that gender and child-related aspects of displacement are considered in the planning and programming of operations. Displacement tends to alter the structure of families and households and to change gender roles. Women play a central role in reducing the vulnerability of entire communities to the effects of displacement. Their participation in the design of protection strategies is essential. The continued study of gender relations and how these have been affected by displacement must be encouraged. This could be achieved by the routine compiling of gender-specific information in assessments. With regard to the specific protection needs of children and in particular of unaccompanied minors and child soldiers, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which outlines the non-derogable rights applicable to children should be examined as a basis for advocacy and programming on behalf of internally displaced children. More attention should also be paid to the specific needs of other vulnerable groups such as the elderly and the handicapped. Promoting protection in the design of return/reintegration or resettlement/integration programmes : Protection activities must work towards durable solutions. For the displaced this entails a voluntary and secure return or resettlement. Internally displaced persons are particularly vulnerable to involuntary return/resettlement and to a lack of safety in the areas of return/resettlement. Additional problems often relate to the restitution of land and property rights. Humanitarian and development agencies need to work together to ensure that their programmes are designed to specifically tackle these challenges. Operational monitoring and reporting : On-going monitoring of the protection requirements of internally displaced persons, and how these needs are being addressed is essential. Field monitoring serves an important protection function by establishing a presence among or near at-risk populations. This allows regular needs assessment and the identification of groups that are particularly at risk. If necessary the RC/HC and the Country Team will relay such information to the ERC, RSG on IDPs, OHCHR, and the IASC-WG as a whole, in order to ensure a timely and effective response. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 581Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-14 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) In this regard, following a request from the office of the Secretary-General, a note was issued by the UNDP Administrator providing initial practical guidance on communicating issues relating to human rights. More detailed and extensive guidance as well as training opportunities should be provided to field staff. III - Responsibilities For Action It is, first and foremost, the responsibility of national authorities to both ensure protection for and provide assistance to the displaced and those at risk of displacement. The protection role of other actors, including international agencies and NGOs, involves reinforcing national responsibility and supporting, not substituting for, the protection responsibilities of competent authorities. In this connection, the UN Secretary-General's Programme for Reform of 1997 has underscored that human rights protection is a concern that cuts across the entire UN System, entailing commensurate responsibilities for its various organs and agencies. Thus, although some UN agencies have expressly designated mandates and possess specialised technical expertise in human rights protection, it remains incumbent upon all agencies to incorporate human rights concerns into their work. All agencies providing humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons have a responsibility to consider how the design and implementation of their assistance activities might best contribute to promoting protection of the internally displaced. Effective fulfilment of this responsibility stands to improve the protection of the internally displaced. The scale and the multi-faceted nature of displacement crises have led the IASC to recognise that an effective and comprehensive response to the protection and assistance needs of displaced persons necessitates a collaborative approach. Thus, the management model for assistance and protection in situations of internal displacement, rather than a single agency approach, is one that involves government officials, UN agencies, international organisations, and international and local NGOs. Such a collaborative approach implies a significant coordination role for the ERC and the IASC-WG. It requires the RC/HC to undertake an important assessment and task coordination role within the country setting; and further means the involvement of UN agencies and other international and national organisations, based on their areas of comparative advantage. 582 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-15 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) The principles which should underlie all interventions on behalf of internally displaced persons are: (a) a clear understanding of the respective roles of the ERC, the IASC-WG and the RC/HC, (b) an in-depth analysis of the specific country situation, and, (c) a multi-organisation coordination model based on the comparative advantages of the humanitarian organisations. IV - Process for Implementing the Collaborative Approach The IASC Recommendations related to the Review of the Capacity of the UN System for Humanitarian Assistance set out a number of coordination arrangements: At headquarters level, the ERC, as chairman of the IASC, is the focal point for the inter- agency coordination of humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons. The IASC-WG has been designated as the inter-agency forum for dealing with problems of internal displacement. An informal network of agency focal points on internal displacement has been established to promote inter-agency discussion and cooperation. At the field level, the RC/HC is, in full consultation with the inter-agency Country Team, responsible for the strategic coordination of assistance to and protection of internally displaced persons. This mandate includes ensuring that humanitarian needs are met before, during and after an emergency. It also requires the RC/HC to serve as an advocate for assistance and protection, and recommend to the ERC a division of tasks and responsibilities among agencies. The RC/HC may also recommend to the ERC, in consultation with the Country Team, a lead sectoral agency to assume operational responsibility for internally displaced persons. This process serves to create areas of predictability as well as systematically promote mechanisms of complementarity and cooperation among the agencies to address the needs resulting from internal displacement. A number of coordination mechanisms need to be distinguished in order to maintain flexibility with regard to the specific requirements in situations of internal displacement. Coordination mechanisms at the outset of an IDP crisis: a) Activation: The primary responsibility for activating the coordination process at the outset of a crisis of internal displacement lies with the field. The RC/HC will alert the ERC to an evolving situation of internal displacement. This then should set off parallel processes in the country and at headquarters level. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 583Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-16 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) b)Strategy building: The RC/HC will initiate consultations with the UN Country Team and other international organisation and establish in-country task forces on internally displaced persons. This should encourage agencies to share information, initiate additional common monitoring activities, and develop a joint plan for responding to the assistance and protection needs of the displaced. The RC/HC will ensure that the monitoring and planning process maintains a strategic focus on protection issues such as those suggested in Section II. As a matter of course, strategies to address situations of internal displacement should include the search for durable solutions, even while the crises are evolving. The RC/HC will also promote consultations with national and local authorities to assess the willingness and capacity of the government to respond to the crisis and to fulfil its obligations with regard to protection in situations of internal displacement. c) Defining institutional arrangements: In consultation with the UN Country Team and other relevant organisations, the RC/HC will propose to the ERC an institutional arrangement among agencies to address the needs of the displaced populations in a coordinated manner. This proposal should reflect the role to be taken by national and local government agencies, as well as by international agencies and NGOs. Subject to inter-agency consultations and subsequent endorsement by the IASC-WG, the ERC may give a provisional response to the proposal. Following general consultations, in particular with agencies proposed for key roles, the ERC will propose a coordination arrangement to the IASC-WG for its endorsement. The RC/HC may also request the ERC to dispatch to the field an inter-agency mission or an individual adviser, as appropriate. d)The IASC-process: The IASC-WG will undertake, in line with its terms of reference on internally displaced persons, a review of the proposed country arrangements and suggest the most appropriate division of labour for addressing them. While the above-outlined mechanisms will help address situations of internal displacement at their outset , a number of steps should be taken at field level as well as at headquarters level to strengthen coordination processes in on-going situations of internal displacement: 584 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-17 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Coordination mechanisms in ongoing crises: a) The RC/HC, or the sectoral lead agency, will encourage in-country task forces on internally displaced persons to develop the capacity and competence to maintain a strategic focus on protection issues while planning for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. These will include mechanisms for participation at sub-office level in designing and implementing strategies. b) The RC/HC or the sectoral lead agency, with the input from the UN Country Team and other international organisations, will report to the ERC on specific information on displaced populations, and call, if necessary, particular attention to gaps in existing assistance and protection measures, as well as constraints due to lack of access or resources. c) The IASC-WG will support the RC/HC in promoting collaborative arrangements among agencies to address protection needs. In particular, the IASC-WG will assist the RC/HC or the sectoral lead agency in their coordination efforts by undertaking a systematic review of country arrangements with regard to internally displaced persons at headquarters level. d) The IASC-WG, in selecting countries for its consideration, should give priority to situations where internal displacement is presenting particular protection and/or assistance challenges. In keeping with its TOR on internally displaced persons, the IASC-WG should systematically monitor the follow-up to visits by the ERC or inter- agency missions to the country(s) in question. When reviewing countries on which the RSG on IDPs has reported on, the IASC-WG should examine the extent to which his recommendations are taken into account by the Governments, concerned parties and by the Country Team. e) The RC/HC may encourage the development of Memoranda of Understanding or other institutional arrangements between key partners in the humanitarian response to displacement situations, the objective being for agencies to be able to rely on one another's comparative advantages and special expertise. In clarifying roles and responsibilities, such agreements can also help to identify and correct operational gaps and overlaps.

The report underlined the role of the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) as one of ensuring that the protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) are addressed9. Accordingly, the Secretary-General designated the ERC as the focal point at headquarters level for the inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons. This responsibility includes: (a) global advocacy on both assistance and protection requirements; (b) resource mobilisation and the identification of gaps in resources for internally displaced persons; (c) promotion of the establishment of a database and global information on internally displaced persons in consultation with external institutions, including monitoring and issuance of periodic situation reports; and (d) support to the field on related humanitarian issues, including negotiation of access to internally displaced persons. As chair of the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the ERC ensures that appropriate arrangements are set up with regard to protection and assistance in specific situations of internal displacement. 8 The Outline of the Capacities of Different Organizations is presented in Annex to the policy paper and constitutes a non-endorsable part of the text. 9 A/51/950, para. 186 586 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-19 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) At the field level, the UN Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) is, in full consultation with the inter-agency Country Team, responsible for the strategic coordination of assistance to internally displaced persons. This includes ensuring that humanitarian requirements before, during and after an emergency are adequately addressed, and advocating for assistance and protection. The RC/HC is responsible for recommending to the ERC the most appropriate collaborative arrangement, among agencies, for responding to the displacement crisis in a specific country. The RC/HC may also recommend to the ERC, in consultation with the in-country team and on a case-by-case basis, a lead sectoral agency to assume operational responsibility for internally displaced persons. Through a network of IDP focal points in IASC member agencies, the ERC's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) maintains a system-wide liaison concerning situations of internal displacement. This enables OCHA to assist the ERC and the IASC with its Working Group in developing an inter-agency consensus in IDP-matters. OCHA is also in close contact with the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons in order to keep him up to date on relevant policy developments, provide him with country specific information and proposals for his advocacy efforts on behalf of internally displaced persons. The Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons (RSG on IDPs) In 1992, in response to growing international concern about the large number of internally displaced persons throughout the world and their need for protection and assistance, the UN Secretary-General, at the request of the Commission on Human Rights, appointed a Representative on internally displaced persons. The RSG was requested to examine the human rights issues relating to internal displacement and to prepare a comprehensive study identifying existing laws and mechanisms for the protection of internally displaced persons, measures to strengthen their implementation, and additional ways of addressing protection needs.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 587Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-20 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) The mandate of the RSG since has been renewed three times and the RSG requested to continue his analysis of the causes of internal displacement, the needs of those displaced, measures of prevention, and specific ways to improve protection, assistance and solutions for the internally displaced. In fulfilment of these responsibilities, the Representative monitors internal displacement world-wide, undertakes country missions, establishes dialogues with governments, collaborates with intergovernmental, regional and non-governmental organisations, makes recommendations to improve international and regional institutional arrangements, assesses international legal protection, and publishes reports for action by Governments, the Commission, General Assembly, international organisations and non-governmental organisations. In 1998, the RSG presented the first international standards on internally displaced persons to the Commission - the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Their development had been preceded by an evaluation of existing human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy to determine the degree to which they provided an adequate basis for the protection of the internally displaced. On the basis of the findings, contained in a compilation and analysis of legal norms, the RSG had been requested by the Commission and General Assembly to develop an appropriate normative framework for the protection of internally displaced persons. The Guiding Principles are the first comprehensive statement of what protection should mean for the internally displaced. They set forth the rights of the internally displaced and the obligations of governments and insurgent groups toward these populations. They provide guidance to the RSG, States, all other authorities, groups and persons, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations when addressing internal displacement. The Commission acknowledged the Principles in 1998 and has welcomed the fact that the RSG is making use of them in his dialogue with Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, and in particular in the framework of seminars he has held on internal displacement (in collaboration with regional organisations, UN agencies and local NGOs). The Economic and Social Council also acknowledged the Principles, as have international organisations, regional bodies and non-governmental organisations, all of which have been widely disseminating them. 588 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-21 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Another important aspect of the mandate is country missions which provide the means for assessing the extent to which the protection, assistance and development needs of the internally displaced are being met on the ground. Discussions are held with government officials, international organisations, non-governmental organisations and displaced populations, all of which serve to raise national and international awareness to areas that need attention.. Thus far, the RSG has undertaken fourteen such visits. The RSG submits reports on his findings to the Commission and General Assembly. He also shares the findings and recommendations of these missions with the IASC, soliciting its support in their implementation. In its Recommendations Related to the Review of the Capacity of the United Nations System for Humanitarian Assistance, the IASC recognised the role of the RSG as focusing primarily on advocacy for protection and assistance of the internally displaced, the setting of global standards and principles for enhanced protection, and making recommendations on how the application of existing instruments and protocols can be made more effective. Since 1997, the RSG has been a standing invitee to the IASC and its subsidiary bodies, participating actively in these forums with a view to ensuring that attention to protection is integrated into the international response to situations of internal displacement. The RSG also makes recommendations for more effective institutional arrangements for internally displaced persons at the national and international levels. The RSG reports annually to the Commission and biennially to the General Assembly. The RSG on IDPs is a voluntary position, which is serviced by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. In 1999, UNHCR seconded a staff person to New York to support the work of the mandate. The Office of the High Co mmi ssioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Protection is at the core of the mandate of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In addition to servicing the mandate of the RSG on IDPs, OHCHR plays a protection role with internally displaced persons in its own right. OHCHR has a field presence in several situations of internal displacement, which in a number of cases has specific responsibilities relating to promoting and protecting the rights of internally displaced persons. Enhancing the human rights field presence in situations of internal displacement would help to ensure greater attention to human rights abuses and protection needs.

The Commission on Human Rights has called upon these mechanisms to seek information on situations that have already created or could create internal displacement, and to include relevant information and recommendations thereon in their reports and to make these available to the RSG. In addition to human rights monitoring, OHCHR can contribute to addressing protection needs of internally displaced persons through technical cooperation activities such as supporting the strengthening of judiciary and the creation and effective functioning of national institutions for promoting and protecting human rights, programmes of human rights education, providing training in human rights, and capacity-building for local non-governmental organisations. The Commission on Human Rights has called upon the OHCHR to develop, in cooperation with governments, international organisations and the RSG, technical cooperation projects specifically aimed at promoting the rights of internally displaced persons. The mandate of the High Commissioner relating to mass exoduses also is relevant, in particular for its emphasis on early warning and response to situations of displacement.The General Assembly, in its resolution on Human Rights and Mass Exoduses, has requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in the exercise of her mandate \"to pay particular attention to situations which cause or threaten to cause mass exoduses and to contribute to efforts to address such situations effectively through protection measures, emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, including information sharing with the United Nations early-warning mechanisms, and the provision of technical advice, expertise and cooperation in countries of origin as well as host countries\". The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Although protection per se does not fall under FAO's mandate, the Organisation recognises that all human rights are interrelated and interdependent. It has a special responsibility in protecting the right to food as a basic human right. FAO's Constitution sets \"ensuring humanity's freedom from hunger\" as one of its basic purposes. 590 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-23 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) The World Food Summit (WFS), organised in Rome in 1996, reaffirmed that food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure; international humanitarian law bans the deliberate starvation of civilians. The WFS also acknowledged that in many instances the lack of security and enjoyment of all human rights are the main impediments to food security. Furthermore all instances of hindrances to the right to food, such as food blockades, mining of agricultural areas and fishing zones, destruction of food production means, the uprooting of people from their lands etc. are of direct concern to the Organisation. Therefore, FAO will strive to cooperate in general protection activities in country teams, and pay special attention to protection of the right to food. Protection of the right to food requires monitoring of household food security of internally displaced persons, understanding the specific constraints that prevent Internally displaced persons from accessing the required food and ensuring that appropriate measures are taken to facilitate this access. Discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnicity, opinion or gender is of particular concern. FAO regards assistance to return to self-sufficiency, by access to land, seed, tools, or general income-generating activities as inherent in the concept of the right to food. The right to adequate food implies that food assistance should be adequate in quality and quantity to meet the dietary needs of every individual for a healthy and active life, with due regard for cultural preferences. Special efforts should be made to ensure the participation of internally displace men and women in assistance activities. Regarding general protection concerns, FAO believes that its visible presence in concerned regions, as such, can contribute to deterring violence and abuses, facilitating the protection of internally displaced persons, especially when complemented by sufficient awareness. FAO Representatives and field staff in countries affected by internal displacement are encouraged to be aware of the special needs of internally displaced persons, for instance by familiarising themselves with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and other material being prepared under the auspices of the IASC-WG. FAO staff is encouraged to participate in inter-agency activities, including training, and to notify partners with a protection mandate of cases, events and situations requiring their intervention. More specifically FAO staff should promote and participate in monitoring, assessing and planning related to household food security of internally displaced persons.

WFP, mandated to provide food aid to the most vulnerable and food-insecure, plays a major role in providing food aid assistance to internally displaced not only during the period of displacement, but also in support of return, resettlement, reintegration and post-conflict recovery. WFP's assistance activities, carried out in collaboration with partners, support, both directly and indirectly, the protection of internally displaced persons. These include: Firstly, WFP engages in negotiations on access and safe passage for humanitarian supplies, including food, with governments and non-state actors in order to reach internally displaced persons and other conflict-affected persons at risk. Advocacy for continuous and unrestricted access to the internally displaced means not only access for the provision of assistance and related protection, but also unrestricted access for regular and systematic needs assessments and follow-up monitoring. Secondly, WFP's food assistance is provided in ways that are intended to protect and promote the human rights of beneficiaries. For example, /g183/g32During programming design, food delivery schedules and commodities and quantities to be distributed are planned so as to minimise the risk of attacks, harassment, etc. In addition, WFP's food assistance in response to the essential needs and rights of displaced persons may preclude repeated displacements and further erosion of their basic rights and security of displaced persons. /g183/g32WFP ensures that its assistance programmes are designed and implemented on the basis of broad-based participation. As women constitute the majority of internally displaced people, WFP's Commitments for Women play a particular role. They are aimed at ensuring women's direct access to appropriate and adequate food; women's equal access to, and participation in, power structures and decision-making; and women's equal access to resources, employment, markets and trade. /g183/g32WFP Food-For-Work (FFW) activities can provide an incentive for activities such as reconstruction of public and private assets, community infrastructure and private housing, involving civilian populations affected by conflict. As such, FFW can aid in the process of resettlement, recovery and reconciliation. /g183/g32In the broad sense, food assistance provides protection during displacement and return phases, by reducing the burden for local communities and lessening the friction that can be caused between displaced people and resident populations.592 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-25 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) WFP is undertaking a review of its assistance to internally displaced persons with one objective being the identification of opportunities to strengthen linkages between protection and assistance. The World Health Organisation (WHO) WHO main role is to support the national authorities in strengthening health services and in improving health care for all segments of their populations. Furthermore, its constitution mandates WHO \"to provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the UN, health services and facilities to special groups\". Internally displaced persons represent one of these special groups: a group most vulnerable to health hazards. WHO is fully aware that protection of health rights of internally displaced persons is an inseparable part of their full human rights. Full coordination between local authorities and external agencies, UN, NGOs, RCRC, etc. is an absolute necessity. WHO-assistance to internally displaced persons hinges on the Organisations country office which ensures a permanent presence in the country before, during and after emergencies. The country office can be strengthened according to needs by the regional office concerned while HQ ensures the coordination with other agencies and the donor community, as well as facilitating technical backstopping from relevant WHO programmes. For instance, technical guidelines can be adapted to the needs of internally displaced persons and disseminated to all other partners. Normally, WHO does not provide health care directly but works through other health care providers, national or international. WHO can intervene in different phases of assistance and in complementary ways: a) during the emergency phase WHO participates in the assessment of the health situation. The internally displaced persons health needs will be identified and brought to the attention of the national authorities, other UN agencies, NGOs and the donor community. b) this technical assessment will serve also as a basis for advocating for the protection of internally displaced persons vis- /g66-vis the national authorities and of the international community. c) consistently with the above, WHO fosters and facilitates the involvement of national authorities in the provision of health care to the internally displaced persons and their coordination with other national and external agencies as may be present. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 593Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-26 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) d) when reintegration is in sight WHO, together with the other UN agencies, WHO will assist the national authorities and NGOs to ensure that internally displaced persons are reintegrated and provided the same level of health services as the rest of the population. This requires the formulation of health plans for the internally displaced persons that are integrated in long term strategies aimed at the promotion of equitable and sustainable health care systems for all citizens. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) provides a broad range of activities to individuals, such as providing transport and fulfilling their basic needs of food, shelter and supplies. By providing assistance and meeting the material needs of internally displaced persons, IOM is offering a form of protection to them. Indeed, protection of the human rights of internally displaced persons often consists in meeting their essential needs. In particular, IOM's migration assistance covers activities such as organising transport, evacuations, and returns; providing temporary shelter and other material relief, providing early warning and rapid analysis of migratory flows, developing national population information systems and censuses, and providing expert advice to governments on migration policies and laws. The Organisation also carries out projects such as reintegration and vocational training to assist these people in the long-term, in the recognition that viable alternatives are indispensable for displacement not to reoccur. Governments are also the beneficiaries of IOM programmes which build the national capacities need to manage or prevent internal displacement, in this light the Organisation has concluded bilateral cooperation agreements with many States, which specifically make provisions for IOM involvement in assisting internally displaced persons. With regard to inter-agency cooperation IOM has entered agreements with UNHCR, UNFPA and UNDP to enhance provision for migration assistance and protection to internally displaced persons. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) plays a critical role in the resettlement phase of internally displaced persons. Internally displaced persons can attract significant support while they remain a distinct target group in camps, or shanty towns, but once they are absorbed into communities, their 'targetability' erodes and delivery of emergency programme support becomes progressively more difficult. The UNDP sustainable human development role begins to grow wherever the targetability of internally displaced persons fades, primarily in: 594 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-27 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) (a) facilitating joint planning of different interventions well beforehand, to ensure that development activities are sufficiently synchronised with relief; (b) supporting development of the communities that the displaced have rejoined; (c) implementing rehabilitation activities in the displaced communities of return in order to facilitate their sustainable reintegration, and; (d) providing local capacity building support to local entities to enable them to take an active role in the reintegration and resettlement process. Experience has shown that the conversion from the 'target group' paradigm to the 'development' paradigm is far less jarring if the planning processes for the two stages are coordinated at a very early stage. Here, both the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator functions are key in repeatedly bringing all of the actors together. UNDP plays an important role in supporting Resident Coordinators to provide the support during the displacement phase, to link rehabilitation activities as appropriate to the emergency and humanitarian relief, and to provide support to joint planning among international and local actors, to ensure that the needs of internally displaced persons are not neglected following their return to their original communities or permanent settlement when reintegration is not option. The United Nations High Co mmi ssioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Although refugees flee their country and the internally displaced remain uprooted within their national borders, the two groups share many common characteristics: like refugees, many internally displaced persons have been forced to leave their homes because of fear of persecution, war and violence, and are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. Because of the close links between refugees and internally displaced persons, UNHCR has also responded to the problem of internal displacement in many situations. As UNHCR's mission statement puts it, 'UNHCR is mandated by the United Nations to lead and co-ordinate international action for the world-wide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems.' Recognising that in many situations the plight, the needs and the causes of displacement of internally displaced persons are closely related to those of refugees or returnees and that it is not possible to resolve refugee problems without addressing simultaneously the issue of internal displacement, UNHCR has increasingly undertaken activities on behalf of the internally displaced as part of a comprehensive approach to address coerced population movements. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 595Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-28 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) While UNHCR's Statute makes no specific reference to internally displaced persons, it recognises, in article 9, that the High Commissioner may, in addition to the work with refugees, \"engage in such activities ---- as the General Assembly may determine, within the limits of the resources placed at (her) disposal\" . This article is the basis on which the General Assembly has authorised the Secretary-General to call upon UNHCR to undertake humanitarian assistance and protection activities on behalf of the internally displaced, provided certain specific conditions are met. UNHCR has interpreted the General Assembly resolutions, and in particular resolution 48/116, as providing the Organisation with a mandate to address the challenges of internal displacement in a flexible manner. Based on these resolutions, and on its operational experience UNHCR developed internal policy directives in 1993 and 1997, defining the criteria for involvement in specific operations as follows: a) specific request or endorsement from the Secretary General or the competent principal organs of the United Nations; b) consent of the concerned state or other relevant entity; c) relevance of UNHCR's expertise and experience in protection, assistance and solution-oriented activities, and; d) availability of adequate resources, access to the affected population, ability of UNHCR to maintain 'its institutional independence as a non-political and humanitarian organisation, and to intervene directly with the Governments and parties concerned through its field presence. The criteria and considerations outlined above do not automatically trigger UNHCR's involvement but reflect factors that need to be taken into account in deciding whether or not a situation is appropriate for UNHCR's involvement. 596 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-29 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) By virtue of its unique mandate and its global operations on behalf of refugees, UNHCR has acquired protection and solution-oriented skills and an operational capacity that can be put to effective use in certain situations of internal displacement. While the nature of UNHCR's involvement is related generally to the organisation's expertise and experience in the area of protection and solutions, the particular activities undertaken by UNHCR vary according to the specific situation and the needs of the persons concerned, ranging from reintegration assistance in Ethiopia and Somalia, to capacity building and the promotion and monitoring of human rights in Tajikistan, to co-ordinating protection and humanitarian assistance in former Yugoslavia. Assisting the internally displaced as part of a reintegration operation for returnees is the most frequent way in which UNHCR becomes involved with internal displacement. Because UNHCR's activities on behalf of the internally displaced in the context of a repatriation operation are usually indivisible from its mandated protection and assistance activities for returning refugees, specific authorisation would not normally be a precondition for the organisation's involvement. In contrast, where the link between an envisaged operation and refugee-related activities is weak, prior request or authorisation from the UN organs or the concerned state is a prerequisite for UNHCR's involvement with internally displaced persons. While recognising the difficulties of protecting the internally displaced in their own country, UNHCR nevertheless believes that activities with respect to internally displaced persons should not be limited to the delivery of relief assistance, but should include a protection component. To give one example of UNHCR's protection activities for internally displaced, in the case of Sri Lanka, UNHCR initially began by assisting refugees returning from India but when renewed fighting displaced both returnees and others in the local community, UNHCR responded to the request of the Government to address the needs of both groups. Seeking to combine relief assistance with some basic protection, UNHCR established Open Relief Centres (ORCs), where the displaced population could seek temporary shelter from the fighting. UNHCR's involvement in the former Yugoslavia has highlighted the relevance of specific expertise in the area of protection and solutions, as well as the importance of addressing the plight of all affected population, whether refugees, displaced or besieged. In November 1991, UNHCR was requested by the UN Secretary-General to act as lead agency to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons affected by the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 597Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-30 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) UNHCR's protection role was implicit in the Secretary General's letter, and the Office interpreted its tasks in a broad way, not only providing material relief to the victims of conflict, but also undertaking a wide range of protection functions, such as field visits to monitor the conditions of vulnerable groups, direct intervention with the authorities to address violations, facilitating evacuation in life-threatening situations, and intervening to prevent involuntary and unsafe return of displaced persons. Although UNHCR's ability to protect was limited by the brutal nature of the war, the Office's monitoring and reporting helped to focus the attention of the international community on the plight of civilians. The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) Broadly speaking, protecting the rights of the child means ensuring the rights provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Protection of displaced children focuses, first, on shielding them from physical and psychosocial harm inflicted by others, such as violence, exploitation, sexual abuse, neglect, cruel or degrading treatment, or recruitment into military forces. Displaced status makes children especially vulnerable to each of these forms of abuse. Second, protection refers to those actions that preserve the identity and cultural, linguistic, and inheritance rights of displaced children, since children removed from their home communities are at significant risk of losing these portions of their heritage. But protection finally also entails providing or ensuring provision at the basic needs of children in terms of food, health and education. By definition, the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF)'s mandate demands that it act whenever and wherever women and children- families- are vulnerable, whether they be refugees, displaced, affected by conflict, by inequity or by poverty. UNICEF can bring to the displaced populations its experience in capacity development, in community participation and in development of coping skills of children, of parents, of families and of communities- required for survival, development and protection in situations of poverty and inequity, and in more extreme uses of violence and armed conflict. Supporting the rehabilitation and recovery of displaced children, their families and communities entail actions to restore psychosocial health is not only a matter of recovery but also one of reintegration, prevention and protection. UNICEF also provides assistance in the area of maternal and child health care, schools, water supply and sanitation systems, and promotes long-lasting solutions to the problem of internal displacement through the creation and strengthening of self-help capacities at the family and community level. In order to achieve these goals, UNICEF builds its interventions around four primary components: advocacy, assessment, care and protection.598 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-31 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) UNICEF also play an important role in the area of providing assistance and protection measures for unaccompanied displaced children, and providing for their reunification with families. Internally displaced children are also targeted in landmine awareness programmes both in order to ensure protection during displacement, and to provide for their safe return or relocation. In the area of preventing recruitment and demobilising children who have been recruited by the military, UNICEF focuses particularly on displaced communities to ensure that priority is given to this issue as displaced children are particularly prone to join the military. The Convention on the Rights of the Child gives added impetus to UNICEF's advocacy and protection roles with regard to children in the widest range of difficult circumstances, especially within national boundaries, given the CRC's emphasis on the obligations of the state of the child and family. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (The Federation ) The Federation works on the basis of the Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to inspire, facilitate and promote all humanitarian activities carried out by its member National Societies to improve the situation of the most vulnerable people. The Federation directs and co-ordinates international assistance of the Movement to victims of natural and technological disasters, to refugees and displaced people and in health emergencies. It acts as the official representative of its member Societies in the international field. It promotes co-operation between National Societies, and works to strengthen their capacity to carry out effective disaster preparedness, health and social programmes. National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies embody the work and principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in more than 175 countries. National Societies act as auxiliaries to the public authorities of their own countries in the humanitarian field and provide a range of services including disaster relief, health and social programmes. Together, the components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (the \"Movement\") are guided by the same seven Fundamental Principles: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. In the same manner, all Red Cross and Red Crescent activities have one central purpose: to help those who suffer without discrimination and thus contribute to peace in the world. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 599Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-32 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) National Societies are already present in the local situation through their extensive branch system and with direct access to internally displaced persons and are therefore particularly suited to support international efforts locally. The Federation may complement other international efforts by making use of its unique network of locally based Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies National societies may be able to play important roles in some or all of the following fields: contribute to an early warning system through information sharing, build a local and national standby capacity, mobilise support to emergency relief at the local, national and international level; promote respect for humanitarian principles through dissemination and training; support protection efforts of the mandate of humanitarian organizations; remain present and involved throughout the difference phases of assistance and protection to displaced persons until solutions are found. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) The mandate of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is based on international humanitarian law (IHL) and on the Statutes of the Movement. The ICRC is active primarily in situations of armed conflict and internal violence. By seeking to assist all victims of armed conflict, its also works to prevent arbitrary displacement and to ensure protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons. In recent years the magnitude of the needs to be met has led the ICRC to launch large-scale operations in practically all armed conflict situations. It has therefore dealt with millions of displaced persons. Thanks to its right of initiative and its neutral and independent status, the ICRC is often well placed to take action during hostilities. Its specific nature and virtually permanent contacts with all parties to conflict generally enable it to obtain access - whether in government territory or in areas held by armed opposition groups - to the victims it is mandated to protect and assist. ICRC's protection and assistance cover a broad range of activities, including promoting respect for IHL, making representations to governments and non-state actors when violations occur, lending its good offices to facilitate the establishment of hospital and safety zones, evacuating civilians from situations of danger, maintaining family links through tracing activities and exchange of Red Cross messages, and providing a variety of material assistance and services (e.g. medical care, shelter, food). 600 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-33 Participant Guide Protection of Internally Displaced Persons: Inter-Agency Standing Committee Policy Paper (Continued) Non-Governmental Activities The non-governmental sector is involved in a wide range of protection activities for internally displaced persons. At an operational level humanitarian NGOs regularly work with internally displaced persons in various theatres around the world, including, for example, the CIS region, former Yugoslavia and the Great Lakes region. Generally operational humanitarian NGOs do not specifically target internally displaced persons for assistance but provide assistance as part of an overall relief effort or as implementing partners for various UN agencies. In recent years many operational NGOs have gone beyond providing \"assistance\" in a narrow sense and initiated internal processes, or collaborated with partners, to examine ways to better incorporate human rights programming and human rights protection into operations. Several NGOs are involved in monitoring displacement situations. Human rights monitoring and advocacy NGOs regularly report on the state of human rights in various parts of the world and do report on the respect for the rights of internally displaced populations. Some refugee organisations also report regularly on internally displaced populations most notably the US Committee for Refugees which includes internally displaced persons in its World Survey and occasionally does country specific studies on internal displacement such as Colombia and Sri Lanka. .The Norwegian Refugee Council has a well-established information dissemination project on internally displaced. It is establishing a database on internally displaced persons, examining both the protection and assistance needs of the displaced. It has worked to support the work of the Secretary-General's Representative on internally displaced persons by disseminating and promoting the Guiding Principles and has more recently played a part in training national NGOs on the Principles. In collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights it has developed some training modules on the Guiding Principles. NRC also served as the focal point for NGO input into UNHCR's new Field Guide for NGOs on protecting refugees, which includes a section on protection of internally displaced persons. Finally the Forced Migration Review , a joint NRC undertaking with the Refugee Studies Programme, have given space to protection issues as they relate to the displaced.

In February 1996 M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res-Holland , convened an international conference in Amsterdam to seek ways that humanitarian and human rights groups might collaborate more effectively Other international organisations have also held discussions on protection and assistance concerns which relate to internally displaced persons. The Lutheran World Federation and the World Council of Churches for example have examined humanitarian ethics with specific reference to tensions between protection and assistance. The Steering Committee on Humanitarian Response is also involved in efforts to develop a \"policy framework\" for protection concerns. The Save the Children Alliance has developed a set of training materials and modules as part of its Action for the Rights of Children which are relevant to internally displaced persons. M\u00e9decins du Monde convened a major conference in Paris in June 1999, on Saving Lives in the Midst of Conflict: From Humanitarian Action towards Humanising Governmental Action. InterAction has been the venue for an ongoing series of discussion of protection and related issues among U.S. NGOs. 602 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-35 Participant Guide What Is Protection? \"The concept of protection encompasses all activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of the individual in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the relevant bodies of law (i.e. human rights law, international humanitarian law, and refugee law).\" /g183/g32It is important to understand that this definition encompasses civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. /g183/g32This definition is comprehensive in scope, both in terms of the legal framework for protection, (\"full respect\"), and in terms of the strategies and methods by which protection may be achieved (\"all activities\"). It is also comprehensive in that it recognises all bodies of law relevant to the protection of internally displaced persons. /g183/g32Although there is growing recognition among humanitarian and development agencies of their responsibilities in the area of protection, including to internally displaced persons, there remains a need to give practical meaning to such commitment. /g183/g32Traditionally, humanitarian and development agencies lacking an explicit protection mandate have tended to conceive of protection for internally displaced persons as falling outside the scope of their work. Their protection role has been limited to the extent that the provision of assistance does in itself constitute a form of protection. /g183/g32The traditional work of humanitarian and development agencies is, indeed, inherently rights-based and the distinction between protection and assistance is complex. However, human rights protection cannot be done by halves; it involves the assurance of the whole set of rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. /g183/g32By saying that protection is an all-encompassing concept, we are not suggesting that all organisations become legal experts and start defending and visiting prisoners, or start drafting legislation on the protection of internally displaced persons. However, what we are saying is that the Country Team must have a clear vision and strategy for making sure that all areas of protection outlined in the Guiding Principles are addressed. /g183/g32Protection is difficult to implement, particularly where displacement is inflicted as part of a deliberate policy, and where national authorities are unwilling to discharge their responsibilities toward their displaced populace.Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 603Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-36 Participant Guide What Is Protection? (Continued) /g183/g32It is important to bear in mind, however, that although protection and human rights activities cannot in themselves cause the disappearance of oppression and violence, they highlight the fact that human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law are illegal and unacceptable, and thus play an important role in diminishing their occurrence. /g183/g32The ICRC 1999 Workshop on Protection identified three categories of protection activities: /g216/g32Environment Building , to include any activity aimed at creating and/or consolidating a global environment conducive to full respect for the rights of individuals; /g216/g32Responsive Action , to include any activity undertaken in the context of an emerging or established pattern of abuse and aimed at prevention and/or alleviating its immedia te effects; and /g216/g32Remedial Action , to include any activity aimed at restoring dignified living conditions through rehabilitation, restitution, and reparation. 604 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-37 Participant Guide Comme nts on the Guiding Principles Related to Protection During Displacement Principle 10: The right to life The right to life is obviously a primary right. If it is violated, the other human rights are left without meaning. This does not mean that the right to life is unqualified or absolute. The prohibition applies only to \"arbitrary\" deprivation of life. The right to life cannot be invoked, for example, where the death penalty is imposed in accordance with law and due process. It is important to note that both the right to life and the quality of life are of concern from a protection viewpoint. In human rights law, the right to life is a non-derogable right. This means that it cannot be departed from in situations of declared emergency. Principle 11: The right to dignity and physical, mental and moral integrity This principle is underpinned by the concept of human dignity - the view that all human beings share certain physical, mental, spiritual and mental attributes which, in normal circumstances should be in some sort of equilibrium. This Principle is violated by any action which threatens or upsets this equilibrium through the infliction of extreme pain, mental suffering, acute humiliation, or any other acts which may destroy an individual's will or conscience. Two fundamental elements of this Principle are non-derogable rights under human rights law. These are the rights not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment and the freedom from slavery or servitude. This Principle underscores the point that protection during displacement is as concerned with the quality of life, as it is with the preservation of life. Principle 12: Right to liberty a nd security of the person A key word in this principle - \"liberty\" - is used in the sense of freedom from unlawful confinement. Some see this Principle as a \"movement-related right\" because its underpinning objective is for internally displaced persons to be free to move around as they please. Others may prefer to conceptualise this Principle as one that protects the security of the human person from unlawful interference. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 605Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-38 Participant Guide Comme nts on the Guiding Principles Related to Protection During Displacement (Continued) Principle 12 outlines three specific ways in which the liberty and security of internally displaced persons may be infringed - internment in camps, arbitrary arrest and detention, and hostage taking. /g183/g32Internment in camps: There is a presumption against the confinement of displaced persons in camps. The use of camps should be the exception rather than the rule, and closed camps are prohibited in all circumstances. A camp may be justified, for example, where their establishment is the only way to facilitate or ensure protection and assistance for the internally displaced. Even then, a camp should never be set up for and indefinite duration: a camps' life-span should be limited to specific time frames. /g183/g32Arrest and detention: The fact that people are internally displaced should not be used as a pretext or be cited as the reason for their arrest and detention. Internal displacement is not a crime, and those who are affected by it should not be treated as criminals. In the event that displaced persons are detained for lawful reasons, they should not be subjected to worse treatment because of their status of being internally displaced. /g183/g32Kidnapping or abduction: There can be no justification whatsoever for treating displaced persons as hostages. Principle 13: Recruitment and participation in hostilities There is an absolute prohibition against the participation of children in hostilities. (\"...in no circumstances...\"). The rationale is that there is a collective international responsibility to secure the full and harmonious development of the children of this world, principally by ensuring that they \"...grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding\". Participation in hostilities is the very antithesis of an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. 606 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-39 Participant Guide Comme nts on the Guiding Principles Related to Protection During Displacement (Continued) With regard to adults, they may of their own free will participate in hostilities. By such voluntary participation they relinquish protection under from attacks or other acts of violence, but still retain the protections of international humanitarian law relating to limits on the conduct of hostilities. Internally displaced persons should not be forced or coerced into participating in hostilities, and they should not be picked out as candidates for recruitment on account of their status as internally displaced persons. (Cross-reference to Principle 10(2)). Principles 14 & 15: Right to liberty of movement Principles 12, 14 and 15 are mutually reinforcing. Principle 12 prohibits unlawful confinement. Principles 14 and 15 guarantee liberty of movement and freedom of choice as to the direction and destination of movement. Two points may be highlighted: /g183/g32Internally displaced persons have the right to seek asylum. This is a key human rights principle. The protection internally displaced persons receive may not be adequate to substitute for national protection. Such protection cannot therefore extinguish their entitlement to seek refugee protection outside their country. /g183/g32Internally displaced persons should not be forced to go to places where they will be at placed at serious risk. This is the \"in-country equivalent\" of the refugee law principle ofnon-refoulement . Principle 16: Entitlement to in formation about missing relatives This Principle addresses several important and very basic human needs. One is the need to be informed about what has happened to missing relatives. If relatives or loved ones are deceased, their remains should be treated with respect and accorded an appropriate form of ceremonial disposal. This Principle seeks to ensure that internally displaced persons are not denied the right to have these very important needs simply on account of their being displaced. More than that, this Principle has a link to the preservation of the right to life by laying out the responsibilities of the authorities to establish the fate of missing persons, to collect and identify their mortal remains and to facilitate their return to the next of kin. In effect, this Principle imposes on the authorities a measure of accountability for those who may be have been killed or \"disappeared\". Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 607Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-40 Participant Guide Comme nts on the Guiding Principles Related to Protection During Displacement (Continued) Principle 17: The right to a family life It is well known that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State\". Given that the context of displacement is frequently accompanied by forced separation of family members, this Principle appropriately highlights the need to maintain the unity of the family. The Principle stipulates that responsible authorities are under a duty to help separated family members obtain information about each other, and to facilitate their reunification. The Principle also emphasizes that camp situations should not be a pretext for breaking up families. The integrity of the family unit should be maintained even where the family resides in a camp. If a family member of a displaced family has been recognised as a refugee, the authorities are under a duty to facilitate family reunification outside the country. The family unity principle should not be interpreted or applied to the detriment of the family but to their benefit. If, for example, the head of family is lawfully detained for a criminal offence, the family should not be required to join him in detention. Principles 18 & 19: The right to an adequate standard of living and the right to adequate medical care and attention These, along with Principles 22 and 23, are the \"quality of life\" Principles. Protection does not merely entail preserving the lives of internally displaced. They should also be assured a certain minimum standard of healthy life on a non-discriminatory basis. Principle 18(2) calls for special efforts to ensure the participation of women in the distribution of supplies. This is an important safeguard against the diversion or misuse of supplies. In Principle 19(2) there is further emphasis on the needs of women, not least because they often constitute the overwhelming majority of displaced populations. Principle 20: The righ t to recognition as person s before the law This non-derogable right is of particular importance for displaced persons because recognition before the law entitles them to claim and enjoy the right to protection and other rights under national law. This right is concretely manifested through documents that affirm a person's identity and civil status - birth certificates, marriage certificates, passports and other documents of identity. Authorities are under a duty to facilitate access of internally displaced persons to these documents, and to renew or replace them. Personal documentation has been an area in which gender inequalities have been perpetuated. Hence the emphasis in Principle 20 (3) on the right for women to have documents issued in their own names.608 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-41 Participant Guide Comme nts on the Guiding Principles Related to Protection During Displacement (Continued) Principle 21: The right to enjoyment of property The importance of this right stems from the fact that the loss of property is one of the most tangible and most telling consequences of displacement. As we are concerned here with protection during displacement, it is clear that the internally displaced who are the subject of Principle 21 would already have lost some of their property and possessions. It therefore becomes an even more urgent protection concern to minimise any further loss during the period when they are displaced. Only \"arbitrary\" deprivation of property is prohibited. There may be circumstances where the loss of property is sanctioned by law, as, for example, where it is in pursuance of a valid judicial or administrative process. E.g. Seizure of a boat caught fishing illegally. Examples of arbitrary deprivation are provided in Principle 21(2). The protection of property applies also to property vacated or left behind as a result of the events triggering displacement. Note that this protection is related to the context of solutions, including the principles for recovery, restitution and compensation. Principles 22 & 23: The freedoms of thought, expression, em ployment, association, voting, use of language, and the right to education This is an omnibus list of freedoms whose enjoyment contributes to the quality of life of all persons affected by internal displacement. The essential message of this Principle is that despite the fact of displacement, freedoms that are part and parcel of normal life should be retained. The concerned authorities are under a duty to facilitate the enjoyment of these freedoms. With regard to education, there is a clear emphasis on the education of children and equal opportunities for women and girls. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 609Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-42 Participant Guide People Oriented Planning Framework The basic concept: In order to enhance the efficiency and impact of protection and assistance activities, we should seek to obtain specific information about the internally displaced persons of concern to us. The POP framework identifies three categories of information to be obtained in three steps. It is crucial to bear in mind that these steps should be undertaken with respect to both the displaced persons and the community that plays host to them. Step 1: Profile and context of the displaced persons and of the host community \"Profile\" includes demographic composition of the group before they were displaced and the changes that have occurred in that composition as a result of displacement. Information should also be obtained about the host community with a view to ascertaining what changes have occurred in their lives as a result of having the displaced persons within their midst. \"Context\" refers to information on the causes of displacement, whether those causes continue to threaten the group, and the cultural and religious mores that prevail among the group . Step 2: Activities analysis - who does what; and when, and where do they do it? Relevant questions include: How does the displaced community organise itself ?. What are the social structures, authority structures and division of labour, and how does this differ from the pre-displacement situation ?. Step 3: Resources analysis - what resources are available within the group, who has which resources, and what are the resource needs ? Information should be obtained not only on physical possessions and resources, but also on intangible resources such as skills, knowledge, and culture. Value of POP as a tool for protection during displacement The POP framework can help us to determine: /g183/g32Who is at risk of protection violations, and from whom the risk emanates. Groups at particular risk can be identified through careful study of the profile of displaced persons, the context, and activity analysis. 610 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-43 Participant Guide People Oriented Planning Framework (Continued) /g183/g32How the internally displaced persons themselves can be partners in ensuring protection: Activities analysis and resources analysis can help to identify areas where refugees can create and maintain aspects of their own protection systems. /g183/g32How can protection and assistance activities can be designed so as to maximum effect: Activities and resource analysis can point to areas where activities and procedures employed by humanitarian staff can themselves become an impediment to protection. This may be the case, for example, with procedures for registration, food distribution, or issues of leadership and representation within the group. Applying the POP framework to protection during displacement For the purposes of this section, the Principles in Section III of the Guiding Principles are placed in four categories. It should be stressed that this demarcation is only for analytical convenience, and that the standards of protection are best approached as a seamless whole. The four categories are: /g183/g32Physical security: Principles 10, 11 & 13 /g183/g32Legal security: Principle 20 /g183/g32Liberty and Freedom of Movement: Principles 12, 14, and 15 /g183/g32Quality of life standards: - Principles 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, & 23 Physical security Profile and context analysis Place of origin: What were the causes of displacement? Are the displaced persons under continuing threat from the same agents of displacement? Are there other threats to security from within the displaced community itself ? If so what are the means available for the displaced persons to be physically removed from the sources of danger? Demographic profile of the displaced: Are women and children and other vulnerable groups in the majority? What documentation do they possess of have access to? Is the demographic profile related to the causes of displacement? What are the particular protection needs of women, children, men, the handicapped, the injured, and the elderly?

Demographic profile of the host community: What are the proportions of men, women, and children? What are the inter-ethnic relations between the displaced and the host community? Do these relations have any implications for protection? Context analysis What are the physical and legal circumstances in which the displaced persons find themselves? Is the location of their settlement vulnerable to armed attack or infiltration by armed elements? Do the displaced persons have access to functioning structures of national authority? Are these structures able and willing to respond to the protection and assistance needs of the displaced? Are the national or de facto authorities favourable to an international humanitarian presence? Activities analysis What are the principal day-to-day activities of the various groups, which make up the displaced population and the host community? Do any of these activities include illegal or criminal or military-related acts? Are these activities political in nature? Are these acts likely to prejudice the safety and security of the displaced population Do any of the activities expose the displaced persons to danger? Resources analysis What resources are available for use in addressing security concerns? Do the displaced have access to national authorities and are the authorities able and willing to address their protection needs? Are males, parents and families capable of playing protection roles? Does the shelter situation have protection implications? Are the procedures for distributing relief items designed with protection objectives in view? Do the displaced have adequate and safe access to health care? Do humanitarian agencies have adequate human and material resources to address assistance and protection needs of the displaced persons? 612 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-45 Participant Guide People Oriented Planning Framework (Continued) Legal Security Profile and Context analysis Place of origin and causes of displacement: Were questions of nationality, citizenship or ethnicity features in the cause of displacement? Were the displaced persons stripped of their documents during their flight to safety? Documentation: What proportion of the displaced persons possesses documents of identity, citizenship, nationality, or civil status? Are these documents considered valid by national authorities? Do the relevant authorities require documentation as a prerequisite for access to humanitarian assistance or services? If conditions are imposed for the issue or renewal of documents are those conditions compatible with protection standards? Are displaced persons fearful of being labeled as such? Activities analysis Is there illicit trafficking in documents? Which groups or persons are active in this trafficking? Are relevant authorities aware of or complicit in such activities? Are documents being exchanged for sexual favours or other services in kind? What are the legal procedures for obtaining, or renewing documents? Resources analysis What resources are available for ensuring that displaced persons obtain the documentation they need? Are national procedures for issuing and renewing documents still operative? What leverage do humanitarian organisations have for intervening with relevant authorities on issues of documentation and certification? Do these organisations have sufficient human and material resources to help address documentation issues?

Do the displaced persons belong to an ethnic group that is in the majority in another part of the country, and are those areas safely accessible? Activities analysis Are the displaced persons involved in criminal or illegal activities? Are elements among the host community also involved in criminal or illegal activities? Are there groups and individuals among the displaced or host community who collude in the process of arbitrary arrest and detention?

A few days ago, insurgents from neighboring Uzbekistan infiltrated the southwestern part of the country, provoking armed clashes in which both rebels and Kyrgyz troops were killed. Civilians are reported missing. The conflict is taking place in mountainous terrain at the intersection of borders drawn arbitrarily when Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan were administrative components of the USSR and not independent countries. The Ferghana Valley, which now runs through these three countries, is an ancient center of commerce, agriculture, and Islamic learning in Central Asia. With its more numerous ethnic Uzbek population, the Valley and surrounding areas are culturally distinct from the rest of Kyrgyzstan, including the capital Bishkek, which is separated from the southwest by high mountains. Estimates vary regarding the numerical strength of the rebels, who are known to be opposed to the secular rule of the post-Soviet leadership in Central Asia. Popular support for the insurgents among certain sectors of the population is assumed but not known definitively. Kyrgyz authorities in Bishkek view developments in the southwest with considerable concern if not outright suspicion. They fear that incursions might further destabilise the country. The prime minister's office has therefore just announced plans to relocate some 23,000 people, including many children and women, from a 25-km band along the border with Uzbekistan in order to carry out massive military operations in coordination with the armies of neighboring countries. The relocation efforts will take at least 10 days and cost less than $200,000, according to official estimates. The Kyrgyz government can cover approximately 60 percent of these costs and has requested international assistance, including from UNICEF and other UN agencies, for funding and logistical needs. It is Sunday afternoon, and authorities plan to start relocation at daybreak tomorrow morning. In part for financial reasons but largely for political ones, the government wants an immediate commitment of support from the UN agencies, even if such a response is contingent on approval from the agencies' headquarters in New York or Geneva.616 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module V: Protection and Assistance during Internal Displacement Page V-49 Participant Guide Kyrgyzstan: Civilians in Harm's Way Decision An urgent meeting has been called of Bishkek-based representatives from UNICEF, UNDP, and UNHCR to discuss this request. Together, the three agencies could readily contribute $80,000 toward the costs of relocation, but it is not clear that relocating 23,000 people would take only 10 days. Your task is to evaluate this request more carefully and provide a preliminary response to the Kyrgyz government before the end of the afternoon. Unfortunately, your colleagues in New York and Geneva are unavailable for consultations until tomorrow. To help you with your decision, please consider the following questions: 1. What sorts of issues in international human rights and humanitarian law might arise in this case? What humanitarian principles should the UN agencies use in deciding whether to provide assistance to the authorities? What examples from other country situations might provide helpful guidance in this case? 2. What conditions or restrictions would it be appropriate to insist on, if the UN agencies did in fact decide to assist the government with this policy? Together with your colleagues, please outline at least three options for responding to the government, including the various advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) that might arise with each. If it is possible, please reach a consensus recommendation for a joint response to the government.

In most cases, the internally displaced will want to return to their original homes or \"places of habitual residence.\" /g183/g32In certain instances, difficult circumstances in their home areas will make it difficult to return, and the internally displaced -- individually or in groups -- may attempt to settle in the location to which they were displaced or in a third setting. /g183/g32This final phase of the internal displacement process -- the search for a durable, or lasting, place to live -- requires careful analysis and program design by staff of international agencies. /g183/g32Sound interventions require: /g216/g32Thorough knowledge of the current conditions facing the internally displaced; /g216/g32Thorough knowledge of conditions in locations where they might settle; /g216/g32Logistical and other capacities on the part of national authorities and international agencies to support transit to a permanent home; and /g216/g32Knowledge of what will be required to ensure the long-term viability of the return or resettlement. 630 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-4 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Introduction to Module VI (Continued) /g183/g32At the same time that the international community may be contemplating an active role in support of the return or resettlement process, agencies must listen closely to the wishes of the displaced themselves, as well as the communities that will be neighbors to the displaced communities when they settle. /g183/g32This module explores all these issues, as well as the recurring issue of property disputes, which often arise when return or resettlement is undertaken. Provide the following definitions: Show Slide 6-2 Definitions /g183/g32As a first step in our examination of these issues, let's consider important definitions that we will refer to many times in this module. The central ones are: /g216/g32Return: In the context of internal displacement return is used to describe the process of going back to one's place of \"habitual residence.\" In many cases return may be the preferred durable solution, but it is often difficult to achieve. /g216/g32Resettlement: In the context of internal displacement, resettlement is used to describe the process of starting a new life in any place other than the place of original residence, but still within the same country . Depending on the circumstances of displacement and root causes of conflict, resettlement may be the only reasonable option for some internally displaced. /g216/g32Reintegration: The process that makes either return or resettlement sustainable or durable is the process of reintegration or integration . In the context of internal displacement, reintegration is used to describe the re-entry of formerly internally displaced people back into the social, economic, cultural and political fabric of their original community.

In both reintegration and integration, long-term assistance and or protection may be needed by returning or resettling internally displaced. /g216/g32Voluntary decision: The concept of voluntary decisions by the internally displaced is critical to sound programming during return or resettlement, so let's discuss this for a moment. In the context of internal displacement, a voluntary decision -- to borrow some definitions from UNHCR -- is a decision that contains two elements: (1) freedom of choice and (2) an informed decision . --Freedom of choice is defined, first, by the absence of any physical, psychological or material pressure and, second, by the availability of choices. --Naturally, when making a decision to return or resettle an internally displaced person will be influenced to some degree by different factors including peer pressure, statements by national authorities and assistance or lack thereof by international organizations. --In cases where encouragement turns into pressure on the internally displaced, or where the displaced do not have a range of choice, there is obviously a lesser amount of freedom to make a decision. /g216/g32When international organizations are called upon to assess the voluntariness of a decision by internally displaced persons, it is useful to recall the distinction UNHCR makes between so called \"push factors\" and \"pull factors.\" 632 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-6 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Introduction to Module VI (Continued) /g216/g32The pull factors are conditions in the area of return that encourage a displaced person to return, whereas push factors are conditions in the area of temporary settlement that encourage a displaced family to leave. In the assessment of freedom of choice, the pull factor is generally more indicative of freedom of choice. /g216/g32One determinant of voluntary choice is the amount of information available to displaced individuals to make a decision. International organizations and national authorities must make every effort to ensure that as much information as possible is available to the displaced on conditions within the areas of return or resettlement. Lead a discussion of why the displaced sometimes must resettle elsewhere within their country. /g183/g32Before we leave these important decisions, we should examine why -- when the displaced generally prefer to return home -- they sometimes must resettle elsewhere within their country. Ask the following question: /g34What are some reasons why displaced communities might not be able to return home? Solicit and record ideas on chart paper. After these are listed, relate the reasons listed below, either connecting them to ideas volunteered by the class or filling in gaps. 1. Ongoing warfare in home areas 2. Communal conflict and/or resentment by those remaining in the home area 3.

Difficulty in assessing conditions in home area Central Themes Identified in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (20 minutes) Present the following central themes relating to return, resettlement, and reintegration: Show Slide 6-3 Core Themes /g183/g32In a recent analysis of the Guiding Principles , the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) identified six core themes contained in Section V: \"Principles Relating to Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration.\" These core themes are: /g216/g32Voluntariness and conditions of safety and dignity , describing some of the fundamental conditions necessary for return or resettlement 634 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-8 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Central Themes Identified in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (Continued) /g216/g32The principle of non-discrimination , referring to treating the displaced fairly and in the same manner as those around them /g216/g32The role of national authorities and priorities for international organizations /g216/g32Participation and communication , which looks at the management of decisions and programs by the internally displaced themselves /g216/g32Property issues, which is frequently a major source of conflict, and /g216/g32Access by humanitarian organizations , when these organizations are assisting return or resettlement Ask participants to turn to page 6-4 in their Participant Guide and tell participants the following: /g183/g32I have listed these core themes on the left-hand column of this handout. On the same handout, on the right-hand column, I have listed principles 28.1, 28.2, 29.1, 29.2, and 30 -- those Guiding Principles related to return, resettlement and reintegration. /g183/g32Please turn to the Guiding Principles themselves, and review these Principles. /g183/g32By drawing lines from the right to left columns, please indicate which Guiding Principles state or reinforce the core themes identified by NRC. /g34Ask participants the following questions: Are there any of the NRC themes that are not supported by the Guiding Principles ? Are there important themes in the Guiding Principles that NRC did not identify?

Voluntary Return in Conditions of Safety and Dignity (5 minutes) Make the following points about the first core theme: voluntary return in conditions of safety and dignity: /g183/g32Now I would like to go into a little more detail on these core themes identified in the Guiding Principles , before we examine practical steps that agencies can take to support the rights of internally displaced persons during return, resettlement, and reintegration. /g183/g32Let's begin with the first theme: voluntary return in conditions of safety and dignity. /g183/g32Drawn from the refugee protection regime, the concepts of \"voluntariness\" and \"return in safety and dignity\" have been adapted to fit the needs of the internally displaced by the Guiding Principles . /g183/g32According to the refugee protection regime, \"voluntariness\" follows from the principle of non-refoulement (or forced return), (article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention). A return that is not voluntary is considered to be \"refoulement,\" therefore against the principles of the 1951 Convention. /g183/g32Unlike the principle of voluntariness, the concepts of safety and dignity are not drawn from the legal refugee protection regime but find their origins in the operational experience of UNHCR in return programs .636 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-10 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Voluntary Return in Conditions of Safety and Dignity (Continued) /g183/g32The need for internally displaced persons to return or resettle in conditions of safety is axiomatic. However, it is important to view safety as a concept that includes much more than the element of physical safety. In fact, safety in a return context also includes legal safety and ma terial safety. /g183/g32The concept of dignity is less self-evident than safety. According to UNHCR, in practice dignity means that: returning displaced families are \"not manhandled, that they can return unconditionally and if they are doing so spontaneously they can do so at their own pace, that they are not arbitrarily separated from family members; and that they are treated with respect by the authorities and full acceptan ce by the national authorities, including the full restoration of their rights.\" /g183/g32While promoting the right to freedom of choice and informed decision-making, particular attention should be paid to women- heads of households and unaccompanied children to ensure that they have freedom of choice and their right to make a free choice are respected. /g183/g32There exists a vast array of mechanisms to supply returnees with information such as radio shows, public information campaigns, look and see visits and so on. It is worth keeping in mind though, that in many cases the displaced themselves will probably have a very well established information network of their own. Non-discrimination and Equality of Participation and Access (10 minutes) Make the following points about the second core theme: non- discrimination and equality of participation and access: /g183/g32Essential to the fulfillment of the n eeds of returning or resettling internally displaced is the need to be free from discrimination. The concepts of equality before the law, equal protection of the law and non-discrimination form a cornerstone of international human rights law. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 637Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-11 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Non-discrimination and Equality of Participation and Access (Continued) /g183/g32Returning internally displaced persons can be even more exposed when, for example, they are treated as \"enemies\" by the community to which they return or with a high level of suspicion and hostility in the community in which they resettle. Promoting non-discrimination and equal access is key to supporting the (re)integration process. /g183/g32For returning or resettling the internally displaced, the principle of non-discrimination will have a profound impact on the success or failure of the reintegration or integration process. Show Slide 6-4 Areas Where Non-discriminatory Treatment Is Crucial /g183/g32There are several areas where non-discriminatory treatment is especially crucial to an integration or reintegration process: /g216/g32In addition to equal access to judicial apparatus, internally displaced also have the right to equal protection from police or public law and order forces and should expect that if they are victims of a crime that equal efforts would be made on their behalf. /g216/g32Access to public services such as education and health services is crucial. Internally displaced, in order to become settled in either their community of origin or community of resettlement, should have equal access to public services. Any reconstruction activities on public services such as schools or health clinics should be conditioned on equal access for all members of the community /g216/g32Equal access to public and communal affairs is another important area for returning or re settling internally displaced. The right to participate in communal decision-making as well as exercising political choice is an important part of creating hope and a sense of future. 638 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-12 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Non-discrimination and Equality of Participation and Access (Continued) /g216/g32Freedom of access and non-discrimination of vulnerable groups such as women within internally displaced communities is something that must always be considered. The importance of non-discrimination refers to more than the equal treatment and access of former internally displaced vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the community. It also refers to the non discriminatory treatment of women, children and other vulnerable groups within the formerly displaced population. /g183/g32The last aspect of nondiscrimination to consider is the counterpoint to what has been discussed up to now; that is, the host or community of return should not be discriminated against in favor of former or resettling internally displaced, to the extent of creating disparities with the local population. National authorities and international assistance efforts, while recognizing needs and vulnerabilities, should ensure that returnees or resettled families are not granted undue benefit and privileges because of their former condition. Reconstruction, the Role of the Government or National Authorities and International Actors (5 minutes) Present the following information on the third core theme: the role of the government or national authorities and international actors: /g183/g32It is crucial to always keep in mind that national authorities ultimately have the legal obligation and responsibility to establish and create conditions conducive to return. Ask participants to turn to Principle 28. /g183/g32Principle 28 of the Guiding Principles, for example, makes it clear that \"competent authorities,\" be they government or non-state agents, have the \" primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions and provide the means...\"Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 639Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-13 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Reconstruction, the Role of the Government or National Authorities and International Actors (Continued) /g183/g32On the one hand the language used in the Guiding Principles is quite clear and has signifi cant implications for international organizations: their role is to support and complement, but not replace, the responsible national authorities. /g183/g32While the language used to define the responsibility of national authorities is quite explicit, there are also implicit qualifications in Principle 28 that reflect the realities and complexities of reintegration. /g183/g32The use of the phrase 'to endeavour to facilitate integration' is a recognition that, while national authorities should do all in their power to promote conducive conditions, ultimately the processes of reintegration or integration depends on attitudes at the community level and other complex factors. Participation and Communication (5 minutes) Present the following information on the fourth core theme: participation and communication: /g183/g32The concept of participatory involvement of the internally displaced in the decisions that affect their lives is reinforced throughout this training program. The involvement of the beneficiaries of a program in decisions that affect their lives has been elaborated in the operating policies of many humanitarian agencies. /g183/g32In the Sphere Project, a coalition of NGOs attempts to identify minimum standards to be applied in disaster response. The minimum standards include this statement, which is directly relevant to return and resettlement of displaced persons:640 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-14 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Participation and Communication (Continued) Disaster response assistance should never be imposed upon the beneficiaries. Effective relief and lasting rehabilitation can best be achieved where the intended beneficiaries are involved in the design, management and implementation of the assistance programme. We will strive to achieve full community participation in our relief and rehabilitation programmes. /g183/g32Within UNHCR's Handbook on Voluntary Repatriation: International Protection, UNDP policy statements, and the policies of other agencies, similar conclusions can be found. Participatory Decision-making (25 minutes) Introduce the activity by telling participants the following: /g183/g32Because of the concept of participatory involvement by the internally displaced during decisions to return or resettle, let's take a few minutes to examine some of the practical issues that arise regarding participatory decision-making. Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32Take a few moments to look over the list of questions in your Participant Guide on page VI-9. /g183/g32Then break out into regional groups, and see if you can agree on answers to these questions. /g183/g32Please select one member of your group to report to the whole group those questions for which you recorded answers and those on which you could not agree. /g183/g32The questions are:Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 641Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-15 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Participatory Decision-making (Continued) 1) Is it possible to involve both local/host communities and returning or resettling internally displaced in program design and management without replicating the cleavages or conflict that originally caused displacement? If so how should it be done? 2) In a return or resettlement situation, following displacement, societies and cultural values are often in a state of flux or change. In these situations should the international community be using relief and protection programs to change traditional values to promote human rights, for example in the treatment of women? How and when? Or, alternatively, should the international community be trying to reinfor ce traditional leadership systems, in order to maintain social stability in the displaced community? 3) How should community representatives be chosen for discussions on return or resettlement? What can be done to ensure they are truly representative? 4) What kind or mechanisms, structures or forums can be used for a promoting a participatory approach in decisions to return or resettle? 5) If return is not the only viable option, when and under what circumstances should a decision to resettle rather than return be made? Property Issues (10 minutes) Present the following information on the fifth core theme: property issues: /g183/g32The property of internally displaced persons is often lost or destroyed as a result of displacement. /g183/g32Destruction or theft of crops and livestock, the bombing or burning of buildings and the confiscation or forcible occupation of private property by military or paramilitary forces are among the experiences faced by returning internally displaced persons, especially following situations of armed conflict. 642 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-16 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Property Issues (Continued) /g183/g32These situations then frequently become obstacles to return and raise questions concerning the right to restitution for property or compensation for its loss. In addition to non-movable property, the internally displaced because of their vulnerability, also need protection for the property left to them or acquired during displacement. /g183/g32There is a certain trend in general human rights instruments, along with the progressive development of international law, to allow for restitution or compensation for property lost during displacement. /g183/g32The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has, for example, recommended payment of just compensation to returning internally displaced persons for loss of their property including homes, crops, livestock and other belongings. /g183/g32The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which led to the end of the armed conflict in former Yugoslavia, established a Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees. In Kosovo, the UN Centre for Human Settlement established a Housing and Property Directorate and Housing and Property Claims Commission. /g183/g32The rules of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia allow the tribunal to award the restitution of property or its proceeds to victims following a conviction even when the property is in the hands of a third party. /g183/g32In 1998 the Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution on housing and property restitution in the context of the return of refugees and internally displaced. Apart from recommending that the recognition of such rights be included in peace agreements, such as it was in the Dayton Peace Accords, it also urged: Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 643Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-17 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Property Issues (Continued) \"All States to ensure the free and fair exercise of the right to return to one's home and place of habitual residence by all refugees and internally displaced persons and to develop effective and expeditious legal, administrative and other procedures to ensure the free and fair exercise of this right, including fair and effective mechanisms designed to resolve outstanding housing and property problems.\" /g183/g32The recovery of lost property or restitution is given a central place within the Guiding Principles , which focus not only on the protection of property occupied before displacement but also property acquired during displacement. Principle 29(2) of the Guiding Principles also refers explicitly to both movable and immovable property. /g183/g32Often property issues are closely linked to sustainable return by directly affecting return ees' ability to create a self- sustainable livelihood. /g183/g32In the case of rural communities, access to farmland is crucial in allowing returnees to become self-sufficient and avoid aid dependency. In urban communities access to commercial premises is equally important. /g183/g32In all cases, access to one's prior property has profound psychological significance to returnees in the healing and reintegration process. 644 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-18 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Real Experiences: The Case of Georgia (30 minutes) Introduce the activity by telling participants the following: /g183/g32Now let's look at an example of property issues. Conduct the activity by asking participants to do the following: /g183/g32Turn to \"Real Experiences: The Case of Georgia\" on page VI-12 of your Participant Guide and read it. /g183/g32Examine the questions following the case. The questions are as follows: 1. Is the Georgia plan workable? What is missing to make it viable? 2. Is the Georgia approach replicable elsewhere? Why or why not? 3. What should happen if residents \"purchase\" houses or other property from fleeing displaced persons at prices well below the actual value? Should the purchaser retain title to the property? 4. Does the Georgia approach adequately address the situation of widows, daughters, or female property owners?

Would any of these other techniques assist returning displaced persons to regain adequate housing? --The establishment of a Government Housing Fund that issues housing vouchers or individual subsidies, which can only be redeemed in relation to the construction of residences. --Government assistance for returnees in finding an empty existing flat or in accessing new housing --Tax reductions could be given returnees for a certain period --Returnees could be placed at the head of the official housing waiting list --State land plots could be allocated to the returnees --Government bonds in a substantial sum could be provided to returnees, or --Returnees could be given favourable housing credits for building materials, should they choose to build new houses themselves. 646 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Page VI-20 Internally Displaced Persons Facilitator Guide Humanitarian Access (5 minutes) Present the following information on the sixth core theme: humanitarian access. /g183/g32 In order to deliver humanitarian assistance, relief workers and their organizations must have unimpede d access to the internally displaced, not only in areas of temporary settlement but also in areas of return or resettlement. /g183/g32In return or resettlement situations, various General Assembly resolutions invite States to facilitate the work of international and non-governmental organizations in implementing humanitarian assistance, in particular by supplying food, medicines and health care. /g183/g32GA resolutions, of course, recognize the primary role of the State but do not consider such offers of assistance by international organizations and non-governmental organizations to constitute interference in the internal affairs of a state. /g183/g32In recent years, the United Nations Security Council has also made several key decisions relating to humanitarian assistance and protection by insisting or calling for \"immediate\" or \"unimpeded\" access by international organizations to all those in need of assistance. /g183/g32The Guiding Principles support both international humanitarian law and human rights law through a broad declaration that national authorities should grant rapid and unimpeded access to all internally displaced in a return situation.

Resettlement In the context of internal displacement, resettlement is used to describe the process of starting a new life in any place other than the place of original residence, but still within the same country . Depending on the circumstances of displacement and root causes of conflict, resettlement may be the only reasonable option for some internally displaced. Reintegration The process that makes either return or resettlement sustainable or durable is the process of reintegration or integration . In the context of internal displacement, reintegration is used to describe the re-entry of formerly internally displaced people back into the social, economic, cultural and political fabric of their original community. Integration In the context of internal displacement, integration describes the same or similar process of entry into the social, economic, cultural and political fabric, but as it occurs to formerly displaced settling into a new community or deciding to stay in the community where they first found temporary settlement. In both reintegration and integration, long-term assistance and or protection may be needed by returning or resettling internally displaced. Voluntary decision The concept of voluntary decisions by the internally displaced is critical to sound programming during return or resettlement, so let's discuss this for a moment. In the context of internal displacement, a voluntary decision -- to borrow some definitions from UNHCR -- is a decision that contains two elements: (1) freedom of choice and (2) an informed decision .Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 655Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-3 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Central Themes Identified in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement /g183/g32Voluntariness and conditions of safety and dignity , describing some of the fundamental conditions necessary for return or resettlement /g183/g32The principle of non-discrimination , referring to the treatment of the displaced fairly and in the same manner as those around them /g183/g32The role of national authorities and priorities for international organizations /g183/g32Participation and communication , which looks at the management of decisions and programs by the internally displaced themselves /g183/g32Property issues, which is frequently a major source of conflict, and /g183/g32Access by humanitarian organizations , when these organizations are assisting return or resettlement 656 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-4 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Matching Core Themes and Guiding Principles Voluntariness and conditions of safety and dignity Guiding Principle 28.1 The principle of non-discrimination Guiding Principle 28.2 The role of national authorities and priorities for international organizations Guiding Principle 29.1 Participation and communication Guiding Principle 29.2 Property issues Guiding Principle 30 Access by humanitarian organizations Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 657Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-5 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Voluntariness and Conditions of Safety and Dignity /g183/g32Drawn from the refugee protection regime, the concepts of \"voluntariness\" and \"return in safety and dignity\" have been adapted to fit the needs of the internally displaced by the UN Guiding Principles . /g183/g32According to the refugee protection regime, \"voluntariness\" follows from the principle of non-refoulement (or forced return), (article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention). A return that is not voluntary is considered to be \"refoulement,\" therefore against the principles of the 1951 Convention. /g183/g32Unlike the principle of voluntariness, the concepts of safety and dignity are not drawn from the legal refugee protection regime but find their origins in the operational experience of UNHCR in return programs. /g183/g32The need for internally displaced persons to return or resettle in conditions of safety is axiomatic. However, it is important to view safety as a concept that includes much more than the element of physical safety. In fact, safety in a return context also includes legal safety and material safety. /g183/g32The concept of dignity is less self-evident than safety. According to UNHCR, in practice dignity means that: returning displaced families are \"not manhandled, that they can return unconditionally and if they are doing so spontaneously they can do so at their own pace, that they are not arbitrarily separated from family members; and that they are treated with respect by the authorities and full acceptance by the national authorities, including the full restoration of their rights.\" /g183/g32While promoting the right to freedom of choice and informed decision-making, particular attention should be paid to women-heads of households and unaccompanied children to ensure that they have freedom of choice and their right to make a free choice are respected. /g183/g32There exists a vast array of mechanisms to supply returnees with information such as radio shows, public information campaigns, look and see visits and so on. It is worth keeping in mind though, that in many cases the displaced themselves will probably have a very well established information network of their own.658 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-6 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Non-discrimination and Equality of Participation and Access /g183/g32Essential to the fulfillment of the needs of returning or resettling internally displaced is the need to be free from discrimination. The concepts of equality before the law, equal protection of the law and non-discrimination form a cornerstone of international human rights law. /g183/g32Returning internally displaced persons can be even more exposed when, for example, they are treated as \"enemies\" by the community to which they return or with a high level of suspicion and hostility in the community in which they resettle. Promoting non-discrimination and equal access is key to supporting the (re)integration process. /g183/g32For returning or resettling the internally displaced, the principle of non-discrimination will have a profound impact on the success or failure of the reintegration or integration process. /g183/g32There are several areas where non-discriminatory treatment is especially crucial to an integration or reintegration process: /g216/g32In addition to equal access to judicial apparatus, internally displaced also have the right to equal protection from police or public law and order forces and should expect that if they are victims of a crime that equal efforts would be made on their behalf. /g216/g32Access to public services such as education, health services is crucial. Internally displaced in order to become settled in either their community of origin or community of resettlement should have equal access to public services. Any reconstruction activities on public services such as schools or health clinics should be conditioned on equal access for all members of the community /g216/g32Equal to access to public and communal affairs is another important area for returning or resettling internally displaced. The right to participate in communal decision-making as well as exercising political choice is an important part of creating hope and a sense of future. /g216/g32Freedom of access and non-discrimination of vulnerable groups such as women within internally displaced communities is something that must always be considered. The importance of non-discrimination refers to more than the equal treatment and access of former internally displaced vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the community it also refers the non discriminatory treatment of women, children and other vulnerable groups within the formerly displaced population.

The involvement of the beneficiaries of a program in decisions that affect their lives has been elaborated in the operating policies of many humanitarian agencies. /g183/g32In the Sphere Project, a coalition of NGOs attempts to identify minimum standards to be applied in disaster response. The minimum standards include this statement, which is directly relevant to return and resettlement of displaced persons: \"Disaster response assistance should never be imposed upon the beneficiaries. Effective relief and lasting rehabilitation can best be achieved where the intended beneficiaries are involved in the design, management and implementation of the assistance programme. We will strive to achieve full community participation in our relief and rehabilitation programmes.\" Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 661Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-9 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Participatory Decisionmaking 1) Is it possible to involve both local/host communities and returning or resettling internally displaced in program design and management without replicating the cleavages or conflict that originally caused displacement? If so how should it be done? 2) In a return or resettlement situation, following displacement, societies and cultural values are often in a state of flux or change. In these situations should the international community be using relief and protection programs to change traditional values to promote human rights, for example in the treatment of women? How and when? Or, alternatively, should the international community be trying to reinforce traditional leadership systems, in order to maintain social stability in the displaced community? 3) How should community representatives be chosen for discussions on return or resettlement? What can be done to ensure they are truly representative? 4) What kind or mechanisms, structures or forums can be used for a promoting a participatory approach in decisions to return or resettle? 5) If return is not the only viable option, when and under what circumstances should a decision to resettle rather than return be made? 662 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-10 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Property Issues /g183/g32The property of internally displaced persons is often lost or destroyed as a result of displacement. /g183/g32Destruction or theft of crops and livestock, the bombing or burning of buildings and the confiscation or forcible occupation of private property by military or paramilitary forces are among the experiences faced by returning internally displaced persons, especially following situations of armed conflict. /g183/g32These situations then frequently become obstacles to return and raise questions concerning the right to restitution for property or compensation for its loss. In addition to non-movable property, the internally displaced because of their vulnerability, also need protection for the property left to them or acquired during displacement. /g183/g32There is a certain trend in general human rights instruments, along with the progressive development of international law, to allow for restitution or compensation for property lost during displacement. /g183/g32The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has, for example, recommended payment of just compensation to returning internally displaced persons for loss of their property including homes, crops, livestock and other belongings. /g183/g32The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which led to the end of the armed conflict in former Yugoslavia, established a Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persona and Refugees. In Kosovo, the UN Centre for Human Settlement established a Housing and Property Directorate and Housing and Property Claims Commission. /g183/g32The rules of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia allow the tribunal to award the restitution of property or its proceeds to victims following a conviction even when the property is in the hands of a third party. /g183/g32In 1998 the Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution on housing and property restitution in the context of the return of refugees and internally displaced. Apart from recommending that the recognition of such rights be included in peace agreements such as it was in the Dayton Peace Accords, it also urged: Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 663Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-11 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Property Issues (Continued) \"All States to ensure the free and fair exercise of the right to return to one's home and place of habitual residence by all refugees and internally displaced persons and to develop effective and expeditious legal, administrative and other procedures to ensure the free and fair exercise of this right, including fair and effective mechanisms designed to resolve outstanding housing and property problems.\" The recovery of lost property or restitution is given a central place within the Guiding Principles, which focus not only on the protection of property occupied before displacement but also property acquired during displacement. Principle 29(2) of the Guiding Principles also refer explicitly to both movable and immovable property. /g183/g32Often property issues are closely linked to sustainable return by directly affecting returnees' ability to create a self-sustainable livelihood. /g183/g32In the case of rural communities, access to farmland is crucial in allowing returnees to become self-sufficient and avoid aid dependency. In urban communities access to commercial premises is equally important. /g183/g32In all cases access to one's prior property has profound psychological significance to returnees in the healing and reintegration process. 664 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-12 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Real Experiences: The Case of Georgia At the request of the Government of Georgia, UNHCR in July 1998 undertook to provide guidelines for resolving outstanding property and housing issues which were seen as the principle impediment to large-scale return of IDPs and refugees displaced by the 1990-1992 Georgia-South Ossetian conflict. Housing and Property Restitution Issues in the Context of Return to and within Georgia: An International Legal Perspective* Following the Georgian-Ossetion conflict much of the housing in Georgia originally registered to refugees and IDPs particularly in urban areas was occupied, as in Bosnia, Tajikistan, Rwanda and other post-conflict societies, by secondary occupants who were unwilling to voluntarily vacate. As such the original residences of IDPs wishing to return home remained inaccessible. While this is an increasingly common feature of ethnic conflict, the Georgia-Ossetian situation presented added complications in that tenancy rights once held by the original inhabitants were not lost in a purely arbitrarily manner. Often, subsequent occupation was judicially sanctioned through biased applications of a 'six- month vacancy rule' under the 1983 Housing Code. The rule stipulated that a tenant could lose his or her right to reside in a given apartment if they were absent for a period of over six-months without 'a valid reason'. The courts frequently mis-applied this provision, arguing that the flight of a refugee or IDP \"was not a valid reason to vacate their home.\" The study by UNHCR recommended a multi-pronged strategy. It emphasized that both the rights of refugees and IDPs and the rights of the secondary occupants should be fully secured throughout the process of return and that the housing rights of all affected persons should be guaranteed such that no person becomes homeless in the process. Several key measures were recommended to redress past injustices, increase confidence and build a basis for national reconstruction and reconciliation. The measures included: APresidential Decree was to officially proclaim the right of refugees and IDPs to voluntarily return to their original homes, in an environment of equality, with full protection of human rights and clear guarantees of safety and security. The Decree was to form the first part of the return process. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 665Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-13 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide The second element of the return package envisaged the adoption of a Housing and Property Restitution Law clearly outlining the legal position of affected refugees, IDPs and secondary occupants with respect to all aspects of their housing and property rights. The study recommended that new legislation should ensure the right of refugees and IDPs to the restitution of their original homes should they wish to reclaim them. In cases where returnees did not wish to return to their original homes, the law was to oblige the State to secure adequate housing for them in such manner that \"no detriment is suffered vis-a-vis their original housing situation,\" and which ensured the right of refugees and IDPs (should they choose to invoke it) to ownership of a dwelling. Finally, the report recommended, within the framework of the housing and property restitution law, the establishment of an independent and impartial, three-person Housing and Property Claims Commission (HPCC) to examine any housing or property claims by refugees, IDPs or secondary occupants. The HPCC was to be vested with the powers required to determine the housing and property rights of the claimants and thus guarantee every returnee the right to an effective remedy and the right to have his or her case heard on an individual basis.

More than 20,000 persons were killed out of a population of about five and a half million. The fighting led to the exile of approximately 100,000 into neighboring countries and the internal displacement of some 600,000. Tajikistan has a large part of its territory covered by high mountains, frequently creating problems of movement between different parts of the country, and causing the relative isolation of communities. With the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which created a power vacuum, latent conflicts erupted among different ethnic groups within the artificial borders of states. In Tajikistan, antagonism quickly emerged between those wanting to preserve the existing system and power structures and those challenging the regime by advocating reforms. The conflict was compounded by regional differences, with ethnic and political affiliations. It gradually degenerated into widespread violence, and escalated into civil war. It can be said that, as a national entity, Tajikistan was artificially created in the sense that an external power united regions and peoples that had only a limited sense of common identity. According to the 1989 USSR census, the population (then 5.1 million) consisted of three major ethnic groups: Tajiks (61%), Uzbeks (23.5%), and Russians (7.6%). The Tajik majority can be further subdivided according to places of origin and local cultural and linguistic variations, with Garmis and Pamiris prominent among subgroups. Beyond these ethnic distinctions, both aspirations for regional autonomy and competition between proponents of an Islamic society, on one hand, and those who upheld a secular state system, on the other, contributed to the conflict. All of these tensions were exacerbated by the political uncertainty, declining economy and general scarcity of resources following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Nature of Displacement: A unique aspect of Tajikistan, which affects the nature of displacement, was the Stalin-era alteration of the demographics of southwestern Tajikistan - a center of conflict and displacement - as part of the Soviet Union's efforts to increase cotton production. Under Stalin, many Garmis and Pamiris from the mountainous areas of the country were forcibly transferred to the southwest to provide labor. These groups integrated only partially with local communities, usually living in separate villages and retaining a sense of ethnic separateness. 1 The following case study is distilled from the Report prepared by the Representative of the Secretary- General on Internally Displaced Persons, UN document A/51/483/Add.1 , of 24 October 1996 .Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 673Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-21 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Country Case Study: Tajikistan, 1992-96 (Continued) In this regard, the term \"regionalism\" and the related \"two homes\" concept are key to understanding the lines along with the conflict developed and the routes fleeing civilians decided to take. Persons who found themselves in a minority position in their areas of residence sought refuge in their regions of ethnic origin. In the southwest, for example, despite migration for economic reasons five decades ago, many of the displaced had historical and family links with their ancestral homelands in other regions of Tajikistan. The internally displaced, therefore, can be said to have had two homes: the one being the region where they had ties through their ethnic origins, but where possibilities for sustaining themselves were limited; the other being where they had their houses and lands, but where they had integrated only to a limited extent. Fighting between regular and irregular forces spawned attacks on civilians, often based on ethnic origin. By June 1992, many citizens of Tajikistan chose to flee. A predominant feature of the fighting was that houses and sometimes entire villages belonging to displaced civilians were systematically looted, with roofing material, windows and doors removed, or simply destroyed by fire. Many villages were either totally destroyed or completely unharmed, in accordance with the ethnic origin of their inhabitants. Another unique aspect of the displacement concerned the disposition of property by IDPs. The homes of some displaced were looted or occupied by others, as IDPs departed. Sometimes, however, those fleeing managed to sell their property first. The conditions under which the sales were concluded - in haste, out of fear of destruction, with little prospect of return - often led to a very low sales price. Eventually, approximately 600,000 fled to other parts of Tajikistan. Because of the traditional kinship patterns noted above, IDPs tended to concentrate in certain regions, increasing demands on poorer, mountainous regions of the country. For example, Gorno-Badakhshan, with a population below 200,000, received at least 100,000 displaced. Situation during Displacement: The civil war in Tajikistan was relatively brief, with heavy fighting ending by Spring of 1993. Many internally displaced have not yet received international assistance. Notable exceptions are the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which mobilized food and medical assistance during the 1992 conflict, and the Aga Khan Foundation, which has taken an active role in meeting needs of the primarily Ismaili Muslim residents of Gorno-Badakhshan. 674 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-22 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Country Case Study: Tajikistan, 1992-96 (Continued) Many displaced have received food, clothing and shelter from extended families. Given the kinship ties during the period of displacement, and the relative poverty of areas where IDPs fled, the ICRC has chosen to assist the entire population in areas where it works, without distinguishing between the internally displaced and local populations. The government role in providing assistance has been limited, although some IDPs have been provided shelter in public buildings. Partial Return and Reintegration: The internally displaced have started returning on their own initiative, without receiving assistance, beginning in the first few months after the conflict subsided. However, the trip to their places of habitual residence has been difficult for many IDPs, characterized by severe weather, inadequate transport and, most significantly, insecure conditions - including attacks by irregular bands - during the return trip. Public transportation for returning internally displaced has been provided by the Government, when transport was available. But, early attempts by the Government to assist this process also included attempts at forcible return. Some returnees were provided with neither food nor water for the transport, and no preparations have been made at the places of destination for their reception. Moreover, local communities, hostile to the returnees, have blocked the rails in at least one case, and refused to permit passengers to disembark. Now, Government authorities seem more open to accepting the participation of international agencies. While some individual returnees have been able to return to their own homes, and others found occupied or destroyed structures, all returnee communities require assistance with safe water supplies, food, medical supplies, shelter, education, and reconstruction of economic activities, including seeds for planting. With regard to food assistance , needs are great. In many cases, international organizations\u2014aware that IDPs in a region tended to represent one ethnic group, and sensitive to public perceptions that certain ethnic groups were responsible for the conflict - are providing food assistance to all needy target groups within areas of return, without distinction as to former displacement, in order to avoid resentment. Observers have noted, unfortunately, that food assistance appears to induce a degree of passivity and dependency on the part of returnee communities, perhaps a legacy of the former Soviet system.

With regard to shelter , there is a requirement for the reconstruction of houses in 170 villages in returnee areas. In the education sector, some efforts have been made by the international community to repair damaged school buildings and heat them in the winter, provide food for work as an incentive for teachers, and distribute food to children to encourage school attendance. School attendance nevertheless takes place in two or three daily shifts, and is seriously affected by the need for returnee children to work to earn money. Economic reconstruction in returnee communities is stifled by destruction, lack of access to critical inputs (credit, supplies, seed), disruption of trade by armed bands and other factors. In addition to meeting basic material needs of returnees, the international community faces serious protection issues . Although some communities welcome returnees, there has often been considerable hostility among the local population. The problem of insecurity was particularly difficult during the early post-war period, when the lack of law and order allowed uncontrolled armed bands to take justice into their own hands.This period was characterized by numerous disappearances, killings, beatings and other forms of harassment of the returnees. The Government of Tajikistan has generally placed a high priority on return, and made attempts - within its means - to facilitate return and reintegration. For example, the government recently adopted a law \"on forced migrants.\" The law regulates registration procedures and provides for assistance to and protection for the internally displaced. During the displacement phase, the law grantes IDPs the right to accommodation, help to find work or unemployment allowances, and free food. Further, the law provides for the return of their property, or for compensation, and protection against forcible return.When resettling, IDPs are legally entitled to free return transport, the right to repossess property, a lump sum allowance, temporary shelter, free food, medical services, and work equivalent to their previous experience. 676 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Basic Course on Internal Displacement: Background, Program Foundations and Program Approaches for International Agency Staff Module VI: Return, Resettlement, and Reintegration Page VI-24 of Internally Displaced Persons Participant Guide Country Case Study: Tajikistan, 1992-96 (Continued) General insecurity, ill-prepared officials, pressure by local groups, extra-legal harassment, a weak court system, mistrust of officials by returnees, and other difficult issues has made protection for returnees in Tajikistan a complex and resource-intensive undertaking. Issues related to Internal Displacement in Tajikistan: Management model: There is uncertainty about the best management model to meet IDP needs. Despite the isolation of the country and international organizations' relative unfamiliarity with the republics of the former Soviet Union, how can the UN system be best organized to focus on IDP problems in Tajikistan? Participation of Displaced Communities: Several observers have noted the seeming passivity of IDPs in Tajikistan, when groups receive international assistance. How can more attention be paid, through research and analysis, to ways to engage displaced communities in planning relief and return efforts? Prevention Activities: Clearly, the conflict and resulting displacement in Tajikistan are related to deep and long-standing cleavages in society. How is it possible to establish an early warning system to alert local and international organizations to pending disruption, or to design prevention activities? Given ongoing instability in Tajikistan, would such techniques be beneficial now? Supporting Local Capacity: Despite its transitional nature and instability, the Government of Tajikistan - as illustrated by its law on migrants - has shown some inclination to assist the internally displaced. How can the international community do more to support Government institutions to assume responsibility for assistance to and protection of IDPs? Targeting of Assistance to IDPs : Both for those displaced still living with relatives, and for those who have begun to return to their places of residence, international organizations in Tajikistan have tended to engage in wholesale distribution of assistance, in order to avoid jealousy and tamp down antagonism to IDPs. How can these realities be balanced with the need to target benefits to those who had been displaced? Alerting Government to the Role of International Organizations: Reports indicate that many Tajik Government officials, even at high levels, have little understanding of the role of international organizations proffering aid to IDPs. This has led to confusion, delayed decisions and even suspicion. How can international organizations, including UN agencies, better publicize their roles, and the non-partisan nature of their work?

Linking Relief to Development: How can relief programs be implemented in a timely fashion, but with long-term potential? Addressing Underlying Problems Affecting Internal Displacement: As instability continues in Tajikistan, deep seated issues of ethnicity, religious orientation, regionalism, fairness and capacity of government institutions, and full political participation continue to threaten fragile social harmony, and threaten future displacement. How can the international community do more to address these large, underlying issues as a method of avoiding internal displacement in the future? 678 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons VI-1At the end of the module you will At the end of the module you will be able tobe able to /g108Describe the rights of individuals, as expl ained in th e Guiding Principles, during return, resettlement, and reintegration /g108Explain the two durable solutions -- return or resettlement -- available to internally displaced persons, and their relationship to reintegration/integration /g108Discuss the roles and responsibilities of national authorities and the international community during return or resettlement, and during reintegration/integration /g108Explain the importance during return/resettlement of voluntariness and participation by the displaced themselves /g108Discuss the centrality of property issues during return/resettlement and explain techniques for resolving property disputesCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 679 VI-2Definition of termsDefinition of terms /g108Return: Process of going back to one's place of \"habitual residence\" /g108Resettlement: Process of starting a new life in any place other than the place of original residence but still within the same country /g108Reintegration: Re-entry of formerly internally displaced people back into the social, economic, cultural and political fabric of their original community /g108Integration: Same or similar process as it occurs to formerly displaced settling into a new community or in the community where they found temporary settlement680 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons VI-3Core themesCore themes /g108Voluntariness and conditions of safety and dignity /g108The principle of non-discrimination /g108The role of national authorities and priorities for international organizations /g108Participation and communication /g108Property issues /g108Access by humanitarian organizationsCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 681 VI-4Critical areas of nonCritical areas of non -- discriminationdiscrimination /g108Equal protection from police or public law and order forces /g108Access to public services such as education, health services /g108Equal access to public and communal affairs /g108Freedom of access and non-discrimination of vulnerable groups /g108Host or community of return should not be discriminated against in favor of former or resettling internally displaced to the extent of creating disparities with the local population682 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced PersonsCollection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 683Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement Sri Lanka Programme Syllabi By Danesh Jayatilaka, Project Coordinating Officer - Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies (CHA) Introduction Notwithstanding the two decades of civil conflict in Sri Lanka, and the continuing presence of inter- nally displaced persons, a normative framework does not exist in the country to measure protectionnor to articulate best practices in assistance. With the advent of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the development of training modules, legal explanations through annotated publications and the mainstreaming of the Principles bylead humanitarian agencies, an opportunity has arisen in Sri Lanka to utilize fully such developments. In 2001 the Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies (CHA) in collaboration with Brookings Institute Project on Internal Displacement and UNHCR undertook an ambitious endeavor to begin opera-tionalizing the 30 Principles to Sri Lankas IDP related framework through a toolkit/toolbox project.The objective was to enhance the protection and assistance conditions for the reportedly 800,000 reg-istered displaced war victims concentrated in the North and East of the island. A two part programme was hence developed and implementedDissemination of English, Sinhala and Tamil Guiding Principles Toolkit 'What you Can Do' field handbooks among policy makers, programme staff, field persons, internally displaced per- sons and the general public (funded by Brookings Institute Project on Internal Displacement) Implementation of the 5 part Guiding Principles Toolbox field programme in districts (funded by UNHCR) Toolbox programme: Sector 1 Interactive training workshops utilizing numerous teaching tools to familiarize and instill the GPs among audience. The mix was an elaborate collection of cross referencing instruments of varyinginformation parting methodologies, able to create powerful synergy during usage (tools catered to all4 project target groups with audience specific, impact specific and time interval specific 'tool set' mixesformulated). The training component also included methods for outdoor communication and masselectronic advocacy and dissemination of the GPs.684 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal DisplacementCollection of Global Course Syllabi September 2004 Relating to Internally Displaced Persons Sector 2 'Listening to the displaced' sessions to gather data on IDP grievances and deficits in the prevailing national / district/ local assistance and protection framework.

The aim, to strengthen the promotion and protection of the internally displaced personsin Sri Lanka and to enhance and to focus better activities at central and regional levels towards thisend. Learning Objectives Understand Internal Displacement Familiarize one self with principles and best practices for protecting and assisting IDPs Realize professional techniques and methods of IDP protection and assistance approach Be aware of displacement environment and support / protection mechanisms in place Program Description The specialized trainer program is intended for individuals working in the area of protection and assis- tance of IDP's. It has been designed after considerable research and thought, and had taken into con-sideration capacities of various audiences and their requirements. The educational tools therefore area product 'best' combination of, requirement to, material effort to, objective. Collection of Global Course Syllabi Relating to Internally Displaced Persons September 2004 The Brookings-SAIS Project on Internal Displacement 685A fundamental characteristic of the box is getting the audience to 'think', 'understand' and make up their own 'conclusions'. This in place of the rules and coercion used at traditional workshops. Hence,it is very friendly, highly interactive, transparent, educational, reflective and thoroughly appealing. The box has an array of tools with varying objectives and levels. As there are four target audiences, only a carefully selected handful of tools would be utilized at any given time. Further, the structureof the tool combo syllabi is such that there is sufficient flexibility for variation at field workshops. Finally, all recommendations on conduct via the Guiding principles on Internal Displacement are sup- ported with logical rationalizing in the form of events, figures and data to further complement thereasoning nature of the toolbox programme. The Target Audience Policy Makers: Government, Military, Donor Agencies, International Non-Governmental Organizations, and Local Non-Governmental Organizations Programme Staff: Government Agents, International Non-Governmental Agencies and Local Non-Governmental Agencies Field: Government, Security Forces, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), International Non- Governmental Organizations and Local Non-Governmental OrganizationsandInternally Displaced Persons and the General Public General Guidelines for Facilitators The role of the facilitator at workshops is to: 1.
