June 27, 2023 In today's fast-paced society, we're all looking for ways to save time and improve efficiency. When it comes to nutrition, countless services and products are designed to save us time in the kitchen and help us get the nutrients we need with little or no effort. Supplements that offer a vast range of fruits and vegetables in a capsule are one way to do this. A prominent player in that market is Balance of Nature. Balance of Nature has been around for over a quarter of a century, establishing itself as a real force in the health supplement marketplace. Yet, the is also some controversy surrounding the company, with an FDA warning letter, some dubious claims on their official website, and quite a few unfavorable user reviews. So is Balance of Nature the real deal, or is this just another overpriced placebo supplement? Let's dig into the weeds in this Balance of Nature review to find out. Balance of Nature Fruits & Veggies are made from fresh, whole produce. Through our advanced cold vacuum process, the vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients of... Balance of Nature is a health food company that sells two main dietary supplements: Balance of Nature Fruits & Veggies Balance of Nature Fiber & Spice Balance of Nature was formed in 1997 by a chiropractor named Dr. Douglas Howard. Dr. Howard observed how the inability of most people to get in the required daily serving of fruits and vegetables was leading to serious health problems. He developed his fruit and vegetable supplements to allow people to get the equivalent of ten servings of fruits and vegetables daily. To achieve this, the supplement comprises 31 flash-dried fruits and vegetables. All Balance of Nature supplements are marketed as being completely natural and sugar-free, containing no additives, fillers, or preservatives. You cannot fault the ingredient list that makes up the blends that go into Balance of Nature products. They are extensive, covering a wide range of superfoods, phytochemicals, probiotics, and enzymes. Unfortunately, the ingredient dosages are hidden behind proprietary labels, so we have no idea how much of each food we are actually getting. That is a significant problem, preventing us from assessing our intake in reference to RDA guidelines. The Balance of Nature website also has some problems. Although it points to a number of studies to support its many claims, none of those studies are sourced from peer-reviewed journals. Asa a result, they should be taken with a grain of salt. The website also makes some rather dubious claims to the effect that the powdered form of the foods used is superior to taking them in whole-food form. Research has proved the exact opposite to be the case. Another red flag is the fact that Balance of Nature has received a scathing letter from the FDA, pointing out that many of its marketing claims are misleading. The letter also stated that Balance of Nature products were not manufactured in CGMP-approved facilities. Misbranding was also pointed out; for example, the FDA letter stated that wild yams were being listed as yams, although they are a very different product. Balance of Nature's claims to be 3rd party tested also fails to provide any supporting evidence. As a result of these red flags, we are not able to give Balance of Nature our endorsement. Check our alternative reviews later on in this review. Overall Verdict: FAIL The ingredients in all Balance of Nature supplements are listed on the label as groupings of proprietary blends. That means that, rather than giving you the individual dose for each ingredient, you simply get a cumulative total for each blend. That's a problem, as we don't know if we are getting the RDA for the various component ingredients. Here's an overview of each of the blends that make up Balance of Nature Fruits: The Maintain Blend is made up of tomato, papaya, banana, apple, grape, wild blueberry, strawberry, and aloe vera. This blend is rich in antioxidants, including lycopene, along with such minerals as potassium and vitamins A and C. The dietary fiber in papaya helps maintain the digestive system, provides energy, and promotes heart health. Resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and heart-healthy qualities. The Protect Blend is a combination of orange, tart cherry, cranberry, wild blueberry, grape, apple, grapefruit, and aloe vera. This blend provides a great source of Vitamin C to boost the immune system, along with antioxidants that are known to lower inflammation, promote better sleep and improve joint health. Cranberry and wild berries are rich in antioxidants called anthocyanins, which have been associated with brain health, heart function, and urinary system improvement. Aloe vera is also renowned for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects on the skin. The Repair Blend is made up of the following fruits; raspberry, pineapple, mango, sweet cherry, lemon, and aloe vera. This blend is packed with minerals and antioxidants. It also delivers an excellent source of dietary fiber, especially anthocyanins, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain, which helps with digestion and has anti-inflammatory properties. The blend also provides plenty of Vitamins A and C, which are beneficial for a healthy immune system, improved eyesight, and youthful-looking skin. The 16 whole fruits that make up Balance of Nature Veggies are divided into three proprietary blends. Here's an overview of what each is designed to achieve: The Maintain Blend combines broccoli, spinach, soybean, green cabbage, wheatgrass, kale, cauliflower, celery, white onion, and zucchini. This blend provides a great source of vitamins C, K, and A. Ingredients like spinach are also rich in iron, calcium, and magnesium. You also get an abundance of dietary fiber and antioxidants to benefit digestive and cardiovascular health. Soybeans are a complete source of essential amino acids, while wheatgrass supplies your magnesium needs. Ingredients like kale, cauliflower, white onions, and celery are full of phytochemicals, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and fiber. Garlic, red cabbage, red onion, soybean, carrot, kale, cayenne pepper, shiitake mushroom, wheatgrass, and sweet potato. This blend has strong antibacterial and antiviral properties thanks to the combination of ingredients like garlic, red cabbage, and beta-carotene. These compounds help to keep blood vessels healthy. Red cabbage contains the antioxidant anthocyanin, which may have anti-inflammatory effects. The soybeans provide you with all nine essential amino acids, and the cayenne pepper has anti-analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The Repair Blend combines carrot, kale, green onion, soybean, spinach, cauliflower, celery, and zucchini into a formula designed to regenerate, repair and recover the body. This blend provides rich sources of beta-carotene, a vitamin A precursor that is important for eye health. There are also plenty of vitamins A, C, and K and anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties to help ward off those nasty bugs. Balance of Nature. Fiber and Spice supplement divides its ingredients into two proprietary blends. Here's an overview of each one: The Whole Fiber blend combines psyllium, flax, apple, and monk fruit. This blend provides an excellent source of soluble fiber by way of psyllium husk. It absorbs water to form a gel-like consistency that takes up room and fills you up. You also get a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids in this blend, lowering inflammation, promoting heart health, and improving brain function. The Protect & Repair blend contains Cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, fennel, cardamom, cumin, fenugreek, coriander, clove, allspice, mustard seed, and nutmeg. This blend provides potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may increase insulin sensitivity, support heart health, and control blood sugar levels. Ingredients such as curcumin, ginger, and cardamom improve digestion, enhance joint health, and advance general well-being. Fenugreek may contain anti-inflammatory properties, assist lactation in nursing mothers, and help control blood sugar levels. The official Balance of Nature website promotes the following claimed health benefits of Balance of Nature supplements: Balance of Nature's constituent ingredients are all sourced from fresh, whole-food sources. An advanced vacuum-cold process is designed to stabilize maximum nutrient content. This is claimed to optimally preserve each blend's phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals. The website states, 'The scientific blend, or recipe, developed by Dr. Howard does not use a full serving of each fruit and vegetable. A precise and balanced combination was discovered through trial and error, research, and experimentation. This balance is what gives us the wonderful results we enjoy today.' They're saying that the powdered blend of fruits and vegetables used is more effective than the same amounts eaten as whole foods. This is patently false, as substantial research shows that whole foods are, in fact, better for us than their supplement equivalents. Balance of Nature claims to employ an independent company to carry out testing on their supplements. If true, this gives you confidence that what you're putting in your body is precisely what the label lists. However, there is no detail listed on the website about who that 3rd party tester is. Nor are any test results displayed on the website. That makes us somewhat dubious about the third-party testing claim. Balance of Nature claims that when you eat whole foods, such as an apple, even if you chew it thoroughly, you won't be able to absorb all of its nutrients. In fact, the website states you may only get 5% of the food's goodness. In contrast, when you take a powdered form of the food, you get all of its nutrient value. There are no research citations for these claims; we do not accept them as they go against the established science. A proprietary blend of fiber & 12 spices for overall and digestive health... There are plenty of Balance of Nature customer reviews online, and users have very distinct opinions of the health benefits and effectiveness of these supplements. There are also a number of Balance of Nature complaints on review websites. Balance of Nature Fruits and Veggies has a 4-star rating on Amazon, based on more than 12,000 verified customer reviews. Here are a couple of typical examples of what customers have to say about it: Balance of Nature supplements is worth considering for anyone looking to ensure they are consuming a healthy diet rich in vitamins, nutrients, and minerals. It may be taken by people who have trouble consuming the daily recommended 2 to 3 servings of fruits and 3 to 5 servings of vegetables daily. This may include people with dietary restrictions who cannot eat a range of fruits and vegetables. People with limited access to fresh produce may also benefit from Balance of Nature supplements. Seniors who struggle to chew or digest whole foods are another potential market for Balance of Nature products. The recommended dosage is three capsules daily, with each bottle containing 90 capsules, which gives you a one-month supply. The official website also suggests that you can open the capsules to sprinkle the powder on your smoothie, protein shake, salad, or dessert. Balance of Nature products can be purchased from the official Balance of Nature [website](https://www.balanceofnature.com/). You can also purchase them on Amazon and select other online retailers. It can also be found at leading health food stores around the world. There are plenty of fruit and vegetable powders as worthy alternatives to Balance of Nature. Here are profiles of three of our favorite fruit and vegetable supplements that measure up favorably against Balance of Nature: [Transparent Labs REDS](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/Wq6zYM) Is a superfood that combines berries, greens, herbs, and nutrient extracts. It includes such acknowledged superfoods as turmeric, spirulina, and chlorella and organic fruits such as blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. The supplement does a great job of covering all your vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant needs. Reds are a potent source of antioxidants, including resveratrol, quercetin, and lycopene. Adaptogenic herbs like Rhodiola rosea and green tea extract are also included to boost energy, sharpen focus, and assist physical performance. Probiotics and digestive enzymes are other features of Transparent Labs Reds. Transparent Labs emphasizes its dedication to creating pure, all-natural supplements. Reds Superfood does not include any artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors, or preservatives. Natural flavors are added to improve the flavor, and it uses stevia, a plant-based, calorie-free sweetener. Transparent Labs Reds features a delicious red superfoods blend with TruServ\u00ae organic fruit blend, VitaCherry\u00ae tart cherry powder, Spectra\u00ae antioxidants... Athletic Greens are now known as [AG1](https://athleticgreens.sjv.io/nLRv0x). This product impresses with its sheer volume of ingredients, containing 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients in every serving. AG1 is produced in New Zealand, sourcing only the freshest whole food sources. The company is NSF certified for sports. As well as the 75 nutrients in AG1, prebiotics and probiotics enhance gut health and optimize digestion. Although initially designed for athletes, AG1 will prove to be a nutritional powerhouse for anyone who is after a convenient and easy way to get the nutrients they need to thrive. The manufacturer claims that the combined effect of the ingredients is to increase energy, improve immunity, promote gut health, support healthy aging, and improve brain health. Ag1 is a powdered supplement. It comes with a scoop so you can easily mix it with water; the manufacturer recommends taking it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. Each of the 75 ingredients in AG1 work together in harmony to amplify each other's effects to achieve whole-body health and provide your necessary daily nutrients... [Swolverine Greens+Reds](https://bit.ly/3VyU2pJ) is a powdered-form supplement that combines organic super greens and antioxidant-rich reds. These nutrients are sourced from both the land and the sea, including spirulina, chlorella, wheat grass, organic beets, pomegranate, and organic turmeric. The 16 ingredients in Swolverine Greens+Reds are designed to improve overall health, reduce inflammation, improve energy levels, and enhance athletic performance. Unlike with Balance of Nature products, the label is entirely transparent so that you know exactly how much of each compound you are getting. Swolverine has been extremely generous with the dosages of its ingredients. Many of them have 30% higher dosages than the competition. Greens+Reds is a high-quality, proprietary blend-free combination of Organic super greens and antioxidant-rich reds. Greens + Reds contains powerfully rich organic super greens... No, Balance of Nature is not as good for you as the marketing hype might suggest. Despite the health benefits that the company may claim, taking fruits and vegetables in supplement form is not as beneficial for our health as taking them in the whole food form in which they were created. Because we do not know how much of each ingredient is in Balance of Nature, it is also impossible to say whether you are getting sufficient amounts of each compound to make a significant difference. No, the Balance of Nature is not made in China. All Balance of Nature supplements are manufactured in the United States in cGMP-approved facilities. The fruits and vegetables are sourced from local farms and orchards. On August 20th, 2019, The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) sent a strong warning letter to Balance of Nature. The letter stated that \"...the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for dietary supplement...You failed to implement a system of production and process controls to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.55. Specifically, you have not established and implemented a system of production and process controls.\" All three Balance of Nature products are available via subscription as well as a one-off purchase. By subscribing, you will save an average of 22% every month. The following Balance of Nature cost breakdowns are based on a one-month supply. A one-off purchase of Balance of Nature Fruits and Veggies costs $89.95. A subscription purchase will cost $69.95. A one-off purchase of Balance of Nature Fiber & Spirce costs $69.95.

Balance of Nature supplements include a wide spectrum of fruits, vegetables, phytochemicals, minerals, superfoods, and other nutrients needed for optimal health. However, there are some red flags regarding these supplements. The company makes some rather startling claims to the effect that this powdered supplement is better than its whole food counterparts, which are patently false. The use of proprietary formulas prevents us from knowing exactly how much of each ingredient we are getting. Balance of Nature has also been the subject of a harsh warning letter from the FDA regarding its marketing claims. Throw in the uncertainty of its 3rd party testing claims, and Balance of Nature is a brand you may want to avoid unless and until they come clean on the issues surrounding its reputation. However, we can recommend alternatives profiled a little earlier - Transparent Labs REDS, AG1, and Swolverine Greens+Reds are all excellent ways to get your fruits and vegetable quota in a bottle. Transparent Labs Reds features a delicious red superfoods blend with TruServ\u00ae organic fruit blend, VitaCherry\u00ae tart cherry powder, Spectra\u00ae antioxidants...
