HERMAN, SECRETARY OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER Senator S PECTER . Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The Ap- propriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, andEducation will now proceed. We have an extraordinarily distinguished panel, the three secre- taries of the departments, which are funded by this subcommittee.Protocol calls for identifying the secretaries in sequence of appoint-ment. The Department of Labor goes back to 1913, and the Department of Health and Human Services to 1953, and the Department ofEducation to 1979. The President has submitted a budget which totals $106.2 bil- lion, which is a very substantial increase over the $95.1 billionfrom last year. My own view is that in a Federal budget of $1.8trillion, that this is a reasonable figure for the departments whichhave the responsibilities which these three departments have. Now I believe that when you talk about education or health or worker safety, you are talking about a capital investment in Amer-ica. But my views are not widely shared on Capitol Hill. And thereis already talk of a total allocation of a budget far below the $622billion, which the President has requested. It is my hope that we will proceed with the budget process much faster this year than last year. And I believe that the leadershipin both the House and the Senate agree with that.2 We really need to pass these bills and present them to the Presi- dent in a timely way, so that they can be acted upon by the Presi-dent long before the fiscal year ends and not have budgets sub-mitted in October and November, bills submitted in October andNovember, when there is no opportunity to follow the constitutionalprocess, which is the Congress submits the bills, and the Presidenteither signs them or vetoes. We have come to a practice where the Executive Branch sits in on the legislative process. And it is unconstitutional on its face, andI think it is highly undesirable. And there are some significant de-bates. My own sense is to try to beat the President 's figure illustra- tively on education. Last year we came out of the Senate Appro-priations Committee with $500 million above the President. There may be some disagreements on priorities. And the Con- gress has a role, perhaps the lead role, on what those prioritiesought to be. But that cannot be debated when you are into Octoberor November and, if there is a gridlock, the consequence is closingdown the government. This is a very, very ambitious program. The administration is moving into a great many areas which have traditionally been leftto the States. Talk about classroom size and more teachers, talkabout school constructions. I supported our former colleague, CarolMoseley-Braun, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, on efforts to beginon the school construction program. But that is not a widely heldview. And my own sense is that if we make provision for those kinds of programs, there ought to be some discretion at the local level,if the local boards decide they want to do something else, becauseall of the districts are not the same. But we cannot have that de-bate in October and November. But we could have that debate inJuly, August or September. If the President vetoes a bill, let us debate it. Let us see what we are going to do and how the public responds to a little dif-ference in the point of view. This year 's budget has a very ambitious program on youth vio- lence. And I thank the three secretaries and also the Departmentof Justice, and specifically Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder,for working with the subcommittee on a series of meetings lastyear, which resulted in the reallocation of some $893 million on 16programs to try to focus on juvenile violence in a quiet,unpublicized way. But the at-risk children in America are an enor-mous concern. I just saw these statistics today that the Senator prepared from 1992 to the present. There have been 257 school-related violentdeaths, 62 of which involved multiple deaths. I sat down withBruce Reed, the domestic counselor, and talked to him about thecoordination program. And I think that really has great potential. We are going to take a new look at the drug prevention program this year, which is a first cousin of youth violence, and try to takea look to see if we might reallocate some funds with some specificevidence on the drug issue. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee last week heard testimony for $1.6 trillion for money for Colombia. And I am very much inter-ested in stability in Colombia, but I have grave doubts about $1.63 trillion going after a supply, which, if it is not from Colombia, will be from Bolivia or Equador or somewhere else. And I believe we have an imbalance with two-thirds of the money going to the so-called supply side. You have to work oninterdiction. You have to work on street crime. And I spent a lotof my professional life doing that. But the demand side, I think, ismuch more promising, rehabilitation and education, to deal withthat issue. Well, those are just a brief overview of some of the items at the top of my mind as to where we are going to be heading. If we canhold the opening statements \u2014your full statements will be admitted into the record \u2014to double time, to 10 minutes, that would be great. If you need a little more time, I have never seen a cabinet officerinterrupted yet. So we will begin with our very distinguished Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, if that is the proper name, Ms. Herman. Ms. Herman was recently married, and she may want to correct the record, or she may not. We have just been joined by the illustrious Senator from Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin. So I will interrupt my introduction of Sec-retary Herman to yield to my colleague. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I apolo- gize for being late. I will just ask that my statement be made apart of the record. Senator S PECTER . And then I will proceed with the introduction. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator H ARKIN . I would welcome the three secretaries here, in this last budget year of the Clinton administration. I particularlywant to thank all three of the secretaries who are here for theirgreat leadership. Secretary Riley and Secretary Shalala for the entire duration over the last 7 years, your great leadership of your two depart-ments. And what you have done to move this country forward bothin education, Secretary Riley, and in covering the health needs ofall of our citizens, Secretary Shalala, I compliment you and com-mend you for your great leadership over these several years. And to Secretary Herman, again for your great work for the ad- ministration in your previous iterations, but also in your role inthis last 4 years with the Department of Labor. Again, I think the budget that we have, as submitted by the ad- ministration, is one that will continue the progress that we havemade in all these areas to continue to move this country forwardin a way that education gets to the kids that maybe are not in thehighest income areas and have the best schools and the best edu-cation, and gets to middle income families for college, for sendingtheir kids to college, and the health needs, the labor area. PREPARED STATEMENT I guess I just want to thank you all for what you have done over the last several years. It has been great working with you. And Icommend you for this last budget of the Clinton administration, be-cause it does keep us moving in that direction that you have so4 stalwartly led over the last several years, all of you. I just thank you for it and welcome you here for this hearing. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Senator Harkin. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOMHARKIN Mr. Chairman, it 's a pleasure to welcome Secretary Herman, Secretary Shalala and Secretary Riley today to testify about the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget. In general, I was very pleased with the overall fiscal year 2001 budget. I think the President has balanced the need to fund important domestic programs \u2014many of which are funded in this bill \u2014with the need to protect Social Security and Medi- care. Secretary Herman, I was very pleased to see the large increase in funds to elimi- nate child labor and I look forward to working with you on that initiative this year.I also want to commend you for your request to set up an Office of Disability Policyat the Labor Department. As the chief sponsor of the Americans with DisabilitiesAct, I am committed to ensuring that every American with a disability has the op-portunity to achieve economic self-sufficiency and independence. I am pleased thatyou share my commitment. Secretary Shalala, I was glad to see that the Administration has requested a sub- stantial increase for child care. Last year, during consideration of this bill on theSenate floor, we were able to increase funding for the Child Care and DevelopmentBlock Grant to $2 billion. We lost that increase in the end but I am committed toseeing that we increase funding for child care to $2 billion in this year 's bill. I am also glad to see the requested $1 billion increase for Head Start. The evidence isvery clear that we need to reach children when they are very young. I was somewhat disappointed about the budget request for NIH \u2014an increase of $1 billion. Last year, this subcommittee was able to provide a $2.3 billion increasefor NIH \u2014maintaining a course to double NIH funding in five years. This year 's re- quest does not keep us on that course. Senator Specter and I have introduced aSense-of-the-Senate calling on the Budget Committee to reflect an $2.7 billion in-crease for NIH in this year 's budget resolution. The opportunities are out there, the potential is great. But we have to commit the resources to get the job done I must add that I was disappointed in the requested cut in the Community Serv- ices Block Grant and I hope to work with Senator Specter to restore that cut duringthis year 's appropriation process. Secretary Riley, I was very glad to see your fiscal year 2001 budget which calls for a $4.5 billion increase for education programs. And it will come as no surpriseto you that I am particularly pleased with you request of $1.3 billion for school ren-ovations and repairs. As you well know, the GAO has found that the cost of bringingthe Nation 's schools into good repair is about $112 billion. Today, I will be intro- ducing a bill to reauthorize the existing school infrastructure program and look for-ward to working with you on this important initiative this year. Thank you, Mr. Chairman \u2014and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON . ALEXIS M . HERMAN Senator S PECTER . One additional note before turning to Sec- retary Herman. At a presidential request of $622 billion, that ex-ceeds the $540 billion cap in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations bysome $82 billion. We have not addressed that yet. And the caps have not been followed. But that is going to have to be addressed. According to the President 's figures, that will still leave a $9 billion on-budget surplus. That is somewhat speculative,but we at least ought to note that it is not in compliance with theact, and we are going to have to deal with that as we proceed. Back to the Secretary of Labor, confirmed in May of 1997, prior to which she served as assistant to President Clinton and directorof the White House Public Liaison Office. She had served as deputydirector of the Presidential Transition Office.5 During the administration of President Carter, she directed the Women 's Bureau at the Department of Labor, a graduate of Xavier University. And again, we congratulate you, Ms. Herman, on your recent nuptials and look forward to your testimony. Secretary H ERMAN . Thank you very, very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your words, also of congratulations. And I am stillknown as Secretary Herman and now Mrs. Charles Franklin. Andquite frankly, I see no reason why I have to choose. I shall be known as both. But thank you very, very much.Senator S PECTER . Ms. Herman, you have been chosen, so you do not have to choose. Secretary H ERMAN . Mr. Chairman and Senator Harkin, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department of Labor 's fiscal year 2001 budget. It is a special pleasure for me to join my col-leagues, Secretary Riley and Secretary Shalala, in outlining the ad-ministration 's goals and priorities. Mr. Chairman, I think that we are all aware of the strength of the American economy today. Yet despite widespread prosperity,we still face two major and related challenges. Business leaders tellme that they simply cannot find the skilled workers that they need.And at the same time, millions of Americans remain outside themainstream of our prosperity for lack of job skills. Yet, if we take these two problems together, I believe they con- stitute an historic opportunity to provide the business communitywith the skilled workers it urgently needs, while at the same timebringing skills, jobs and hope to individuals and communities thatfor too long have been left behind. The President 's budget for fiscal year 2001 requests $39.8 billion for our department, $12.4 billion in discretionary funds. This is anincrease of $1.2 billion over last year. The majority of this increase is for targeted initiatives to provide the skilled workers who can meet the needs of our economy. Ourbudget puts special emphasis on young Americans. The Depart-ment of Labor 's new Youth Opportunity Movement is the most in- tensive effort to reach young people in our history. I recently announced youth opportunity grants to address skills training and job placement in 36 of the poorest urban and ruralareas and Indian reservations in America, places where the unem-ployment rate is more than 6 times above the national average.Our new budget includes $375 million for this initiative, an in-crease of $125 million over the current year. Mr. Chairman, you and I have visited youth programs in Phila- delphia, and we have seen how they change the lives of young peo-ple. I believe our Youth Opportunity Movement will create similarsuccess stories for tens of thousands of at-risk youth from coast tocoast. Last September we discussed with this subcommittee ways to re- duce violence and drug abuse among our young people. One of the administration 's responses has been the Safe Schools/Healthy Stu- dents Initiatives started last year by the Departments of Justice,Education and Health and Human Services. Our new budget in-cludes $40 million to enable the Department of Labor to join them6 in supporting community-wide programs to prevent youth violence and drug abuse and to promote youth employment opportunity. Mr. Chairman, we share your concern that too many out-of-work young people get into trouble and wind up in jail. We need to pro-vide positive alternatives and second chances. That is why ourbudget builds on the youth offender projects that began under yourleadership and proposes to add $61 million for a total amount of$75 million. The youth offender program will bring young offenders into the workplace through job training and placement and new partner-ships with the criminal justice system. We hope that we will nowbe able to work even more closely with the Department of Justice,which has a companion proposal to bring these young people backinto community life. Too often, youth unemployment is a part of an environment that also includes high dropout rates, drug abuse, gang activity, violenceand crime. Mr. Chairman, in answer to the questions you raised in your let- ter about drug abuse reduction and early intervention, we believethat our youth-related programs can reduce social problems. Stud-ies show that well-designed school programs lead to better aca-demic achievement and lower rates of drug abuse, violence and ar-rest. For all of our focus, however, on young people, this cannot be our only concern. We have to reach out to other untapped pools ofworkers. These include 5.7 million unemployed Americans, 4.4 mil-lion who are not in the labor force but say they want a job, andan additional 3.2 million who work part time because they cannotfind a full-time job. Our budget includes $255 million for our Fathers Work/Families Win, a new two-part initiative that grows out of the successful Wel-fare-to-Work Program. Fathers Work will provide jobs for non-custodial parents, mostly fathers who owe child support. Families Win will help low-incomeparents who are struggling to make ends meet by providing betteraccess to community services and upgrading job skills. We are reaching out to people with disabilities, whose unemploy- ment rates are more than three times the national average. Wetook an important step last December, when President Clintonsigned the Bipartisan Work Incentives Improvement Act, whichmakes it possible for millions of people with disabilities to take jobswithout losing their health insurance. Our budget also includes funds to establish an Office of Dis- ability Policy, Evaluation and Technical Assistance headed by anAssistant Secretary, which will provide leadership in helping dis-abled Americans enter the workforce. We are now in the second year of a 5-year effort to provide skills, counseling and other assistance to every dislocated worker wholoses a job through no fault of their own. To meet our goal of Uni-versal Re-employment, our budget includes an increase of $275 mil-lion for information, training and One-Stop Career Centers. Our concern is not only putting Americans in jobs, but ensuring that those jobs provide an adequate living for them and for theirfamilies. That is why the President has asked Congress to increase7 the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years. And I strongly endorse his request. Our budget also includes funds to oppose the worst forms of child labor around the world and to support international labor stand-ards. These proposals reflect the President 's challenge for us to put a human face on the global economy and to ensure that everyAmerican worker can compete on a level playing field, recognizingthat today what happens around the globe in fact impacts workersaround the corner. Mr. Chairman, there will never be a better time than today to put America to work and to build an even stronger, more inclusivenational economy. We will work with you in every way that we canto meet these goals. PREPARED STATEMENT I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this subcommittee, and I look forward to answering any questions that you may have.Thank you very much. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Secretary Herman. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALEXIS M. H ERMAN Mr. Chairman, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear today to present the Department of Labor 's fiscal year 2001 Budget. I am particularly pleased to join my colleagues, Secretary Riley andSecretary Shalala, to discuss key Administration priorities. Mr. Chairman, I am especially pleased to be here with you today because the pro- posals in DOL 's fiscal year 2001 budget request are exciting and innovative and build on seven years of solid accomplishments. The President 's request for fiscal year 2001 reflects the Department 's goal that all workers have the opportunity to find and hold jobs, with safe and healthfulworking conditions, good wages, secure pensions and health benefits; and that theyhave opportunities to improve their skills over their lifetime. To meet this goal, the overall budget for the Department in fiscal year 2001 pro- vides a total of $39.8 billion in budget authority. DOL 's request for discretionary programs is $12.4 billion, $1.2 billion above the fiscal year 2000 level. Since 1993,President Clinton has committed to investing in today 's workers in order to keep America strong in the years ahead. This budget is faithful to that commitment. President Clinton, in his State of the Union Message, spoke of the extraordinary state of our economy the more than 20 million jobs created over the past 7 years,the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, and low inflation. America 's workers are more productive, and real wages have increased as well. The President also recognized that our prosperity is not universally shared among all Americans. The President called for a 21st Century revolution of opportunity, re-sponsibility, and community. This vision includes steps to reward work, strengthenfamilies, and expand opportunities to all our citizens. DOL has an important roleto play in meeting those challenges. I believe that the Department 's programs are part of those all-important invest- ments in the workforce and workplace of the future. Our bottom line is about help-ing people obtain skills, jobs and opportunity. It is about ensuring that, as our Na-tion moves forward, no one is left behind. We acknowledge that the Governmentcannot accomplish this alone; we need to enter into appropriate partnerships withothers who share our commitment for a better America. HELPING WORKING FAMILIES AT A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY The dynamic forces of technology and globalization, while providing prosperity for many, continue to change the workplace in ways that may not benefit some Ameri-cans. Those who work hard should be able to realize the American dream for theirfamilies. DOL 's budget takes account of the dramatic changes that are sweeping through the Nation and the world economy, and proposes significant, realistic poli-8 cies and programs to help America 's working families manage change and succeed in this new century. Today we face two major workforce challenges: one new and one old. Many busi- nesses report difficulty in filling vacancies. At the same time, millions of Americans,including many youth, dislocated workers and people with disabilities, are havinga difficult time getting jobs, even during this period of unprecedented economic ex-pansion. As I have often said, we do not have a worker shortage, but a skills short-age. Through the initiatives in the fiscal year 2001 Budget Request, we can helpprovide the business community with the skilled workforce it needs while bringingprosperity to individuals and communities that have been left behind. THREE STRATEGIC GOALS DOL 's fiscal year 2001 Budget Request provides the resources we need to continue to make substantial progress toward DOL 's three strategic goals: a prepared work- force, a secure workforce, and quality workplaces. I will first briefly describe ourthree goals and then describe the initiatives and programs in the fiscal year 2001Budget Request that will help us to achieve these goals. A Prepared Workforce. \u2014DOL 's budget request reflects one of the President 's top priorities: investing in education and training to help ensure that every Americanhas the education and the skills to succeed in the increasingly competitive globaleconomy. Among other things, we must help young people make a successful transi-tion to the world of work and family responsibility. Because a changing economyoften requires our Nation 's workers \u2014of all ages \u2014to acquire new skills, we must also serve dislocated workers in need of assistance as the labor market changes. A Secure Workforce. \u2014We must ensure that all Americans are economically secure both while in the workforce and after they retire. Employment-based pension andhealth benefits are the foundation of family security. Yet only about one-half of allfull-time workers in the private sector have pension coverage today. Three-quartersof the workers in small businesses are not covered by a pension plan at all. Increas-ing access to our private pension system and assuring that private pensions, healthcare, and other employee benefits are secure and properly administered are someof DOL 's most critical priorities addressed in this budget. Quality Workplaces. \u2014My third goal is to help guarantee every working American a safe and healthful workplace with equal opportunity for all. I believe tough en-forcement is necessary when an employer 's practices threaten workers ' safety and health, discriminate on the basis of gender, race, religion, color, national origin, vet-erans ' status, or disability, endanger children, or deprive workers of fair wages. DOL 's ultimate goal, however, is compliance with employment laws. There must be an appropriate balance of fair and consistent enforcement, cooperative partnerships,and compliance assistance and training. Within the context of our global economy,I am also firmly committed to improving workplaces internationally, such as by im-proving implementation of core labor standards internationally and by eliminatingabusive child labor practices abroad. A PREPARED WORKFORCE We must ensure that every American has the skills, the education and the train- ing to be ready for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. The fundsin DOL 's budget will support programs to provide skills to young Americans, to work toward the goal of Universal Reemployment, and to reach out to untappedpools of workers, such as homeless veterans and Americans with disabilities, andbring them into the mainstream of our economy. The fiscal year 2001 Budget Request puts a special focus on helping young people gain the skills they need to start up the career ladder. Even in today 's booming economy, in some areas, unemployment among young people reaches 30 percent ormore, and that is simply unacceptable. We cannot afford to lose even one of theseyoung people. There has never been a better time to invest in workforce develop-ment initiatives. That is why we have launched our Youth Opportunity Movementto give young people skills, jobs and hope. Youth opportunity movement I am proposing several programs under the Youth Opportunity Movement um- brella to address the opportunity gaps and reach untapped labor markets in orderto advance the goal to promote a prepared workforce. I am very pleased that President Clinton helped launch our Youth Opportunity Movement as part of his New Markets tour last July. This is the most intensiveeffort to reach young people in our Department 's history, and it is no secret that it is a personal priority of mine. Our Labor Day 1999 report entitled ''Future Work:9 Trends and Challenges for Work in the 21st Century '' points out that there are al- most 11 million young people who are not in school and have a high school diplomaor less. The four million high school dropouts are at a particular risk of being per-manently disconnected and disenfranchised from our society. There are warningsigns when this is about to happen \u2014the absence of supportive and caring individ- uals in their lives; low academic success which often leads to diminished self-esteemand leaving school; use and abuse of drugs and alcohol; out-of-wedlock births; andcontact with the criminal justice system. Youth opportunity grants The Department 's fiscal year 2001 budget includes $375 million for Youth Oppor- tunity Grants, an increase of $125 million above fiscal year 2000. This program isintended to provide comprehensive, longer term intervention, primarily in the livesof out-of-school youth living in inner cities and high poverty areas, to help themgraduate from high school, get jobs, and progress in the workforce. On February 19,the President announced the first round of grants to 36 communities across thecountry \u2014from Philadelphia to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The fiscal year 2001 request includes $250 million to provide for the third year of funding of thesefive-year grants. An additional $125 million is requested in fiscal year 2001 to fundthe first year of 12 to 15 new competitive grants to high poverty areas. The programwill serve an estimated 85,000 young people next year. These grants will focus onraising the high school graduation rates and long-term employment prospects ofyoung people living in these poor areas. Responsible reintegration for young offenders As you know, we have shockingly high rates of incarceration in our Nation today \u2014and many of those in jail are young people. Too many out-of-work young peo- ple get into trouble and wind up in jail, and that is a tragic waste. We need to pro-vide positive alternatives and second chances. That is why our budget includes $75 million to bring young offenders into the workplace through job training, placement, and support services, and by creatingnew partnerships between the criminal justice system and our workforce develop-ment system. When we get young people out of trouble and into jobs, we are notjust helping individuals, we are strengthening the future of our communities. Eachyear, approximately 500,000 people leave prison. We must do more than lock peoplein jail. We must lead them into hope for the future. This initiative will build on our experience with the Youth Offenders projects begun under your leadership, Mr. Chairman. This large scale Workforce InvestmentAct (WIA) Pilot and Demonstration initiative will link offenders under age 35 withessential services that can help make the difference in their choices in the future,such as education, training, job placement, drug counseling, and mentoring, whichare the primary tools for reintegrating this population into the mainstream econ-omy. Through local competitive grants, this program would establish partnerships between the criminal justice system and local workforce investment systems, andwill complement a related program in the Department of Justice. An estimated19,000 offenders will be served by this initiative. Safe schools/healthy students When we think about the problems young people have today, we also think of the tragic outbreaks of school violence that have shocked the Nation. We must ask whatwe can do to reduce violence and drug abuse, and help move young people in theright direction. One of the Administration 's responses to this challenge is the Safe Schools/ Healthy Students Initiative, begun in fiscal year 1999 by the Departments of Jus-tice, Education, and Health and Human Services. DOL 's budget for fiscal year 2001 includes $40 million to enable DOL to join this partnership in supporting commu-nity-wide programs to prevent youth violence and drug abuse. With DOL 's participa- tion, the activities for the next round of grants can be expanded to provide servicesto out-of-school youth, including connections among high schools, post-secondaryschools, alternative schools, and work-based learning programs, in an effort to re-duce violent behaviors. The White House Council on Youth Violence \u2014of which I am a member \u2014will play an important role in coordinating both the Safe Schools/Healthy Students and youngoffenders initiatives. Job Corps The Job Corps continues to be America 's biggest and most successful residential job training program for at-risk youth. The Job Corps provides intensive skills train-ing and academic and social education for these youth. I am requesting $1.4 billion10 for the Job Corps in fiscal year 2001 to allow us to serve more than 73,000 young people at 122 centers in almost every State. This request includes a net increaseof $35 million above fiscal year 2000 for the Job Corps to support efforts to attractand retain top-quality staff, and for the operating costs of new centers. Universal reemployment For all our focus on young people, they are not and cannot be our only concern. Many other Americans need help gaining the skills demanded by today 's economy. Sometimes the challenge is not first-time employment but reemployment for thosewho have lost jobs and need new skills. Two years ago the President set an ambi-tious goal for our Nation called ''Universal Reemployment. '' We are on the path to meet the goal of providing assistance to all dislocated workers who lose a jobthrough no fault of their own. The initiative will: provide all dislocated workers whowant and need assistance the resources to train for or find new jobs; expand andimprove the quality of employment services now available to all job seekers and en-hance services for individuals receiving unemployment compensation; and ensureaccess to the One Stop System, either in person or electronically, to help workersfind jobs and training. The Department 's fiscal year 2001 request includes $1.975 billion, an increase of $275 million above fiscal year 2000, for Universal Reemployment. Of this amount,$1.8 billion, an increase of $181 million, will support dislocated worker retrainingand adjustment assistance activities under Workforce Investment Act. This initia-tive will provide State formula grants, as well as a national emergency grant ac-count, to help 984,000 laid off workers return to work quickly. These resources arepart of a phased in effort to assist all dislocated workers in need of these services. We are requesting $154 million for new and better ways of providing employment and related information through One Stop Career Centers and America 's Labor Market Information System (ALMIS) \u2014an increase of $44 million above fiscal year 2000. ALMIS services include America 's Job Bank which now lists about 1.5 million jobs, and America 's Talent Bank, which lists more than 500,000 resumes. Also in- cluded in DOL 's request for the Universal Reemployment initiative is an additional $50 million for the One Stop Employment Service for reemployment services grantsthat will provide targeted, staff-assisted services to unemployment insurance claim-ants identified as having a high probability of exhausting their benefits. This willspeed their reentry into employment and reduce benefit duration. Finally, the re-quest includes $10 million to implement AgNet nationally, a system that will matchagricultural workers with employers. We are also concerned about the skill levels of currently employed workers. DOL 's budget proposes $30 million for a new program of employment and training assist-ance to incumbent workers under WIA Pilot and Demonstration authority. This ef-fort is intended primarily to address the major job losses in the manufacturing in-dustry where one half million jobs have been lost since March, 1998. Comple-menting the activities under the Universal Reemployment proposal, this initiativewill boost skills and wages of non-management U.S. workers through competitivegrants to States to train and upgrade the skills of about 20,000 incumbent workersand, through local partnerships, to help firms with training in order to prevent dis-placements. Fathers work/families win The Department 's budget includes $255 million for Fathers Work/Families Win, a new two-part initiative that builds on the Welfare-to-Work program. FathersWork/Families Win promotes responsible fatherhood and supports working families. We have all heard about deadbeat dads. Well, Fathers Work is about upbeat dads. It will provide jobs for noncustodial parents \u2014mostly fathers \u2014who owe child sup- port. Most of these fathers are young and unemployed. Most want to meet their obli-gations, and Fathers Work will help make that possible. You cannot pay child sup-port if you do not have a job. A complementary part of this initiative, Families Win, will help low-income par- ents who are struggling to make ends meet by helping them find work, obtain betteraccess to community services and upgrade their skills so they can move up careerladders. Together, these two initiatives are an important, exciting new way to putAmerica to work. The strong working relationship we have forged with the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services in administering the job training, Welfare-to-Work, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families programs will serve our Fa-thers Work/Families Win initiative. For example, our grants will go only to entitiesthat have established relationships with child support enforcement agencies, rein-forcing linkages that have been developed under Welfare-to-Work.11 These competitive grants will be awarded to State and local Workforce Investment Boards, enabling States and local communities to complement welfare reform effortsby focusing on work connections, post-employment work support activities, andskills training. The initiative helps families with incomes up to 200 percent of thepoverty level. Disability initiatives We are also reaching out to another untapped pool of talent. Last December, the President signed the bipartisan Work Incentives Improvement Act, which makes itpossible for millions of people with disabilities to take jobs without losing theirhealth care. At a time when our economy is booming, 26 percent of persons witha severe disability are working, as compared to over 80 percent of those personswithout a disability. We cannot afford to waste the talents of millions of Americans. DOL 's budget includes funds to establish an Office of Disability Policy, Evalua- tion, and Technical Assistance headed by an Assistant Secretary. This new officewill provide leadership within the Department of Labor in helping people with dis-abilities enter, re-enter, and remain in the workforce. With the recent passage ofthe Work Incentives Improvement Act and the Workforce Investment Act, the stageis set to achieve real change in the unemployment rate of people with disabilities.In addition, DOL 's budget continues the competitive grants enacted in fiscal year 2000, totaling $20 million to be awarded each year by the Department to partner-ships of organizations to provide incentives for broader systems \u2014building on efforts to coordinate service delivery through, and linkages across, the One Stop CareerCenter system established by the Workforce Investment Act. HOMELESS VETERANS PROGRAMS Homeless veterans represent another group with untapped promise. The Depart- ment 's request for fiscal year 2001 includes $15 million \u2014a 50 percent increase over the fiscal year 2000 level \u2014to provide employment and training services to help about 15,000 homeless veterans obtain employment and progress toward self-suffi-ciency. We expect about 8,700 homeless veterans to find jobs as a result of the serv-ices we provide. Economic indicators The Department is also requesting $20 million for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $12 million of which is for new initiatives to improve major economic indicators,which are critical for monitoring the state of the economy and implementing Federallegislation. In its Producer Price Index program, BLS will extend coverage for thefirst time to the construction sector of the U.S. economy, and will continue its ongo-ing expansion of coverage in the service sector. This budget request includes $4.3million to develop a new timeuse survey that will provide nationally representativeestimates of how Americans spend their time in an average week, weekday, andweekend. This will provide important and meaningful data in many areas such asthe amount of time invested in the care of the young and the elderly in our society,variations between single and two-parent families, and time invested in skills acqui-sition. A SECURE WORKFORCE The second strategic goal is a secure workforce. It is not enough simply to have a job. The goal of a secure workforce helps attain important values, such as dignity,family and community. A job should pay a decent wage, should provide health carebenefits and should lead to a quality retirement. You cannot have security, or strong families and strong communities, if people work hard and still cannot pay their bills. That is why the President has proposedto increase the minimum wage by one dollar an hour over the next two years. Thisincrease would help more than ten million workers \u2014almost 70 percent of them adults and 60 percent of them women. For a minimum wage worker, a $2000 raiseis enough for a family of four to pay its rent for five months or to buy groceriesfor seven months. Raising the minimum wage is simple economic justice. Too many workers are also insecure because they are afraid their jobs will be sent overseas. That is why the President again proposes legislation to consolidate, reformand extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional AdjustmentAssistance programs for workers who lose their jobs due to trade. The proposalswould expand eligibility for benefits to workers who lose jobs when production shiftsabroad, increase training opportunities for trade-affected workers, link training and income support, and provide needed support services. Pension, health and other employee benefits are vital to the economic security of hard-working Americans and their families. As Secretary of Labor, I have the re-12 sponsibility for protecting these job-based benefits for more than 150 million Ameri- cans. We work diligently to make sure workers feel secure in their promised benefits. We make certain that the assets held by pension and health plans are secure andavailable to pay promised benefits. The Department operates a nationwide programof educational outreach and technical assistance that serves to protect the rights ofworkers and their families entitled to benefits under their job-based benefit plans.We provide broad-based outreach to employers, especially small employers, to assistthem with their questions about the plans they sponsor for their employees and toencourage those employers who do not sponsor a plan to consider setting one up.The Department also recognizes the importance of partnerships \u2014we work with the employee benefits community to find innovative solutions that enhance our nation 's system of employee benefits. That is why our budget request of $108 million for the Pension and Welfare Bene- fits Administration includes additional resources to expand our efforts to provideprotection to the health care and pensions of workers and their families. These newprotections will include implementing a new program (the Rapid ERISA ActionCompliance Team) to better protect the rights and benefits of American workers andtheir families if their employer faces financial hardship and their pension andhealth benefits are in jeopardy. In addition, the budget request will expand the De-partment 's Health Benefits Education Campaign and enhance our customer service efforts by developing new publications, multimedia educational products and thecreation of a toll-free interactive system to provide individuals with maximum directaccess to the customer service staff trained to answer their health care and pensionrelated questions. These initiatives will build on our ongoing efforts and allow usto respond to the increasing demand from workers and their families for assist-ance \u2014last year we responded to over 153,000 inquiries from workers and their fam- ilies and obtained benefit recoveries of over 62 million dollars. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) also helps achieve the goal of a secure workforce by guaranteeing pension benefits for 42 million workers and re-tirees in private-sector defined benefit plans. The budget request provides increasesfor enhanced computer security and to speed final benefit determinations. QUALITY WORKPLACES Our third strategic goal is quality workplaces. By quality workplaces, we mean those that reflect such basic values as health, safety and fair play. Globalizationmeans we must be concerned about the quality of workplaces overseas as well asat home. That is why the President has challenged us to put a human face on theglobal economy. International child labor According to the International Labor Organization, an estimated 250 million chil- dren between the ages of 5 and 14 are working in developing countries, 120 millionof them full time, and tens of millions under abusive or dangerous conditions. Weare committed to improving the lives of children both at home and abroad by oppos-ing abusive child labor wherever it exists and by providing the necessary resourcesfor its elimination. Building on our past funding of the ILO 's international child labor program, and the recent ILO convention on banning the worst forms of childlabor that was unanimously approved by the U. S. Senate in November and signedby the President in December, the Administration proposes $100 million to supportinternational efforts to eliminate abusive child labor. These funds would not onlypermit us to increase the global efforts to remove children from abusive and dan-gerous conditions, but would also allow us to increase our efforts to support the edu- cational infrastructure in areas where oppressive child labor is a pervasive and sys-temic problem. Education, not hard labor provides children with real opportunitiesand hope for a better future. I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his impres-sive leadership on this issue over the past several years. International labor standards Additionally, our budget includes $40 million for international core labor stand- ards initiatives. The Department proposes to expand the efforts begun last year toachieve internationally-recognized core labor standards, and to build social safetynets, so American workers can be more confident that we are building a global econ-omy with the ''human face '' that President Clinton has called for. This should be a race to the top \u2014not to the bottom. In all these ways, we are working to make globalization empower workers and improve their lives, not accept a lowering ofstandards at a time when so much progress is possible.13 When we consider quality in the international workplace, we must also consider the terrible harm being done by HIV/AIDS. When I was in Africa last year, I sawthat AIDS is not only a vast human tragedy but a major economic disaster. Whenworkers die, their skills and experience die with them. Production is down in manycountries. This disease threatens not only development and progress in Africa butpeace and stability. That is why our budget includes $10 million as part of a larger, government-wide Global HIV/AIDS Initiative that will work with African leaders to use the workplaceas a forum for providing health education programs to prevent the spread of AIDS.The workplace has a great, potential for providing millions of workers with informa-tion that can literally save their lives. Domestic child labor To continue our commitment towards reducing the more than 200,000 workplace injuries that occur among young workers in America each year, I am requesting $13million for the Department 's domestic child labor activities, including $8 million to continue to help eliminate violations of domestic child labor laws, particularly in theagricultural sector, and $5 million for demonstration programs to provide alter-natives to field work for migrant youth. This request includes additional funds toimplement targeted enforcement tools, including ''strike teams '' in the agricultural and garment industries, and to enhance education and outreach efforts undertakenas part of the ''Safe Work/Safe Kids '' initiative. Family leave Today, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows covered and eligible workers to take up to 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave to care for a newbornor adopted child, attend to their own serious health needs, or care for a seriouslyill parent, child, or spouse making it less likely that employees will have to choosebetween work and family. The President has again proposed to expand the FMLAto reach workers in firms with 25 or more employees, extending coverage to 12 mil-lion more workers. For lack of money and other reasons many workers are unable to take advantage of unpaid leave. The Department is requesting $20 million to fund competitive plan-ning grants for States and other interested entities to explore ways to make paren-tal leave and other forms of family leave more affordable and accessible for Amer-ican workers. This initiative will help identify in more detail the workers in needof financial assistance to take parental/family leave and to develop and evaluate op-tions to aid these workers. Equal pay We cannot talk seriously about a quality workplace unless we also talk of equal pay for equal work. Today, the average woman who works full-time earns approxi-mately 75 cents for each dollar that an average man earns. This gap, in part, isattributable to differing levels of experience, education and skills. However, even after accounting for these factors, a significant pay gap remains between men andwomen. When women are not fairly paid, their whole family suffers. We need to ridourselves of this stubborn, lingering pay discrimination. That is why the President has proposed an Equal Pay Initiative to expand oppor- tunities for women and help end wage discrimination. His proposal includes $17million for the Department to support initiatives on behalf of equal pay. The EqualPay Initiative dedicates $10 million from the current H -1B nonimmigrant fee for DOL to train women in nontraditional occupations such as those in high-tech indus-tries and also provides $7 million to help employers assess and improve their paypolicies, to provide nontraditional apprenticeships, and to support public educationefforts. The President supports the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthenwage discrimination laws and provide for additional research, training, and publiceducation efforts on this important subject. Workplace safety Finally, safety and health are absolutely basic to a quality workplace. We are proud that for the sixth consecutive year, workplace injury rates have come downand are now at the lowest level since we began keeping records in the 1970s. Butwe can still do better. Even one workplace death is too many. Our budget includes $668 million to promote health and safety for more than one hundred million workers through programs of the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Through a com-bination of targeted enforcement, compliance assistance and partnerships, theseagencies work hard to protect workers from illness, injury and needless death.14 The Department 's request includes a $44 million increase for OSHA which will enable OSHA to achieve better balance between its outreach activities, such as com-pliance assistance and training, and its enforcement activities, which in recent yearshave been targeted to high hazard worksites. The increase will improve our abilityto provide expertise and services to both employers and employees. Among OSHA 's efforts to provide safe and healthful workplaces is its ergonomics rulemaking. Workers suffer roughly 600,000 musculoskeletal disorders each year.The proposed standard can protect 27 million workers from the risk of incurringsuch injuries and illnesses. I remain committed to completing the standard thisyear. The Department is requesting an increase of $14.2 million for the Mine Safety and Health Administration 's (MSHA 's) programs to enhance protection of miners, by providing necessary training to miners and for better auditing of accident and injuryreporting. Approximately $3.2 million of this increase will augment MSHA 's enforce- ment activities in the metal/nonmetal industries. DOL 's budget also includes a re- quest for additional funds for the State grant program to provide training assistanceto miners and mine operators. Information technology initiative The Department 's fiscal year 2001 budget establishes a permanent, centralized IT investment fund for DOL managed by the Chief Information Officer (CIO). In thepast, DOL agencies have separately budgeted for and managed their own IT invest-ments. While the investments met the immediate needs of the individual agency,a unified approach will provide more efficient and effective services. For fiscal year 2001, the Department 's request includes $60 million to fund IT in- vestments within three crosscutting areas: (1) Information Technology Architectureand Web Services; (2) Common Office Automation Implementation; and (3) Security-Critical Infrastructure Protection. These investments will enable the Department toimplement a sound information technology investment strategy, and expand ourInternet capacity for the elaws program which provides the public with additionalaccess to information on labor laws. CONCLUSION These are some of the ways we will work in fiscal year 2001 to achieve our De- partment 's strategic goals. These are important, exciting initiatives, because they are not just numbers or words on paper \u2014they are about helping real people, with real talents to develop and real challenges to overcome. I will be happy to answer to any questions you may have about the fiscal year 2001 President 's Budget for the Department of Labor.(15)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY STATEMENT OF HON. DONNA SHALALA, SECRETARY Senator S PECTER . We now turn to the distinguished Secretary of Health and Human Services. As noted by Senator Harkin, Sec-retary Shalala has served during the full 7 years plus of the Presi-dent's administration. And beyond that is the longest serving Sec- retary of Health and Human Services in U.S. history. During her career, she has been a scholar, a teacher, a public ad- ministrator, chancellor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,where she was the first woman to head a big ten university, andnamed by Business Week as one of the five best managers in high-er education. She earned a Ph.D. from the Maxwell School of Citi-zenship in public affairs. And we welcome you back, Madame Secretary.Secretary S HALALA . Thank you very much, Senator Specter, Sen- ator Harkin, members of the subcommittee. I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman, for the leadership you have shown in working to prevent youth violence.And I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his kind words, too. When we presented our fiscal year 2001 budget, I noted the sear- ing images that we saw last year at Columbine and other schoolsmust never be repeated. If there was ever a bipartisan issue in thiscountry, this is it. That is why the President worked with Congressto establish a new White House Council on Youth Violence to getall Federal agencies thinking and working together to preventyouth violence. And that is why my colleagues, Secretary Herman and Secretary Riley, and I join you in your determination to bring to bear the re-sources we need to fight this problem effectively. How pleased I amto be with both of them today. At HHS, the Surgeon General is developing a report on youth vi- olence that we expect to be completed this year. However, thismuch we already know. Violence is preventable. So we intend tofind out what works and what does not and then publish and dis-seminate a source book of the best practices. Our budget also in-creases the mental health block grant by $60 million, a full 17 per-cent. And we are budgeting another $78 million to stop youth vio-lence. Now let me highlight other important features of our budget and why we believe this budget is critical to the health and future ofthe American people. Our fiscal year 2001 budget brings us to where we should be at the dawn of a new century, a great nation pledging allegiance togreat goals. Those goals are expanded health care coverage, re-newed support for children and families, greater scientific advance-16 ment, and the creation of a healthier America. Our fiscal year 2001 budget brings those goals within reach without loosening our com-mitment to fiscal discipline or to a balanced budget. This budget is about people. It makes a record investment in health care coverage, in access and in quality. Two years ago, withbipartisan support, we launched the State Children 's Health Insur- ance Program. Two million children are now enrolled. Now we want to make sure that this new program, and Med- icaid, carry millions more children and their parents into the safeharbor of quality health care. The President 's Family Care Pro- gram will do just that. But even as we expand coverage to some parents through Family Care, we recognize that many low income adults work in jobs thatdo not offer health insurance. These workers frequently rely onlocal health institutions and local professionals who provide serv-ices at a reduced or no cost. Secretary Herman has married a manwho does exactly that. Dr. Franklin is a family doctor. And while he gets reimbursement from many parts of the health care system, he told me the other night that he also often has tooffer reduced cost services to make sure the families he has treatedover the years, who might lose their health insurance, continue toget that treatment. This year we want to increase our support for community service networks to $125 million, five times our investment last year. Weneed to strengthen and modernize Medicare. First and foremost,that means dedicating more than $300 billion of the on-budget sur-plus over 10 years to extend the solvency of the trust fund until2025. We also must add a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medi- care. And I emphasize voluntary. As the President said in his Stateof the Union message, we would never design Medicare today with-out a prescription drug benefit. We cannot change the past. How-ever, we can change the future and catch up with modern medi-cine. But the longer we wait, the worse the problem will become.And the more expensive it will become. Government cannot step into the shoes of parents and commu- nities. But government does have a role to play in helping familiesbalance work and children. One recent study notes that in 1998only 10 percent of the 14.7 million children eligible for Federalchild care subsidies received them. So as part of the President 's Child Care Initiative, this year 's budget adds another $817 million to the Child Care DevelopmentBlock Grant. Senator Specter, you will recognize that exact amount, because we talked about it during the appropriations process last year. Thisis part of our discretionary budget and brings the total block grantto $2 billion. Mr. Chairman, Head Start is one of the most successful bipar- tisan programs our two branches of government has ever createdfor children. And this year we are requesting $6.3 billion for HeadStart. That is $1 billion more than last year, the largest increasein the history of Head Start. We believe the program merits it.17 I cannot talk, of course, about children without talking about drugs, as you have yourself, Mr. Chairman. I know that you wouldlike to pursue this further in our question and answer period. We know that marijuana use has leveled off among teens, but too many teens are still saying yes to drugs and alcohol. And that iswhy our budget includes over $3.3 billion for substance abuse treat-ment and prevention. I mentioned the success we have had in cutting the death rate from AIDS, but HIV/AIDS is still a disease without a cure. And itis still the greatest public health challenge both here and aroundthe world. So fighting HIV/AIDS remains a top priority for the de-partment. Our total AIDS budget this year is $9.2 billion, an in-crease of 8.4 percent over last year. Every agency 's AIDS-fighting budget is going up, in prevention, treatment and research. On the prevention side, we have proposed to add an additional $75 million to help stop the spread of the disease. Specifically, theCDC will direct $40 million of the new funds to local communities,including prevention services to target minority communities. CDCwill spend another $26 million to fight AIDS around the world. And at the same time, the Health Resources and Services Admin- istration will spend $1.7 billion in Ryan White funding to help peo-ple living with HIV/AIDS. This is a $125 million increase over lastyear. Our budget requests for AIDS-related research at NIH is $2.1 billion, a 5.2 percent increase over last year. The total NIH budgetthis year is $18.8 billion, $1 billion more than last year. This sub-committee, of course, should take pride in the unprecedented in-vestment it has made in basic and clinical research. Our shared commitment to the National Institutes of Health, and to producing quality science and quality scientists of the next gen-eration on both the NIH campus and at the great research univer-sities, is an extraordinary legacy. Years from now, I predict we will see results beyond our wildest dreams. And some of those results are certain to come from the $73million we intend to invest over 2 years to build a National Neuro-science Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. Thiswill put all NIH brain research under one roof. More important,the center will usher in what is certainly to be the century of thebrain. In the interest of time, let me quickly mention three other areas where we intend to increase our discretionary budget. We take veryseriously the need to stop infectious diseases and bioterrorism. Our budget increases by almost 50 percent CDC 's funding for disease surveillance. As for bioterrorism, which may be the biggestthreat of the 21st century, we are proposing to spend $265 millionto prepare for and respond to biological attacks. We also want to make a major investment in bricks and mortar. In addition to the Neuroscience Research Center at NIH, CDC pro-poses to spend $127 million, $70 million more than last year, to modernize and expand three critical laboratory sites. The remain-ing funds will go towards completing the Edward R. Roybal infec-tious disease lab and construction of a new environmental healthlab.18 Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude my testimony by noting that our greatest moral imperative is to close the gaps in health out-comes between minorities and the majority population. In 1998, thePresident set a goal of ending health disparities in six major areas.Now almost every operating division of my department is workingto close these gaps. That includes an additional $35 million for CDC for community- based research and demonstration projects to reduce disparities,money aimed at those communities themselves. PREPARED STATEMENT Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of this com- mittee. I would be happy to join my colleagues a little later to an-swer any questions you may have. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Secretary Shalala. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DONNA SHALALA Good morning, Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin, and members of the Sub- committee. I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the President 's fiscal year 2001 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services. At the outset,let me thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on the prevention ofyouth violence and substance abuse and on the treatment of mental health \u2014issues which I will discuss in detail later in my testimony. I am honored to be here withSecretaries Herman and Riley to continue our dialogue and coordinated efforts inthese areas. A PROUD HISTORY ... Mr. Chairman, before I discuss our plans for confronting the challenges that lie ahead, I think it is important first to take a look back at where we have been. Overthe past seven years, we have worked together to develop innovative solutions thathave improved the health and well being of all Americans. Let me note just a fewof these accomplishments: \u2014Working together, we have expanded enrollment in Head Start from approxi- mately 714,000 children in 1993 to an estimated 950,000 in this budget, whileat the same time improving the quality of the program, thereby providing astrong foundation for success for hundreds of thousands of low-income children. \u2014Two years ago, the President called for an increase of almost 50 percent over five years in the NIH budget as part of his Research for America Fund. Sincethat time the NIH budget has increased by over $4.2 billion and, with the fund-ing proposed by the President this year, we will be ahead of schedule in reach-ing our goal. In addition, we have increased the number of Research ProjectGrants funded by the National Institutes of Health by over 30 percent, from23,952 in fiscal year 1993 to 31,524 in this budget. This represents a dramaticexpansion of our scientific knowledge base that will pave the way for biomedicaladvances in the years ahead. \u2014We have nearly doubled the number of people receiving access to comprehensive combination drug therapy under the Ryan White Care Act AIDS Drug Assist-ance Program (ADAP), from almost 49,000 in 1994 to approximately 75,000with this budget. \u2014We have improved the health of our seniors by increasing the number of healthy meals served to older Americans under the Administration on Aging 's Nutrition programs from 240 million in fiscal year 1994 to 279 million in thisbudget year. \u2014With the enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we have helped individuals keep their insurance when they changejobs, guaranteed renewability of coverage, and helped ensure access to healthinsurance for small business. \u2014Together with the states, we have undertaken the largest health care coverage initiative since Medicare, namely the State Children 's Health Insurance Pro- gram. In just the two years since its enactment, the number of children enrolledin SCHIP \u2014now almost 2 million \u2014has doubled. In addition, the number of19 states covering children up to 200 percent of poverty has increased by more than sevenfold. \u2014Last year, the President signed into law the bipartisan Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act that allows people with disabilities to main-tain their Medicare and Medicaid coverage when they go to work. It also in-cludes a new demonstration program that allows people with disabilities whoare still working and are not sufficiently disabled to qualify for Medicaid to ob-tain coverage and reforms the training system for people with disabilities. \u2014We created the Vaccines for Children Program, to finance immunizations for children without private health coverage. Childhood immunization coveragerates in 1998 were the highest ever recorded. Ninety percent of toddlers in1996, 1997 and 1998 received the most critical doses of each of the routinelyrecommended vaccines, surpassing the President 's 1993 goal. We also have undertaken a number of new initiatives to target emerging threats and address long-standing problems. We have launched new initiatives to promoteresearch on disease prevention and health care quality, to improve the quality ofnursing home care, to provide support for our nation 's children 's hospitals, and to increase the number of children adopted from our child welfare systems. To educateMedicare beneficiaries about their health care options, we have implemented thelargest peacetime outreach campaign ever undertaken by the federal government.We have stepped up efforts to increase the availability of substance abuse treat-ment, to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities, and to address the AIDS cri-sis in minority communities. And we have invested significant resources to preparethe nation to respond to the medical and public health consequences of chemical andbioterrorist attacks. We have launched new initiatives to protect the rights of Amer-icans in managed care and protect the privacy of electronic medical records, andmost recently, to improve patient safety and reduce preventable medical errors inour health care systems. While we should be proud of past accomplishments, we must continue to address ongoing health and human services challenges. These include: expanding access toquality health care and extending protections to the uninsured and at-risk; sup-porting working families and bettering the lives of our nation 's children; encour- aging greater scientific advancement; and creating a healthier America. Thanks to our continuing economic prosperity, we have a great opportunity to meet these challenges. In the last two years, we have recorded back-to-back sur-pluses for the first time since the 1950 's. The combination of a strong economy, fis- cal discipline, and unprecedented advances in our scientific knowledge give us theopportunity to make the investments needed to build on all of our achievementsover the last seven years. Mr. Chairman, the total HHS budget request for fiscal year 2001 is $421.4 billion (Outlays). The amount before this subcommittee totals $267 billion (BA), of which$44.8 billion is discretionary. This discretionary component represents an increaseof $4.5 billion over last year. Let me now highlight the main components of our fis-cal year 2001 budget request. EXPANDED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE We live in an age of remarkable advances in the biomedical sciences. Yet too many of our citizens are denied the benefits of these advances because they lackaccess to quality, affordable health care. Throughout his Administration, PresidentClinton has made expanding access to health care one of his most important goals.Working with the Congress, we have had some notable successes, including enact-ment of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program, which today covers nearly 2 million children; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, whichallows workers to keep health insurance coverage when they change jobs and limitsthe ability of insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions; and mostrecently, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, which allowsdisabled Americans to return to work without losing their Medicare and Medicaidcoverage. But even with these successes, approximately one-seventh of the population still lacks health insurance. Our budget seeks to address these problems through a num-ber of initiatives designed not only to expand access to care but to improve the qual-ity of health care as well. Expanding coverage under Medicaid and SCHIP The State Children 's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), enacted in 1997, now provides nearly two million low-income, uninsured children with access to health in-surance, preventive medicine, and immunizations. While the success of the SCHIPprogram has greatly enhanced the health of these children, many of their parents20 remain uninsured. And there still are many children who are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP who are not currently enrolled. With the country 's resources growing, the economy booming, and the SCHIP program showing great progress, it makessense to take advantage of this opportunity to implement new options for low-in-come working families without health insurance. The President 's budget includes proposals to create a new ''FamilyCare '' program that expands coverage to the par- ents of children eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, increase outreach efforts, and sim-plify the enrollment process. Under FamilyCare, parents would be enrolled in the same programs as their chil- dren, and states would receive the higher SCHIP matching payments for expandingcoverage to parents. To ensure that the original intent of the SCHIP program ismet, states would be required to expand eligibility for children up to 200 percentof poverty before accessing funds to cover parents. As is the case with children, pri-ority in enrollment would be given to lower-income parents before covering higher-income parents. If, after five years, some states have not expanded coverage of parents to at least 100 percent of poverty, they would then be required to do so. By 2006, all poor par-ents would be eligible for coverage just as their children are today. We believe thatenrolling parents in Medicaid or SCHIP will not only improve their health, but willalso make it easier for entire families to access insurance through one source, there-by increasing the number of children participating in the program. This FamilyCare initiative is a practical, targeted approach to encouraging greater insurance cov-erage. Over eighty percent of parents of uninsured children under 200 percent ofpoverty are themselves uninsured, while nearly two-thirds of uninsured parents (6.5million) have children eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. The budget proposes to ex-tend and improve the transitional Medicaid program, which provides importanthealth insurance coverage for families moving from welfare to work. Our proposalswould use existing state administrative and delivery systems and no new bureauc-racies would be needed. In addition to covering parents, states also will be given the option to extend Med- icaid coverage to young people ages 19 and 20. If they do, they will also have theoption to cover kids up to age 20 under SCHIP. To further increase Medicaid andSCHIP enrollment, the President 's budget supports new efforts to simplify eligibility and aggressively expand efforts to enroll eligible children identified through schoollunch programs. To ensure that children are not overlooked in States that have dif-ferent rules and procedures for Medicaid and SCHIP, we also propose to requirethat States conform certain eligibility rules between Medicaid and SCHIP. Ourbudget also proposes $10 million in mandatory funding for competitive grants toStates that develop innovative plans for outreach to the homeless and the coordina-tion of services across the Medicaid, SCHIP, TANF, Food Stamps, and MentalHealth and Substance Abuse programs. If they do, they also will have the optionto cover kids up to age 20 under SCHIP. Finally, our budget seeks to reverse some of the inequities that have resulted from the 1996 welfare reform legislation by giving states the option to provide Med-icaid or SCHIP coverage to legal immigrant children and pregnant women. Thebudget also proposes to restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility to legal immigrants whoentered the United States after the enactment of welfare reform, become disabledand live in the U.S. for five years. Parents of legal immigrant children would alsobe eligible for coverage under our FamilyCare proposal. In addition, the budgetseeks to restore Food Stamps eligibility to legal immigrants who were in the countrybefore the enactment of welfare reform and either subsequently reach age 65 orhave children who are eligible for Food Stamps. In addition, the budget will take an important step to improve the health of low- income Americans by ensuring that they have access to drugs that help them quitsmoking. The budget will ensure every state Medicaid program covers both prescrip-tion and non-prescription smoking cessation drugs, removing a special exclusionnow in law, and requiring states to cover these drugs as they cover all other FDA-approved drugs. Modernizing and strengthening Medicare For the last thirty-five years, Medicare has been the cornerstone of our efforts to ensure that all seniors have access to the quality health care they need and deserve.However, since its enactment in 1965, much in the health care system has changed,not only the types of care provided and the setting in which these services are per-formed, but also the makeup of the population that receives Medicare. Thesechanges have dramatically increased the financial strains on the Medicare program,and current actuarial projections show that by approximately 2015, just as the largebaby-boom generation is becoming eligible, Medicare may be faced with insolvency.21 The Clinton-Gore Administration budget also dedicates $432 billion over ten years to Medicare to extend the solvency of the Trust Fund until at least 2025 and to cre-ate a voluntary, affordable prescription drug benefit. It includes a new, multi-billiondollar reserve fund that can be used to add protections against catastrophic drugcosts to the President 's proposed drug benefit. This financing commitment is part of a comprehensive plant to modernize and strengthen Medicare to ensure that itcan continue to deliver high quality, affordable care in the 21st Century. Thesesteps include making the program more competitive; introducing private sector pur-chasing and management tools; and continuing our historic fight against fraud,waste, and abuse. Over the last thirty-five years, the development of new prescription drugs to treat a variety of conditions has helped Americans to live longer and higher quality lives.The centerpiece of the President 's plan to modernize Medicare is a voluntary pre- scription drug benefit that would be affordable and accessible to all beneficiaries.This benefit, which would rely on market competition to obtain lower prices, wouldhave no deductible, and would pay half of all costs up to $2,000 in fiscal year 2003,increasing to $5,000 by fiscal year 2009. The plan would fully pay for costs for bene-ficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty level, and provide premiumassistance for those with incomes between 135 and 150 percent of the poverty level,while providing financial incentives to employers to continue offering prescriptiondrug benefits to current retirees. The President 's budget also proposes much-needed incentives to increase the utili- zation of preventive services by Medicare beneficiaries. Our plan would eliminateexisting coinsurance and deductibles for covered preventive benefits, includingcolorectal and prostate cancer screenings, pelvic exams, mammographies, bone massmeasurement, and diabetes self-management. The President also is planning to de-velop a three-year demonstration for smoking cessation services. By lowering thecost and expanding the availability of these services, we will not only save lives, butwill minimize the need for more extensive, and expensive, treatments in the future. While we work to strengthen Medicare to better serve current beneficiaries, our budget also includes proposals to expand access to Medicare to groups who face bar-riers to health insurance coverage. These proposals will allow Americans ages 62 to65 to buy into Medicare by paying a premium, provide a similar buy-in option fordisplaced workers ages 55 to 62 who have lost employer-provided health coverage,and provide COBRA coverage to retirees between the ages of 55 and 65 whose com-panies have reneged on their promise to provide health benefits. To make these buy-in options more affordable, the budget includes a proposal for a tax credit, availableto displaced workers over age 55 as well as all eligible persons ages 62 to 64, thatwould be equal to 25 percent of the buy-in premiums. As important as our efforts to modernize the Medicare benefit package are, Medi- care recipients will be able to realize the full benefits of these new services onlywhen we give equal attention to strengthening and modernizing the managementof our health programs. The President 's budget continues efforts to improve the Health Care Financing Administration 's (HCFA) management, building on the five- part reform plan advanced last year to increase flexibility while also increasing ac-countability. Our budget also maintains our commitment to fighting fraud andabuse, investing in a new Medicare contractor oversight initiative to address a num-ber of concerns outlined in OIG and GAO reports last year. This initiative includesfunding to improve evaluation of program operations, establish financial manage-ment controls at each contractor, develop an integrated general ledger accountingsystem that will ensure clean audit opinions into the future, and monitor and over-see these changes at all contractors. These actions will augment the successful efforts we have undertaken in partner- ship with you, Mr. Chairman, and Senator Harkin to combat fraud, waste, andabuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As you know, the Department ofJustice recently announced that, in conjunction with HHS, it had achieved a $486 million settlement with a national health provider that had been defrauding theMedicare program. This action is in addition to results reported in latest HealthCare Fraud and Abuse Control account report that indicated that $490 million hadbeen collected as a result of successful prosecutions in 1999. Of that amount, $369million was returned to the Medicare trust funds. In addition, the Medicare Integ-rity Program reported an increase of 25 percent in total overpayments preventedand identified in the first six months of fiscal year 1999 compared to the same pe-riod the year before. These successful efforts are why the latest Medicare Trustees ' Report included this Administration 's fraud and abuse efforts as a contributing fac- tor in slowing the rate of growth of the Medicare program.22 Increasing access to health care for uninsured individuals Those who lack health insurance often are forced to rely on emergency rooms or ad-hoc networks of facilities and individual health professionals for whatever carethey are able to receive, or to forgo any health care at all. Last year, the President 's budget requested $25 million to launch a new initiative to help community healthclinics, public hospitals, academic health centers, and other institutions serving thepoor to create new systems of comprehensive and coordinated care that uninsuredworkers and their families could depend on, and Congress responded by fully fund- ing this request. To continue this effort, this year the President is proposing to in-crease funding for this initiative to $125 million. This increase will allow as manyas 40 to 60 additional communities to receive grants to improve the capacity of safe-ty-net providers. The President 's budget also continues to provide strong support for the nation 's Community Health Centers, which provide care to nearly 10 million low-income and uninsured individuals in rural and inner city areas. Our budget re-quests $1.1 billion to support Community Health Centers, an increase of $50 millionover last year. Long-term care With more Americans now living longer than ever before, one of the most pressing demands we face is the increasing need for long-term care services. Studies showthat the great majority of individuals who need long-term care prefer to remain intheir own homes and communities rather than receive care in institutional settings,but this places a heavy burden on the family members and friends who must pro-vide supports for them. More than half of these caregivers are women, and one-thirdhave full time jobs. Our budget seeks to address the pressing need for new long-term care solutions through a multi-faceted initiative designed to help both the mil-lions of Americans who require long-term care and those who care for them. Our budget invests $125 million to support family caregiver activities in the Ad- ministration on Aging (AoA). This initiative will provide States and local commu-nities with the flexibility to design and provide caregiver support activities to ap-proximately 250,000 families nationwide who are caring for elderly relatives withchronic diseases and disabilities. Services provided will include quality respite care,information about local services, counseling, and training for complex care needs. The budget also proposes $140 million over five years to expand access to home and community-based care services under Medicaid through an option to equalizeincome eligibility standards for those who need institutional care but choose to livein the community. This long-term care initiative also includes a $3,000 tax creditto provide support for those with long term care needs and those who care for adisabled or elderly relative; an innovative housing initiative to integrate assisted liv-ing facilities and Medicaid home and community based care settings; and a programto provide Federal employees, annuitants and their families with the opportunity topurchase private long-term care insurance at group rates. Nursing home quality initiative As we begin to develop a support system for those who choose to receive long term-care in home and community-based settings, we must also continue to ensurethat nursing home residents are receiving the highest quality care possible. The fis-cal year 2001 budget includes $71 million for continuing quality monitoring activi-ties in last year 's budget to improve federal and state oversight of nursing homes. Now in its third year, this initiative supports the efforts of states to strengthen en-forcement and oversight of nursing home quality and to crack down on those whorepeatedly violate program standards. Expanding on activities already underway,funding will support increased surveys of repeat offenders, improved training forsurveyors, and enhanced legal services including resolution of the backlog of ap-peals. RENEWED SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Mr. Chairman, these investments in health care access and quality, in improving our public health system, and in broadening our scientific knowledge, all are funda-mental to making sure that the new century is a time of good health and prosperityfor all Americans. But just as we honor our commitments in the health arena, wealso keep our commitments to improving the lives of the nation 's children and fami- lies. The President 's budget keeps our promise to work toward an America where every child, and every family, has the opportunity to succeed at work, at school, andat home.23 HHS YOUTH VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES HHS is pursuing a range of activities to assist in the prevention of youth violence, and we have requested $78 million for these activities. The Safe Schools/HealthyStudents Initiative is an unprecedented collaborative effort involving this Depart-ment, along with the Departments of Education and Justice. SAMHSA is our lead agency for this important effort. Through this initiative, we are assisting 54 schooldistricts in designing and implementing comprehensive educational, mental health,social services, law enforcement and juvenile justice services for youth. The increasein this program provided by the Congress for fiscal year 2000 will enable us to in-crease that number to 70 -75 Safe Schools/Healthy Students grants by the end of the fiscal year. In addition to its support for this partnership, SAMHSA has devel-oped a comprehensive set of activities to provide direct grants for exemplary prac-tices as well as a variety of activities for developing innovative technology, technicalassistance, evaluation and social marketing in the youth violence prevention arena. The Surgeon General is developing a Report on Youth Violence that may be com- pleted this year. Local communities, private organizations, academia, other federaldepartments, state and local governments, and other groups are providing informa-tion and assistance to ensure the report soundly addresses the prevention of youthviolence. In addition, CDC is engaged in a variety of activities including researchon school violence and suicide prevention. For example, CDC will evaluate programsfor high risk youth and publish and disseminate The Best Practices to Prevent Vio-lence by Children and Adolescents: A Sourcebook based on the input of experts fromacross the nation. CDC also will initiate National Centers of Excellence on YouthViolence and a National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center. The Adminis-tration for Children and Families (ACF) is proposing to build on these efforts by fo-cusing on the mental health needs of runaway and homeless youth. NIH research has demonstrated behavioral interventions in the home and class- room that address violence in children with behavioral disorders and is developingand improving programs aimed at prevention, early recognition, and intervention foryouth violence in various community settings. Finally, the President has conveneda White House Council on Youth Violence, which includes representatives from theDepartments of Treasury, Labor, Justice, and Education. The Council 's duties in- clude developing a citizens ' information hub; producing reports on youth violence; expanding the Safe Schools/Healthy Student model of collaboration; providing toolsfor parents to deal with the issue of youth violence; coordinating the federal re-search agenda; and developing further policy responses. Expanding substance abuse activities Even with all our efforts over the last few years to expand the availability of serv- ices to those addicted to drugs and alcohol, there continues to be a significant gapbetween the need for substance abuse treatment and the capacity available to pro-vide treatment. Estimates by the Office of National Drug Control Policy show thatless than half of the five million individuals who need substance abuse treatmentactually receive these services. To further close this gap, the President 's budget in- cludes a total of $3.3 billion in HHS for substance abuse treatment and prevention,including $2 billion to support SAMHSA 's substance abuse prevention and treat- ment activities. Included in this request is an additional $54 million for TargetedCapacity Expansion grants to support rapid and strategic responses to emergingareas of need. The request also includes an increase of $31 million for the SubstanceAbuse Block Grant, which will provide funding through the states for over 10,500community-based treatment and prevention organizations. In all, our budget requestwill enable more than 16,000 additional individuals to access treatment services. Improving mental health services The Surgeon General 's Report on Mental Health, released in December 1999, has focused new attention on the plight of those who suffer from mental illness. Whileabout one in five Americans experiences a mental disorder in the course of a year,many of them will not receive the treatment they need. To address this problem,the President 's budget proposes an increase of $100 million for mental health serv- ices provided by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA). This includes an increase of $60 million for the Mental Health BlockGrant, to support state efforts to create comprehensive, community based systemsof care for both adults and children. It also proposes to create a new $30 millionTargeted Capacity Expansion Grant program to support prevention and early inter-vention services, as well as local service expansion.24 Improving access, affordability, and quality of child care For the millions of American families in which parents must work to support their children, the availability of child care is often the difference between self-sufficiencyand dependency. But even though funding for child care has doubled under the Clin-ton Administration, recent studies showed that in fiscal year 1998 only ten percentof the children potentially eligible for federal child care subsidies received them. Aswe have said before, no parent should be forced to choose between the job they needand the child they love. We must take steps to close this gap and help all parentsfind child care that is safe, reliable, and affordable. As we close this gap, we also must continue to improve child care quality. Study after study has shown that safe, quality child care is essential to the healthy devel-opment of our children. But the lack of quality care has forced too many parentsto place their children in less than desirable settings, and even low quality care canplace a heavy financial burden on low-income families. The President 's budget builds on our ongoing efforts to remedy these deficiencies with a comprehensive ini-tiative designed to not only make child care more affordable but also to improve thequality of care. Our fiscal year 2001 budget requests an additional $817 million, for a total of $2 billion, for the discretionary Child Care and Development Block Grant. This in-crease will provide child care subsidies to almost 150,000 additional low-income chil-dren. Also included in the $2 billion total is $223 million to improve the quality of care, of which $50 million is for infant and toddler quality care efforts; $19 millionis for school-aged care and resource and referral activities; and $10 million is forongoing research, demonstration, and evaluation programs. Our budget also pro-poses an increase of $3 billion in mandatory funding over five years, including $600million in fiscal year 2001, to establish an Early Learning Fund. This fund will pro-vide money to states to offer community level challenge grants for programs thatimprove childhood development and school readiness and the quality and safety ofcare. The President 's Child Care Initiative also includes critical increases for activi- ties in the Departments of Treasury and Education. Enhancing head start Since its enactment thirty-five years ago, the Head Start program has been one of our greatest success stories, ensuring that millions of low-income children startschool ready to learn. In 1993, the Clinton Administration set the goal of enrollingone million children in Head Start by fiscal year 2002. The President 's $6.3 billion request for fiscal year 2001, an increase of $1 billion, will keep us on track to realizethis goal, increasing the number of children enrolled to nearly 950,000. A portionof these funds will be reserved for grants to unserved and under-served populations.Consistent with the focus of the 1998 reauthorization of Head Start to improve thequality of services, $418 million of the proposed increase will be targeted for reduc-ing class size, improving facilities, staff training, and school readiness; obtainingsafer and better equipment; and attracting and retaining top-quality staff. Finally,our Head Start budget request includes $564 million for the Early Head Start pro-gram, which will provide 54,000 infants and toddlers and their families with contin-uous and comprehensive child development and family support services. Increasing parental responsibility through child support enforcement One of the key underpinnings of this Administration 's support for working fami- lies is the idea of encouraging personal responsibility. Nowhere is this more evidentthan in our actions to step up child support enforcement, which is a critical supportfor children and families. Child support collections have almost doubled since 1992,reaching an estimated level of $15.5 billion in fiscal year 1999. Our package of childsupport enforcement proposals is self-financing and it increases collections to fami-lies by more than $1.8 billion over five years. These proposals build on our successin the program through changes designed to give states new options to get moremoney to families and to improve enforcement tools to increase collections. Theseactions are part of a comprehensive Administration initiative to promote and ensurethat non-custodial parents who can afford to pay child support do so, and helpinglow-income non-custodial parents go to work so that they can support their childrenthrough ''Fathers Work '' grants in the Department of Labor 's budget. Under one pro- posal, we would match State efforts to allow families still working their way off wel-fare to keep a portion of the child support they are owed, increasing payments tothese families by $388 million over five years. A second proposal provides Stateswith the option to simplify their rules for distributing child support to ensure thatfamilies that have left welfare will keep all the child support paid by the non-custo-dial parent, resulting in increased payments to families of $815 million over fiveyears. Both of these proposals build on our Family First distribution policies. Our25 package also includes proposals for better enforcement techniques and program im- provements that will save the Federal government nearly $600 million over fiveyears while increasing payments to families by over $650 million. Ensuring continued educational excellence in the nation's children's hospitals As we move to increase the number of children with health insurance, we also must continue our efforts to ensure that all children receive the highest qualitycare. Expertly trained pediatricians are a critical ingredient in providing high qual-ity care to children, and children 's hospitals play an essential role in their edu- cation, training over 25 percent of all pediatricians and the majority of pediatricspecialists. Last year, the President proposed a new $40 million program to supportthe vital role children 's hospitals play in training physicians. This year, our budget proposes to double this amount, providing $80 million to raise support for approxi-mately 60 free-standing children 's hospitals to a level more consistent with other teaching hospitals. Advancing innovative treatments for asthma Approximately 5 million of our nation 's children suffer with asthma, and children from low-income families are disproportionately affected. What makes this particu-larly disconcerting is that the number of children afflicted has doubled over the past15 years, with the sharpest increases in rates among children under age 5. Asthmais a leading cause of school absenteeism, and children who suffer from asthma areoften forced to limit their activities. To address this growing health problem, ourbudget proposes $100 million over two years in demonstration grants to states totest innovative asthma disease management techniques for children enrolled inMedicaid and SCHIP. Through appropriate clinical disease management, these pro-grams will attempt to reduce asthma related incidents and keep children with asth-ma out of emergency rooms and in school. Providing heating and cooling assistance to low-income families The Nation has been severely affected by this winter 's fuel oil and propane price increases which, in some cases, have doubled since last year. On February 16, thePresident took steps to respond to critical needs by releasing all remaining emer-gency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds for this year,bringing the total heating assistance funds released this winter to $295 million. OnFebruary 25, the President submitted a supplemental request to Congress for an ad-ditional $600 million in contingent emergency LIHEAP funding to help as manypeople as possible meet the additional heating costs and to establish an emergencyreserve in the event of a severe summer heat wave. It is essential that Congressact quickly on this request to help to relieve the burden of rising fuel bills. To fur-ther address this problem, I have encouraged States to take advantage of the flexi-bility of current law to reach families with high energy needs, including the optionof raising State LIHEAP income eligibility limits. Federal law allows States to setincome eligibility limits at the greater of 150 percent of the poverty level or 60 per-cent of State median income. I also have encouraged States to fully utilize their op-tions under TANF to ensure low income families with children receive the assist-ance they need. GREATER SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT As we enter the new millennium, we stand on the cusp of an era of that promises unprecedented scientific advances. However, these breakthroughs only will be real-ized if we continue to make the necessary investments in biomedical research. Ourbudget continues along the path we set several years ago by investing in basic bio-medical research as well as in research that will lead to improvements in the qual-ity of care, thereby moving important scientific discoveries from the laboratory intoour hospitals and clinics. Investing in biomedical research Biomedical research has been at the center of the unprecedented gains we have made in improving the health and quality of life for all Americans. Breakthroughsthat did not seem possible only a few years ago are now within our reach, but itwill require a sustained investment for these endeavors to bear fruit. The Presi-dent's fiscal year 2001 budget includes almost $19 billion, an increase of $1 billion over last year 's funding level, for biomedical research at NIH. This increase will support research in such areas as diabetes, brain disorder, cancer, disease preven-tion strategies, and development of an AIDS vaccine, and eventually lead to a revo-lution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. This request will enableNIH to fund 31,524 research project grants, the highest total in history, and en-26 hance activities in critical areas such as research on racial and ethnic health dis- parities, biomedical information and technology, clinical research, and genomics. Using science to improve quality of care and reduce medical errors As we make new breakthroughs in biomedical research, we also must work to see that these scientific advances result in better quality health care. Even with all ourscientific innovations, a recent study by the National Academy of Sciences ' Institute of Medicine estimated that as many as 98,000 Americans die each year due to med-ical errors. The Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force, which HHS leads,just released its report, Doing What Counts for Patient Safety: Federal Actions toReduce Medical Errors and Their Impact, which incorporates and expands on thereport of the Institute of Medicine (IoM). Our report also builds on the extensive and thoughtful review of the medical errors issue that has been undertaken by thissubcommittee. Our budget dedicates $20 million in the Agency for Healthcare Re-search and Quality (AHRQ) and $13 million in the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for new activities to address medical errors and patient safety. In addition,HCFA will require that hospitals implement medical error reduction and patientsafety programs in order to meet Medicare 's conditions of participation. Overall, our budget invests $250 million in AHRQ to support research activities that will improve quality of care, and produce better health outcomes. These re-sources will be used to step up research efforts on the uses and tools of health infor-mation technology; sponsor clinical prevention research and research to enhance pa-tient safety and reduce medical errors; and expand research on issues of workers ' health. These activities will help us to learn how best to translate knowledge intodaily practice and improve health care for all Americans. Our budget also invests and additional $20 million to implement a new Health Informatics Initiative designed to improve patient care and health outcomes throughthe efficient and effective use of data and information. This request will fund a setof cross-cutting and agency-specific investments in information systems and healthdata, thereby enabling HHS to assume a greater national leadership role in the es-tablishment of health data standards while also strengthening the information basefor decision-making, improving the uniformity and ease of transmission of healthcare data, and protecting the confidentiality of health information. In addition, ourbudget includes $45 million to enhance the Food and Drug Administration 's post- market activities. This includes funds to expand their adverse-event reporting sys-tem and to allow FDA to investigate, identify and prosecute those selling prescrip-tion drugs over the Internet without proper certification. Food safety initiative Enhancing our capabilities to conduct surveillance also will help us in our ongoing fight against the threat of food borne diseases. Estimates show that food-relatedhazards are responsible for as many as 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitaliza-tions, and 5,000 deaths each year. To combat these outbreaks, the budget seeks a$10 million increase for CDC 's Food Safety Initiative programs. These funds will support enhanced public education efforts and the continued expansion of thePulseNet network of health labs. This award-winning network performs DNA''fingerprinting '' of disease causing bacteria, enabling public health agencies to iden- tify and respond more rapidly to disease outbreaks. In addition, the FDA is seekingan increase of $30 million for its Food Safety Initiative activities. These funds willbe used to increase inspections so that all high risk food establishments are covered,expand the number of examinations of imported foods, increase laboratory capacity,broaden efforts to work with states and the industry to make standards more con-sistent, and in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and the states, beginto implement the Egg Safety Action Plan prepared by the President 's Council on Food Safety. CREATING A HEALTHIER AMERICA Expanding access and improving the quality of health care are crucial steps to- ward ensuring that all Americans live long, healthy lives. But new threats to publichealth continue to emerge, and many long standing health problems still pose con-siderable risks. From AIDS prevention and treatment to food safety and the controlof infectious disease, our fiscal year 2001 budget continues our work to vigorouslysafeguard the public health. HIV prevention initiative As a nation, we have made substantial progress in our fight to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. Thanks to the use of combination anti-retroviral therapy, theAIDS death rates in the United States continue to decline. But in some parts of the27 world, and in some communities in the United States, the virus continues to spread rapidly. Domestically, the impact of HIV among certain segments of the population,especially minority communities, continues to be severe. In 1997, 45 percent of thosenewly diagnosed with AIDS were African American and 20 percent were Hispanic.Globally, the AIDS pandemic continues to be a major threat, particularly in devel-oping countries. In sub-Sahara Africa, for example, it is estimated that four millionpeople each year are newly infected with HIV. Internationally, the President 's budg- et includes an increase of $26 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention to continue the initiative undertaken last year to prevent the spread of HIVin developing countries. Domestically, our budget request supports our ongoing initiative to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS in minority communities. It provides an increase of $50million (including $10 million in reallocated funding) for CDC 's domestic prevention programs to encourage individuals at risk to avoid behaviors that can result in thetransmission of the disease. These funds will be directed to community based inter-ventions designed to reduce the rates of HIV infections, with special emphasis onvulnerable populations including racial and ethnic minorities, women, injection drugusers and their partners, and young gay men. Internationally, the President 's budg- et includes $61 million for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anincrease of $26 million, to continue the initiative undertaken last year to preventthe spread of HIV in developing nations. Ryan White Up to one-third of the 750,000 Americans living with HIV are currently not in care. As we step up our efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS, we must also continueto help those who already suffer from this deadly disease. The President 's budget keeps this commitment by providing $1.7 billion for the Ryan White Program, anincrease of $125 million. These additional funds will provide primary medical care,pharmaceuticals critical to treatment, and other critical support services for thoseliving with HIV and AIDS. This includes an increase of $26 million for the AIDSDrug Assistance Program (ADAP), which will allow a total of approximately 75,000individuals to receive comprehensive combination drug therapy. Reducing racial health disparities One of the long-standing priorities of this administration has been making sure that all people receive the highest quality health care, regardless of their race orethnicity. Unfortunately, members of minority groups, including American Indiansand Alaska Natives, continue to bear a disproportionate burden of the nation 's dis- ease and illness. The President 's budget continues the effort to eliminate these health disparities. A targeted response to this problem is the request of $35 millionto expand CDC 's program of demonstration projects in six identified areas of health disparities: infant mortality, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and immu-nizations. Funds will support the continuation of ongoing projects and the develop- ment of projects in two new communities. The budget also proposes increasing fund-ing for the Office for Civil Rights by nine percent, including new program resourcesto ensure that our racial health disparities initiative has a strong civil rights non-discrimination component. We also request an increase of $230 million for the In-dian Health Service, the largest funding increase in two decades, to implement amulti-pronged effort to improve the quality of care for Native Americans. Family planning Support for family planning services has been a key factor in preventing over one million unintended pregnancies each year. Family Planning Clinics provide a rangeof valuable services including sexually transmitted disease and cancer screening andprevention; HIV prevention and education; and contraception services and coun-seling. As part of our strategy to prevent teen pregnancies, these services have alsocontributed to reducing the teen pregnancy rate to its lowest level on record (since1976). Our fiscal year 2001 budget request continues our strong commitment to fam-ily planning services, providing an increase of $35 million over fiscal year 2000.These funds will support grants to family planning clinics which will enable ap-proximately 5.75 million low-income clients to receive reproductive health servicesand clinical care. Preventing emerging infectious diseases Thanks to the extraordinary advances in transportation and other technologies and the expansion of international commerce, we truly live in a global community.While these advances have resulted in numerous economic and cultural benefits,they also have placed increasing strains on our public health system. Since 1970,more than 35 new infectious diseases have been identified. More recently, we have28 begun to see the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, and the spread of older diseases to areas where they were previously unseen, such as the recentoutbreak of West Nile encephalitis in the New York City area. To combat thesethreats, our budget requests a total of $202 million to support infectious disease pre-vention activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includesan increase of $26 million to fight emerging infectious diseases, of which $20 millionwould be used to support the development of a national electronic disease surveil-lance system, which will enhance the ability of state and local health offices to re-spond to multi-state outbreaks of diseases and to share information, both amongthemselves and with CDC. Combating bioterrorism The recent arrests of suspected terrorists at the Canadian border has reminded us all of the serious threat that terrorism poses to the peace and prosperity of ournation. The threats posed by bioterrorism are particularly deadly because of theircommunicability and their ability to remain undetected for long periods of time.Continuing our efforts to prepare for and respond to the consequences of a bioter-rorist event, the Department 's budget includes $265 million for activities across agencies to mount a comprehensive public health effort to combat this deadly threat.This strategy includes four major components. First, our budget strengthens criticalcomponents of our public health infrastructure, including our surveillance systems,epidemiological and laboratory capacity, and communications technology. Second, itcontinues funds for the purchase of a stockpile of the pharmaceuticals needed totreat the most likely biological agents. Third, it provides funds for research, develop-ment, and regulatory review of new vaccines and new diagnostic screens for chem-ical agents. Finally, it would support the establishment of an additional 25 localarea health care response systems, bringing the total number around the countryto 97. Investing in HHS laboratory and health infrastructure To successfully overcome the public health challenges of the 21st century, we must invest now to modernize the infrastructure that provides the foundation forour public health and biomedical research systems. Many of the laboratories at CDC and FDA are overcrowded and outdated, while at the National Institutes of Health(NIH) the fragmentation of laboratory space delays the pace at which new discov-eries are made. Our budget requests substantial increases to solidify this foundationand construct state-of-the-art facilities. For CDC, we are requesting a total of $127million, an increase of $70 million, for laboratory construction at three sites. First,our budget includes $85 million in fiscal year 2001 and additional funding in fiscalyear 2002 and fiscal year 2003 to construct a laboratory to handle the most highlyinfectious and lethal pathogens studied at CDC, as well as housing important workon antibiotic resistant diseases, AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuber-culosis. Second, we request $20 million to complete and equip the Edward R. Roybalinfectious disease laboratory. Third, we request $4 million to design a facility to re-place our antiquated environmental health laboratory. The remainder of the requestwill be used for security improvements and maintenance of existing facilities. For NIH, we are requesting $149 million for intramural buildings and facilities. Intramural projects include $73 million over two years to construct a new facilityto house the new National Neuroscience Research Center, and $24 million to begindesign and construction of a new centralized animal facility. Our budget also in-cludes $20 million for new lab construction at FDA, as well as $65 million for healthfacilities construction in the Indian Health Service (IHS). RIGOROUSLY EVALUATING PROGRAM PERFORMANCE Our budget request for fiscal year 2001 presents the annual performance informa- tion required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. No-tably, this includes the first GPRA performance report of HHS and its components,which compares fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 perform-ance plan. Although GPRA reporting must mature before its full value will be real-ized, our performance report for this year shows improvements for critical HHS ini-tiatives of the past few years. SAMHSA reports that retailers in more States havecomplied with rules prohibiting tobacco sales to youth than we had projected in our1999 performance plan. HCFA achieved its 1999 goal for reductions in Medicarepayment errors a year early, and pursues increasingly rigorous goals in fiscal year2001 and fiscal year 2002. ACF and its program partners, including states, exceededperformance expectations when they moved 1.3 million welfare recipients into newemployment. Information like this demonstrates that GPRA can be a valuable toolthat will enhance our efforts to improve programs that serve the American people.29 As our performance measures continue to mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as important program indicators to support the identifica-tion of strategies and objectives to continuously improve programs across HHS. A ROAD MAP TO A BETTER AMERICA Mr. Chairman, as I look back at the journey we have taken, I feel tremendous pride in what we have been able to accomplish. While there were occasional bumpsin the road and we did not reach every destination we set out for, we have madegreat advances in improving the nation 's health and well being. Today I have placed before you a road map for the destinations we have charted \u2014improving health care access, coverage, and quality; making America a healthier and safer place; expand-ing our scientific knowledge, and giving all our children and families the oppor-tunity for success \u2014and these are destinations we all wish to reach. Thanks to the unprecedented economy, our fiscal discipline, and a new age of scientific break-throughs, the conditions under which we set out on this road have never been morefavorable. FISCAL MANAGEMENT AT CDC Mr. Chairman, before concluding, I would like to speak about the recent news sto- ries regarding the management of hantavirus funding at CDC. Dr. Koplan and I aredeeply concerned about CDC 's failure to report these reallocations to the Congress in a timely fashion. I strongly believe that the full accountability and integrity ofour budgeting and reporting efforts are central to our responsibilities, and I havezero tolerance for inaccurate reporting or inaccurate statements. We have an obliga-tion to expend our funds consistent with congressional expectations and to reportin an accurate and timely fashion. In consultation with Dr. Koplan, I am taking what I consider to be aggressive and unprecedented actions to rectify this problem and restore the trust of this Congress.These actions, which will be coordinated by the Department and CDC, include: \u2014The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will take such actions as necessary to certify all financial obliga-tions made by the National Center for Infectious Diseases for the remainder ofthe fiscal year. \u2014The Department 's CFO also will work with Dr. Koplan to ensure that all senior decision-makers in the National Center for Infectious Diseases receive certifiedbudget execution training. \u2014CDC is commissioning an external review of the agency 's fiscal management practices. The review is to be completed within six months. The results of thisanalysis will be communicated to the Congress as soon as the review is com-plete. \u2014CDC program managers will conduct a top-to-bottom examination of CDC 's 133 programs and projects to make sure there are no other areas of concern. Duringthe 90 day period CDC managers will be able to fully and openly identify anyarea for which there may be a discrepancy between actual expenditures and theinformation provided to Congress. Dr. Koplan will share these findings with theCongress. \u2014CDC has commissioned Pricewaterhouse Coopers, a firm of independent audi- tors, to thoroughly examine our hantavirus expenditures. The results will becommunicated to the Chairman immediately upon completion. When this auditis complete, CDC will expand the effort to the entire National Center for Infec-tious Diseases. In addition, Dr. Koplan has for the past year put in place numerous corrective actions to respond to the Inspector General 's report on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. He has implemented new financial management systems; initiated improvements inthe agency 's budget displays and in the allocation of centralized agency costs. Again, let me state very clearly that neither any senior manager at HHS nor I have anytolerance for inaccurate reporting and that we are all devoted to restoring the credi-bility and integrity that is central to the important work done at CDC. Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin, and members of the Subcommittee: I would like to thank each of you for all of the hard work you have done to make everythingwe have accomplished a reality, and I look forward to working with all of you tomeet the challenges before us in this budget. I would be happy to address any ques-tions you may have.(30)DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD W. RILEY, SECRETARY Senator S PECTER . We now turn to the distinguished Secretary of Education, Secretary Richard Riley, who has also served during theentire tenure of President Clinton 's Administration starting in Jan- uary of 1993. Secretary Riley brought a wide breadth of experience to the posi- tion, having been governor of the State of South Carolina, a StateSenator and a State representative, so that he has been in manyfields, many capacities. He had a nationally recognized effort to improve education in South Carolina, which led to his appointment as secretary. He isa graduate of Furman University and a recipient of a law degreefrom the University of South Carolina. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Secretary, and we look forward to your testimony. Secretary R ILEY. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and Senator Harkin and Senators Murray and Feinstein for thestrong support of education that all four of you have shown us. It 's clear that you really believe in the investment in young people 's education and all people 's education. STATE OF AMERICAN EDUCATION It is a great pleasure to be here with my colleagues in the Cabi- net. I just have completed my annual state of American educationaddress, which I gave down in Durham, NC, at a turn-aroundschool, a school that was predominantly African-American and wasreally a school that was classified as a low-performing school. Butthey had a new principal, and it was a very exciting thing. It isnow an exemplary school there in Durham. I talked about higher expectations. I talked about the achieve- ment gap between the students whose families are educated andhave money and students who are minorities, and, oftentimes, lim-ited English proficient. I talked about the digital gap and reallythose things that we can do about those. And we are trying to closethat gap. I see good things happening. We have a lot of work todo. The E-rate, for example, is other work that we have done in tech- nology. We just recently had a determination that 95 percent of ourschools are connected to the Internet. And we have gotten up to 63 percent of all classrooms connected. That is enormous growth, andI am very proud of it. Increased attention to early childhood programs that my col- leagues spoke about is making a real difference. Parents have an31 absolute focus on keeping their children out of harm 's way and school safety is a paramount issue. Overall, the American people have made education clearly one of their top priorities. The budget reflects these priorities. Turningaround failing schools, school safety, improving teacher quality,modernizing our nation 's schools, technology, safe schools, helping working and middle class families pay for college. The American people, I think, are getting into a new position when it comes to how we improve education. I think they havemoved beyond the debate on Federal versus local control. I stronglybelieve that State and local control, in terms of control, must bethere. But it is so interesting to see that we have come to a new place. The American people want practical answers. They want to knowspecifics. If we are going to have national priorities, what are they?What are our expectations? And they want accountability for those. They want local, State, and Federal interests working together to create new partnerships, partnerships that are not just govern-ment, obviously, but include business, community groups, jump oldboundaries, and make things happen. The Federal Government isthe junior partner in all of that, but a very important partner. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT EDUCATION So where are we when it comes to education? Higher standards are now in place in all 50 States. The big job now is to get stand-ards down in the school classroom, where they impact every childand have real accountability measures. We are also starting to seethe early benefits of our sustained focus on raising standards. Ithink it is making a difference in every State. And I would like to submit for the record a new release from the Center on Education Policy and the American Youth Policy Forum,entitled ''Do You Know the Good News About American Edu- cation? '' And it is, I think, a very good indication that across the board very interesting things are happening. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUDGET REQUEST But I will be the first to tell you that we still have a very long way to go. There are schools out there that should not even becalled schools, and they need fixing immediately. The proposed in-vestment in this budget, I think, moves in that direction. We arerequesting $40.1 billion, an increase of $4.5 billion or 12.6 percentover the fiscal year 2000 spending. The budget continues a strong emphasis on improving account- ability in Title I, reducing class size, improving teacher quality,technology, modernizing our schools, increasing after-school oppor-tunities to help keep children out of harm 's way. And I remain very excited about the President 's college opportunity tax cut proposal. It can make a real difference in giving young people the chance togo to college, and middle income families as well. TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION This budget includes $1 billion to support better teaching with a strong emphasis on recruiting and retaining high-quality teach-32 ers. There is no single way to get that job done, and we come at it from many angles, that have been carefully thought about. 21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS One of the best ways to keep our children out of harm 's way is through positive after school experiences. That is why we are pro-posing a $547 million increase for 21st Century Community Learn-ing Centers, doubling the funding to the total of $1 billion, makingthe after-school effort very important. SCHOOL SAFETY AND DISCIPLINE School safety and discipline are very immediate. We do not need another Columbine. I worry about that every single day, and Iknow each of you do. And the other incidents that have happened,even though they are very rare, are still so terribly important. Anyone of them makes it a crisis. SMALL , SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOLS INITIATIVE Young people need to have a strong sense of connection. I think that is very important, when you look at school violence. We pro-pose to scale up our Small, Safe and Successful High Schools initia-tive by providing $120 million to help 700 high schools createschools within schools. These are these large, often consolidatedschools. SAFE SCHOOLS /HEALTHY STUDENTS INITIATIVE We are now in our second year of funding for our joint safety ini- tiative with HHS and the Justice Department. There is an enor-mous demand for this initiative. I think there is great potential inthat. It is something, Mr. Chairman, you have been interested in.Over 440 cities applied for those grants. We were able to grant 54of them in the first year, to show you how significantly it is seenby cities. We expect another 20 to 23 to be funded this year. CHILDREN 'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM I would mention CHIP, Mr. Chairman and members of the com- mittee. I think all of us ought to be talking about that, how we getyoung people out there to get health care. That is, just like theseother issues, an overlapping issue. But under eligibility of Medicaidand CHIP, really every poor young person in the country ought tobe receiving health care. And that is, too, related to these issues. SAFE AND DRUG -FREE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES But it is important to remember that our nation 's schools still are basically safe. We have 53 million young people in school everyday. That is an awful lot of young people. Yet less than 1 percentof the homicides among youth aged 12 to 19 occur in schools, atschool functions or on the way to school, way less than 1 percent. Drug use is falling slightly, but remains much too high. It is one of the reasons why we continue to work hard to improve the effec-tiveness of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program. The budgetreflects those changes. We believe that our middle school coordina-tors effort can play a positive role in helping parents and school of-33 ficials who are on the front line, and I think our effort to support character education and civic education also help as well. SCHOOL MODERNIZATION I also urge the Congress to pass our school modernization legisla- tion. Many rural and urban school districts need the help. Ourmodernization proposal now comes in two parts. And I want to tryto urge you all to take a look at that. Both are worthy, I think, ofconsideration. We are putting strong emphasis on our new $1.3 billion appro- priation for school renovation, a request to help school districts ren-ovate and repair thousands of old schools that are in urgent needof repair, often in areas that cannot float a bond issue. They reallydo need some special help. Our school buildings are wearing out in many of these older cit- ies. They are old, overcrowded in other areas. We think that thatbears an awful lot of attention. PELL GRANT MAXIMUM AWARD Let me conclude by a comment on higher education. We are pro- posing increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $3,500, up from$3,300, a $200 increase, up more than 50 percent since 1994. COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES TAX CUT The President 's new 10-year, $30 billion College Opportunities Tax Cut \u2014which I would be happy to discuss in detail, if you would like, will be of significant help to working class families who makeunder $43,000 a year. It provides special help for them, as well asmiddle class parents with several children going to college withspecial cost problems. I thank you very much for giving me the chance to be here with my colleagues. And I, like they, welcome questions. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Secretary Riley. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD W. R ILEY Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the President 's fiscal year 2001 budget request for education. I want to begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman, as well as other Members of this Sub-committee, for your strong and consistent support for education over the past sev-eral years. Working together, I believe we have made real progress in helping toexpand educational opportunity for all Americans. The American people have made education one of their top national priorities. We recognize that the Federal government is the junior partner in our education sys-tem, and that real progress in improving education depends primarily on State andlocal efforts. But we can play a critical role in encouraging and supporting State andlocal initiatives, particularly in the areas of raising standards, improving account-ability for results, and helping to meet the needs of disadvantaged and limitedEnglish proficient students and students with disabilities. The American people also see this time of peace and prosperity as a unique oppor- tunity for the Nation to be investing in the long-term future of our great countryby improving education at all levels. Some might argue that the growing Federalbudget surplus should be used for broad-based tax cuts, but that 's not what I hear when I talk with students, parents, and teachers across the country. What I hear34 instead is a strong consensus on paying down the national debt and building for the future by investing in the education of our children. That is why the President is requesting $40.1 billion in discretionary spending for the Department of Education, an increase of $4.5 billion or 12.6 percent. This budg-et reflects the transition to the second phase of the standards-based reform effortswe launched seven years ago. First, we worked with the Congress to support Stateand local efforts to raise standards and put accountability measures in place. Stand-ards are now in place in all 50 States and we are working hard to improve account-ability. Now we need to ensure that States and communities have the resourcesneeded to ensure that all students can achieve to higher expectations and thatteachers are prepared to teach to the new standards. The Department 's request provides significant new resources to help States and communities implement higher standards in their schools while coping with boom-ing enrollments and the need to modernize academic facilities. The request also pro-vides substantial new support to help prepare disadvantaged students for postsec-ondary education and make college more affordable for all Americans. INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY The 2001 budget for education once again emphasizes accountability for results, particularly for chronically failing schools. Our purpose is not to punish the studentsin those schools, but to provide the right combination of incentives and support thatwill accelerate the changes needed to improve the quality of their education. The President 's request for Title I includes $250 million for a second year of ac- countability grants, an increase of $116 million over the 2000 level. These fundswould enable States and school districts to provide the additional assistance neededto help failing schools \u2014primarily those identified for corrective action under Title I\u2014turn around and improve student achievement. The President 's proposal also recognizes that in too many schools, students and parents have waited far too long for meaningful change and improvement. For thisreason, school districts participating in Title I would be required to offer studentsenrolled in a school identified for corrective action the choice of attending anotherpublic school not identified for corrective action. The goal here is to help ensure thatno student is trapped in a truly bad school, and to reinforce the idea of serious con-sequences for schools that consistently fail to improve. At the same time, we are em-phasizing efforts to turn around poor-performing schools, because even with a publicschool choice option the majority of students will continue to attend their neighbor-hood school. IMPROVING LOW -PERFORMING SCHOOLS We want to balance accountability for meeting high standards with new resources to help students meet those standards and to help school districts turn around fail-ing schools. This is why, for example, the request includes a $547 million increasefor 21st Century Community Learning Centers, for a total of $1 billion for after-school and other extended-learning programs. These funds would support high-qual-ity extended learning opportunities for nearly 2.5 million children, including stu-dents in low-performing schools. We also would add $450 million to reduce class size in the early grades, for a total of $1.75 billion to help children get more personal attention, improve discipline, andlearn more. There 's no better way to rapidly improve student achievement than to put highly trained teachers into small classrooms where they can provide the indi-vidual attention students need to reach high standards. The request would bring thetotal number of teachers hired under this program to about 49,000, or almost half-way to the President 's goal of hiring 100,000 teachers over seven years. One of the best ways to bring about real change and turn around failing schools is to help communities and schools to put in place reforms based on solid research.This is why our budget includes $190 million for the Comprehensive School ReformDemonstration program to help an additional 1,900 schools develop and implementproven, comprehensive reform models. We would also increase funding for edu-cational research by $30 million to help meet the growing need for research-basedinformation on what works in education. The request also expands the Small, Safe and Successful High Schools initiative to help create smaller, safer, and more disciplined and supportive learning environ-ments in approximately 700 of the Nation 's largest high schools. The President 's budget would provide $120 million for such effective innovations as schools-within-schools or career academies that assign students to groups of a few hundred \u2014help- ing to replace the isolation many students feel in large schools with smaller, morenurturing communities.35 Another way to accelerate change is by giving parents more choices of public schools. Our budget would increase the choices available to parents and studentsthrough a $175 million request for Charter Schools. These funds would support thestart-up of some 1,700 new or redesigned charter schools, which have the flexibilityto offer innovative educational programs in exchange for greater accountability forstudent achievement. The 2001 request would bring to 2,400 the number of charterschools helped by this program, supporting the President 's goal of creating 3,000 charter schools by 2002. We also are seeking $20 million for the Opportunities to Improve our Nation 's Schools initiative, or OPTIONS. This flexible new authority would support 40 grantsto States and school districts to implement and test new approaches to public schoolchoice, including inter-district programs and public schools at work sites and on col-lege campuses. Our budget also acknowledges the importance of recognizing success. A new, $50 million Recognition and Reward program would reward States for improving stu-dent achievement and for reducing the achievement gap between high- and low-per-forming students, as measured by State results on the National Assessment of Edu-cational Progress. MODERNIZING OUR SCHOOLS A key priority for 2001 is to help ensure that all students have the opportunity to attend safe, modern school facilities that are equipped with up-to-date edu- cational technology. With public school buildings averaging some 42 years of ageand a backlog of more than $100 billion in repairs, it is clear that we have a lotof work to do. This is why the 2001 request includes two proposals to upgrade schoolfacilities. The School Renovation program, a major new $1.3 billion discretionary initiative, would help school districts repair or renovate their schools. The $1.3 billion totalincludes $50 million in grants to approximately 119 districts with at least 50 per-cent of their children residing on Indian lands, $125 million in grants to high-needschool districts, and $1.125 billion that would leverage an estimated $6.5 billion in7-year, no-interest loans. The School Renovation initiative would complement the President 's School Mod- ernization Bonds proposal, which would provide nearly $25 billion in tax creditbonds over two years to modernize up to 6,000 schools. Tax credit bonds, which thePresident is proposing for the third year in a row, would provide interest-free fi-nancing to help State and local governments pay for modernizing schools and ad-dressing overcrowding. An additional factor driving the demand for the upgrade of school facilities is the explosion in the development and use of educational technology based on multi-media computers and access to the resources of the Internet. Computers are the''black board and chalk '' of the future. A key resource for this revolution in edu- cational technology is the E-rate, created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996,which provides nearly $2 billion annually in subsidies to help schools and librariesconnect to the Internet. The Department budget would provide $450 million for the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, an increase of $25 million, to help schools integrate technology intothe curriculum and ensure that teachers in high-poverty communities are preparedto use educational technology effectively. We also would double funding to $150 mil-lion for the Preparing Tomorrow 's Teachers to Use Technology program, which helps prepare new teachers to use technology effectively to improve instructional practicesand enhance student learning in the classroom. And to help close the digital divide in our communities between those who enjoy the full benefits of computers and the Internet and those economically disadvan-taged individuals and families who lack access to such technology, the budget wouldmore than triple funding for Community Technology Centers. The $100 million re-quest would support up to 1,000 new centers offering area residents access to ex-tended learning opportunities before and after school, adult education, and onlinejob databases. MASTERING THE BASICS The President 's budget also expands support for programs that help students master the basics and close achievement gaps between disadvantaged and minoritystudents and their more advantaged peers. The request includes $8.4 billion forTitle I Grants to Local Educational Agencies and $286 million for the third year ofthe Reading Excellence program, which helps all children to read well and inde-pendently by the end of the third grade. We would increase funding for Special Edu-36 cation Grants to States by $290 million for a total of $5.3 billion, while boosting sup- port for Special Education Parent Information Centers by 40 percent. Indian Education programs would receive $116 million, an increase of 50 percent, to provide larger formula grants to school districts for Indian Education programs,and to launch a new $5 million American Indian Administrator Corps that wouldtrain American Indian teachers and professionals to become school administrators. It is difficult if not impossible to master the basics in communities and schools threatened by youth violence. I know that preventing youth violence is a priorityshared by both President Clinton and the Chairman of this Subcommittee. To helpexpand the Youth Violence Initiative that you helped launch last year, Mr. Chair-man, we are requesting a $50 million or 25 percent increase in funding for Safe andDrug-Free Schools National Programs. These funds would be used primarily tomake new awards under the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative. This inter-agency initiative \u2014funded by the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor \u2014would receive a total of $247 million in 2001, an in- crease of more than $100 million over the 2000 level. IMPROVING TEACHER QUALITY We need to elevate the teaching profession and expand opportunities for teachers to continually update their skills. Improving teacher quality is a major emphasis inthe Educational Excellence for All Children Act, the Administration 's proposal for reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. We need to make sure our teachers are prepared to teach to the new State standards, and weneed to help States and communities deal with the projected nationwide shortageof 2 million teachers over the next 10 years. Our budget provides $1 billion for acomprehensive approach to reaching these goals, with an overall focus on preparingboth new and experienced teachers to bring high standards into the classroom. This includes $690 million for Teaching to High Standards State Grants, our TitleII reauthorization proposal to promote professional development linked to Statestandards and assessments. A new $75 million Hometown Teachers proposal wouldsupport comprehensive approaches to teacher recruitment and retention in high-need districts, while a $50 million Higher Standards, Higher Pay initiative wouldhelp high-poverty school districts attract and retain high-quality teachers throughbetter pay linked to a rigorous peer-review process. To help meet the growing demand for high-quality leadership in our school dis- tricts and schools, particularly in the area of implementing standards-based re-forms, the budget includes $40 million for a School Leadership Initiative. This newprogram would fund consortia-based efforts to provide current and prospective su-perintendents and principals \u2014particularly those serving high-poverty, low-per- forming districts and schools \u2014with the professional development opportunities needed to help them serve as effective leaders. The request also would provide $50 million to reward school districts that show the largest increases in the number of teachers who are fully certified and teachingin the field in which they are trained, $25 million to encourage career-changing pro-fessionals to enter the teaching ranks, and $30 million to train some 15,000 earlychildhood educators and caregivers in techniques to improve early literacy skills andprevent later reading difficulties. In addition, the 2001 budget includes $100 million for Bilingual Education Profes- sional Development to help address the critical national shortage of well-preparedbilingual and English-as-a-second-language (ESL) teachers. NEW PATHWAYS TO COLLEGE A college education remains the best guarantee of success in a rapidly changing, technology-based economy that demands critical-thinking skills and the ability toadapt to new ways of doing business. Postsecondary institutions are enjoying theirown enrollment boom \u2014climbing last fall to a record 14.9 million students \u2014but too few disadvantaged and minority students are entering and completing college. To help give these students and their families new pathways to college, the 2001 budget includes a $125 million increase for GEAR UP to provide 1.4 million low-income elementary and secondary school students the skills and encouragementthey need to enter and succeed in college. We also are asking for $725 million forTRIO outreach and support services to more than 760,000 disadvantaged postsec-ondary students. The TRIO request includes $35 million for a new College Comple-tion Challenge Grant program that would help reduce the college dropout rate, par-ticularly among poor and minority students. Another pathway to college is Tech-Prep Education, which supports efforts by partnerships of high schools, postsec-ondary institutions, and employers to create comprehensive technical education pro-37 grams that prepare students for both college and high-tech careers. The 2001 budget nearly triples Tech-Prep funding to $306 million. MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE Just as important as preparing for college is helping students and families pay the rising costs of a postsecondary education. Over the past six years larger Pellgrants, expanded work-study opportunities, lower borrowing costs on student loans,and Hope and Lifetime Learning tax benefits have made college financially possiblefor all who qualify. Paying for college is still a difficult burden, however, especially for low- and mid- dle-income families. Our 2001 budget would help reduce that burden. For example,we are proposing a maximum Pell Grant award of $3,500, a $200 increase over the2000 level. A $60 million increase for Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grantswould provide a total of $875 million in grant assistance to an estimated 1.2 millionundergraduate students, or 64,000 more than in 2000. And a $77 million increasefor Work-Study would continue the President 's commitment to give 1 million stu- dents the opportunity to work their way through college. Outside the discretionary budget for postsecondary education, President Clinton would dramatically expand tax benefits for postsecondary education through a newCollege Opportunities Tax Cut. This proposal would build on the Lifetime LearningTax Credit to give over 5 million families the option of taking a tax deduction orclaiming a 28 percent tax credit on up to $5,000 in annual postsecondary educationtuition and fees. The limit would rise to $10,000 in 2003, and the Treasury Depart-ment estimates families would save an additional $30 billion over 10 years, com-pared to the current Lifetime Learning tax credit. To increase academic opportunities for minority students and increase their num- bers in high-skill fields such as science and engineering, the President 's budget pro- poses $40 million for Dual-Degree Programs for Minority-Serving Institutions. Thisprogram would provide competitive grants to partnerships between Minority-Serv-ing Institutions (MSIs) and nationally recognized research universities. Partici-pating students would earn two degrees in five years, one from the MSI and onefrom the partner institution in a field in which minorities are underrepresented. Finally, the President 's budget targets additional funds to Latinos as part of the Administration 's Hispanic Education Action Plan. The 2001 request includes more than $800 million in increases intended to help expand educational opportunitiesand improve outcomes for Latinos. In addition to increases for programs like TitleI and TRIO that serve large numbers of Latino students, the request provides an$86 million increase for Adult Education, most of which would be used to triplefunding for Common Ground Partnership Grants. These grants support demonstra-tion programs that provide immigrants and other participants with English literacyskills, coupled with civic education and basic skills that are necessary to effectivelynavigate key institutions of American life. The budget also includes nearly a 50 per-cent increase for Hispanic-Serving Institutions to support postsecondary educationinstitutions that serve large percentages of Latino students. I believe this budget is a fitting start to a new century \u2014the Education Century \u2014 and would provide the resources needed to increase both quality and opportunityin our education system. The 2001 request will, as the President noted in his Stateof the Union address, move the Nation ''a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed. '' I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the President 's 2001 budget for education. Senator S PECTER . Before proceeding to our customary 5-minute rounds of questioning from the members, we have been joined bythe chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens. We would be delighted to hear from you, Mr. Chairman. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TED STEVENS Senator S TEVENS . Well, thank you very much. I apologize for being late. I do have a conference. I just have a very short state-ment I would like to make and submit some questions for therecord, if that can be done. I do welcome all three of you secretaries. I think it is a very great thing that you all would come at the same time, so we can38 have everyone here with responses that are of mutual importance to all of us, I am sure. I would like to put the full statement in the record, if I can.Senator S PECTER . Without objection, it will be. Senator S TEVENS . Secretary Shalala, I want to thank you par- ticularly for providing Alaska some great help, particularly in thearea of combating a very high rate of fetal alcohol syndrome andfetal alcohol effect problems in our State. Fetal alcohol syndrome,as we all know, is estimated to cost over $1.4 million for each per-son that is born with it. And unfortunately, we have the highest level per capita in the country. We believe it is an entirely preventable condition and ap-preciate what you are doing to help us work on the prevention side. I also am grateful to you for your assistance in making PET scans available to our seniors under the Medicare program. Wetalked about this last week. And I understand your staff and theHealth Care Financing Administration have agreed to a reasonablelevel of Medicare payment for PET scans under the new OutpatientHospital Payment System that is going to go into effect in the sum-mer. I congratulate you very much for that. I appreciate your agency 's willingness to continue working coop- eratively with the PET community on getting full, broad, coveragefor PET scans. It is my understanding the PET community will be submitting revised information to HCFA in the next 45 days. We will all befollowing the progress on that. And hopefully we will be able to getfull approval of PET coverage by this summer. Incidentally, in flying back from California on Sunday, I read a whole series of new brochures that are out from across the countryon the use of PET, how we are expanding its use into all forms ofcancer, as well as the brain. I think it just an invaluable new sys- tem of imaging and diagnosis. I am very interested in it because of my great friend, Dr. Michael Phelps of UCLA, who is the inventor of that. And I am very proudof him as a friend. It has been about 20 years ago now that Istopped off to see him at UCLA. And he gave me a rundown of thePET scan. I told him I was supposed to make a speech to the National Con- vention of the American Legion that day. When he got through giv-ing me his presentation, I asked him what time it was, and he saidit was 8:00 p.m. I started at 3:00 with him, and unfortunatelymissed that convention altogether, I was so mesmerized by what hewas doing. He has undoubtedly made a significant contribution toour medical diagnostic capability. And I do believe that it is going to be expanding in its use, pri- marily because of the help you and your staff are providing. IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION Secretary Riley, I am also here to tell you I am particularly pleased with your recognition of the importance of technology inour classrooms and training teachers to effectively use that tech-nology.39 LONG -DISTANCE EDUCATION I am sure you know we are going into our State with a whole new concept of education by distance, long-distance education. Tele-medicine and tele-education are two very important opportunitiesfor our State, which is, after all, one-fifth the size of the wholeUnited States. In the past, many opportunities were denied to our teachers and students in Alaska because of the isolation of rural communitiesand villages. But distance education will change that. Alaska and Hawaii in particular, and some of the rural south 48 States will benefit tremendously from the new technologies in dis-tance education. I am very grateful to all you for what you andyour people have done working with us. BALANCE BUDGET REQUEST WITH RESOURCES A word of caution, however. I am disappointed in the President 's budget request because it promises more than we can deliver. It in-cludes paying out monies that theoretically come in as taxes, whichhave no chance of being approved. And because of that, we are going to have a real difficulty in maintaining our commitment to a balanced budget and our positionthat we will not use the Social Security surplus in financing theworking operations of the Federal Government. I look forward to working with the chairman, the members of this committee, and all of you to try to come up with a realisticspending plan for the next fiscal year that will meet our needs andnot return to the days of a heavy deficit. PREPARED STATEMENT Thank you very much. And I will submit the questions.Senator S PECTER . Thank you, Senator Stevens. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TEDSTEVENS Senator Specter, Senator Harkin, and members of the subcommittee. I'd like to begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman for the leadership you have shown in working to prevent youth violence. When we presented our fiscal year 2001 budget, I noted that the searing images we saw last year at Columbine and other schools must never be repeated. If there was ever a bi-partisan issue \u2014this is it. That 's why the President worked with Congress to establish a new White House Council on Youth Violence to get all Federal agencies thinking and working togetherto prevent youth violence. And that 's why my colleagues, Secretary Herman and Secretary Riley, and I join you in your determination to bring to bear the resources we need to fight this prob-lem effectively. At HHS, the Surgeon General is developing a Report on Youth Violence that we hope will be completed this year. However, this much we already know: Violence is preventable. So we intend to find out what works. What doesn 't. And then publish and disseminate a sourcebook of best practices. Our budget also increases the Mental Health Block Grant by $60 million \u2014a full 17 percent. And we 're budgeting another $78 million to stop youth violence. Now let me highlight other important features of our budget and why we believe this budget is critical to the health and future of the American people. Our fiscal year 2001 budget brings us to where we should be at the dawn of a new century: A great nation pledging allegiance to great goals.40 Those goals are: Expanded health care coverage; renewed support for children and families; greater scientific advancement; and the creation of a healthier America. Our fiscal year 2001 budget brings those goals within reach \u2014without loosening our commitment to fiscal discipline and a balanced budget. This budget is about people.It makes a record investment in health care coverage. In access. And in quality.Two years ago, with bipartisan support, we launched the State Children 's Health Insurance Program. Two million children are now enrolled.Now we want to make sure that this new program \u2014and Medicaid \u2014carry millions more children, and their parents, into the safe harbor of quality health care. The President 's FamilyCare program will do that. Even as we expand coverage to some parents through FamilyCare, we recognize that many low income adults work in jobs that do not offer health insurance. These workers frequently rely on local health institutions and professionals who provide services at a reduced or no cost. This year we want to increase our support for these community service networks to $125 million \u2014five times our investment last year. We need to strengthen and modernize Medicare.First and foremost that means dedicating about $300 billion of the on-budget sur- plus over 10 years to extend the solvency of the Trust Fund until 2025. We must also add a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare.As the President said in his State of the Union, we would never design Medicare today without a prescription drug benefit. We can 't change the past. However, we can change the future. But, the longer we wait, the worse the problem will become \u2014and the more expen- sive it will become. Government cannot step into the shoes of parents and communities, but govern- ment does have a role to play in helping families balance work and children. One recent study notes that in 1998 only 10 percent of the 14.7 million children eligible for Federal child care subsidies received them. So as part of the President 's Child Care Initiative, this year 's budget adds another $817 million to the Child Care Development Block Grant. This is part of our discretionary budget and brings the total Block Grant to $2 billion. Mr. Chairman, Head Start is one of the most successful bipartisan programs our two branches of government has ever created for children. This year we 're requesting $6.3 billion for Head Start. That 's $1 billion more than last year \u2014and the largest increase in the history of Head Start. I can 't talk about children without talking about drugs. I know, Mr. Chairman, that you would like to pursue this further in our question and answer period. We know marijuana use has leveled off among teens. But too many teens are still saying ''yes'' to drugs and alcohol. That 's why our budget includes over $3.3 billion for substance abuse treatment and prevention. I mentioned the success we 've had cutting the death rate from AIDS. But HIV/AIDS is still a disease without a cure \u2014and is still the greatest public health challenge both here and around the world. So fighting HIV/AIDS remains a top priority for the Department.Our total AIDS budget this year is $9.2 billion \u2014an increase of 8.4 percent over last year. Every agency 's AIDS-fighting budget is going up in prevention, treatment and re- search. On the prevention side, we propose to spend an additional $75 million to help stop the spread of this disease. Specifically, the CDC will direct $40 million of the new funds to local commu- nities \u2014including prevention services targeted to minority populations. CDC will spend another $26 million to fight AIDS around the world.At the same time, the Health Resources and Services Administration will expend $1.7 billion in Ryan White funding to help people living with HIV/AIDS. This is a $125 million increase over last year.Our budget request for AIDS-related research at NIH is $2.1 billion, a 5.2 percent increase over last year. The total NIH budget this year is $18.8 billion \u2014$1 billion more than a year ago. This subcommittee should take pride in the unprecedented investment we have made in basic and clinical research. Our shared commitment to NIH, . . .41 . . . and to producing quality science and scientists \u2014on both the NIH campus and at great research universities \u2014is an extraordinary legacy. Years from now, we will see results beyond our wildest dreams.Some of those results are certain to come from the $73 million we intend to in- vest\u2014over 2 years \u2014to build a National Neuroscience Research Center at NIH. This will put all NIH brain research under one roof.More important the Center will usher in what is certain to be The Century of the Brain. In the interest of time \u2014let me quickly mention three other areas where we intend to increase our discretionary budget. We take very seriously the need to stop infectious diseases and bioterrorism.Our budget increases by almost 50 percent CDC 's funding for disease surveillance. As for bioterrorism \u2014which may be the biggest threat of the 21st century \u2014we're proposing to spend $265 million to prepare for, and respond to, a biological attack. We also want to make a major investment in bricks and mortar.In addition to the Neuroscience Research Center at NIH, CDC proposes to spend $127 million \u2014$70 million more than last year \u2014to modernize and expand three lab- oratory sites. The remaining funds will go toward completing the Edward R. Roybal infectious disease lab, and construction of a new environmental health lab. Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude my testimony by noting that our greatest moral imperative is to close the gaps in health outcomes between minorities and the ma-jority population. In 1998, the President set a goal of ending health disparities in six major areas.Now, almost every operating division is working to close these gaps.That includes an additional $35 million at CDC for community-based research and demonstration projects to reduce disparities. Thank you. TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FOR WELFARE WORKERS Senator S PECTER . Secretary Herman, when you talk about areas of needs, of trying to move workers from, say, the inner city, wherethere are no jobs, to the suburbs, where there are jobs, I think thatis an area which requires special attention. And I thank you for taking the initial steps to free $1.3 million for Philadelphia. We talked about that week before last, and youacted on it last week. But when I visited the transit system yester-day, I was told the check was in the mail. Do you know how faralong the delivery route that check is? Secretary H ERMAN . I believe it will arrive on Thursday. Senator S PECTER . OK. So I will report back to them that it is still in the mail. That program needs a lot of additions. They transport 1,500 peo- ple in buses, and they have some 9 vans. But I am making a sur-vey to see how many poor people need that transportation, whatit would do for the lives of people giving them dignity and a job,and what it would do for the taxpayers on reducing welfare pay-ments. So we are going to come back to you there, but I do appre-ciate your help. BIOTERRORISM Secretary Shalala, you commented specifically about the $265 million on bioterrorism. A commission just finished its work a fewmonths ago on dealing with weapons of mass destruction. I servedas vice chairman. And the commission did not move into the do-mestic area. And I believe that is something that we ought to bedoing more on, this subcommittee, and will. But could you give us in a general way the use of the $265 mil- lion on anti-bioterrorism?42 Secretary S HALALA . Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you well know, unlike other kinds of terrorism, bioterrorism, the responsefor it needs to be done on the ground in local communities. And, much of this money is focused on building up the public health infrastructure and educating the medical community, bothin terms of identifying what may turn out to be a release of somekind of disease and reporting it as quickly as possible. So what we do on the ground level is strengthen the existing public health infrastructure and the State and community publichealth officials that are responsible. And, simultaneously strength-en our surveillance systems, which were set up originally for infec-tious diseases, but now are full reporting systems for any kind ofoutbreaks, which are reported from the community, State, and thento the CDC, and our response time in our laboratory capacitiesacross the country in being able to make a diagnosis quickly. Senator S PECTER . Could you give me your evaluation as to the adequacy of our domestic program against potential bioterrorism? Secretary S HALALA . The current program is inadequate. And that is the reason for these substantial investments at both the locallevel, the State level, as well as the national level. Senator S PECTER . I would like to work with you on the staff level. I do not want to cut you short, but I want to come to a couplemore questions. Secretary S HALALA . We would be happy to do that. The person who is coordinating it in the Department, I want to point out, isthe Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Peggy Ham-burg, who is a physician and the former New York City healthcommissioner. Senator S PECTER . That is a good start. Secretary S HALALA . We particularly picked someone who actually knows what you do on the ground and how you can strengthen thesystem from the bottom up. MEETING DIVERSE NEEDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS Senator S PECTER . Secretary Riley, last year we had a real battle over the potential for local flexibility on the issue of providing addi-tional teachers. And the question which I would like you to providefor the record, because I want to ask another question before myred light goes on, I intend to observe it, is what is the disadvantageof allowing a school board to go for books or computers or someother facet, instead of hiring teachers to reduce class size? PREVENTION OF YOUTH VIOLENCE But the question I want to get a response from all three of you secretaries on is, our program against youth violence has looked atexisting resources on the National Institute of Mental Health andCenter for Disease Control, the parenting initiatives, et cetera. MASS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND YOUTH VIOLENCE But what about the role of movies and television and the com- puter and video games? And we do not want to point fingers, asmany have, there specifically. But to what extent should we lookat that? Considering the first amendment rights and freedom of43 speech, how big a problem is it? And what are your suggestions as to what we ought to be doing there? May we just work through thepanel? Secretary Riley, why do you not start?Secretary R ILEY. Well, when you have the distribution system this country has, the capacity to deliver and the amount and avail-ability of information that we have now \u2014and we have really only scratched the surface, you then are going to have considerableissues to deal with. And that is the availability of undesirable in-formation and so forth to youngsters. And I emphasize the important role that parents and teachers play in that. I think no matter how many filters you have, howmuch you try to deal with that \u2014I was in the mine force in the Navy, and we were always talking about measures and counter-measures. And you get a countermeasure for filtering out some-thing, and then they develop a measure to produce it in a differentway. So I think you can have all of that, and it is a help. But really, it falls back on, I think, parents working with young people, mak-ing sure that the availability and the use of these powerful toolsis supervised and managed. And the same applies with teachers in schools. Schools can do a better job than families, because they have the constant super-vision of computers and other information. So I think it is a com-bination of things. All of these technical things are important. Butreally, it falls back on quality teachers and quality parents. Senator S PECTER . I am going to come back to this question in the second round, because we have quite a large attendance. And I donot want to exceed the 5-minute rule here. Senator Harkin. PENSIONS PAID VIA LUMP SUM VS . ANNUITY Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Herman, I sent you a letter on January 28 discussing what appears to be an increasingly common, but unfortunate, prac-tice concerning pensions. What is happening is that many majorcompanies offer employees retiring early the option of taking theirpension benefits as a lump sum. ERISA requires that all definedbenefit plans must pay benefits as an annuity, must pay it as anannuity, unless the employee and his or her spouse knowinglyagrees to waive the annuity form. Although the statutes and regulations require the plan fiduciary to disclose the ''relative value '' of the optional forms of a benefit, a growing number of these employers not only fail to disclose,some, I think, even try to hide the fact that the lump sum has avalue far less than the annuity. I think this represents a clear vio-lation of the specific ERISA statutes and regulations, as well as anemployer 's general fiduciary responsibility. Have you looked into this? And are you proposing any plans to stop this kind of an abusive practice? Secretary H ERMAN . Senator, we are looking very carefully into it. And I certainly appreciate the concern and the interest that youhave taken in particular in this issue, because what it really boilsdown to is the ability of beneficiaries, of participants, to make in-44 formed judgements and their right to know. It is not necessarily the quantity of the information, but it is about the quality of theinformation that is needed to make critical retirement decisions. And we want to continue to work with you and others in efforts to advance the whole education effort to ensure, first of all, thatplan participants are getting the information that they need tomake informed decisions about their own retirement. But additionally, as your letter points out, we are also working with Treasury, and the IRS, to look at what formal steps we mayneed to take in this area regarding the specific obligations ofERISA. And I will be sure to have a written response to your letterin the very near future. CDC'S BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that, and I appreciate your atten- tion to this. And one of the examples I used in my letter, the annu-ity option had an actuarial value 80 percent larger than the lumpsum. And yet, the information that was given to the employee didnot point that out at all. And, of course, you hold out a lump sum and tell them they can invest in the stock market and they can make all this fast moneyand stuff. It looks very nice. But really what is happening is, basi- cally the employer is buying back the annuity at a very reducedrate. So I encourage you to pursue this vigorously, and I am sure that you will. Secretary Shalala, recently I visited the Center for Disease Con- trol in Atlanta. And I have to tell you, I was shocked at the condi-tion of the facility at the world 's premier disease control center, the one that people around the world look to for the prevention of out-breaks, the rapid response to the various diseases and viruses thatare coming out. I understand just in the last 20 years 35 newlyemerging diseases have been identified and are becoming virulent. I remember when Senator Hatfield left the Senate. He spoke on the Senate floor about the fact that with the Cold War over, it isno longer the Russians are coming, but the viruses are coming. Andhe spoke about the need to invest more basically in NIH. I think we have focused a lot on NIH. You have, to your great credit, we have on this committee, to the chairman 's credit, focused on doubling NIH research. He has been a great leader in that. Iwonder if maybe we have not somehow kind of shortchanged theCenter for Disease Control. I remember the movie Outbreak withDustin Hoffman in it. I always assumed it was filmed there. Senator H ARKIN . That is sort of what I assumed. I get down there and find out that the movie producers came down there andlooked at CDC and, as I understand it, refused to film it there be-cause no one would believe how bad it was. So they went to Holly-wood and built their own set. So what you see in the movie wasnot the actual Center for Disease Control. Now I know they have a proposal in for new buildings. And I must say that the time frame is too long. I think somehow we haveto collapse that time frame. I am just shocked. I do not know whyI had not really paid more attention to this myself in the past. Ithink perhaps a lot of focused on NIH and the basic research.45 But when you are talking about these newly emerging viruses and diseases and outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, I mean, this iswhere we look worldwide for rapid intervention. So I just \u2014and I have to believe that it makes it more difficult to recruit scientists, too, when they go down and take a look at thatplace. Who wants to work there? I mean, it really is bad. I knowyou know that. I mean, you have been there. But I am just wondering for your response, just a general re- sponse, on the conditions and whether you think we should bepushing a little bit harder and faster on the buildings and renova-tion of CDC than what we are doing. Secretary S HALALA . Senator Harkin, I welcome the opportunity to talk to you about that. I do not disagree with your comments.In fact, this year 's budget has 122-percent increase in our request for construction money. It is part of a master plan. What I would like to do is to work with the committee and iden- tify and show you what we have done in a master plan. If youwould like to shorten the amount of time, we would certainly beprepared to talk to you. But we have now laid out a master plan. This may be a case of a little out of sight, out of mind. And, we need to pay attention. The focus on CDC, in this budget, is my per-sonal highest priority. As I am ending my tour of duty in govern-ment and since I spent much of my career working with State gov-ernments, we could figure out how to finance capital projects. We have to do it out of every year 's budget, as opposed to stretch- ing it out over time. And the budget rules are just irresponsible,in my judgment, about the financing of capital projects. We haveto put everything in the budget in 1 year \u2014\u2014 Senator H ARKIN . Crazy. Secretary S HALALA [continuing]. As opposed to spreading it over time. And we need to work through these issues when we are in- vesting in institutions as important as the CDC or the NIH or anyof the other institutions where we have to build facilities. FDA also has a proposal here. It has been just as difficult to struggle to make sure that FDA has first-class facilities, because ofthe way the budgeting rules work, and not our lack of interest orattention to the structures that we think are so responsible and im-portant to the quality of work. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you. Senator S PECTER . Thank you, Senator Harkin. Senator Feinstein. CLINICAL TRIALS DATA BASE Senator F EINSTEIN . Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to compliment the three of you on your presentations. I thought they were excellent. With your permission, Mr. Chairman,I will submit a statement for the record. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN Thank you to all of you for coming before our subcommittee today. You are re- sponsible for addressing some of the nation 's most pressing problems. Let me name a few that face my state, the largest state in the nation, 34 million people.46 EDUCATION California 's needs Our nation 's schools face huge challenges \u2014low test scores, crowded classrooms, teacher shortages, booming enrollments, decrepit buildings. \u2014California has 5.8 million students, more students than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the US. \u2014California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. Eleven percent or 30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency credentials. \u2014California has 40 percent of nation 's immigrants; we have 50 languages in some schools. \u2014For school construction, modernization and deferred maintenance, California needs $21 billion by 2003 or 7 new classrooms per day. Two million Californiachildren go to school today in 86,000 portable classrooms. \u2014California 's Head Start programs serve only 13 percent of eligible children. \u2014For higher education, the University of California has the most diverse student body in the US. Federal programs provide nearly 55 percent of all student fi-nancial aid funding that UC students received. Our colleges and universities arefacing ''Tidal Wave II, '' the demographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers who will inundate California 's colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010 because the number of high school graduates will jump 30 percent. So our needs are huge. Fiscal year 2001 education budget While these needs cry out for resources, the federal share of elementary secondary education funding has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent in 1999. Fund-ing is so short in my state that California teachers are spending around $1,000 ayear out of their own pockets to pay for books, magic markers, scissors and otherschool supplies, according to the San Diego Tribune, August 16, 1999. I commend the Administration for proposing to increase education funding in fis- cal year 2001 to $40.1 billion or 12.6 percent. I welcome this increase. I hope wecan do better because the status quo in American public education is not enough. I would like to share with you, Secretary Riley, some of my concerns:Title I: For the Title I program, I have two concerns: First is the ''hold harmless '' provision. Thank you, Secretary Riley, for opposing the Title I ''hold harmless '' pro- vision that has been included in our appropriations bills. I hope you will more ac-tively work to prevent its enactment again. In 1994, Congress included in the Title I law a requirement that you annually update the number of poor children so that the allocation of funds would truly re-flect the most up-to-date number of poor children. This is a very important provisionto growing states like mine. However, despite my opposition, the hold harmless pro-vision has been included in annual appropriations bills, effectively overriding thecensus update requirement and locking in historic funding amounts for states de-spite the change in the number of poor children. Secretary Riley, I whole-heartedly agree with your statement last year \u2014which I hope you will reaffirm today \u2014that ''a basic principle in targeting should be to drive funds to where the poor children are, not to where they were a decade ago. '' With 18 percent of the country 's Title I students, California only receives 11.4 per- cent of Title I funds. Please join me in vigorously fighting the hold harmless provi-sion. At least, 775,000 eligible Title I students are not getting services in my state. Second, on Title I, I hope we can work together to better focus the funding on academic achievement. Title I reaches virtually every school district and can be animportant force for change. I hope you will give me your thoughts on how to putmore ''academic teeth '' into Title I. Head Start Head Start is one of the most important federal programs because it has the po- tential to reach children early in their formative years when their cognitive skillsare developing. Many studies have confirmed the significance of bringing positiveinfluences to early brain development. But we know that poor children dispropor-tionately start school behind their peers \u2014they are less likely to count to 10 or to recite the alphabet. Every child deserves not just a good start, but a head start. And yet, ''Head Start has only vague performance standards and no curriculum to stimulate the growth of literacy and numeracy, '' say Henry Aaron and Robert Reschaeur in Setting National Priorities, The 2000 Election and Beyond. Researchtells us that for every dollar invested, we save $7.00 in decreased expenditures forcompensatory education, crime and welfare. I hope that both you Secretary Riley47 and Secretary Shalala will discuss the plight and challenges of Head Start with me. I will have some very specific questions to pose to you. The proposed addition of $1 billion for HeadStart to enroll 1 million more children by 2002, a 19 percent increase, is good first step. California has 764,462 poor chil-dren age 5 and under in poverty, but we only serving only 13 percent of eligiblechildren. We must do better. I want to explore with you the challenge of major re-form of the Head Start program to better prepare children for school at a time whenhigh quality preschool programs can have long lasting benefits. Impact aid I am disappointed in your impact aid request. You are proposing to cut Impact Aid from $906.5 million in fiscal year 2000 to $770 million in 2001. California has 119 school districts receiving Impact Aid, helping 1 million stu- dents. In fiscal year 2000, California is receiving $57 million in Impact Aid. In Cali-fornia, Impact Aid funds only 23 percent of the cost of educating a federally-con-nected student. This is an important program in a state that has many tax-exemptfederal properties. Immigrant education I am disappointed that your budget request proposes flat funding \u2014no increase \u2014 for immigrant education. Appropriations were $150 million in 1998, $150 million in1999, and $150 million in 2000 and you have requested $150 million. California receives $180.00 for each eligible immigrant child which hardly begins to address the needs these children bring to the classroom. These are the most at-risk of all children. They speak another language; their schooling has been inter- rupted and they have huge adjustment challenges. Can 't we do better? Other education challenges I commend the President 's initiatives on school construction, both the tax credits for bondholders and the new school renovation grants. These are long overdue. The continued drive to hire teachers and reduce class sizes is right on target. California started reducing class sizes in grades K -3 in the 1996 -1997 school year. We had then and we still have some of the largest class sizes in the country. Andevery parent knows that the smaller the class the more individualized attention stu-dents receive and the more effective the teacher can be. CHILD CARE Secretary Shalala, I am so pleased to see that the Administration has rec- ommended $818 million for the Child Care Development Block Grant. As you know,Senators Dodd and Jeffords offered an amendment last year to increase funding toassist working families with the costs of child care. The Dodd-Jeffords amendmentdoubled the discretionary funding for the CCDBG by $818 million to a total of $2billion. The amendment passed 41 -54, but was dropped in conference with the House and was not included in the final version of the bill. I understand that Sen-ator Specter has committed to including the increased funding in his chairman 's mark for fiscal year 2001 appropriations. I am hoping these funds will not be for-ward funded this year, as in previous years. HEALTH CARE Now I will turn to health care, another important concern of Californians. California 's needs We have an uninsured rate of 24 percent (7.3 million people), far above the na- tional rate of 17 percent. Despite a thriving economy, the number of Californianswithout health insurance grows by 23,000 per month, far exceeding the nationalrate. California has the second highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the US.While the AIDS death rate has declined, it is till too high; 40,000 new infections develop eachyear. In California, 100,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS. Nationally, half of allHIV-infected people do not receive regular medical care (Rand study, December1998). California ranks 37th overall among states having children immunized by the age of 18 to 24 months. In my state, 37 hospitals have closed since 1996 and 15 percent more may close by 2005. Over half my state 's hospitals are losing money. Seismic safety require- ments add more cost strains.48 Health budget National Institutes of Health While I welcome the $1 billion or 5.6 percent increase, I am told that to keep us on the path toward doubling NIH over five years, the increase should be $2.7 billion.Even though Congress has given NIH generous increases in the last two years, NIHis 1999 could still only fund 32 percent of grant proposals. Our investment in biomedical research has given us longer lives, healthier lives, and cures and new treatments. This is an area of governmental activity that Americans overwhelmingly support. Fifty-five percent of Californians said they would pay more in taxes for more med-ical research Cancer The President proposed only a 5.9 percent increase for cancer research. Cancer is a concern of virtually every American. Fifty percent of Americans have had someone close them die from cancer. The American Cancer Society and other major cancer groups are calling for a 15 percent increase for the National Cancer Institute, raising NCI from $3.25 billionto $4.1 billion. The Cancer March, that came to Washington in September 1999, called for in- creasing the National Cancer Institute budget by 20 percent each year for 4 years,to get to $10 billion by 2005. They cited the impending ''cancer explosion, '' coming with the aging of the American population. Because of the aging of the population,the incidence of cancer will reach staggering proportions by 2010, with a 29 percentincrease in incidence and a 25 percent increase in deaths, at a cost of over $200billion per year. The cancer burden will balloon especially in the next 10 to 25 yearsas the country 's demographics change. Why invest more in cancer research? The Cancer March Research Task Force said we could reduce cancer deaths from 25 to 40 percent over the next 20 year period,saving 150,000 to 225,000 lives each year. Other areas that could be enhanced arebringing new cancer drugs from the laboratory to clinical trials; continuing to iden-tify genes involved in cancer; improving our understanding of the interaction be-tween genes and environmental exposures; finding new ways to detect cancers ear-lier when they are small, not invasive and more easily treated. We must also improve participation in cancer clinical trials. Medicare bene- ficiaries account for more than 50 percent of all cancer diagnoses and 60 percentof all cancer deaths, but only two percent participate in clinical trials. Along this line, I hope Secretary Shalala can tell us today that the clinical trials database that we enacted in 1997 is all ready to go. This is an important 1 -800 number for patients and doctors to find out what research trials for serious and life-threatening diseases are underway. Cancer prevention is another area that needs increased resources. The American Cancer Society says that 60 to 70 percent of all cancers are preventable. We needto do more in this area so that Americans never get cancer. Other health programs I welcome the President 's initiatives to fill in some of the gaps in health care \u2014 new initiatives like expanding the CHIP program to children 's parents; strength- ening enrollment in CHIP through schools and child care centers; increasing fund-ing for community health centers; restoring Medicaid to immigrant children who en-tered the U. S. after August 1996 and to legal immigrant pregnant women; in-creases for immunizations; for HIV/AIDs services. All of these are very importantto my state. I do have to question why the HHS budget cuts funding to train health profes- sionals by $84 million. Almost one in five Californians lives in a health professionsshortage area. We are facing a nursing shortage and will need 43,000 more nursesby 2010, which is a conservative estimate based on a projected 23 percent increasein the state 's population. Even though we have a booming economy, we are faced with many challenges to which your budgets respond. I look forward to working with you to craft a final billthat responds to these concerns that I have outlined. I am also concerned about the delay in establishing the clinical trials database. We passed the FDA bill requiring NIH to set up a toll-free 1 -800 number in 1997. We created it at the suggestion of patients and their doctors who said they needone simple place to go to find out what research trials were being conducted. I amquite concerned that, two and a half years later, this still not be set up and an-nounced. I hope you will have good news today, Secretary Shalala. Thank you again for coming before our subcommittee.49 Senator F EINSTEIN . Secretary Shalala, it is my understanding that last night your department announced that you are imple-menting the clinical trials database Senator Snowe and I authored.Will it now be possible for an individual to call a 1 -800 number and get information about clinical trials relating to acute diseases? Secretary S HALALA . More important than just the 1 -800 number, they will be able to go on the website, get information about indi-vidual clinical trials, and find out who to contact about that par-ticular clinical trial. So it is a very transparent system on clinicaltrials. I think the first 4,000 are up and on the website. So from our point of view, your initiative and our ability to get this up on the website so that people find out what the clinical trialis doing, how to enroll, and specifically who to call, this is a majorstep forward in health in this country. Senator F EINSTEIN . Well, thank you very much. Secretary S HALALA . And thank you for your leadership. HEAD START Senator F EINSTEIN . Well, Senator Snowe and I appreciate that very much. Thank you. Let me just share with you some of my thinking about Head Start. I appreciate very much that there is an additional $1 billion to expand the program by about 17 percent. I am coming to ques-tion whether we should expand the program prior to the time wemake Head Start truly a Head Start program. I am finding thatmany Head Start classrooms do not teach any cognitive skillswhatsoever. I am also finding that the standards are vague and that Head Start is a missed opportunity. One of the major cities in Californiahas just told me they can only pay $22,000 a year for a Head Startteacher. You are not going to get a Head Start teacher that is goingto bring about any quality education for that. And then I took a look at the French system, looked a little bit about what the Core Knowledge Foundation is doing in setting upsome model Head Start programs. I really think we are missing theboat by expanding Head Start without improving the quality of theprogram first. And since this is a 100-percent federally funded program, it seems to me that not only do we miss the boat, but we have anobligation to see that standards and quality are present. I thinkthere is enough information. Cognitive learning is quite possible inchildren of a Head Start age. My questions are these, and I will just ask them, and then per- haps you can respond: What is HHS doing to move Head Startfrom custodial child care to a program that stresses cognitive devel-opment and learning? Second, would HHS be opposed to changing the focus of the Head Start program so that more attention is placed on the developmentof cognitive skills? Third, what kind of coordination or communication does the De- partment of Education have with HHS on this program? And finally, should we not really move Head Start to the Depart- ment of Education and convert it into a strong preschool programand focus on cognitive development?50 COGNITIVE SKILLS AND STANDARDS IN HEAD START Secretary S HALALA . Let me answer those questions quickly. The answer is that Head Start is the strongest preschool program that we have in this country. Over the last 7 years this administrationhas invested substantially in improving not only the cognitivelearning part of the program, but in raising the standards. In fact,25 percent of all the new money going into Head Start has beeninvested specifically in raising the quality of the program. So tough have we been on this program that we have closed over 150 Head Start programs that did not meet our standards. Noother government program has been as effective in both raisingstandards and closing down programs that did not meet our stand-ards. Before we came into this administration, not one Head Start pro- gram had ever been closed for not meeting its standards in the his-tory of its program. The difference between Head Start and other kinds of custodial programs is in fact its investment in training and in specific stand-ards. In fact, the specific rules of Head Start, are much more de-tailed than other programs. I would be happy to talk to you at some length about the cog- nitive part of Head Start. But the genius of Head Start is that itis comprehensive. It integrates both health, social services, edu-cation and learning. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IN HEAD START The evaluations of the program have concluded that it is a stronger program than any other preschool programs in this coun-try. And parents ' satisfaction of this program is the highest of any government agency or government program that we have. It iseven higher than the ratings for Mercedes and BMW in customersatisfaction of the program. SHOULD HEAD START BE TRANSFERRED FROM HHS TO ED ? Do I think it should be transferred to Education? I do not. But let me tell you specifically why. First, the history of Head Start isa history of a program that was started because of what was per-ceived as the weakness in the education programs in this country,a lack of parental involvement. However, we have built a series ofpartnerships with the Department of Education. And increasingly there are incentives in Head Start for public schools to integrate Head Start programs with their other pre-school programs, their kindergarten programs. So there is a seam-less program. But evaluations have shown something very interesting. And that is, where Head Start programs are standalone, there is moreparental involvement than in these new cooperative endeavors withpublic schools. That is, you get less parental integration into theprogram when there is a cooperative agreement with a publicschool than you do with standalone programs. That means we see ourselves as reformers of the role of public schools and of public education. And no one has been a stronger51 supporter in HHS than I have been of public education in this country. But it is a different kind of program of the highest quality that has played an important role, I believe, in our understanding ofpreschool education and its quality by any measure. If you trotted out here the world 's greatest experts on early child- hood education, including the experts from the Yale Study Center,they would say to you, this program has gone through a trans-formation over the last 7 years, that it is strong both cognitivelyin terms of what it teaches and in the way it is managed and theway programs are integrated. So we started out with an overall assessment by experts in the field. They told us what to do. We have incorporated those. Wehave invested this money heavily in improving the quality, teachertraining, and all the other parts of the program. But simultaneously, we have kept the heart of the program. And that is integrating parents into the learning process for theseyoung people. Senator S PECTER . Secretary Shalala, you are on a very big sub- ject. Could you supplement your answer for the record? Secretary S HALALA . I will, yes. Senator S PECTER . Because we are pretty much over time. Secretary S HALALA . With both the data and the research. And I would be happy to look at any California programs that my goodfriend, the Senator from California, thinks are weak in particular.And I would be happy to have our teams look at them very care-fully. Senator F EINSTEIN . Mr. Chairman, would it be possible to ask Secretary Riley to respond to that as well? Senator S PECTER . Well \u2014\u2014 Secretary R ILEY. How about in writing? Senator F EINSTEIN . In writing? Senator S PECTER [continuing]. If you can briefly. Senator F EINSTEIN . In writing would be fine. Senator S PECTER . If you can briefly respond orally, and supple- ment it, Mr. Secretary, in writing, because we do have other Sen-ators who are waiting. FOCUS ON COGNITIVE SKILLS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD Secretary R ILEY. Very briefly, I want to thank Secretary Shalala for really honing in during the reauthorization of Head Start a cou-ple years ago and all the work that has been done since in cen-tering on standards and quality. I think the question, Senator, is the cognitive skills for early childhood, which, as you point out and as Secretary Shalala haspointed out, have gotten more attention with all the brain researchand so forth. The question is, are they provided, and not how andwhere. I am not into the empire building of the Department of Edu- cation. I am interested in cognitive skills being there in HeadStart. And as I read it, they are very strong. That is a very strongfocus from HHS now, and they really are trying to move in thatdirection as rapidly as possible and are doing a grand job movingin that direction.52 HHS AND EDUCATION COORDINATION ON HEAD START We are working closely with them, with the overlap of Title I. The flexibility of Title I enables school districts to use Title I forearly childhood. And so we are seeing more and more of that, andwe are working very well in a cooperative way. [The information follows:] HEAD START Head Start is America 's premiere early childhood education program, and con- tinues to lead the way in state-of-the-art approaches to enhancing young children 's development. Head Start 's performance standards are, in fact, quite comprehensive and clearly delineate what programs must do in serving children and families.These standards cover the areas of Education and Early Childhood Development,Child Health, Child Mental Health, Child Nutrition, Family Partnerships, Commu-nity Partnerships and Program Governance, among others. A copy of these stand-ards is attached. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Performance Standardon Education and Early Childhood Development clearly requires that all programsmust, in collaboration with Head Start parents, implement a curriculum and goeson to discuss what this curriculum must include. This Administration has invested heavily in improving not only the cognitive learning aspects of this program, but in raising its standards. We have paired in-vestment in critical elements of quality such as teacher compensation and trainingwith a tough approach to enforcement of high standards in every Head Start pro-gram. Annual salaries for Head Start teachers have increased from $14,600 in 1992to $20,700 this year. Since 1995, more than 140 local grantees have been replacedbecause they have been unable to rectify deficiencies in program quality. We willcontinue these investments in fiscal year 2001 and will devote more than half ofall new Head Start money to continued improvements in the quality of the program. In addition, Head Start has made a commitment to measuring child outcomes, in- cluding cognitive outcomes as well as other key aspects of children 's development and parental involvement. Our research shows that typical children leave HeadStart with a wide range of specific knowledge and skills that prepare them for kin- dergarten. These practical, common sense achievements form the foundation for con-tinued progress in learning by Head Start children in kindergarten where they showstatistically significant growth in vocabulary, letter recognition, writing and otherpre-reading skills. Head Start provides top-quality early childhood education along with comprehen- sive services, such as health, nutrition, and family support services, to almost900,000 low-income, preschool children and their families across the nation, includ-ing more than 81,000 children and their families in California. Head Start currently places a strong emphasis on cognitive skills. Preliminary re- sults from the Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) indicate that averageprogram quality is in the ''good '' to ''excellent '' range and no classroom scored below the ''minimal quality '' range. Head Start children are ready for school, performing above the levels expected for children from low-income families who have not at-tended center-based programs. The survey also found that 66 percent of Head Startparents read to their child three or more times a week and that 70 -90 percent of parents teach their children letters, numbers or songs. We are building upon this progress with new initiatives, including expanded training in family literacy services, new partnerships with pre-kindergarten andchild care programs, and the development of local grantee systems to track and ana-lyze child outcome data. The Head Start Bureau has extensive collaborative relationships and initiatives with the Department of Education, including the following: \u2014Recent joint sponsorship with Title I, Even Start, and HHS 's Child Care Bureau of a national leadership forum of State leaders and managers of pre-kinder-garten, Head Start, and child care programs to explore new opportunities to useState and Federal early childhood funding to reach more children with higherquality services and to identify ways to eliminate barriers to cross-program col-laboration. \u2014Long-standing involvement with ED in joint efforts to serve infants, toddlers, and young children with disabilities, including participation in the FederalInteragency Coordinating Council, and public-private partnerships such as theConrad Hilton Foundation/Head Start $15 million initiative to training commu-nity teams of Early Head Start, ED early intervention program providers, par-53 ents and other community agency leaders to improve serving to infants and tod- dlers with disabilities. \u2014Collaborative efforts in research and accountability efforts, including joint spon- sorship and funding of major longitudinal studies of early childhood develop-ment (including the National Center for Education Statistic 's Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Kindergarten & Birth Cohorts) and emerging efforts inTitle I and Even Start to utilize the Head Start Performance Measures outcomemeasures in Federal evaluations and State-level accountability efforts. \u2014Additional leadership efforts between Head Start and public education pro- grams and systems occur at the State and local level through the nationwidenetwork of Head Start-State Collaboration Offices which give priority attentionto forging linkages among local Head Start agencies, family literacy initiatives,State pre-kindergarten programs, and local education agencies. \u2014Finally, and most importantly, every local Head Start grantee is held account- able for maintaining strong and effective partnerships with local elementaryschools and districts through specific mandates covering the provision of familyliteracy and adult education services, services to children with disabilities, andpreparing every child and family for a successful transition to kindergarten. Senator S PECTER . Mr. Secretary, thank you for that amplifi- cation. HEAD START STAFF SALARY LEVELS Senator H ARKIN . If I might just say one thing to my friend from California. You are not going to get good cognitive skills teachingto the point that we want in Head Start if you are going to keeppaying Head Start teachers as babysitters. Secretary R ILEY. That is true. Senator H ARKIN . If you are going to pay them at the rate of babysitters, that is what you are going to get. Now if you want tostart getting cognitive skills \u2014the big scam on Head Start is what we are not paying the Head Start teachers. Senator S PECTER . Secretary Shalala and Secretary Riley, Senator Feinstein raises a very important question. And we have been inconference on these figures, debating precisely the issues whichboth Senator Feinstein and Senator Harkin have raised. If you would \u2014I think this is something we ought to pursue at the staff level. This may even be a subject for a full blown hearing.But let us pursue it at the staff level. And if you could supplementyour verbal answers in writing, we would appreciate it. Senator Murray. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATTY MURRAY Senator M URRAY . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all three of the cabinet members who are here today,and I just personally thank you for all the work you have done onbehalf of so many children and families in this country in yourservice. And I really do appreciate it. CLASS SIZE REDUCTION FUNDING Secretary Riley, let me begin with you. The chairman asked you a question and a response in writing, but I really would like tohear your opinion on the debate that we continue to have onwhether or not to focus targeted money on reducing our class sizesby hiring additional teachers or whether or not just sending thatmoney out to schools to allow them to purchase books or pencils orpaper or computers or whatever their needs are.54 I do not think there is any doubt in anybody 's mind that there are tremendous needs in our public schools for those kinds ofthings. But what are the advantages of targeting it directly to hir-ing additional teachers? ROLE OF FEDERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS Secretary R ILEY. Well, of course I look at the Federal role as being one of support of the States and local schools, but with a na-tional identification of a priority and a targeted effort. That is howFederal programs are most effective, and that is the role as I seeit. CLASS SIZE REDUCTION \u2014USE OF PROGRAM FUNDS We have as a goal for this Nation to get the class size of early grades down to 15 to 18 pupils per teacher \u2014and the research shows that that works. It works in those grades. It works in theeighth grade, in the twelfth grade, and on into college. It makes adifference in a child 's education. So by setting the national goal to do that \u2014to reduce class size, and that is a proposal that you have strongly supported, then wehave to move in that direction. If you then lump that in with ablock grant kind of approach, what you do is you take your eye offthe prize. You take your eye off the focus, your eye off the national goal in this country of saying that all children will have a relatively smallclassroom in those early grades with a teacher well qualified toteach reading. So I am very much in opposition to lumping national goals, na- tional focus, in with a number of other things. You have no wayfor accountability. There is no way you can look at how well it isworking, if people have all kinds of options. Now I think within a program, there should be enormous flexi- bility. In the Federal Government, of course, under the proposalthat you and I have supported, they do not pick the teachers, theydo not decide what classes to do what in. It simply is a Federal pri-ority targeted for that direction. And that is what makes a dif-ference. And you can look at it in the future, see if it 's working, or if it is not, determine why. CLASS SIZE AND SCHOOL VIOLENCE Senator M URRAY . Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And the chairman asked about this issue of school violence. In talking tothe teachers who are now in classes of 15 or 16, they tell me spe-cifically that they now can focus attention on young kids and havethem have that adult-child relationship that they believe will makea difference on the issue of violence later on. So if we do have that targeted approach, we will be able to follow that more closely. And I appreciate your response. EDUCATIONAL TRAINING AND WELFARE RECIPIENTS Secretary Shalala, I have a question for you. I am hearing a lot of anecdotal evidence in my State and elsewhere that many of thecommunity college programs that typically were filled with return-55 ing welfare-to-work mothers, nursing programs, things like that, are empty this year. Enrollments are way down. And a concernthat because education is no longer considered a \u2014that you need education as part of your welfare, that we have lost a lot of thosemoms, young moms, either back home in perhaps an abusive situa-tion that they cannot get out of or in jobs that are going to go no-where. Are you hearing this at your level as well? And I really would like to hear from Secretary Herman and even Secretary Riley onthis, because both of you mentioned the disparity in people who areable to go to college and in the disparity in the workforce betweenthose who are able to get into higher paying jobs and not. And I am worried about this component of those welfare-to-work moms, if they are not getting into programs in our colleges thatwill help them get into those higher paid jobs. Secretary S HALALA . Senator Murray, when the welfare bill was written, it left to the States the decision about whether full-timecollege attendance could be integrated, and you would not lose the2-year time frame. So those decisions were left to the State, as op-posed to something that was automatic. The vast majority of college students in this country are now going part time. That is, they are working and going to school. Andwhile that is a particularly heavy burden for young moms and forpeople coming from welfare to work, the fact is that in their ownneighborhoods, in the houses next to them, are people who arecombining work and going to school. And I just think the States have struggled with this issue. Is it fair to allow a small group of people, because they came throughthe welfare system, to go to school full time and be subsidized bythe welfare system as an investment in their long-term earning po-tential versus people who live next door to them that have chosento go directly into dead end jobs, but at the same time go to schoolpart time to help increase their earning power over a period oftime? There are numerous programs which Secretary Herman can out- line that are available for people to combine the two or that theycan get into. But the States addressing the issue of fundamentalfairness, some States have struggled with it and said, yes, you cango to a 2-year community college. Other States have said, well,maybe for certain people a 4-year program in nursing, for example. I fought the State of New York, when I ran Hunter College, try- ing to get them to allow welfare, former welfare, recipients to stayin 4-year nursing programs because my belief was that their earn-ing power at the end would be substantially better. But I do under-stand the fairness problem, because at that institution were peoplefrom the same neighborhoods, with the same socioeconomic back-grounds that were combining the two and killing themselves in theprocess for doing that. Senator M URRAY . Well, if nobody \u2014\u2014 Secretary S HALALA . So I think the States have \u2014\u2014 Senator M URRAY [continuing]. Is in our nursing programs, then we do have a problem. Secretary S HALALA . Right. And nursing programs are a par- ticular problem, because it is hard to do them part time. There are56 a set of programs, physical therapy, nursing, where it is a par- ticular problem because it is hard to do those programs part time.You can do a 2-year program part time often, a certification pro-gram, but it is hard to do a 4-year program part time. So the States can make the decision to allow someone to do it, and many of them have struggled with the decision. We do nothave a national standard that we can impose. Congressspecifically \u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . Senator Murray, would you like that answer amplified for the record? Because we are going to have to move on. Senator M URRAY . I would. I know Secretary Herman, if she could just comment in a 10-second time frame, I would like to hear whatshe has to say. Senator S PECTER . Take 10 seconds, Secretary Herman. Secretary H ERMAN . I think Welfare-to-Work had unintended con- sequences in regard to educational opportunities. We did amendthat last year to allow vocational education and job training for upto 6 months. And we are making further progress. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Senator Murray.Senator Reid. Senator R EID. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am wondering if \u2014in the audience is Dr. Koplan. I wonder if he could respond to some questions. He is head of the Centers for Dis-ease Control. Senator S PECTER . Well, we had planned to call him at the conclu- sion of this panel. But if you want to do that in your 5-minuteround \u2014\u2014 Senator R EID. That would be great. Senator S PECTER [continuing]. We would do that. Wait just a minute, though.We have asked Dr. Jeffrey Koplan to be present at this panel today. And I had, as I stated, planned to call him at the conclusionof this round. But to accommodate Senator Reid on his schedule,we will move to Dr. Koplan at the present time. We have written Dr. Koplan, and he has responded. And those letters will be made a part of the record concerning expendituresmade at the Center for Disease Control, which are at variance withwhat the congressional authorizations were, congressional appro-priations. With that, Senator Reid, you can begin your round of ques- tioning. DR. WILLIAM BELLINI 'S STATEMENT Senator R EID. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. You, as usual, are right on line. I was greatly disturbed to read a quoteearlier this month in newspapers all around the country, in TheWashington Post particularly, when one of Dr. Koplan 's staff mem- bers, a Dr. William Bellini, who is in charge of the measles pro-gram, told the inspector general, and I quote, ''It's a bigger crime to follow Congress 's direction than to spend money where science dictates, '' end of quote. This is the basis for a very troubling thing. In the mid-1980s, Mr. Chairman, in Lake Tahoe, a series of people came down with a dis-57 ease that was then known as Epstein Barr syndrome that is now is chronic fatigue syndrome. Under the good auspices of this com-mittee, we were able to get some money to specifically study thatdisease. We were very disappointed to learn that that money was spent for something else, because they thought it could be better spenton something else. If it were only Epstein Barr that money has notbeen spent properly for, maybe we could say that was a mistake.But now we learn that the Hanta virus, money that was set aside for that, which is also a western United States disease where peo-ple are dying as a result of this disease, who are being exposed tosomething, we believe, dealing with rats. We are not too sure. And then I have been getting mail the last few days, Lyme dis- ease, the same thing. You know, we have report language, and itis ignored on many occasions. But when we appropriate money fora specific program, that is the program it should be spent on. Andwords cannot describe how disappointed I am. I have people all over the country that are writing to me that have been extremely sick. And this is not just Congress coming upwith this. We have had the Inspector General look at this, and heacknowledges that they are spending money on programs otherthan what it was dictated for. So, Dr. Koplan, as I say, I just think this is outlandish. And I think the excuses that we have from your department are not verygood. I appreciate the apology. You in writing apologized. But theanswers that we have are just very, very bad. I recently received an employee, who, if their name were dis- closed, would of course get fired. But they have sent me a batchof stuff, which I have sent on to the inspector general, where thisis going on in the Centers for Disease Control. I do not know how to say this, but a stop has to be put to this. It is very, very difficult. It took me more than 10 years to get spe-cific money for this Epstein Barr program. And then to have youroffice, your department, spend it on something else, and then welearn later it is Hanta virus, it is Lyme disease, we do not knowwhat else. How do you respond to this? And I would also like to know how in the world can you have somebody working for you that in effectspits in Congress 's face, William Bellini, who says, ''It's a bigger crime to follow Congress 's direction than to spend money where science dictates. '' [The information follows:] QUOTE FROM THE WASHINGTON POST The comments at the hearing, drawn from a Washington Post article, were inac- curately attributed to Dr. William Bellini, a Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention employee. Secretary S HALALA . Senator, if I might \u2014\u2014 Senator R EID. I asked the questions, Ms. Secretary, to Dr. Koplan. Dr. K OPLAN . Senator Reid, thanks for giving me the opportunity to respond to this. First of all, let me answer your last questionfirst, which is that we have 8,000 employees, and the sentiments58 that you just expressed, that one of them was quoted as saying, are antithetical to my own beliefs and opinion. As Director of CDC, I can tell you that the vast majority of our staff, and all of our senior managers and decision makers believestrongly in following the directions of Congress, the budgetary di-rections of Congress and congressional intent. And that has beenmade clear to our staff top to bottom. And I strongly believe that,and I cannot emphasize it enough to you. Individual quotes, certain individuals in the institution do not speak for the institutional as a whole. Senator R EID. Do we just let that go? Is there anything in his record? Do we let it \u2014is he just down there drawing his merit pay with this? Dr. K OPLAN . I do not know the individuals involved in detail. Senator R EID. But do you not think that should be flagged and take a look at this? I mean, this does not speak well of the Centersfor Disease Control. Dr. K OPLAN . All of our staff have been told by me \u2014\u2014 Senator R EID. I want to know what \u2014\u2014 Dr. K OPLAN . Might I finish, Senator? Senator S PECTER . Senator Reid. Senator Reid, let him finish his answer. Dr. K OPLAN . All of our staff have been told in very clear terms what the relationship with Congress is, how I view the importanceof that, and what our responsibilities and obligations are, both theCongress and the American public. And the type of attitude youjust described is not tolerated in what we do. We have put in place \u2014\u2014 Senator R EID. OK. Not tolerated. What has happened to Bellini? Nothing? Dr. K OPLAN . I cannot describe personnel actions toward individ- uals, but I believe individuals are still allowed to express them-selves on a wide variety of topics that I cannot necessarily tellthem what to think. That is not an attitude or an expression of opinion that is likely to encourage someone to take any more management responsibilityor have any policy options within our organization. By the same token, I have not had a chance to speak to this indi- vidual. I do not know what he was saying in general. And I do notknow where the quote comes from. Senator R EID. I told you. Senator S PECTER . Senator Reid. Senator Reid, let us come back to this. Senator Craig has been waiting. We are going to take it up, and we will have another round in a moment or two. Senator Craig.Senator C RAIG . Mr. Chairman, I came here to listen. I am in- trigued by what Senator Reid is saying. If you can trust the Centerfor Disease Control, nearly every agency \u2014not every agency. A good many agencies I work with more dominantly than I do these \u2014\u2014 Senator R EID. If the Senator would yield, I heard the Senator dealing the Forest Service a week ago, the same situation. Senator C RAIG . Last year it was $400 million there, and they do not come back to their authorizing committees to get reauthoriza-59 tion. They just reprogram. And that is very frustrating to a Con- gress that oftentimes directs very specifically where the moneyshould be spent. Now there are ways to reprogram money. You come back to the authorizing committees, and you get the consent of Congress to doso. Somehow in this administration we have had a real problem attimes. But I am not singling out any one of these secretaries. WhenI say that, I am saying that in a generic form. And, you know, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, we only know how to get tougher by firewalling andstraightjacketing. And that does not offer the flexibility that some-times is necessary. But I do not blame the Senator for being frus-trated. There is clear evidence of those kinds of remarks and atti-tudes. Senator H ARKIN . Would the Senator just yield for a second? I think the Senator may have just misspoke. Reprogramming comesto the appropriating. Senator C RAIG . You are correct. Reprogramming comes to the ap- propriating committees. But oftentimes, reprogramming, if it is sig-nificant enough, the appropriating chairman also consults with theauthorizing chairman, which is wise and responsible to do when itcomes to significant changes in direction that have happened. Thatis what I am suggesting. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.Senator S PECTER . Thank you, Senator Craig. Let us proceed with Dr. Koplan, since Senator Reid has brought it up. And we will conclude this. We do have some other questionsfor secretaries. Dr. Koplan, the difficulty arises in part from the fact that there had also been misstatements by the Center for Disease Control asto the chronic fatigue syndrome research program, where fundswere allocated in a different way, so that it appears to be a repet-itive problem. Senator Reid has pressed you about Mr. Bellini 's statement. Had you heard that before Senator Reid raised it with you this morn-ing? Dr. K OPLAN . I have not heard Mr. Bellini 's statement before. No. Senator S PECTER . You had not heard about it before today? Dr. K OPLAN . We had an inspector general 's report that was deliv- ered to me in May. There were background paperwork to that re-port that an inspector general 's office did not provide me with. And I believe some of the quotes that are being provided are from back-ground documents that I had not seen. Senator S PECTER . But your statement to the subcommittee is you had not heard about what Mr. Bellini had said prior to the timeSenator Reid brought it up this morning. Dr. K OPLAN . I had not heard Mr. Bellini 's quote. Senator S PECTER . All right. Well, that is \u2014first of all, we ought to make the determination as to whether it is true that he in fact did say it. And if we make that determination, then I think thereought to be an investigation by you in the first instance, Dr.Koplan, as head of the Centers for Disease Control, to see what anexplanation would be, if we determine the statement was made.60 When you deal with this sort of a statement, you have a poten- tial violation of the Penal Code Section 1001, a false official state-ment. And we do not want to start to deal with that. But there isa high level of concern, really anger, in the Congress about whathas happened here. Dr. K OPLAN . Chairman Specter, I share it. I share that concern. And the institution, CDC, and myself as responsible, erred in bothreallocating funds and in not reporting it and not having appro-priate discussions with the folks who we are dependent on for ourwell-being and for your trust. We have made a mistake. That mis-take seems to be larger than just one unit. And because of that, we have put in place recently I think strong measures to address it and to address it across the whole institu-tion. We have done several of them in partnership with SecretaryShalala. OIG REPORT Senator S PECTER . Have you inquired of the inspector general, who made the report, what the details were, so you would be in aposition to answer? Dr. K OPLAN . The inspector general presented me with a report last May. Senator S PECTER . You have already said that. My question is: Have you inquired of them to find out more? Dr. K OPLAN . We met with them. They gave us a set of rec- ommendations to put in place. We put those in place and went sev-eral steps further in putting into place recommendations. Senator S PECTER . Let me come back to my question, which you still have not addressed. Did you inquire of them as to what otherinformation they had? You said they submitted a report. You saidyou met with them, and you put more steps into play. But haveyou found the details of their investigation? Have you said to theinspector general, tell us all you found here, so we can deal withit? Dr. K OPLAN . We asked for all they had found, and they gave us that set with recommendations. They did not provide us with back-ground material, which they normally do not supply to agencies; inother words, interviews they do with everyone who they met with. Senator S PECTER . Did you ask for that? Dr. K OPLAN . No, we did not ask for it. Senator S PECTER . Well, I suggest that you do that. I would sug- gest you make the inquiries. What assurances are you in a position to give that this problem is going to be corrected in a forceful way? Dr. K OPLAN . Thank you. One, we are working with the depart- ment. The Department is placing a financial officer to provide over-sight for our Center for Infectious Disease expenditures. That isthe larger unit in which Hantavirus and chronic fatigue syndromesits. Senator S PECTER . Are there any items besides those two where you have knowledge that there has been misstatements by theCenters for Disease Control? Dr. K OPLAN . There are no items besides those two in which I be- lieve there are misstatements. But we are putting in place a sys-61 tem that is going to look broadly throughout the agency, including a management review of all of CDC 's budgetary practices, to look everywhere and try to uncover it. Senator S PECTER . Have you taken any disciplinary action against anybody who made a false report? Dr. K OPLAN . I have reassigned a senior official in our Division of Virology and put new leadership in the Division of Virology. Senator S PECTER . Anything beyond the reassignment? Dr. K OPLAN . Reassignment is a pretty strong action in our insti- tution. Senator S PECTER . Well, sir, my question was: Anything beyond a reassignment? Dr. K OPLAN . No. Senator S PECTER . Just one individual, one reassignment. Dr. K OPLAN . That is correct. Senator S PECTER . Is that individual the only one who has been determined to have made a false statement? Dr. K OPLAN . I am not sure that individual has made a false statement. That individual was reassigned to assume other dutiesto\u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . OK. Why did you make a reassignment of that individual? Dr. K OPLAN . I think there are other duties to which he is better suited. And we can make more improvements in the division forwhich he was responsible and \u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . So that reassignment is not related to the false statements. Dr. K OPLAN . I am not sure of the false statements you are refer- ring to, sir. Secretary S HALALA . Senator Specter. Senator S PECTER . I want to finish this. I want to finish this. Have you made a determination as to any employees at CDC who made false reports relating to these two items, chronic fatiguesyndrome and Hantavirus? Dr. K OPLAN . There have been disciplinary actions taken at CDC to personnel. Senator S PECTER . How many for false statements made with re- spect to Hantavirus and chronic fatigue syndrome? Secretary S HALALA . Senator Specter, we have a privacy issue here, if we might take a break and talk to you privately about whatwe can say on the record. Senator S PECTER . Well, is there a privacy issue, Madame Sec- retary, if names are not named? Secretary S HALALA . Senator S PECTER . Why? Secretary S HALALA . Because anything that could lead to the indi- viduals \u2014you are the lawyer. But I certainly would like to discuss this, not on the record, before the director of the CDC responds tothat. Senator S PECTER . Well, I do not see a privacy issue in the ab- sence of any specified person being identified or a category whichcould lead to the identification. But at your request, we will takea brief recess.62 Let us step into the back room, Madame Secretary, Dr. Koplan, Senator Reid. Senator H ARKIN . I think I am next. I just might say that I have looked at this issue, too. And I am equally upset about it as justabout anybody else could be. And I think I have looked into it in-depth. I would just like to state for the record that I have met withDr. Koplan both here and in Atlanta about this issue. It goes without saying that people should follow the intent of Congress. I can somehow see how this thing transpired. I do notknow that anyone made intentionally false statements. I think the budget office responded to a question asked by Con- gressman Porter, I think, using what knowledge they had at thetime of what was done. I do not think that the budget office \u2014this is my own opinion \u2014really had the information about what had happened to the funds. I am not \u2014I do not want to sit here and go on with this thing that somebody made false statements. I do not know that that isso. And from my look at it, I do not believe that is so. I believestatements were made based upon the best information that peoplehad at the time when they made that statement. That is not inten-tionally making a false statement. I want to make that clear. Second, I think what maybe Secretary Shalala said earlier about being out of sight, out of mind, I really do believe that whereas wehave in the past continually worked with NIH as to how they arespending the money that we give them, and we do not earmark,but a lot of times we make our intentions known about where Con-gress wants to move, whether it is in AIDS, Ryan White type ofinitiatives, or whether it is in breast cancer research, a myriad ofthings that we give congressional intent. We are constantly \u2014you do it, Mr. Chairman. I did it before, when I was chairman. We constantly have them up here to tell uswhat they are doing and how they are proceeding. And I would sayeven myself, when I was ranking on this, I did not bring CDC uphere to talk to them. They were down there doing their thing. And I just think that perhaps we need a new relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to keep a closerworking relationship on exactly how this money is going out andwhat they are doing and how they are operating. I talked with Dr. Koplan about what had happened down there and the reassignment of certain individuals. I had not heard thestatement before either. This is the first time I had heard thatstatement. And I obviously need to know more about whether it isso and how it was said and that kind of thing before we can takeaction on it. But from what I have heard from Dr. Koplan, I am reasonably assured that steps have been taken on their end to correct this andmake sure it does not happen again. I think what we do, what wehave to do here as appropriators, I believe, is to establish a closertype of a working relationship with CDC and to have them up here more often to talk about where we are investing this money andwhat the intent of Congress is. But I think this is a two-way street. You had that relationship with NIH. I just do not think we have had it with the CDC.63 Senator S PECTER . Well, thank you, Senator Harkin. I do not know if there has been a false statement made either here. Butwhen Dr. Koplan testifies that one person has been reassigned andthat that is not related to a false statement, but for efficiency, thatis really not \u2014that is really beside the point of the question. And then he said there has been disciplinary action taken. With the record of the Center for Disease Control and the very substan-tial sums involved here, my sense is that this subcommittee has aduty to inquire and to find out what has happened. We are going to respect privacy. The questions asked of Dr. Koplan did not go to any individual or any category of individual,but just to find out if there had been a report of falsification and,if so, whether it was determined to be true or false and, if so, whataction was taken. But when Secretary Shalala wants a session off the record, we will do that. Let us do that promptly, because we are going to haveto conclude this hearing in the course of the next 10 minutes. Do you want to step back, Secretary Shalala, Dr. Koplan.Senator S PECTER . The subcommittee will resume. We had allocated 2 hours for this hearing. And I am scheduled to meet with the House leadership at 11:30 to see what the funding is going to be for this subcommittee. We are working far in advance of the October sessions on that with my purpose being to try to see if we cannot get adequate fund-ing for these three departments. Secretary Shalala has raised a question about the Privacy Act, and I have grave reservations as to its applicability in this situa-tion. But we will pursue it to see if there is a basis for it. And wewill proceed to work with Secretary Shalala and Dr. Koplan on pri-vate meetings and then make a determination as to what furtherhearings are needed. My sense is that on a matter of this sort, there is public interest and a right to know, and that this incident could have very sub-stantial therapy for other branches of government. I do not knowwhat the facts are, whether there has been any violation or wheth-er there is any implication of 18 U.S. Code 101. We have to makethat determination. But in view of the time and in view of the request, we will do that privately. And we will report publicly what our findings are.And to repeat, if there is a necessity for a public hearing, we willreconvene. Let me turn now to Senator Cochran. DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY Senator C OCHRAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I came over to urge the secretaries to look at the Delta Regional Authorityproposal the President has made. Yesterday they had a meeting atthe White House with governors from the States that are involved. And in each of these instances, I think there are significant roles that can be played by these three departments in this undertaking,without really using any of the proposed spending to establish anew Federal agency. This authority, in my judgment, may or may not be needed in the context that is being proposed, if we use the resources that we64 have and some of the existing programs, like Job Corps, where we can train people who need jobs. We have a growing economy allover the country, but it is growing much slower. And in someplaces, it is negative, for example in the Mississippi Delta and inthe lower Mississippi River Valley region. But in education, we have teacher training programs. Delta State University has a $1.5 million appropriation that this committee ap-proved last year. There are more parts to this training and upgrad-ing of skills, of teachers, recruiting people, a superintendents train-ing program that has been proposed as a part of this program thathas not been funded. We think that if you could go back and take a look at some of the proposals that places like Delta State University, MississippiValley State University, Alcorn State University \u2014those are all in my State \u2014but the community colleges, too, can play a major role, if we give them a little extra money. They have the know-how.They know what the problems are. And I think we are missing the bet, if we divert attention from some of the existing resources that we have, like Job Corps, teach-er training programs and the rest, and in the rural health centers,to be sure that we have an infrastructure there. RURAL HEALTH CENTERS IN THE DELTA REGION We have introduced legislation this week to double the appro- priation over the next 5 years for rural health centers. They havedone a very effective, cost-effective, job. We hope the administra-tion can support this increase in funding that Senator Bond and Iand others are sponsoring here in the Senate. So I do not have any real questions. I have some, but I am not going to ask them, because we are out of time. But I just wantedto let you know what my highest priority was this morning for dis-cussion with you. So we appreciate you being here and look forward to working with you on these and other issues as we go through this next fis-cal year. Thank you very much. Secretary R ILEY. Mr. Chairman, if I might respond to the com- ment. And I thank you for it. As you know, I was in Mississippilast week and got over into the Delta Region and went to DeltaState University and I also was in the Cleveland area. And Istrongly support the tenor of your remarks. I was there. I talkedto a lot of school people and parents, higher education people. I did the same thing in Iowa a couple of weeks ago and saw in those rural areas \u2014one little school district in Mississippi even told me they had 17,000 people in the district, and they had lost some-thing like 1,000 jobs over the last couple of years. And then we have a program that they very much want to use, like Gear Up to connect up colleges with these struggling middleschools, and yet it calls for a match, which is a very legitimatething for it to do. But they say they have no way of participating.They do not have any money for the program match requirement. In this school construction thing, where we do have resources for some grants in those very needy areas, they cannot support aschool bond issue. And so I think it is good for all of us to get outand see the kind of thing you are talking about. Those people are65 working so hard in the Delta Region, and I was very proud to be there with them. Senator C OCHRAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Senator Cochran. YOUTH SAFETY AND HEALTH QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD There will be more questions submitted for the record. Senator Campbell and Senator Domenici made specific requests. And Iwould like the observations of all three of you in writing on whatwe ought to be looking toward on movies, television and videogames, an enormously sensitive subject. And in structuring ourprogram against youth violence, we have deliberately not moved inthe direction that everybody pummels, but have treated this as anational health problem, very much as Dr. Koop suggested yearsago, putting it under the Surgeon General, so he has the responsi-bility. And I have asked each of you to let me know who your point per- sons will be, because this subcommittee intends to conduct exten-sive oversight, really working with you, as we started to do lastyear, but give our views on the subject and interact, so we canmake more money available to you or make more reallocations orget the legislative branch in with our power of the purse to helpout on that. STEM CELL RESEARCH AND DIABETES We are going to ask you some questions on stem cells. There is a report today about some phenomenal new advances on mice anddiabetes. We had a postponement hearing on that subject that Sen-ator Lott has agreed to bring that subject up as a free-standing bill,very important medical research. And we are going to do our bestto come to grips with these budget issues. Senator Stevens came and told you that the money was not there for what you have asked for. And that is a prevailing view. Whenyou have a total budget of $622 billion, it pushes up, aside fromthe Balanced Budget Act and the caps, which we are going to haveto act on one way or another, you do have the issue. Nobody wantsto invade the Social Security surplus. So that is a limit that nobodyis going to transgress. But we are going to work with you and try to see to it that you are adequately funded. I think you were last year, and we aregoing to try to the good job for America this year, with your co-operation. Thank you all very much. I will insert a statement from Senator Gorton for the record.[The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR SLADE GORTON For decades now, Washington, D.C. has taken almost complete responsibility from local communities for how our schools should be run. Over the past few years, I 've visited perhaps over 100 schools and listened to countless numbers of parents,teachers and principals, and they almost universally agree that it 's time for Con- gress and the President to restore the authority local communities once had to makedecisions for their local schools. Last year I proposed, along with Mr. Goodling in the House, the Academic Achievement for All Act, also known as Straight A 's. This bill is based on the simple premise that in exchange for a significant increase in flexibility states and schooldistricts would be held to a higher standard of accountability. Under my proposal,66 states would have the option of submitting a charter proposal that would set specific and measurable performance goals to reach by the end of five years. If approved,states would be allowed to use any of their regular Federal K -12 formula program funds for state education priorities and programs, in exchange for being held ac-countable for meeting their goals. States would be free to combine their federalfunds from multiple programs to more effectively address the needs of students intheir state. Alternatively, states would be free to administer Federal education pro-grams the old way \u2014Straight A 's does not eliminate any program. It 's the state 's choice of which approach to use. What this means for states and school districts is that they can use federal funds for any initiative that improves performance of students in your state. States that choose to participate can focus more funds on disadvantaged students, increase ef-forts to improve teacher quality, reduce class size or even hook up all their classesto the Internet. The one string is that these efforts must increase the achievementof all students \u2014including the lowest performing students \u2014over the course of five years. If states do not substantially meet those goals, they would lose their Straight A 's status, and revert to the categorical, regulated approach under current law. If statesdo well and significantly reduce achievement gaps between high and low performingstudents, they will be rewarded with additional funds. Finally, school districts would not lose any Title I funding. If Title I, Part A ($8 billion program for educationally disadvantaged children) is included by a state,each school district in the state would be assured of receiving at least as muchmoney as they received in the preceding fiscal year. I've received a good deal of feedback from my constituents on my proposal, and a great deal of it has been positive. They do not shy away from being held strictlyaccountable for the academic success of all children if they are freed from the myr-iad of rules and regulations imposed on them by the federal government. Mr. Sec-retary, tomorrow the Senate education committee will take a closer look at reau-thorizing ESEA and included in the package is Straight A 's. The very fact that Straight A 's is being adopted into any ESEA reform bill sends a dramatically different message to state and local school districts across the coun-try. For the past 35 years, we have consistently told our local educators that ''D.C. is in charge of running schools across the country. '' Now, as the education debate gets underway, we are going against the grain by trusting our state and local edu-cation officials to do what they think is best for our children. I ask you to back mein that endeavor and put your trust behind our teachers, rather than D.C. bureau-crats. All children can learn, and they will do so only because of the dedication and hard work of those who know their names, not because those of us in Washington, D.C.,create a number of new programs with good intentions. Mr. Secretary, I urge youto seriously consider the merits of the Straight A 's proposal and support funding pri- orities that provide those who know our children best \u2014their parents, teachers, prin- cipals, superintendents, and school board members \u2014with the flexibility they need to educate our children. ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much. There will be some ad- ditional questions which will be submitted for your response in therecord. [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but were submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the hear-ing:] DEPARTMENT OF LABOR QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR KAYEBAILEY HUTCHISON BONUS INCENTIVE ACT Question. Madam Secretary, as you know, the Senate recently passed legislation I introduced, the Bonus Incentive Act, which will allow employers to pay their hour-ly wage employees performance-based bonuses, without the unnecessary and bur-densome need to go back and recalculate the employee 's overtime pay. Typically, this results in very small changes to overtime pay, while it clearly discourages thou-sands of American businesses from paying their employees bonuses. One estimate67 is that if my bill passed, it could mean an average increase to an hourly worker of $1,000 per year in bonus pay. Do you support this legislation, and if not, whynot? Answer. The Bonus Incentive Act was attached to a provision to increase the min- imum wage in an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 and passedby the Senate in February. This measure would amend the Fair Labor StandardsAct (FLSA) to exclude from the definition of ''regular rate ''\u2014the basis for calculating overtime premium pay (time-and-a-half-pay) \u2014any payments made to reward em- ployees for meeting or exceeding productivity, quality, efficiency, or sales goals, i.e.,the additional compensation provided through gainsharing plans, incentive bonuses,commissions, or other performance contingent bonus plans. The Department strongly opposes this amendment. If enacted, it would substan- tially reverse the FLSA 's long-standing overtime policy and drastically weaken ex- isting protections for workers to receive true time-and-a-half overtime premium pay.These requirements, which have been in place for over 60 years, provide vital work-er protections that discourage employers from working their employees excessivelylong hours and ensure fair compensation to those who bear the burden of workingextended hours. This bill would not guarantee workers the right to receive incentive compensation for any additional hours they work and therefore, does not ensure that workers \u2014 who may have to work excessively long hours for their employers \u2014will ever share in any of their employer 's gains. The amendment would, however, allow an employer to pay artificially low hourly wages and structure its compensation system on newly''excludable '' bonus pay. Such a compensation structure would enable the employer to effectively transfer much of its business risk directly to its employees. The work-ers' only rights would be overtime pay at time-and-a-half a reduced hourly wage \u2014 not their true wage. Moreover, the amendment would encourage employers to require employees to work longer hours at lower earnings, directly contrary to the statute 's original in- tent-to limit the detrimental impact that long work hours can have on the health,efficiency and general well-being of workers and their families. The Administration 's Statement of Policy on November 8, 1999 regarding the Bankruptcy Reform Act of1999 reiterates the President 's position in stating that if Congress sends him a bill ''delaying the [minimum wage] increase, repealing overtime protections for certain workers, adding costly and unnecessary tax cuts . . ., he will veto it. '' In considering identical legislation in the House (H.R. 1381, the Rewarding Performance in Com-pensation Act) I advised Chairmen Ballenger and Goodling that I would recommendthat the President veto the legislation because it is contrary to the best interest ofthis Nation 's working men and women. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ROBERT C. B YRD NATIONAL MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ACADEMY Question. What amount of revenues did the Academy receive for the use of its fa- cilities by mining officials from foreign nations for fiscal year 1998, fiscal year 1999,fiscal year 2000, and the projected amount for fiscal year 2001? Answer. The training facilities of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy are used to promote international mine safety and health through training and ex-change of information and techniques. Because of the mutual benefit of exchanginghealth and safety information with other nations, we have waived food and lodgingfees for international groups that have been invited to participate in MSHA trainingprograms. No change is anticipated for fiscal year 2001. The sponsoring countrypays travel costs to and from the Academy. Question. What were the staffing levels at the Academy for those same years? Answer. Staffing levels at the Academy have remained relatively constant in re- cent years. For the years in question, they are: Fiscal year 1998 \u201463 FTE Fiscal year 1999 \u201465 FTE Fiscal year 2000 \u201466 FTE Fiscal year 2001 \u201466 FTE (est.) Question. Has the training provided by the Academy to mining officials from for- eign nations led to a reduced number of mine-related deaths in those countries?What countries benefitted most from this training? Answer. Since 1998, the Academy has trained mine inspectors and mining offi- cials from South Africa, Hungary, Poland, Peru, Malaysia, Australia, Mexico, theUkraine, Croatia, Russia, and Thailand. In addition, the Academy has hosted a68 number of international mine rescue teams, including those from Russia, Poland, and the Ukraine. The following information reflects the actual and estimated number of mining offi- cials from foreign nations trained or provided training guidance at the Academyduring fiscal years 1998 through 2001: Fiscal year 1998 \u201459 Fiscal year 1999 \u201483 Fiscal year 2000 \u2014124 (est., with 32 to date) Fiscal year 2001 \u2014250 (est.) Both MSHA and the visiting officials recognize the value of sharing technical ex- pertise to reduce hazards in the mine industry. Training and materials provided to these delegations give the international delegations a basis to make improvementsin health and safety conditions in their respective countries. Generally, improve-ments in the reduction of mining-related accidents are realized over extended peri-ods. At this time, there are no statistics available to indicate the degree to which this training has affected miners ' health and safety in the individual countries. There is, however, anecdotal evidence that suggests that it has led to some improvementsin participating countries. For example, following the March 2000 methane explo-sion in the Ukraine, we received a letter from the Ministry of Labor and Social Pol-icy requesting assistance from MSHA in developing health and safety programs. Ad-ditionally, the letter stated that they attributed their improvements in mining safe-ty during 1999 to the assistance and support provided by MSHA (letter attached). M INISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL POLICY OF UKRAINE , March 20, 2000. Hon. S TEVEN K. P IFER, Ambassador of the United States of America,Vul. Yuriya Kotsyubinskoho 10, Kiev, Ukraine. D EAR AMBASSADOR PIFER: As you are aware, the coal industry of Ukraine has re- cently experienced another unfortunate accident \u2014this time at the Barakova Mine that resulted in the death of eight-one coal miners, and seven more being injured.During the past few days we have received many conveyances of sympathy and con-cern from various U.S. governmental organizations, individuals, and friends. All ofthis has been greatly appreciated. This was the worst accident that the coal industry has experienced for over twen- ty years, and it came after we had achieved a positive trend during 1999 in thenumber of deaths and accidents in this industry. We attribute many of these posi-tive results to the assistance and support that we have received from your Depart-ment of Labor-Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) during the past twoyears under our Cooperative Agreement. This program has been instrumental inraising the awareness of safety at our coal mines; it has greatly enhanced the effec-tiveness of the Labor Safety Committee and the morale of its workers. The purpose of my letter is humbling but very necessary under the current situa- tion in Ukraine. The Labor Safety Committee requests your consideration and sup-port in a program to help create a safer environment for the coal miners of Ukraine.Specifically, we would be interested in joining with MSHA in developing a programto address the following issues: \u2014raising awareness of coal miner safety by developing and presenting a training program designed for Ukrainian mining conditions and practices, \u2014develop a program to use the Barakova Mine as a test case to demonstrate the effectiveness in the utilization of rockdust to control excess underground dust.The success of this program will result in the writing of new regulations thatwill be implemented at all Ukrainian coal mines, and \u2014a method to improve communication during mine accident investigations. We are aware that the resources of the U.S. Government are not unlimited, but believe that a jointly developed program between MSHA, the Labor Safety Com-mittee, and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy can be a cost effective method ti im-prove the health and safety of our miners. Thank you for your consideration of thisvital issue. Sincerely, P. O VCHARENKO , First Deputy Minister. CONVENTION 176 Question. The General Conference of the International Labor Organization adopt- ed Convention 176 on June 21, 1995, establishing minimum mine safety and health69 standards for the international community. Convention 176 was based on the Fed- eral Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, and if ratified, the U.S. would be in fullcompliance without the need for any further legislation. Would you please explainthe Administration 's position on Convention 176, and any externalities that could result from its ratification. Answer. The Administration strongly supports ratification of Convention 176. The Convention recognizes the importance of preventing injuries and deaths in the min-ing industry throughout the world. Widespread ratification of the Convention is inour interest since it would help raise international standards to the same high levelreflected in our own law. U.S. ratification would reinforce the important role of theILO in developing effective labor standards for the global economy. The NationalMining Association and the United Mine Workers of America worked with the De-partment of Labor in developing Convention 176, and both organizations support itsratification. Convention 176, as you indicated, is patterned after our own Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). Ratification therefore does not require anychange to U.S. mine safety and health law or regulation. This conclusion wasreached by the Tripartite Advisory Panel on International Labor Standards(TAPILS), which carefully examined Convention 176, including its negotiating andlegislative history. TAPILS ' membership includes representatives of the Depart- ments of Labor, Commerce, and State, the U.S. Council for International Business,and the AFL -CIO. The Mine Act is the foundation of the safety and health successes that we have achieved in this country. The Mine Act, as well as its predecessor statute, the Fed-eral Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, are universally regarded as criticalin having reduced the number and severity of mine explosions, mine fires, and othercatastrophic events in the mining industry in this country. In developing Convention176, the U.S. Government, industry and labor agreed that the adoption and enforce-ment of a common set of safety and health laws by the international community willhelp ensure safe and healthful working conditions for miners throughout the world,as well as help ensure that U.S. businesses can compete fairly in the world economicmarket. In recent years, the Department of Labors ' Mine Safety and Health Administra- tion has provided mine safety and health assistance and advice to several countries.These exchanges have made us even more firm in our conviction that establishinguniform safety and health standards is essential for raising labor standards glob-ally. Mining remains one of the most hazardous industries, both here and abroad.In part due to inadequate health and safety standards, the human toll associatedwith mining is particularly high in certain foreign countries. As recently as lastmonth (March), a methane explosion in the Ukraine resulted in the death of 80 coalminers. According to reports, at least 274 miners were killed in the Ukraine in1999, and about 360 in 1998. Reports indicate that South African mines recorded312 work-related deaths in 1999, and that mining accidents in China killed morethan 3,000 people in the first 9 months of that year. Convention 176 has been ratified by 12 nations. The South African Parliament agreed to ratification in December 1999, and is currently processing the proceduralpapers needed for the International Labor Organization to officially recognize SouthAfrica as a ratifying country. We were extremely pleased that the U.S. Senate gaveits advice and consent to ratification of Convention 182, the Worst Forms of ChildLabor Convention in November 1999. Like ratification of Convention 182, U.S. adop-tion of Convention 176 would reflect our commitment to work together with laborand business interests to raise labor standards around the world. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR HERBKOHL WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT Question. Recently there have been plant closings in Wisconsin that have violated the WARN Act. This act has several loopholes in it, however, and it does not allowthe Department of Labor to investigate or enforce the act. If the Department ofLabor had the authority to investigate and enforce the act, how many workers couldbe helped and what would the possible impact be? How much funding would thiseffort require of the DOL? Answer. As part of the development of our dislocated worker consolidation bill in 1993, DOL conducted consultations on the possibility of amending WARN in theareas of coverage and enforcement. No action was taken for a number of reasons,including:70 \u2014The concern that amendments might reopen issues and upset the fragile con- sensus that produced the original statute, and \u2014The belief that coverage changes would have to be accompanied by agency en- forcement in order to be effective and the cost of that enforcement, in both dol-lars and Federal positions, would be great. These factors have not changed. In fact, support for the Department 's role in en- forcing labor laws and the positions and funds comprising that enforcement has be-come an issue in cases where Federal law already assigns the Department these re-sponsibilities. Advance notice of layoff is a critical component for workers to begin the adjust- ment process, and for the workforce system to provide the specialized assistanceneeded by affected workers. The importance of early notification is recognized by theDepartment. The positive impact of DOL having enforcement authority would be in the number of additional workers who receive advance notice of layoff. (This assumes that DOLenforcement authority leads to greater employer compliance with WARN.) The De-partment does not have data on the number of workers who should have receivednotice under WARN, but did not. To promote greater employer awareness of their obligations under WARN, the De- partment is exploring a public information campaign and targeted outreach to em-ployees, employers, and organized labor to (1) stress the employers ' obligations under WARN, (2) encourage advance notice on a voluntary basis even when WARNmay not apply, and (3) encourage even earlier notification of impending layoffs andclosures than WARN requires. Finally, WARN enforcement would require about 30 staff, including those in re- gional offices, in a management unit in the national office, and in the Office of theSolicitor, which would involve an estimated staffing cost of $3.3 million. WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT IMPACT Question. There is some concern that the Workforce Investment Act, which will be fully implemented in Wisconsin in July, will already face a sunset in 2003, tooearly to fairly judge if the new act is successful. What is the Department of Labordoing to measure the Workforce Investment Act 's successes or shortcomings and will the data be enough to get a clear picture? Answer. The Department has contracted with Social Policy Research Associates to conduct a process evaluation of WIA implementation. While there will be a lagtime for the receipt and analysis of the initial WIA performance data (including cus-tomer satisfaction), the information will be instrumental in determining State andlocal success in achieving the WIA reforms and the core measures. Our technicalassistance, discretionary grant investments, and performance incentive awards au-thorized by WIA are targeted at expanding partnerships in the One-Stop deliverysystem. In sum, our focus and resources are directed at assuring positive outcomesfor the customer \u2014increased employment, retention, and earnings, increased occupa- tional skill attainment, while meeting the needs of American employers in stayingglobally competitive. TRAVELING SALES CREW INDUSTRY Question. As you know, I recently introduced legislation, S. 1989, to make it ille- gal for young people under the age of 18 to participate in the traveling sales crewindustry. These sellers travel around the country and go sell products door-to-door.In my state there was a tragic accident taking the lives of several sellers, manyunder 18. Recently there was another accident in California that took the life of twoadults. All in all almost 40 people have been killed in this industry due to neg-ligence and criminal behavior. I believe that this is no environment for a child tobe in and that it is too dangerous for minors. Does the Department of Labor agreethat the traveling sales crew industry presents a workplace safety problem? Answer. Yes. Vehicle related incidents of all types are the number one killer of young workers \u2014accounting for 43 percent of fatalities for workers under the age of 18. When you also consider the dangers of peddling door-to-door in unfamiliarneighborhoods, working long hours in strange surroundings, this industry is clearlycharacterized by a number of serious occupational risks. The Senate PermanentSubcommittee on Investigations, in 1987, also documented problems of worker ex-ploitation in the traveling door-to-door sales industry. Question. Does the industry present an unacceptable risk for minors? Answer. As you know, child labor is one of the Department 's top priorities. When children work, they must do so safely and legally. The youth peddling industry, ingeneral, presents special hazards for young workers. Children as young as eight-71 years-old are recruited from poorer neighborhoods and transported by crew leaders to unfamiliar locations to peddle candy and other consumer goods door-to-door, atsubway stops, and at shopping malls. We have been looking at the issue of commer-cial youth peddling and the special hazards that this industry poses for young work-ers. This past spring, the Department joined with the Interstate Labor StandardsAssociation and the National Child Labor Coalition to launch a public awarenesscampaign to educate parents and young people about the dangers of the youth ped-dling industry. We are also working with our State colleagues to coordinate enforce-ment activities to protect children who are being exploited. And, we have sought andobtained additional resources to undertake a thorough evaluation of the hazardousoccupations orders, which began last year through the National Institute for Occu-pational Safety and Health. As you know, we have been and will continue to assist you and Senator Harkin in your efforts to address problems in this industry. As I have often stated, the De-partment is committed to doing everything possible to ensure that the early workexperiences of our young workers are positive and safe, and do not interfere withtheir primary occupations-as students. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR PATTY MURRAY JOB TRAINING HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2001 BUDGET REQUEST Question. The President has requested a total of $2 billion to provide effective job training assistance to those workers who are struggling to keep their skills currentin our changing global economy. Can you briefly highlight some of the President 's initiatives in his fiscal year 2001 budget as well as the success of a new innovativeapproach to job training in the 21st Century? Answer. The 2001 budget includes $2 billion for the second year 's request for the President 's Universal Reemployment initiative which will ensure that by 2004: (1) all dislocated workers will have access to the training and employment services thewant and need; (2) that all unemployment insurance claimants who have beenprofiled as unlikely to return to work quickly will get the reemployment servicesthey need to return to work; and (3) all Americans will have access to the informa-tion and services of One-Stop Career Centers. This initiative will provide resourcesto train for or find new jobs, expand and increase quality of employment services,enhance services for individuals receiving unemployment compensation, and ensureavailability of the One Stop System, either personally or electronically. The programs to be funded are increased by $275.5 million, as follows:Dislocated Workers Employment and Training:\u2014Second year 's funding of the President 's Universal Reemployment Initiative. \u2014The request is $1.77 billion \u2014an increase of $181.5 million over 2000. \u2014984,000 dislocated workers will be assisted under this initiative. \u2014Included in the request is $105,100,000 for Skill Shortages grants that will be financed only if the Administration 's proposal for an employer user fee on the permanent labor certification process is enacted. Upon enactment of the fee, abudget amendment will be proposed reducing budget authority. America 's Labor Market Information System (ALMIS): \u2014Component of the One-Stop Career Centers budget. \u2014ETA request is $154 millions for ALMIS, $44 million over 2000. \u2014The major components are: Core Employment Statistics; Universal Access for Customers/Digital Divide Initiatives; Lifelong Learning and Earning; and Meas-uring and Displaying Performance Information \u2014ALMIS Services and Products: Mobile One-Stop Vans; Nationwide Toll-Free Number; America 's Job Bank, America 's Talent Bank; Occupation Network (O*Net); America 's Learning Exchange; Access America; Agricultural Network (AgNet). Reemployment Services Grants to States. \u2014ETA requests $50 million to provide reemployment services to unemployment insurance claimants to help them returnto work. I view this historic time of economic prosperity as an opportunity to address the challenge of bringing skills, jobs and hope to individuals and communities that fortoo long have been left behind. That is why our Budget not only proposes increasesin funding for some formula-funded Workforce Investment Act programs, but alsoproposes several targeted initiatives for groups that we have not paid adequate at-tention to in the past. We have asked for an increase of $125 million for Youth Opportunity Grants to address skills training and job placement in the poorest urban and rural areas and72 Indian reservations in America. I recently announced 36 of these grants. With this first grant competition we were able to fund only about 25 percent of the eligiblecommunities that submitted applications. Over 160 communities put together thebroad partnerships and developed comprehensive plans for meeting the needs of thistarget population. We had far more high quality applications than we could fund.These additional dollars will allow us to reach about 20 additional communities .We know that the needs were great in all the communities that applied and theseadditional funds will take us a few steps closer to reaching these communities. Responsible Reintegration for Young Offenders is a $75 million pilot and dem- onstration initiative that will test new approaches to bring young offenders into theworkplace through job training and placement, and by creating partnerships be-tween the criminal justice system and our workforce development system. We hopethat by developing models showing how we can work effectively with the criminaljustice system, we can expand services to this population through our State andlocal grant programs. Safe Schools/Healthy Students is an ongoing collaboration among the Depart- ments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice to promote healthychildhood development and to prevent school violence and the abuse of alcohol andother drugs. We believe the Department of Labor has something to contribute tothis interagency initiative and have proposed $40 million so that we can join in thisinitiative to enrich the connections among secondary and post-secondary schools, al-ternative schools, out-of-school youth programs, and work-based learning. Some ofthese funds will be used to assist in building the infrastructure of youth councilsunder WIA. Fathers Work/Families Win is a $255 million, two-part initiative that grows out of the successful Welfare-to-Work program. Fathers Work will provide jobs for non-custodial parents \u2014mostly fathers \u2014who owe child support. Families Win will help low-income parents who are struggling to make ends meet by providing better ac-cess to community services and upgrading job skills. These families often includemembers who have been on welfare or may be at risk of going on welfare, but be-cause they are employed, most have not received services under JTPA. I view these initiatives as addressing some needs and target groups that our workforce development system has not sufficiently dealt with in the past, and thatwould not be addressed through our formula grants. For example, the youth formulaprograms provide a relatively small amount of funds to every area in the country,while Youth Opportunity Grants concentrate a large amount of funds in targetedhigh-poverty urban, rural and Native American communities, exactly where theneed is the greatest. With respect to job training in the 21st Century, I believe the Workforce Invest- ment Act (WIA), which we are now implementing and which becomes fully effectiveon July 1, 2000, offers us a new innovative approach. Under WIA, information andaccess to training and other services will be provided through customer-focused One-Stop Career Centers in each local area. Training will generally be provided throughthe use of Individual Training Accounts, and clients of the Workforce InvestmentSystem will be provided information on the past performance of training providersto help them make career choices. The new WIA system will be accountability-driv-en and all training providers must be certified. The Workforce Investment Act alsoprovides the authority for a state of the art, quality information system that helpsAmerican workers and companies navigate the labor market and exercise informedchoice in their workforce decisions. Together, these new tools will help us respondto the demands of the changing global economy. PAY EQUITY Question. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton highlighted the issue of pay equity or pay inequity for women. We all realize this is an importantissue of fairness, however, pay inequity for many women plagues them well beyondtheir working life. More women live in poverty after the age of 65 and single womenover 65 are at a much higher risk of living in poverty. How does addressing payequity for women during their working life impact their economic status after theage of 65? In addition, isn 't pay equity really a family issue, not just a women 's issue? What impact does bridging the salary gap between men and women in theworkplace have on the family? Answer. We recognize that pay inequity is not just about pay \u2014it is also about benefits. And although the pay and pension gap between men and women has beennarrowing, we know we must work hard to reduce it further \u2014and to someday see equal employment opportunity and pension equity for all.73 On average, women who work full-time earn only about 75 cents for every dollar that a man earns. Less than 40 percent of all working women in the private sectorare covered by a pension (compared to 46 percent of men). Only 32 percent of cur-rent female retirees receive a pension (compared to 55 percent of men). Recent(1994) men retirees ' median annual benefits were $9,600, compared with only $4,800 for women, half the benefit amount for men. Women 's economic status after age 65 often depends on what wages they received when they were working \u2014and whether or not they have a pension from their own work. If a woman has a pension but received lower pay while working, she will facea lifetime of inequity because most pensions are based, in large part, on wages. Ifa woman receives lower wages while working and does not have a pension, she willface an even more difficult time making ends meet when she retires. And with orwithout a pension, lower wages make it harder for women to save their own moneyfor retirement. The pay gap is a family issue. Women 's earnings are a significant source of family income. Women 's earnings help support nearly three out of four working American families. Yet women tend to be concentrated in lower paying jobs. Fifty-four percent of full-time female workers earn less than $25,000 a year compared to 36 percentof full-time male workers. When women aren 't paid equally or don 't have equal ac- cess to high-paying jobs, the whole family pays the price. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (LIHEAP) Question. Over the past several months, the price of crude oil has increased from $10 to $30 a barrel, causing the subsequent increase of diesel fuel, heating oil andunleaded gas. As a result of increases in home heating fuel prices this winter, thePresident released all of the emergency LIHEAP funds ($300 million) on 3 dates:January 25, February 8, and February 16. The President is requesting $600 millionin additional emergency funding in the supplemental. The President 's fiscal year 2001 request for LIHEAP is the same as last year: $1.1 billion in regular fundingand $300 million in emergency funding. How many additional families have appliedfor assistance? In light of the dire situation this year, does the President 's request adequately reflect the funding needs? Answer. LIHEAP is one of the 1981 block grants. As a result, ACF does not have specific current information on the number of additional families that have appliedfor assistance. ACF is, however, in daily contact with their State partners to keepabreast of needs and developments in the State LIHEAP programs. A number ofStates have modified their program eligibility requirements as a result of the largefuel oil price increases. LIHEAP funds are distributed to the States as block grants.States have used this flexibility to leverage emergency funds in a variety of waysto support the energy needs of low income households, including increasing benefitlevels for emergency heating assistance for current recipients and raising eligibilitylimits to serve greater numbers of households. As example, Pennsylvania raised itsmaximum crisis payment from $250 to $300, provided a supplemental payment of$250 to households already eligible under the program (up to 110 percent of the fed-eral poverty level), and provided a payment of $250 to households up to150 percentof poverty. The State also delayed the closing date for the State 's crisis program from March 15 to April 30. Fiscal year 2000 emergency funds served their function well, addressing the needs of low income households facing significant increases in heating costs. This year wasan extraordinary situation, which we do not expect to be repeated. However, the Ad-ministration is seeking a $600 million supplemental appropriation for LIHEAP, toassist families with this winter 's heating bills and provide a reserve in the event emergency summer cooling assistance is needed. WORKER HEALTH Question. Within the funds provided for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the President proposes to spend $10 million for ''improving worker health. '' How does this research differ from the research being conducted by the NationalInstitute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)? Answer. The research focus at NIOSH is on the causes and prevention of work- related illness and injury. Two components of AHRQ 's proposed worker health ini- tiative focus on the outcomes and effectiveness of clinical treatment and the quality74 of the systems in which care is provided after a worker has been injured or other- wise becomes ill. These two components have a focus on quality of patient care andreturn-to-work that responds to research requests we have received from the busi-ness community, labor, and major purchaser groups. The third component of thisinitiative focuses on the health care workplace and the impact of the ways we orga-nize and manage the delivery of health care services on the quality of patient care.This part of the initiative builds upon past AHRQ research on the relationship be-tween professional staffing patterns and the quality of patient care as well as re-search requests we have received from major health clinics and hospitals in ourstakeholder outreach meetings. This area of investigation is complementary toNIOSH 's work on health care worker health and safety. AHRQ and NIOSH have collaborated effectively on this issue and will continue to do so in the new initiative.This initiative will help employers ensure that injured workers receive qualityhealth care. HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR THE UNINSURED Question. The President is requesting $125 million for an initiative he calls ''Health Care Access for the Uninsured. '' It appears that your request requires au- thorizing legislation before Congress can appropriate funds. Please explain how thisprogram would work and the goals that the administration hopes to achieve. Answer. In fiscal year 2000 Congress appropriated $25 million for the Health Care Access for the Uninsured program which we are operating under Section 330demonstration authority of the Public Health Service Act. In order to strengthen theprogram the Administration provided Congress with the draft bill, ''Community Ac- cess to Health Care Act of 2000 '' on March 22, 2000. The Community Access Pro- gram (CAP), included in our budget request as the Health Care Access for the Unin-sured program, is an innovative effort to help communities build and strengthen in-tegrated health care delivery systems for uninsured and underinsured persons. Thehealth care services available to the uninsured can be fragmented, often with littleto no coordination among providers who serve this population. Not only can patientcare be compromised, but much-needed resources can be wasted as providers dupli-cate efforts. CAP addresses this growing problem by fostering community-based ef-forts to improve service integration for the uninsured. Building off the critical foun-dation established by providers who have traditionally provided services without re-gard to ability to pay, CAP will provide new resources to help communities coordi-nate core services more effectively. CAP grants will support the development of in-frastructure, such as information systems, referral relationships, and clinical proto-cols, that will help providers improve access to existing services and promote theefficiency of the care that is delivered. By supplementing existing categorical pro-grams to fund safety net services and targeting infrastructure development not cur-rently supported through those programs, CAP will allow communities to better har-ness their current capabilities and resources. CAP is designed to encourage community-wide collaboration and stimulate cre- ative approaches to the development of coordinated, comprehensive care systems.CAP recognizes that the ''safety net '' of providers willing to deliver care to the unin- sured can vary from community to community, resulting in a wide array of integra-tion challenges. To accommodate this variability and to promote innovation, CAP isintended to be flexible to community needs. No single model for integration is beingpromoted; rather it is our goal that a diversity of models be explored. While themethods used to achieve integration may differ, all CAP grantees will representcommunity-wide coalitions focused on developing sustainable infrastructure for im-proved services integration. FAMILY CAREGIVER PROGRAM Question. Last year, the President requested $125 million for a ''Family Caregiver Program. '' Congress did not appropriate funds because this program was not author- ized. You are requesting the same level of funding this year. Do you believe thatyou can undertake this program without authorizing legislation? Answer. Yes, Title III -D of the Older Americans Act provides existing authority to support caregivers. As we look at the needs of our older population we becomemore and more cognizant of the needs of their caregivers. Establishment of the Na-tional Family Caregiver Support Program, through reauthorization of the Act, hasthe advantage of providing the kind of visibility we would like for this program, and would probably afford a better opportunity to systematize the services we are sug-gesting need to be put into a package. However, Existing authority will permit usto do the work that is essential to intervene immediately. We will continue our ef-75 forts to seek reauthorization of the Older Americans Act and the formal establish- ment of the National Family Caregiver Support Program. MEDICAL ERRORS Question. Last week, the President issued his recommendations for reducing med- ical errors, following the Institute of Medicine 's report ''To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System. '' The President has requested $20 million to reduce medical errors. Is this investment significant enough, given the fact that medical errorscause up to 100,000 deaths annually? How long do you think it would take to accom-plish your goals to truly see a reduction in the rate of medical errors? Answer. The recommendations you refer to are much broader than HHS \u2014they also address work needed in other agencies involved in health care and health cov-erage, such as the Department of Defense, The Department of Veterans Affairs, theOffice of Personnel Management, and the Department of Labor. Our budget includesincreases of $33 million to start this work. An increase of $20 million is requestedin the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AHRQ will create aCenter for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety which will carry out a widerange of research activities to reduce medical errors. An increase of $13 million isrequested in the Food and Drug Administration to reduce medical errors related toadverse events from FDA-regulated products, as well carry out a wide range of ac-tivities recommended by both the Institute of Medicine and the Quality InteragencyCoordinating Task Force (QuIC), which I co-chair. In addition to activities for whichdedicated funding is requested, HCFA will require that hospitals implement medicalerror reduction and patient safety programs to meet Medicare 's conditions of partici- pation. These activities, combined with other work recommended by the QuIC, willgive us a good start on the work of reducing medical errors. YOUTH VIOLENCE Question. On February 25, Bruce Reed sent a letter describing the Administra- tion's progress on instituting the youth violence prevention initiative. What specific ways will you encourage HHS agencies to coordinate with the Department of Laborand the Department of Education to ensure the coordination of efforts to reduceyouth violence? Answer. In developing the Youth Violence Prevention Initiative, our efforts extend across Department lines. A Federal Coordinating Committee on the Prevention ofYouth Violence has been convened, which includes representatives from the Depart-ment of Labor, Justice and Education. This committee is assessing the cross-cuttingissues in violence among youths and is exploring ways on how to synchronize andmaximize our collective efforts into a meaningful blueprint of an effective initiative. The Department of Health and Human Services is already working closely with the Departments of Education and Justice to continue coordination of the SafeSchools/Healthy Students initiative begun in fiscal year 1999. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students is an unprecedented collaborative effort to assist communities indesigning and implementing comprehensive educational, mental health, social serv-ice, law enforcement and juvenile justice services for youth. Our efforts in this col-laboration, through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-tion's Center for Mental Health Services, have resulted in the funding of 54 grants to school districts around the country. While no increase in funding is requested forSAMHSA, the overall President 's fiscal year 2001 Safe Schools/Healthy Students budget request includes funding for an additional 40 grants, and would include theDepartment of Labor as a new partner in this effort. CDC, and the U.S. Department of Education, Department of Justice, and the Na- tional School Safety Center continue to examine homicides and suicides associatedwith schools and identified common features of school-related violent deaths. Thestudy examines events occurring to and from school, as well as on both public orprivate school property, or while someone was on the way or going to an officialschool-sponsored event. The first study looked at deaths occurring during 1992 - 1994. CDC and its partners are updating and expanding the original study, exam-ining school-associated violent deaths since July 1994. In addition, the Office of the Surgeon General is developing a ''Surgeon General 's Report on Youth Violence '' that will be completed this year. Information and assist- ance is being obtained from HHS operating divisions, other Federal Departmentssuch as Education, Justice and Labor, communities, private organizations, aca- demia, State and local governments, and other groups to ensure the report soundlyaddresses the prevention of youth violence as a collaborative intervention requiringa well-coordinated approach.76 MEDICARE COVERAGE OF INJECTABLE DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS Question. When will HCFA issue a program memorandum to carriers as required by the report language accompanying Section 219? Answer. The program memorandum (AB -00-21) was issued on Friday, March 17, 2000. Question. What is the status of the policy conveyed in the transmittal of August 13, 1997 of the Deputy Director of the Division of Acute Care to regional offices re-garding injectable drugs? Answer. We have directed our contractors to disregard the memorandum and all other documents based on that memorandum until further notice. Contractors areto base any determinations they make with respect to self-administered injectabledrugs on policies that pre-existed that memorandum. Question. I am concerned that some carriers may consider the August 13, 1997 transmittal to be the current Medicare policy on injectable drugs. Can you assureme that, today, it is Medicare 's policy among all carriers to cover injectable drugs for program beneficiaries if the physician determines that it is inappropriate or im-possible for a particular patient to self-administer the drug? Answer. In accordance with the DHHS Appropriations Act, 2000 requirements, we have suspended the August 13, 1997 memorandum and have instructed our contrac-tors to make determinations with respect to self-administered injectable drugs basedon policy guidance that pre-existed that date. This law also effectively precludes usfrom clarifying our policy, since any clarification could easily be read as restrictive;therefore, our contractors are making determinations based on policies in place priorto August 13, 1997. While our contractors will be acting independently, I can saythat historically they have not been inclined to provide coverage for injectable drugsthat can be self-administered. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ERNEST F. H OLLINGS LIVER ALLOCATION POLICIES Madam Secretary, I 'm a bit confused by the Department 's December 21 Federal Register notice, and was wondering if you could clarify your understanding of themoratorium imposed on the OPTN Final Rule by Section 413 of the Ticket to Workand Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. The Amended Final Rule would have required the OPTN to submit revised liver allocation policies by February 15, 2000 \u201488 days after the Rule was to become ef- fective on November 19, 1999. But Section 413 imposed a moratorium on the effec-tive date and all provisions contained in the Amended OPTN Final Rule UntilMarch 16, 2000. The Department 's December 21 notice states on page 91626: ''Because we do not seek to have the deadline occur during the period when the regulation is stayed,we have decided to extend the deadline to March 16, 2000 ''\u2014just 30 days after the original deadline, and the first day the Rule can become effective under the morato-rium. Question. Could you please explain to me why requiring the OPTN to work on the most controversial new allocations policies required by the Rule during a periodwhen its implementation has been stayed by Congress does not violate both thespirit and the letter of the moratorium? Answer. The OPTN has been working on the refinement of the liver allocation pol- icy continuously since the NPRM was published in 1994. We did not believe it waswise to interfere with their deliberations. Nor did we believe it was wise to suggestthat the patients could wait for the benefits of an improved liver allocation system.The OPTN delivered a liver allocation policy proposing wider sharing for patientswith the most urgent need and plan for further refining the medical distinctionsamong chronically ill patients on March 15, 2000. The Department is reviewing thatsubmission. I believe it is a reflection of the OPTN 's efforts to address the problem and a testament to the Department 's persistence that a policy that puts patients first was delivered on time. Question. Section 413 also requires the Department to solicit and review com- ments on the Rule, and to revise it appropriately in accordance with this review.How, then, can you justify your December 21 Federal Register notice, which an-nounced a March 16, 2000 effective date for the rule, when you had not even begunto receive, much less review, comments on your October amendments? What kindof message do you think this sends to those who will be so deeply affected by theprovisions of this Rule?77 Answer. We were confident that our staff could review the comments and identify any new issues that would require modifications to the rule quickly. In fact, no newissues were raised by the public comments and no change was needed. A FederalRegister Notice so stating was published March 21, 2000. Question. Do you plan to revise the Rule based on public comments? If so, what is your time frame? Why wouldn 't you postpone the effective date until you make the additional modifications? If you do not plan to modify the regulation, why not? Answer. We were confident that our staff could review the comments and identify any new issues that would require modifications to the rule quickly. In fact, no newissues were raised by the public comments and no change was needed. A FederalRegister Notice so stating was published March 21, 2000. QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR DANIEL K. I NOUYE HEALTH CENTERS WAIVERS Secretary Shalala, On April 20, 1998, HCFA sent a letter to State Medicaid Direc- tors requiring States with Section 11 15 waivers to comply with the terms and con-ditions of their waiver as they relate to federally qualified health centers. In thisletter, HCFA committed to review those States ' compliance with the waiver and to take corrective action if necessary. Madame Secretary, it has been nearly two years since that policy was released and it is my understanding that States with Section 11 15 waivers are still not com-plying with the terms and conditions specified. This has created a very serious prob-lem in my state costing Hawaii health centers $1.2 million a year as a result of thisnon-compliance. Question. What is the Department 's plan to take corrective action regarding this problem and when do you plan to implement this course of action? Answer. On July 15, 1998 HCFA sent a letter to all State Medicaid Directors with the section 1115 waiver of cost-based reimbursement for federally qualified healthcenters (FQHCs). This letter requested that each State submit information per-taining to the methodology used to reimburse FQHCs under their section 1115 dem-onstrations. The submitted information was to include an analysis of how the meth-odology was developed to calculate a cost-related or risk-based adjustment, as wellas a description of how the methodology was implemented. We received the State responses and on September 30, 1998 we wrote to the Pri- mary Care Association (PCA) in each State in order to share the State response andto request that the PCA review the response. We asked each PCA to provide us withtheir assessment of the State response as well as any comments they wished to pro-vide on the adequacy of the State 's methodology for meeting the FQHC term and conditions. On January 4, 1999 we sent a follow up letter to seven States, including Hawaii, requesting further information and clarification of their methodology. We receivedall of the State responses by May 1999. Since that time we have worked in partner-ship with the Health Resources and Services Administration to assess the State andPCA responses. We expect to be in contact with the Hawaii regarding this assess-ment shortly. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR PATTY MURRAY BATTERED WOMEN AND CHILDREN Question. I would like to focus my questions on my concerns regarding the impact of welfare restructuring on battered women and children, who are some of the mostvulnerable citizens. Secretary Shalala, as you are aware, I fought to implement a''family violence option '' within Federal welfare guidelines. My objective was clear \u2014 to make clear that punitive welfare restrictions did not result in more women andchildren becoming trapped in violent homes or relationships. I feel confident thatthe final regulations issued by HHS for the States to implement a family violentoption will meet my objective. However, I have become increasingly concerned thatStates are not screening properly and are not directing services and benefits to bat-tered women. Can you briefly outline what steps you are taking to ensure that bat-tered women do not end up being victimized by our welfare structure and do wehave any real outcome data on the number of battered women impacted? How manyof those who have fallen off welfare are now trapped in violent homes or relation-ships?78 Answer. The Department 's Administration for Children and Families, Office of Family Assistance has a number of initiatives that address domestic/family violence. In fiscal year 1997, a grant was awarded to the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services, Maryland to develop and pilot test a domestic violence trainingcurriculum for administrative and front line service staff. The training model devel-oped in collaboration with the YWCA of Annapolis (Maryland) is intended to betterequip staff to identify and serve clients of TANF and other public assistance pro-grams who may be victims of domestic violence. New staff receives training on howto identify and screen for potential domestic violence situations. Anne Arundel County was awarded a subsequent grant in fiscal year 1998 to in- crease its capacity to provide technical assistance to human service agencies on inte- gration of services and organizational change. The organizational change model in-cluded strategies to assess and provide services to families at risk of domestic vio-lence, and other barriers to self-sufficiency. Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services like many local welfare of- fices places information in public restrooms about domestic prevention services andhotline telephone numbers. ACF has funded our Regional Offices to provide targeted workshops around do- mestic violence issues such as identification, screening, confidentiality, and safetyplanning. A major conference is planned for our Northeast Hub (Regions I -III) in August of this year. ACF 's Office of Community Services funds the National Family Violence Hotline, which provides assistance to families in immediate danger of violence, and providesgrants to community organizations for Family Violence Prevention Services. The Department has an ongoing Family Violence workgroup composed of senior staff from its operating divisions who coordinate DHHS program policies and activi-ties to provide education on domestic violence prevention and services. With reference to outcomes, as of February 2000, we are beginning to receive de- tailed quarterly data from states on individuals receiving TANF assistance. We willnot have outcome data on battered women, but we will know the number of womenwho are exempt from the work requirements based on receipt of a domestic violencewaiver. In addition to these cooperative efforts, DHHS and DOL convened a series of con- ferences to share with other welfare reform stakeholders, an informational ''road map'' on how to succeed in moving welfare families to self-sufficiency. The informa- tion presented included models of promising practices for helping families movefrom welfare to work. The conference objectives were to help participants: \u2014gain insight on how agency practitioners and the private sector have responded to challenges of moving welfare recipients to work; \u2014learn from practitioners how to prepare for the difficult task of moving welfare clients with multiple barriers to work; \u2014interact with peer practitioners from a broad cross-section of Federal, State and local agencies, community-based organizations, employers, and other disciplines;and \u2014gather practical information, helpful practices, and names of professional con- tacts to help structure programs to move families to self-sufficiency. CHILD CARE Question. One of the greatest challenges to meeting welfare-to-work goals is child care. I have listened to this Administration and many Governors talking about thesuccess of welfare restructuring. However, there has been little action at the statelevel to increase the availability of affordable, quality child care, especially infantcare. We know that early childhood development is essential, yet I am not convincedthat we are targeting limited resources to implementing new, innovative child careprograms. I know the President is calling for additional resources. I=d like to knowB what are we doing to ensure that parents, especially those caught between workand welfare, can locate quality, affordable child care? Answer. A recent report, Access to Child Care for Low-Income Working Families , found that in an average month in fiscal year 1998, only 10 percent of the 14.7 mil-lion children eligible for child care subsidies under Federal regulations receivedthem. The fiscal year 2001 budget request includes several proposals to help low-income families find and afford quality child care. For fiscal year 2001, we are re-questing $2 billion, an increase of $817 million, for the discretionary Child Care andDevelopment Block Grant (CCDBG). These funds are critically needed to help ad-dress the gap between available funds and the child care subsidy needs that low-income working families re experiencing. This increase will provide child care sub-sidies to nearly 150,000 additional children. $223 million of the total funds re-79 quested will support State activities that improve the quality of child care, including $50 million for infant and toddler quality activities and $19 million for school-agedcare and resource and referral activities. In addition, the budget includes $600 million in entitlement funds for an Early Learning Fund to focus on the quality of child care. The Early Learning Fund willbe used to provide grants to communities to improve school readiness by fosteringthe cognitive, physical, social and emotional development of children under five years-old through improvements in the quality of child care settings, among otherthings. The President=s budget also proposes an increase in the Child Care and De-pendent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) of $7.5 billion over 5 years and an expansion ofthe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) of $23.6 billion over 10 years, both of whichwould help low-income working families obtain quality, affordable child care. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR LARRY CRAIG Question. Is the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Prevention part of the Sub- stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or SAMHSA? Answer. Yes, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Question. A survey was sent out to Missourian students in grades 6, 8, 10, and 12 by the State of Missouri, and funded by the Federal Center for Substance AbusePrevention, for the purpose of participating in a study designed to ''develop impor- tant information that will help combat such problems as alcohol and other drug usein our schools and communities. '' If the states purpose of the SAMHSA sponsored survey is to help combat alcohol and drug use problems, then why do 10 percentof the questions deal with handguns? Answer. This survey was conducted as part of a Missouri needs assessment con- tract. Needs assessment provides a means for States to obtain data critical for pre-vention planning, resource allocation, and to establish baselines for performancemeasurement. States are collecting uniform data through school and community re-source studies and assessing risk and protective factors in four domains \u2014Peer/Indi- vidual, Family, School, and Community \u2014using readily available surveys, including the CSAP Student Survey Risk and Protective Factors Instrument, the Youth RiskBehavior Assessment Survey (CDC) and/or other community-based instruments To assist States with needs assessment, CSAP contracted with Hawkins, Catalano, and Miller to help develop a survey instrument. Hawkins et al. workedwith a six state consortium (WA, OR, CO, ME, KS, and UT) to develop the StudentSurvey and pilot it. CSAP and ONDCP assessed the viability of the Student Surveyamong the first 3 cohorts (11 out of 23 states, or 48 percent) and determined thatthe Survey was an accurate needs assessment instrument. Discussions with theONDCP regarding the State needs assessments determined that these assessmentswould be of more value if we could compare the data gathered for one State to thedata of other States. Since the Student Survey is a reliable needs assessment instru-ment, the Survey was designated as a mandatory instrument for subsequent needsassessments. Based on this, Missouri is required to use this instrument. States thathave, or are scheduled to use the Student Survey include: Washington, Florida,Kansas, New Jersey, South Carolina, Maine, Utah, Oregon, Arkansas, Delaware,Montana, Arizona, Hawaii, Missouri, Virginia, Alabama, Michigan, and Tennessee.Three states also using the survey, but not as part of the CSAP needs assessmentare: Louisiana, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. NIDA also is using the Student Surveyin communities as part of a seven state consortium diffusion study. Research has consistently shown a strong association between substance use and violence. This is reflected in studies depicting violence as a precursor to substanceabuse (by victims of violence) as well as depicting substance use as a precursor toviolence (by assailants). The Student Survey, in use since 1993, includes questionsrelated to individual, peer, family, and community antisocial behavior because ofthis consistent relationship. Student survey results from both a CSAP six state con-sortium and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) seven state consortiumfurther support this relationship. The handgun questions, which comprise 5.2 percent of the survey, are part of scales that measure: \u2014association with antisocial peers \u2014early initiation of problem behavior \u2014attitude toward antisocial behavior \u2014antisocial behavior \u2014convention involvement \u2014perceived availability80 \u2014community laws and norms \u2014family history of antisocial behavior NIDA study data show that every one of these constructs is strongly correlated with 30-day substance use as well as with antisocial behavior. Hence, the surveyscales are important for identifying risk factors that potentially should be targetedwithin a State program. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ROBERT C. B YRD STATUS OF REPORTS Question. On December 9, 1999, I wrote to your office to inquire as to the status of certain initiatives identified in Senate Report 106 -166 accompanying the fiscal year 2000 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, andRelated Agencies Appropriations bill and/or Conference Report 106 -479 accom- panying the Consolidated Appropriations bill. I respectfully ask you to provide mewith a status report of the following projects: $38,500,000 and 303 full-time equivalent employees for the new National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health laboratory in Morgantown, West Virginia;(CDC) Answer. The investment in the new National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) laboratory in Morgantown, West Virginia, continues to yieldsignificant scientific advances in understanding and preventing work-related dis-ease, injury, and death. Activities at the new laboratory include: applied and pre-ventive, multi-faceted laboratory-based research into the causes, mechanisms, pre-vention, and control of occupational disease and injuries; the development of high-tech engineering solutions for the control of occupational hazards; and basic and ap-plied health communications research to improve the effectiveness of NIOSH com-munication efforts. Highlights of the laboratory 's fiscal year 1999 accomplishments include: \u2014Hexavalent Chromium Research .\u2014NIOSH researchers developed a field-portable method for on-site determination of hexavalent chromium (a carcinogen foundin structural components of buildings, as well as ink, paint, textile dyes, graphicart supplies, and wood preservatives), which is critical for assessing worker ex-posure and the effectiveness of control measures. Additional NIOSH basic re-search is examining the mechanism of hexavalent Exposure .\u2014NIOSH investigators performed a silica inhalation study using animal models to examine pulmonary damage, pulmonary inflam-mation, fibrosis, and dust retention. The study found explosive increases in lungdamage and inflammation when dust burdens stabilize, and observed that in-flammation progressed even in the absence of continued exposure. The data willbe used to model dust deposition, clearance, and retention in rats and to com-pare results to models for humans. \u2014Carcinogenesis Mechanisms for Cadmium .\u2014NIOSH studied the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumorigenic potential of cadmium. Findings suggestthat genetic instability and changes in the cancer-related and novel genes maybe responsible for the cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by thesemetals. Identification of mechanisms for workplace-related carcinogenesis willhelp identify appropriate strategies for therapeutic intervention and prevention, as well as improve risk assessment for carcinogens. \u2014Laboratory-based Models for Work-related Stress .\u2014To determine the role of acute and chronic stress as occupational risk factors or contributors to disease,NIOSH is working with external partners to use laboratory-based models to de-termine the biochemical, cellular, and molecular changes engendered by specificstressors alone and in conjunction with various disease models. Results fromthis work indicate that glucocorticoid release associated with stress enhancesskin response to chemicals and can exacerbate damage in the brain areas im-portant for cognition. \u2014Silicosis Outreach for Hispanic and Latino Workers .\u2014NIOSH is developing an outreach project to increase the awareness of the seriousness of silica exposureamong construction workers in Texas (who experience an alarming number ofdeaths attributed to silicosis) and to increase the use of engineering controlsand respiratory protection in these workers. NIOSH assessed the workers ' knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors about silicosis prevention, as well as their in-formation seeking habits and barriers to and facilitators of prevention. NIOSHis using these data to develop a silicosis prevention program in fiscal year 2000.81 \u2014Preventing Deaths from Tractor Overturns .\u2014Tractor overturns are the largest single source of agricultural fatalities, accounting for approximately 132 deathsper year. Current rollover protective structures (ROPS) do not provide adequateprotection because farmers manually lower them when working in low clearanceareas and may forget to raise them. NIOSH has developed a ROPS prototypethat is stored normally in a compact form but automatically deploys to full di-mension, without operator input, to protect the operator in the event of an over-turn. The new system includes: (1) a roll bar and deployment mechanism, whichwere successfully tested for appropriate protective strength according to indus-try standards, and (2) a sensor to identify an impending overturn and triggerthe roll bar deployment. A patent application is being developed for this device. Research at the new laboratory will continue to focus on critical areas in occupa- tional safety and health in fiscal year 2000. For example, researchers at the newlaboratory are: coordinating an Institute-wide intramural initiative to study dermatitis, including latex allergy, using state-of-the-art research meth-ods; studying the genetic mapping of lung and prostate cancer to aid in the identi-fication of at-risk worker populations; and using virtual reality technology to studythe prevention of falls, which are one of three leading causes of injuries occurringin the workplace. $3,000,000 for the construction of West Virginia University 's Eye Center; and $1,1135,000 for the construction and equipment of the Harts Health Center inHarts, West Virginia Answer. Congress provided $120 million for eighty-six specific projects in fiscal year 2000 and this amount has been reduced to $112.4 million under the fiscal year2000 government-wide discretionary spending rescission authority. The projects atthe West Virginia University 's Eye Center and the Harts Health Center in Harts, West Virginia will be notified in April 2000 of the amount available for their specificproject and they will be provided with an application kit and application guidelines.They will be given 60 days to submit their application and supporting documenta-tion. Following a 75-day review period, given the large number of projects, grantawards are scheduled for the end of September 2000. Approximately $1,000,000 for West Virginia University 's Prevention Center funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (CDC) Answer. In fiscal year 1994, West Virginia University received a four-year Preven- tion Research Center (PRC) grant from CDC. Under this cooperative agreement,they received approximately $1,000,000 per year in core funding. In fiscal year 1998, at the end of West Virginia 's 4-year project period, they com- peted for renewal of their core PRC cooperative agreement along with the other 13PRCs which existed at the time. In fiscal year 1998, CDC approved a 12-month ex-tension of the project to allow the PRC time to expend their remaining funds to com-plete program goals and objectives. CDC 's fiscal year 1999 appropriations committee report language mandated that all ''incumbent '' PRCs were to be funded. Based on this language, CDC awarded West Virginia a new 5-year PRC cooperative agreement, which began on February1, 1999. The fiscal year 1999 award amount for the first year of this new 5-yearproject period included $600,000 in new core funds, which was commensurate withthe level of funding received by the other 13 incumbent PRCs. The award also in-cluded $133,611 in new supplemental funds, and $285,000 in funds West Virginiawithheld in previous years, for a total approved amount of $1,018,611. In fiscal year 2000, the West Virginia PRC received $650,000 in new core funds to support the second year of the current project period, which began on February1, 2000. This increase in core funding was equal to the funding level of the otherincumbent centers. They will also again have the opportunity to request funding forcontinuation projects and compete for new special interest project funding this year. Current center activities include evaluating the efficacy of a new teen smoking cessation program, Not on Tobacco , in two Appalachian states. Other research projects focus on diabetes, cardiovascular disease, nutrition, tobacco, and mentalhealth. The Center continues to be the Coordinating Center for the Women 's Cardio- vascular Health Network and participates in the Tobacco Control Network. TheCenter also provides participatory research training to West Virginia Bureau forPublic Health funded projects and has strong relationships with the West VirginiaDepartment of Education, the American Lung Association, other voluntary healthorganizations, and other community-based groups.82 $687,000 for Marshall University 's Autism Training Center; (CDC) Answer. CDC will encourage Marshall University to broaden its intervention pro- gram to include secondary conditions in children with autism as well as to examineetiologic factors and conduct surveillance for the condition. $850,000 for the Farm Resource Center through the Center for Mental Health Serv- ices of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Answer. SAMHSA will announce the availability of a demonstration grant pro- gram in April 2000. The Rural Outreach Program demonstration would continueoutreach activities that ameliorate stress associated with unemployment in ruralcommunities and increase access to, and utilization of, mental health and substanceabuse services for coal miners, farmers, and their families in Illinois and West Vir-ginia and western Pennsylvania. This program, designed to result in more effectivemental health and substance abuse services delivery, is intended to address theneeds of adults and their families in rural areas who have or may be at risk fordeveloping a mental illness or substance abuse problem. Needs of their children whohave or may be at risk for developing emotional or other behavioral problems areaddressed also. Report language and $500,000 for the Office of the Surgeon General, in conjunction with the Public Health Policy Board and other agencies, to establish a processfor selecting health priorities based on clear scientific data on emerging healththreats to children Answer. The final fiscal year 2000 appropriation did not include funding to estab- lish a process for selecting health priorities. However, in January 2000 the SurgeonGeneral launched Healthy People 2010, the third iteration of the Healthy People ini-tiative first launched in 1979 with the publication of Healthy People: The Surgeon General 's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention . Healthy People 2010 sets the nation 's health agenda for the next decade and states a set of common goals developed through a national consultative process; it also provides a mechanism tomonitor progress toward achieving those goals. The scope of the Healthy People ini-tiative has grown over the last three decades to more than 460 objectives \u2014about a third of which relate to children. This approach identifies important public healthissues for children and families, and assesses the relevant science available on thesetopics, in order to stimulate public discussion and effective interventions. The multi-disciplinary and broad public health expertise of the Public Health Policy AdvisoryBoard has taken a similar approach. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the current Chairman& CEO of the Public Health Policy Advisory Board, was among the distinguishedleaders who participated in the release of the Healthy People 2010 Report. Healthy People 2010 , which now includes a set of ten leading health indicators, has provided a monitoring apparatus to measure and achieve progress towards our child healthgoals. Report language urging the Surgeon General to host a summit on obesity policy to develop a national strategic plan to prevent obesity and to complete the SurgeonGeneral 's Report on Nutrition and Health which was to focus on dietary fat Answer. The Surgeon General is very concerned about the increasing health bur- den of obesity and overweight, and has considered how best to contribute to its alle-viation. Towards this end, HHS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) arejointly planning a National Nutrition Summit for May 30 -31, 2000, that will have a major focus on overweight and obesity. This summit will highlight: accomplish-ments in food, nutrition, and health that have occurred since the 1969 White HouseConference on this topic; the continuing challenges and emerging opportunities inthis area; and nutrition and lifestyle issues across the human lifespan, especiallythose that we confront in solving the nation 's epidemic of overweight and obesity. The summit will include policy makers, leading researchers in obesity, nutrition,physical activity and community-based prevention, and representatives of consumer,trade, business, and health professional organizations. An HHS/USDA interdepart-mental steering committee is coordinating the summit, and held a public meetingin December 1999 to solicit input on the agenda. The committee will continue to so-licit input and to involve other relevant government agencies in its planning efforts. As a follow-up to the 1988 Surgeon General 's Report on Nutrition and Health , and to fulfill the requirements of Public Law 103 -183, a Surgeon General 's Report on Dietary Fats and Health was being developed under the aegis of the Department 's Nutrition Policy Board. However, it became clear to the report drafters that, whilethe role of dietary fats (especially saturated fats) in coronary heart disease is wellestablished, the science related to dietary fat intake and other chronic diseases isstill evolving \u2014and has become increasingly complex and, in some cases, contentious.83 There is also emerging evidence that energy balance is a key dietary factor affecting health and disease risks, independent of the effects of fats. Because dietary fats area component of energy intake, it is difficult to parse the effects of fat or types offat on disease risk and energy intake per se. Therefore, in order to obtain the balanced review needed to address this issue, the Office of Public Health and Science turned to the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Inthe fall of 1999, IOM began a 24-month comprehensive review of macronutrientswith dietary fats and health, and including energy balance as a major component.This review is part of the IOM 's multi-year project to evaluate nutrient require- ments and establish recommended dietary intakes. Several other significant reviewswith relevance for dietary fat and health issues parallel the IOM study; these in-clude: a National Cancer Institute-funded systematic review and synthesis of the re-search literature concerning diet-related behavior change interventions; a Rand Cor-poration study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on healthyaging, which will include diet, nutrition, and fat; and the National Cholesterol Edu-cation Program 's expert panel review of current detection, evaluation and treatment methods for high blood cholesterol. As these reports are finalized, the science relatedto dietary fats will be better understood, and the Department will be better able totake appropriate action to promote and protect public health. Report language under the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism re- garding Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), genetics, neuroscience, medications de-velopment, alcohol and Hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, and ''Research to Practice '' Forums Answer. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) \u2014FAS research at NIAAA is supported in both the intramural and extramural programs and accounted for approximately 6.7percent of the Institute 's budget in fiscal year 1999. Prevention of FAS is a high priority for the Institute. All meritorious candidates submitted in response to a re-cent request for applications have been funded. Research continues in a large com-munity-based trial of comprehensive interventions to prevent FAS and other alco-hol-related birth defects among four Plains Indian tribes, with two other NativeAmerican communities serving as comparison sites. A project to develop a screeningtool and determine the prevalence of drinking in women in prenatal clinics in theDistrict of Columbia also was cosponsored by the National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development (NICHD). Data collection now has been completed, anddata analysis is under way. To aid the health care community in addressing the problem of FAS, the NIAAA has developed two manuals for use in clinical practice. These manuals soon will beready for distribution. One is designed to train health practitioners who treatwomen of childbearing age on the assessment of risk drinking and on referral andintervention methods. The other provides a guide for pediatricians on screening chil-dren for FAS. The NIAAA plans to pilot test the effectiveness of both manuals withprimary care health professionals. In addition, the NIAAA is preparing a Requestfor Proposals to establish a FAS clearinghouse. The NIAAA will continue its leadership of the Interagency Coordinating Com- mittee on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (ICCFAS). Member organizations include sevenorganizations within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),the Office of Special Education in the U.S. Department of Education (DoED), andthe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in the U.S. Departmentof Justice (DOJ). To promote information exchange and to assure high quality re-search, the NIAAA sponsored an investigator workshop at the October 1999ICCFAS meeting. \u2014Genetics \u2014Approximately 50 -60 percent of total population vulnerability to alco- holism is mediated by genetic factors. The NIAAA-funded Collaborative Studyon the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) has found significant evidence for geneticlinkages on several chromosomes. These chromosomal regions are likely to con-tain genes that influence alcohol-related behavior. This powerful new data setgenerated by COGA is now ready for release to the general scientific commu-nity. The COGA databases contain extensive clinical, diagnostic, psychological,neurophysiological, pedigree, and genetic data on thousands of individuals, whocomprise hundreds of families of alcoholics under study. The neurophysiologicaldata will be distributed by SUNY Downstate Health Sciences Center (New York, NY); all other data will be distributed by Washington University (St.Louis, MO). The companion collection of cell lines and DNA samples from indi-viduals studied will be distributed by Rutgers University (Piscataway, NJ). TheInstitute plans to encourage intensive analysis of the substantial COGA dataset by the broadest possible spectrum of investigators.84 \u2014Neuroscience \u2014Approximately 25 percent of the NIAAA 's resources are com- mitted to neuroscience research. Recent neuroscience findings on the biologicmechanisms that underlie alcohol 's effect represent new possibilities for devel- opment of medications for alcohol disorders. Most pharmaceuticals target spe-cific protein sites. Scientists have identified at least one protein site on aneuroreceptor implicated in alcohol 's neurodepressant actions, opening the po- tential for design of compounds to block such protein sites and, thus, alcohol 's effects. In response to these and other findings, the Institute has solicited re-search grants for the study of in vivo screening models that will test new com-pounds for alcoholism pharmacotherapy. Another initiative solicits research thatwill examine how alcohol affects neurochemical changes that take place duringadolescence. \u2014NIAAA-supported scientists are using and expanding powerful new techniques for studying specific protein areas of neuroreceptors. Site-directed mutagenesisand chimeric techniques permit researchers to examine, individually, compo-nents of neuroreceptor proteins to determine if they are involved in the brain 's response to alcohol. Gene knock-out techniques eliminate the activity of specificgenes and the proteins they encode. These genetic techniques thus allow sci-entists to test whether specific proteins, including components of neuro-receptors, mediate alcohol 's effects on nervous system function. The NIAAA will issue a Request for Applications (RFA) to apply these techniquest to alcoholstudies in fiscal year 2000. In addition, NIAAA-funded investigators are amongthe pioneers of a microdialysis technique that enables researchers to directlymeasure \u2014simultaneously \u2014neurotransmitter and neurophysiologic response in freely-behaving rats exposed to cognition-altering substances. Based on these neuroscience finding, NIAAA-supported scientists are devel- oping new pharmacologic compounds. Grants awarded under the pharma-cotherapy-screening initiative will enhance the laboratory testing process forevaluating the therapeutic potential and likelihood of risk associated with thesesubstances. Once this screening task has been accomplished, promising com-pounds will follow the usual route in the medication-development pipeline;namely, testing for efficacy and safety in animal studies, then small-scalehuman trials, when appropriate. Compounds shown to be safe and effective insmall-scale human trials will then become candidates for large-scale humanclinical trials. \u2014Medications Development \u2014NIAAA-supported scientists are making rapid progress in understanding the neurobiologic mechanisms that underlie alcohol 's effects. With this understanding comes the potential to design compounds thattherapeutically alter these mechanisms. To channel this rapid accumulation ofdata toward medication development, the NIAAA is encouraging research grantapplications that will result in new methods of screening promising compounds with therapeutic potential. This screening initiative also includes a componentintended to stimulate research on pharmacotherapy for the sequelae of alco-holism, such as liver disease. \u2014Project COMBINE, a large, multi-site, clinical trial of promising alcohol-treat- ment medications \u2014naltrexone and acamprosate \u2014is ongoing. Investigators are testing the effectiveness of these medications alone and in combination. Themedications are being evaluated with two behavioral interventions which areapplicable to two types of treatment settings. One is applicable to primary caremedical practices, and the other is suitable for addiction medicine specialitypractices. Preliminary studies evaluating safety of the combination of the medi-cations and the feasibility of the study protocol are in progress, and the maintrial will begin early in year 2000. \u2014Alcohol and Hepatitis C \u2014The NIAAA is an active and integral component of the research initiatives and collaborations among the NIH Institutes regardinghepatitis C virus (HCV). Heavy drinking increases the severity of hepatitis Cand complicates its treatment. Recognizing the substantial increased risk for in-fected individuals to advance to end-stage liver disease and liver failure, theNIAAA has released a Request for Applications (RFA) in fiscal year 2000. Thissolicitation specifically focuses on the role of alcohol in promoting end-stageliver disease and subsequent death in HCV patients. Principal goals of this re-search include elucidating alcohol 's impact on the course of hepatitis C, as well as exploring potential mechanisms and their exploitation in the development ofsuccessful treatment options. In fiscal year 1999, the NIAAA also cosponsored other HCV initiatives. For examples, the NIAAA participated in the requests for Hepatitis C ResearchCenters, sponsored by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID), that will provide a national research network blending basic research85 and clinical investigations to promote translational research in HCV research \u2014 that is, bring the basic research findings into the clinic. In addition, the NIAAAco-sponsored a request for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) applica-tions to establish new animal models to advance the field of alcohol and hepa-titis C research. An underlying premise is that multi-disciplinary basic labora-tory, animal model and clinical research is needed to advance our under-standing of HCV and the liver disease and cancer it can cause. The Institutealso has established a new collaboration with the American Liver foundation 's (ALF 's) ''Hepatitis C Initiative '' and is working closely with the ALF in advanc- ing patient-related information and activities. \u2014Alcoholic Liver Disease \u2014Scientists have made significant progress in under- standing the biological mechanisms that lead to organ damage in alcoholic liverdisease (ALD), the fourth leading cause of death among urban U.S. males anda source of costly morbidity. Among the findings are that reactive oxygen spe-cies (namely, producers of free radicals, which cause harmful changes in manymolecules) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), a protein that causes an inflam-matory response, play major roles in ALD, NIAAA-funded investigators are re-searching numerous methods to either inhibit TNF expression in liver cells di-rectly through genetic manipulation or by specific insertion of TNF-inhibitorsinto liver cells. In fiscal year 1999, the Institute expanded this research areathrough a Program Announcement (PA), entitled ''Mechanisms of Alcohol-In- duced Hepatic Fibrosis, '' which solicits elucidating new thera- peutic approaches for the fibrosis seen in alcoholic liver diseases. Since TNF isimplicated in many major diseases (for example, cancer, arthritis, and multiplesclerosis), advances in discovering how to selectively express cytokines associ-ated with organ damage will benefit a variety of disciplines. \u2014Research and Practice Forums \u2014In 1997, the Director of New York 's Office of Substance Abuse Services met with NIAAA Director Dr. Enoch Gordis to dis-cuss a number of issues affecting prevention and treatment services in theState. Two ideas emerged: (1) directing research dissemination efforts specifi-cally to clinical directors of treatment programs, and (2) developing a rigorousresearch demonstration project to test recommended science-based clinical prac-tices and measure outcomes in four or six volunteer treatment programs. Tofund these efforts, the Institute entered a partnership with the Center for Sub-stance Abuse Treatment (CSAT). The first phase of the collaboration was a ''re- search-practice forum '' held in Saratoga Springs, NY, in October 1998. The re- search symposium was designed specifically for clinical supervisors and direc-tors in New York who received the most cutting-edge research findings onissues affecting their work for incorporation into their programs. In turn, re-searchers also benefitted from input and information from the supervisors aboutreal world barriers and difficulties encountered in their clinics. The NIAAA and CSAT continue work with New York State, the provider 's as- sociation, and clinical directors of six programs on phase II of this project. Sixprograms have been selected to participate in the Best Practices/Researcher inResidence Program. The program 's goal is to encourage the adoption in clinical practice of recent treatment research advances by placing nationally recognizedscientists in brief periods of residence at participating clinical treatment sites.Information exchange between participating researchers and clinical supervisorsand staff will occur through training sessions, research seminars, presentationsof recently-developed techniques, case reviews, and clinical problem solving. This program has been expanded to the State of North Carolina where a forum was held in November 1999. Phase II of the North Carolina project isunder discussion and will be implemented in year 2000. If efforts in these twostates shod sufficient promise, they will be repeated elsewhere throughout thecountry. INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RURAL AGING With more than fifteen percent of the West Virginia 's population being at least sixty-five years of age, a percentage that is expected to increase over the next sev-eral years, such statistics underscore the need to take a closer look at how the needsof an aging population may affect West Virginia, the United States, and nationsaround the world. To help address the challenges associated with aging, delegatesfrom around the globe are slated to converge in Charleston, West Virginia, this com-ing June for the international ''Rural Aging: A Global Challenge '' conference. The rural aging conference is planned to direct special attention toward meeting theneeds of the elderly residing in the some of the least developed areas of the world.86 Organizers hope that the event will result in a stronger commitment to senior citi- zens by both the public and private sectors. Question. Currently, West Virginia University has submitted its application to the Administration on Aging for release of the remaining $500,000 that I secured forimplementation of the conference. What steps will you take to ensure the funds arereleased before the June 9, 2000 deadline? Answer. The Administration on Aging has been in frequent contact with the staff from West Virginia University to assure processing of funds as quickly as possible.Extensive technical assistance has been provided to assist in the planning of theconference. The Project Officer at the Administration on Aging has helped Univer-sity staff connect with representatives of the U.S. Federal Committee, State Inter- national Year of Older Persons coordinators and internationally recognized speak-ers. She has also developed publicity, recommend substantive program content andidentified partners who are providing help in handling the details of this event.Based on all the assistance provided HHS has every confidence the funds will bereleased before June 9. With more than fifteen percent of the West Virginia 's population being at least sixty-five years of age, a percentage that is expected to increase over the next sev-eral years, such statistics underscore the need to take a closer look at how the needsof an aging population may affect West Virginia, the United States, and nationsaround the world.

OBESITY IN WEST VIRGINIA Question. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources re- ported in May 1999 that 4.2-percent of West Virginia 's population falls into the cat- egory of being clinically obese. This alarming statistic places West Virginia first inthe nation in obesity, with the percentage reportedly growing higher each year.Sadly, it is the children who are falling prey to this epidemic, making them the fast-est growing portion of the obese population. What steps are you taking to createheightened obesity awareness and prevention, particularly with regard to West Vir-ginia? Answer. The Department sees obesity as a very serious public health problem. In fiscal year 2000, CDC received approximately $4.5 million in new funds for nutri-tion/obesity activities. With these funds, CDC will provide support to up to eightstates to initiate nutrition and physical activity programs to prevent and controlobesity and related chronic diseases. In carrying out these programs, states will (a)select one or more priority population in which to plan and initiate activities; (b)develop appropriate internal and external partnerships to carry out the plan; anddevelop, conduct, and evaluate nutrition and physical activity intervention pro-grams. West Virginia is encouraged to apply for CDC funding. Currently, CDC provides funding for State-based school health programs in West Virginia to: (1) develop a state system of support for coordinated school health pro-grams ($225,000) and (2) expand comprehensive school health education, with afocus on physical activity, nutrition and tobacco use prevention ($212,000). WestVirginia has used these funds to: \u2014Assist in the development and implementation of child nutrition polices. The West Virginia 's Department of Education requires food served in school cafe- terias to meet the dietary guidelines and prohibits the sale of high sugar andhigh fat foods during the school day; \u2014Evaluate and develop revised physical education requirements. The State Board of Education requires Physical Education requirements in grades K -8, and a full unit of Physical Education instruction as a high school graduation require-ment; \u2014Develop physical fitness requirements. President 's Physical Fitness Test is re- quired by law for all students in grades K -9 which includes a new accreditation standard that requires schools to have a 40 percent passage rate on the testor show improvement in each of the previous 3 years; \u2014Develop standards in health education and physical education for the State Board of Education; West Virginia plans to hold a Nutrition Symposium in 2001 for school health teams that will focus on obesity and being overweight; and continued physical edu-87 cation summits to help physical education teachers change their focus from sports to lifetime fitness activities. MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT OF AMBULANCE SERVICES Question. Earlier this year, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) advised all carriers to suspend any Inherent Reasonable (IR) pricing until the Gov-ernment Accounting Office (GAO) has finished their study of current IR authorityas revised by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). Although HCFA is scheduledto implement a fee schedule reimbursement for ambulance services beginning Janu-ary 1, 200 1, counties such as Doddridge and Marion are in dire need of a reassess-ment. What can you do to provide relief to West Virginia 's ambulance services? Answer. Since our instructions to the carriers to suspend any inherent reasonable- ness activities, the Congress enacted the Balance Budget Refinement Act of 1999(BBRA). Section 223 of BBRA prohibits use of the inherent reasonableness authorityby the Secretary or her contractors until (1) the General Accounting Office (GAO)reports on its inherent reasonableness study, and (2) HCFA publishes a final rulethat responds to the GAO report as well as to the comments received on the Janu-ary 1, 1998 Interim Final Inherent Reasonableness regulation. Therefore, we currently have no mechanism to provide relief to ambulance sup- pliers in your state at this time. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN HEAD START Question. The President 's goal is to enroll $1 million children in Head Start by 2002. Providing children with access to programs that improve cognitive and socialdevelopment in their early years is important. And yet, ''Head Start has only vague performance standards and no curriculum to stimulate the growth of literacy and numeracy, '' say Henry Aaron and Robert Reschaeur in Setting National Priorities, The 2000 Election and Beyond . What is HHS doing to move Head Start from custo- dial child care to a program that stresses cognitive development and learning? Answer. Head Start is America 's premiere early childhood education program, and continues to lead the way in state-of-the-art approaches to enhancing young chil-dren 's development. Head Start 's performance standards are, in fact, quite com- prehensive and clearly delineate what programs must do in serving children andfamilies. These standards cover the areas of Education and Early Childhood Devel-opment, Child Health, Child Mental Health, Child Nutrition, Family Partnerships,Community Partnerships and Program Governance, among others. A copy of thesestandards is attached. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Performance Stand-ard on Education and Early Childhood Development clearly requires that all pro-grams must, in collaboration with Head Start parents, implement a curriculum andgoes on to discuss what this curriculum must include. This Administration has invested heavily in improving not only the cognitive learning aspects of this program, but in raising its standards. We have paired in-vestment in critical elements of quality such as teacher compensation and trainingwith a tough approach to enforcement of high standards in every Head Start pro-gram. Annual salaries for Head Start teachers have increased from $14,600 in 1992to $20,700 this year. Since 1995, more than 140 local grantees have been replacedbecause they have been unable to rectify deficiencies in program quality. We willcontinue these investments in fiscal year 2001 and will devote more than half ofall new Head Start money to continued improvements in the quality of the program. In addition, Head Start has made a commitment to measuring child outcomes, in- cluding cognitive outcomes as well as other key aspects of children 's development and parental involvement. Our research shows that typical children leave HeadStart with a wide range of specific knowledge and skills that prepare them for kin-dergarten. These practical, common sense achievements form the foundation for con-tinued progress in learning by Head Start children in kindergarten where they showstatistically significant growth in vocabulary, letter recognition, writing and otherpre-reading skills. Question. Would HHS be opposed to changing the focus of the Head Start pro- gram so that more attention is placed on the development of cognitive skills? Answer. Head Start provides top-quality early childhood education along with comprehensive services, such as health, nutrition, and family support services, to al-most 900,000 low-income, preschool children and their families across the nation, in-cluding more than 81,000 children and their families in California.88 Head Start currently places a strong emphasis on cognitive skills. Preliminary re- sults from the Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) indicate that averageprogram quality is in the ''good '' to ''excellent '' range and no classroom scored below the ''minimal quality '' range. Head Start children are ready for school, performing above the levels expected for children from low-income families who have not at-tended center-based programs. The survey also found that 66 percent of Head Startparents read to their child three or more times a week and that 70 -90 percent of parents teach their children letters, numbers or songs. We are building upon this progress with new initiatives, including expanded training in family literacy services, new partnerships with prekindergarten andchild care programs, and the development of local grantee systems to track and ana-lyze child outcome data. Question. What kind of coordination or communication does the Department of Education have with HHS on this program? Answer. The Head Start Bureau has extensive collaborative relationships and ini- tiatives with the Department of Education, including the following: \u2014Recent joint sponsorship with Title I, Even Start, and HHS 's Child Care Bureau of a national leadership forum of State leaders and managers of prekinder-garten, Head Start, and child care programs to explore new opportunities to useState and Federal early childhood funding to reach more children with higherquality services and to identify ways to eliminate barriers to cross-program col-laboration. \u2014Long-standing involvement with ED in joint efforts to serve infants, toddlers, and young children with disabilities, including participation in the FederalInteragency Coordinating Council, and public-private partnerships such as theConrad Hilton Foundation/Head Start $15 million initiative to training commu-nity teams of Early Head Start, ED early intervention program providers, par-ents and other community agency leaders to improve serving to infants and tod-dlers with disabilities. \u2014Collaborative efforts in research and accountability efforts, including joint spon- sorship and funding of major longitudinal studies of early childhood develop-ment (including the National Center for Education Statistic 's Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Kindergarten & Birth Cohorts) and emerging efforts inTitle I and Even Start to utilize the Head Start Performance Measures outcomemeasures in Federal evaluations and State-level accountability efforts. \u2014Additional leadership efforts between Head Start and public education pro- grams and systems occur at the State and local level through the nationwidenetwork of Head Start-State Collaboration Offices which give priority attentionto forging linkages among local Head Start agencies, family literacy initiatives,State prekindergarten programs, and local education agencies. \u2014Finally, and most importantly, every local Head Start grantee is held account- able for maintaining strong and effective partnerships with local elementaryschools and districts through specific mandates covering the provision of familyliteracy and adult education services, services to children with disabilities, andpreparing every child and family for a successful transition to kindergarten. Question. Shouldn 't we move Head Start to the Department of Education and con- vert it into a strong preschool program and focuses on cognitive development? Answer. I do not believe that Head Start should be transferred to the Department of Education. While the cognitive elements of Head Start are extremely important,the genius of the program is that it is comprehensive. It integrates health, nutritionand family support services with education and learning. The American CustomerSatisfaction survey found that Head Start=s composite satisfaction score of 87 is un-surpassed among all public and private entities in the survey. Head Start parentssaid that they would recommend Head Start to other parents and that they are con-fident that Head Start will continue to do a good job of providing preschool edu-cation in the future. In addition to these high levels of parent satisfaction, HeadStart programs demonstrate exemplary levels of parent involvement, a key ingre-dient in children=s success. We are continuing to introduce new initiatives to challenge and support Head Start 's drive for excellence, including expanded training in family literacy services (in collaboration with the Department of Education 's Even Start program), new partnerships with pre-kindergarten and child care programs and funding sources,and the development of local grantee systems to track and analyze child outcomedata.89 IMMUNIZATIONS Question. You have told me that opening up the Federal Vaccines for Children Program to SCHIP beneficiaries would require a legislative change. Would you sup-port legislation to make SCHIP beneficiaries eligible for the Vaccines for ChildrenProgram? If no, why not? Answer. The Department would not oppose such legislation. HIV/AIDS Question. What are your plans to reinvigorate the government 's focus on pre- venting the further spread of HIV/AIDS, particularly in communities of color? Answer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the lead for the De- partment in preventing the further spread of HIV/AIDS. CDC has initiated a num-ber of national, regional, and community-based programs designed specifically toreach racial and ethnic minorities at greatest risk of HIV infection. CDC is focusingspecifically designed programs on the HIV/AIDS prevention needs of African- Ameri-cans and other disproportionately affected racial/ethnic minority communities inthree broad categories: technical assistance and infrastructure support, increasingaccess to prevention and care services, and building stronger linkages to address theneeds of specific populations. In October 1999, CDC awarded funds to more than 100 organizations throughout the nation to expand HIV prevention efforts in African-American and other commu-nities of color at high risk of infection, including Latinos, Native Americans andAsian Pacific Islanders communities. The 1999 awards represented a 50 percent in-crease in funding earmarked for HIV prevention efforts in African-American com-munities. Awards include 47 African American community-based organizations(CBOs) and 7 State and city health departments to develop HIV prevention pro-grams in correctional facilities to reach high-risk minority populations, as well as,new national efforts to encourage HIV testing among African- Americans and othersat high risk of HIV infection. In addition, CDC continues to provide funds to State and local health depart- ments for HIV prevention. Funding priorities for the health departments are deter-mined through a community planning process. Community planning provides an ap-proach to ensure community voices and programs to keep pace with the local epi-demic, and States are strongly encouraged to direct resources towards their HIVepidemic. Funds are used to (1) address prevention needs in communities of color;(2) build capacity of grassroots organizations to deliver effective, targeted, culturallycompetent interventions; and (3) supplement funds for demonstration projects focus-ing on HIV seropositive persons, correctional activities, and perinatal preventionwork. In fiscal year 2001, an increase of $40 million will fund grants allocatedthrough the community planning process to focus on high risk populations, includ-ing minorities. An additional $10 million will also be directed towards the Know Your Status '' campaign in fiscal year 2001 to focus predominantly on minority popu- lations. Question. What has HHS learned during the past year about the effectiveness of the current role and structure of the CARE Act in improving access to HIV treat-ments among underserved communities? Answer. Over 67 percent of Ryan White CARE Act programs provide services to minorities, based on 1997 Annual Administrative Reports from CARE Act grantees.An initial draft of a study conducted by the University of California, San Francisco,and supported by HRSA, did not find minorities disproportionately under rep-resented in acquiring access to HIV treatments when other public funding and enti-tlement benefits programs (e.g., state programs and Medicaid) are taken into consid-eration. The study 's final report is expected by the end of fiscal year 2000. Question. Do you think the current formula used to distribute funding is effective and working? Why or why not? If not, what changes would you propose to the for-mula? Answer. We do believe the current formula for distributing funds under Title I and II, which was revised when the CARE Act was reauthorized in 1996, is effectiveand works. In order to more fully understand and address the complex set of issuesassociated with the allocation formulas, the Administration supports the authoriza-tion of an Institute of Medicine study to examine the financing and delivery of HIVservices to low-income, under and uninsured persons with HIV. Question. Do you think the current formula effectively sends funds to areas where the AIDS epidemic is? Why or why not? If not, what changes would you proposeto make? Answer. We believe the current formula effectively sends funds to areas where the AIDS epidemic is. In order to more fully understand and address the complex set90 of issues associated with the allocation formulas, the Administration supports the authorization of an Institute of Medicine study to examine the financing and deliv-ery of HIV services to low-income, under and uninsured persons with HIV. Question. What can HHS do to make certain that the funding is going to commu- nities most impacted by the epidemic? What should Congress do? Answer. As you already know, Congress appropriated additional funds to address the needs of minority communities through the Congressional Black Caucus initia-tive in both the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and the fiscal year 2000 appropria-tion. The Agency allocated funds to communities based on the allocation processspecified in the report language accompanying the fiscal year 1999 appropriationand is assessing the impact of these funds. In allocating these funds, grantees wereprovided direction in the use of these funds. The fiscal year 2000 appropriation sig-nificantly increased the amount of CARE Act funding designated for minority com-munities. We understand that the Senate is beginning to discuss Ryan White reauthoriza- tion. We believe that this reauthorization can strengthen the Ryan White program 's ability to ensure that funding is going to communities most impacted by the epi-demic. This can be accomplished by considering changes to the Act that will focuson methods for identifying and reaching HIV-positive individuals who are not cur-rently receiving care, increasing the service capacity of providers in underservedcommunities, and establishing increasingly accountable service networks. BIDIS Question. Given the widespread availability of bidis and their harmful health ef- fects, it is especially important that bibis be included in all anti-tobacco programs.What is HHS, FDA, and CDC doing to address the increasing use of bidis? Answer. Research has shown that bidis are a significant health hazard to users, leading to an increased risk of coronary heart disease and cancers of the mouth, pharynx and larynx, lung, esophagus, stomach, and liver. One study found that abidi produces more than three times the amount of carbon monoxide and nicotineand more than five times the amount of tar than a cigarette, when tested on astandard smoking machine. In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule prohib- iting the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to minors. The Agencyhas been enforcing the provision since 1997 in an enforcement partnership withstate and local governments. Bidis are not ordinarily sold in conventional tobacco retail establishments. FDA is carrying-out research to determine the types of retail outlets that are likely tosell bidis; results are expected shortly. Once this information is available FDA canthen determine whether additional unannounced inspections should be conducted inthose establishments. This is of course, contingent upon the Supreme Court 's review of FDA 's legal au- thority to regulate tobacco and tobacco related products. Recent trends related to bidi use among youth underscore the need for a greater focus on preventing young people from ever starting to use bidis or any other to-bacco product and to help young people to quit tobacco use. The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) continues to help States address the use of bidis andother tobacco products through the implementation of comprehensive tobacco pre-vention and control programs. In particular, CDC is working with States to developmessages to inform the public about the health risks attributed to bidis use to refutethe notion that they are safer to smoke than cigarettes, explore ways to involveyoung people and their families in efforts to prevent tobacco use to include bidis,and survey teens in order to determine trends in bidis use. There is still much to be done, but we have established dialogue and provide ongo- ing technical assistance to the states and national organizations in their efforts toeffectively address all tobacco issues, including bidi use. Question. Shouldn 't all bidis packages carry health warning labels? If so, what are you doing to make certain this happens? Answer. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is working with bidis manufactur- ers and the U.S. Customs Department to ensure that health warning labels areproperly placed and appear on bidi packages imported into the U.S. Anecdotal evi-dence indicates that some bidi packages imported and sold in the U.S. do not con-tain health warning labels. The public is encouraged to notify the FTC if they ob-serve bidi packages not containing health warning labels. The FTC should answerfurther questions regarding the placement of the Surgeon General 's rotating health warning labels on packs of bidis.91 Question. Shouldn 't they be sold with the same age restrictions as other tobacco products? If so, what are you doing to make certain this happens? Answer. Bidis are subject to the same age restrictions as other tobacco products. Bidis are not safe and should never be considered a safe alternative to any formof tobacco product including cigarettes, spit tobacco, cigars or pipes. Therefore, con-cerns regarding the accessibility of bidis among youth are similar to minors ' access issues for other tobacco products. Currently, bidis are available through the Inter-net, tobacco shops, some ethnic food and convenient stores, and in selected healthstores. Anecdotally, youth (under the age of 18) have little difficulty purchasingthem. The Synar Amendment, enacted in 1992 and implemented by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), requires States toenact and enforce laws prohibiting any manufacturer, retailer, or distributor fromselling or distributing tobacco products \u2014including bidis \u2014to individuals under the age of 18. The goal of the amendment was to reduce the number of successful illegalpurchases by minors to no more than 20 percent of attempted buys by minors ineach State within a negotiated time period. SAMHSA is working closely with the States to broaden their enforcement to in- clude spit tobacco, cigars, bidis, etc. in addition to cigarettes. In addition SAMHSAis conducting a series of State and regional studies to measure the availability ofthese tobacco products to youth, and whether there are differences in retailers ' will- ingness to sell to youth based on the type of tobacco product. Question. How can we expand health services in underserved areas by reducing training opportunities of qualified health professionals? Why did you propose to cutfunding? Answer. The fiscal year 2001 budget will work to ensure a diverse workforce that is adequately distributed. The request is $218 million, an $84 million reduction.Within this overall funding level HRSA will focus resources on programs which willhelp disadvantaged students and reflects the Administration 's goal to move away from broad-based categorical programs. Within this level there is a $10 million in-crease for the Centers of Excellence and the Health Careers Opportunity programs,both of which have success in increasing diversity by recruiting and retaining prom-ising racial and ethnic minority students in health professions training. Also in-cluded in the total request is $80 million for the Children 's Hospitals Graduate Med- ical Education (GME), doubling the funding available in fiscal year 2000. Thesefunds will raise the level of GME support for approximately 60 freestanding Chil-dren 's Hospitals to be more consistent with other teaching hospitals. NIH SALARY CAP Question. Wouldn 't an increase in the NIH salary cap benefit biomedical research? Answer. An increase in the NIH salary cap is unlikely to benefit biomedical re- search directly. In those instances in which an institution chooses to provide a basesalary that exceeds the current statutory salary cap, an increase in the salary capcould affect the amount of their own funds that research institutions have availablefor the support of the government-university research enterprise. However, coveringthe additional costs for those grants resulting from an increase in the NIH salarycap could reduce the number of awards the NIH is able to make. Question. Do you support an increase in the salary cap to Executive Level I? Answer. In the fiscal year 2001 President 's Budget, the Administration proposes to maintain the salary cap at Executive Level II. STATE CHILDREN 'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (SCHIP) ENROLLMENT Question. Why is enrollment in SCHIP so low? Answer. In December 1999, HHS announced that enrollment in SCHIP was near- ly 2 million for fiscal year 1999. This represents a doubling in enrollment since De-cember 1998. We are pleased with States ' success in finding and enrolling these eli- gible children. Remember, SCHIP is still a relatively new program and now that all States have programs approved, we expect to see further increases in enrollment once the pro-grams are fully implemented. States continue to engage in and improve upon outreach activities that will in- crease the number of children enrolled in SCHIP. Furthermore, States continue tosubmit plan amendments to expand the eligibility levels for their programs. Question. What are the Department 's current efforts to improve enrollment and decrease obstacles to enrollment in SCHIP? Answer. The Administration 's FamilyCare coverage proposal builds on States ' op- erating SCHIP programs by expanding SCHIP to parents. This will increase enroll-92 ment of children in the program because States would be required to cover children up to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level before covering parents in fiscal year2001 -2005. Furthermore, we believe enrollment of children in SCHIP and Medicaid will increase because children are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance iftheir parents are also enrolled. FamilyCare also permits States to pool allotments with employer contributions to- ward the purchase of private coverage. Thus, families that would be eligible forFamilyCare will be able to access their employers ' health plan as long as the em- ployer contributes half the family premium costs and the health plan metFamilyCare standards. In addition to covering the parents of SCHIP and Medicaid eligible children, we expect to cover an additional 400,000 uninsured children over the next 10 yearsthrough several new tools, including: \u2014allowing school lunch programs to share eligibility information with Medicaid, \u2014expanding sites authorized to determine presumptive eligibility for SCHIP and Medicaid, \u2014requiring States to make their Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment processes equally simple. Over the next 10 years, we expect to cover 4 million additional people, that is, 3.5 million new adults (parents of Medicaid-eligible children) and 500,000 new chil-dren in Medicaid and SCHIP. Question. What are the current efforts to ensure retention in the programs? Answer. Since the welfare reform law was enacted in 1996, the Department has issued guidance and other information to the States about how Medicaid eligibilityrules and procedures have been affected by welfare reform. Perhaps the most sig-nificant was a detailed guide, released in March 1999, that sets forth the Federalrequirements and proposes a range of options that can promote enrollment amongeligible families, including those leaving welfare. This guidance made it clear thattransitional Medicaid is available to all families that would otherwise lose theirMedicaid coverage due to earnings. HCFA is working with States to ensure that eli-gible families continue to receive Medicaid after they leave welfare without any gapin coverage. Through its Regional Offices, HCFA recently conducted on-site reviews in every State and territory to examine current policies and practices with regard to Med-icaid applications, eligibility and enrollment in the post-welfare reform environment.One goal of this effort is to take the appropriate steps to ensure that eligible fami-lies receive and retain Medicaid, including ''transitional '' Medicaid. In addition, we will be synthesizing the findings from the site visits and devel- oping a plan for the next steps, including technical assistance, corrective action ifappropriate, and best practices identified through our site visits. On January 6, 2000 we released guidance advising States of the continued avail- ability of Federal funds set aside in the 1996 welfare law to help States cover thecosts of adapting their Medicaid policies and systems to welfare reform changes. Atthe end of last year, the Administration worked successfully with Congress to ex-tend the life of this fund. Most States have a considerable amount of funds to usefor these purposes. Finally, on April 7, 2000 we released guidance to ensure that eligible low-income families are able to enroll and stay enrolled in Medicaid. The letter to State Med-icaid Directors covers State responsibilities in three related areas: identifying andreinstating people terminated improperly; processes for redeterminations for eligi-bility; computerized eligibility systems. REPORTS REQUESTED IN LAST YEAR 'S APPROPRIATIONS LANGUAGE Question. What is the status of these reports? Answer. Reports will be submitted at a later date.Question. When will we receive these reports? Answer. Reports will be submitted at a later date. INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FUNDING The budget calls for an increase of $192 million for the Indian Health Service. While the increase in funding is appreciated, I fear it will not be enough to bringIndian Health up to even minimal standards. In 1998, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior directed the Indian Health Service to work with Tribes to address the question of funding equity forIndians. That group used outside consultants with proven experience in actuarialresearch and analysis. Using the Federal Employee Benefit Package (FEBP) as a93 model, the group analyzed funding for Indian Health in four defined Indian popu- lations. What the group found was that an additional $1.2 billion dollars would have been needed in fiscal year 1999 to fully provide services comparable to those in theFEBP. The average cost of providing the FEBP-like services is $2980 per AmericanIndian per year (of which approximately $750 is available from non-IHS sourcessuch as Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare.) The IHS currently has on average only$1,200 of the needed residual amount of $2,230 per person per year. Question. Congress asked for this funding study, the results are in. Why, then, did the Administration not ask for more funding for the IHS? Answer. The Administration has proposed an increase of $230 million for the In- dian Health Service as a step towards eliminating the disparities in health outcomeswhich currently exist between Indian people and other Americans. This 10 percentincrease is the largest requested for the Indian Health Service in over two decades. Much of the disparity in health outcomes is closely linked to poverty, unemploy- ment, and lower levels of educational attainment in much of Indian country. To ad-dress these problems, the Department 's budget includes a $96 million increase in other programs targeted towards American Indians and Alaska Natives includingincreases in Head Start, Child Care, tribal TANF, the Administration for NativeAmericans and the Administration on Aging. The requested increase for the Admin-istration for Native Americans is also the largest in over two decades. Looking atthe Administration 's entire budget for Native Americans, a total of $9.4 billion is requested, an increase of $1.2 billion over fiscal year 2000. Question. What can the Administration do to help me bridge this gap between supply and demand? Answer. The Administration has requested an increase of $1.2 billion in funds for Native Americans for a total of $9.4 billion. HHS 's part of this request includes an increase of $326 million in funding targeted to American Indians and Alaska Na-tives for an HHS total of $3.5 billion. Funding requests for both HHS Agencieswhich exclusively serve Native Americans-the Indian Health Service and the Ad-ministration for Native Americans-are the largest in over two decades. In addition to requesting increased funding, better inter-agency cooperation is an important means of bridging this gap. The Health Care Financing Administrationhas worked to increase Medicare and Medicaid collections at Indian Health Servicesfacilities by 103 percent since 1995. The Indian Health Service has recently enteredinto collaborations with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the HeadStart Bureau, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, theNational Institutes of Health, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Agriculture Depart-ment, the Justice Department and the Veterans Administration. Tribal consultation is also important to ensure that we understand the problems of Indian communities and to assist these communities in accessing assistance fromall parts of the Department. In May of 1999, HHS held its first Department-widetribal budget consultation meeting, Leaders from 35 tribes and tribal organizationspresented recommendations covering the entire Department. Our second Depart-ment-wide tribal budget consultation meeting is scheduled for this coming April.The Deputy Secretary has also held a series of five regional meetings with triballeaders over the past year. A fourth way to bridge this gap is through supporting tribal self-determination efforts allowing tribes to provide their own health services under contract with theIndian Health Service. A recent National Indian Health Board survey of tribal lead-ers found that contracting tribes were significantly more likely to than non-con-tracting tribes to believe that their health services had improved over the past threeyears. The share of IHS 's budget going for tribally operated programs increased from 28 percent in fiscal year 1993 to 44 percent in fiscal year 1999. To supportcontinued growth in tribal self-determination efforts, the Indian Health Service 's budget includes an increase of $40 million for contract support costs. CLINICAL TRIALS DATABASE In 1997, Congress passed the FDA bill and included the Snowe-Feinstein bill re- quiring HHS to establish a database and a 1 -800 number for clinical trials so that patients and doctors can find out what research trials are being conducted for seri-ous and life-threatening diseases. It has been almost 3 years. I received a press re-lease last night saying you announced the launch at 12:01 a.m. Thank you verymuch. Question. Is it operational? Can people now call an 800 number? Can they access it via the Internet? Are all research trials on it? Federal, private, others?94 Answer. The ClinicalTrials.gov database is operational and available on the Web. The strategy adopted by the NIH was first to develop, test, and implement an Inter-net-accessible database of clinical trials; NIH is now investigating how best to im-plement an 800 number. There are presently about 4,200 clinical trials in this firstphase of the database. These are primarily clinical trials sponsored by the NIH.There are also several hundred privately sponsored trials in the database, primarilyrelated to AIDS and cancer. In the second phase of ClinicalTrials.gov, we will entermany more clinical trials sponsored by other Federal agencies and private and com-mercial trials. Question. When will it be completed? How often will it be updated? What took it so long? Answer. The ClinicalTrials.gov database will continue to evolve indefinitely as new trials are added. The database is updated nightly as new data are received bythe NLM from the sponsors of clinical trials. The clinical trials database was man-dated by the November 1997 FDA Modernization Act. After considering various op-tions for implementation, NIH tasked the National Library of Medicine in Sep-tember 1998 to create the database. During fiscal year 1999, the NLM worked expe-ditiously to organize the 20-plus NIH institutes to establish standard data elementsfor each clinical trial and to input the data for the first 4,200 NIH-supported clinicaltrials into the system. The database was released to the public on February 29,2000. CANCER REGISTRIES Last September, the Sacramento Bee reported under a headline, ''Retreat on Can- cer,'' that California 's landmark cancer registry is ''slowing falling apart. '' We were the leader in efforts to track cancer at one time, dating back to the 1940s. But it 's budget has been flat for a decade. Question. Admittedly the State should put more resources into our cancer reg- istry, but your proposal for funding cancer registries is flat for fiscal year 2001, at$24 million. The American Cancer Society recommends an appropriation of $55 mil-lion. Why aren 't you increasing funding for cancer registries? Answer. As you know, developing a budget involved hard choices between deserv- ing programs. The Department is working hard to improve cancer registries nation-wide. The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention are working more closely than ever to provide good epidemiological infor-mation on cancer. They will pool their cancer data resources and create a nationalinfrastructure for cancer control and surveillance activities. CDC 's National Pro- gram of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NIH 's SEER together cover virtually the en- tire U.S. cancer patient population. CDC supports registries in 45 States, the Dis-trict of Columbia, and three territories. The SEER program covers 5 States, 5 majormetropolitan areas, rural areas in one State, and selected populations of AmericanIndians. The California Cancer Registry has participated as an enhancement state with the CDC 's NPCR since 1994. On the basis of 1996 data, the California registry has been certified by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries forits data completeness, timeliness, and quality. An example of California 's accom- plishments with its limited resources is that the state routinely reports cancer ratesfor Asian and Pacific Islanders and for Hispanics. These rates can then be comparedwith the more readily available rates for whites and blacks. A recent registry reportsuggested that the state 's tobacco control program may have helped decrease inci- dence rates for lung cancer among women in racial and ethnic minority populations. The California registry is one of eight registries participating in a special NPCR- supported childhood cancer project to design, implement, and evaluate a method touse data from a state population-based central registry to compute expected num-bers of incident cancer cases in children. The registry will evaluate completeness ofits data and of other existing pediatric cancer databases, such as the Pediatric On-cology Group/Children 's Cancer Group, by performing data linkage. CANCER AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS Question. NCI, NIEHS and CDC sponsor cancer research. Should we be doing more on environmental risk factors for cancer? Answer. The emergence of new research tools for clarifying how environmental factors and susceptibility to cancer interrelate, has opened many new possibilitiesfor research on environmental risk factors. The NCI has identified ''Genes and the Environment '' as a major scientific opportunity for cancer research for fiscal year 2001. Among the research areas for emphasis at both NCI and NIEHS are: identifymore fully the environmental causes of cancer using new epidemiologic and genetic95 approaches; identify genes that modify (increase or decrease) cancer risk, including the risk resulting from environmental exposures; integrate information on geneticsusceptibility and environmental exposure to estimate cancer risks for individuals,families, and populations; and develop new strategies for cancer prevention, earlydetection, and treatment, building upon new knowledge about the genetic and envi-ronmental determinants of risk. The study of geographical variation in cancer rates has provided important clues to the role of lifestyle and other environmental factors that affect cancer risk. A newedition of the Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States from 1950 -1994 was recently published by the National Cancer Institute. The geographic patterns of can-cer displayed in the atlas should help target further epidemiologic investigationsinto the causes of cancer and to set priorities for public health activities aimed atcancer prevention and control. Epidemiology and Exposure Assessment NCI and NIEHS have a long history of working together to explicate the role of environmental factors in geographic variations in cancer mortality patterns, espe-cially for breast cancer. This working relationship was established with the Congres-sionally mandated Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP) and theNortheast/Mid-Atlantic Breast Cancer Program, both of which the Institutes haveco-funded. The latter program, comprised of highly productive research, focusing onexposure to pesticides and related chemicals and electromagnetic frequency radi- ation in relation to breast cancer risk, has been completed and a report has beensubmitted to me. Investigators on the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project have explored new ways to study the relationships between the environment and breast cancer. How-ever, much remains to be learned about the role of environmental exposures andother risk factors and their interaction with genes in promoting the development ofbreast cancer. Beginning in mid-2000, a series of papers are expected to be pub-lished that will address results of biomarker analyses, analysis of environmentalsamples, and interview data on exposures both environmental and non-environ-mental (e.g., diet, medications, medical irradiation, electromagnetic field radiation). In 1999, NCI, in collaboration with NIEHS, convened an ad hoc advisory group of experts from many disciplines to discuss the present status of environmental ex-posure assessments and cancer epidemiology. Considerations for advancing the fieldduring the next five years were summarized, focusing on research needs and newresearch directions. NCI and NIEHS program staff are currently preparing a re-quest for applications (RFA) on exposure assessment incorporating the discussionsat that meeting. It is expected that the RFA will be issued and funded in fiscal year2000. An RFA issued by NCI and NIEHS, entitled ''Regional Variation in Breast Cancer Rates in the United States, '' launched new projects in which investigative teams are using statistical and epidemiologic methods to investigate factors that may influ-ence, contribute to, or account for the reported differences in breast cancer incidenceand mortality rates across different geographic regions. Data on women residing inCalifornia, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mex-ico, Washington, Wisconsin, and Utah will be analyzed. A supplement to an ongoingstudy in New York is evaluating the effect of electromagnetic field radiation (EMF)on breast cancer risk. The results of these studies will be critically assessed to helpdirect the future research agenda on the environment and cancer. The NCI and CDC have worked collaboratively in several areas, including cancer surveillance. A recent Memorandum of Understanding lays out areas for futuregrowth and development of this collaboration. NCI will support CDC 's efforts to en- hance state-specific use of cancer surveillance systems for cancer control and to de-velop appropriate risk communications tools for use with public inquiries about can-cer rates and trends. The NCI 's Epidemiology and Genetics Research Program (EGRP) was a co-sponsor of four initiatives led by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health(NIOSH) within CDC. The NCI component supported the environmental and/or oc-cupational exposure assessments for epidemiologic studies of cancer. In response to two of these initiatives, entitled ''Implementation of the National Occupational Research Agenda '' and ''Mechanistic-Based Cancer Risk Assessment Methods, '' four new grants were awarded to develop and/or improve methods for as- sessing past environmental and occupational exposures that could be associatedwith geographically related cancers, including breast cancer. Research of this type(called exposure assessment) is important in understanding breast cancer for tworeasons. First, we must be able to link breast cancer development to a carcinogenexposure that occurred years before the diagnosis; and second, we must be able to96 obtain environmental data for assessing the role of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of breast cancer. Intramural Geographic Information System Projects A new area that offers some promising technologic methods for assessing the im- pact of environment on cancer is the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). NCIhas completed several intramural projects designed to develop methods to use GISin estimating exposure to crops sprayed with pesticides, drinking water contami-nants, and measures of proximity to industries that release toxic substances. Meth-ods to identify populations potentially exposed to agricultural pesticides using re-mote sensing and a GIS were evaluated. Several future efforts are planned to fur-ther examine the usefulness of GIS in cancer-related studies. Researchers willevaluate the accuracy of several ''address-matching algorithms '' that determine the geographic location of respondents in health-related studies, and a comparison willbe made of household levels of pesticides in dust with proximity measures to pes-ticide-treated crops, as estimated by GIS methods. A ''pesticide drift model '' will be incorporated into GIS estimates of pesticide exposures among persons living adja-cent to crop fields sprayed with pesticides. In studies of cancer etiology, GIS methods will be used to help evaluate geo- graphic patterns in prostate cancer mortality in relation to nitrate levels in drinkingwater and pesticide use. A GIS will be used to map populations in the Platte RiverValley usingpublic and private water supplies and to estimate nitrate exposure indrinking water to evaluate associations with rates of several cancers. In a study ofbladder cancer, Global Positioning System measurements will be collected and loca-tional information will be used to link residences to information on water qualityin existing databases and to evaluate proximity to industries and industrial releasesof toxic substances. Environmental Genome Project and Gene Expression Technology The many rapid advances in technologies for molecular genetics research are pro- viding new opportunities to understand the genetic basis for individual differencesin susceptibility to environmental exposure and how exposure and susceptibilityinterrelate to the development of diseases like cancer. The NIEHS has establisheda research program on genetic susceptibility to environmentally-associated diseasesthrough its Environmental Genome Project, which is aimed at the identification ofallelic variants (polymorphisms) of environmental disease susceptibility genes in theU.S. population, the development of a central database of polymorphisms for thesegenes, and population-based studies of gene-environment interaction in disease eti-ology. By identifying those genes and allelic variants that affect individual responseto environmental agents, scientists can better predict health risks and assist regu-latory agencies in the development of policies on environmental protection policies.As previously mentioned, NCI has identified ''Genes and the Environment '' as a major scientific opportunity in cancer research for fiscal year 2001. We are only be-ginning to amass these data, and much more work is needed. cDNA microarrays are tools that can be used to analyze changes in patterns of gene expression that contribute to cancer development. This technology may revolu-tionize the way problems in environmental health are investigated. Given that expo-sures to different classes of toxicants result in distinct patterns of altered gene ex-pression, microarray technology can be utilized to categorize and classify these ef-fects through the direct comparison of gene expression patterns in control samplesversus those treated with toxicants. In defined model systems, treatment withknown toxic and carcinogenic agents, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,dioxin-like compounds, peroxisome proliferators, oxidant stress, or estrogenic chemi-cals, may provide a gene expression ''signature '' on a microarray which represents the cellular response to these agents. These same systems can then be treated withunknown, agents under suspicion, to determine if one or more of these standard sig-natures is elicited. This approach will also help elucidate an agent 's mechanism of action and may also be used to detect changes in exposed human populations, infor-mation essential for the risk assessment process. cDNA microarrays also hold prom-ise for the determination of interactions between combinations of agents (e.g., dioxinand estrogen). It is also likely that new molecular targets of toxic or carcinogenicaction will be identified, and that these new targets may be good candidates foranalysis in the Environmental Genome Project. NIEHS and NCI each have estab-lished the capacity to do cDNA microarray technology. In a collaborative researchproject with cDNA arrays or ''chips '' that comprise human cDNA clones oriented toward the detection of the expression of genes involved in responses to toxic insult. Theinitial ''ToxChip '' we have designed includes genes for xenobiotic metabolizing en-97 zymes, cell cycle components, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, DNA repair genes, estrogen-responsive genes, oxidative stress genes, and genes known to be involvedin apoptotic cell death. Plans call for this technology to be available eventually toboth intramural and extramural scientists on a collaborative basis. NCI has beenactively promoting and funding the use of DNA microarray technology into the ex-tramural community through a variety of approaches. The NIEHS is also workingto enhance capacity for cDNA microarray technology in research institutions. By exploiting recent advances in human genetics and recombinant DNA tech- nology, we can develop animal models and in vitro assay systems to identify carcino-gens and toxicants in a matter of weeks rather than years, with considerable sav-ings in terms of money and use of animals. Using cDNA microarray technology, forexample, toxicologists may be able to expose cells or tissues to chemicals whose tox-icity is unknown and match the results against the ''signature, '' or common set of changes in gene expression, produced by a known class of toxicants. This would re-duce the need for lengthy and expensive rodent bioassays and could lend itself totesting the effects of low-dose as well as long-term exposure. The use of cDNAmicroarray technology to assess changes in gene expression in response to specificenvironmental exposures is a rapidly growing research area that will have a largeimpact on the environmental health sciences, including molecular epidemiology, anddrug discovery. It is appropriate that the development and validation of this newapplication to environmental health science is being led by the NIEHS since thistechnology could revolutionize the field. Similarly the leadership of the NCI in ap-plying this new technology, in cancer research, will speed new discoveries of envi-ronmental factors that contribute to cancer. Also, it is now possible to modify genes in animals thus orchestrating the carcino- genic process. For example, incorporation of a chemically inducible oncogene into thegermline produces animals with multiple copies of the modified gene in all the cellsof the organism. Conversely, one can delete one copy of a gene that acts as a tumorsuppressor. Such so-called transgenic animals are much more responsive to carcino-genic exposures. In preliminary studies, a carcinogen can be identified in these ani-mals in six months (rather than two years). NIEHS has taken the lead to establisha major collaborative effort involving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the pharmaceutical and chemical manu-facturing industry, and two foreign governments (Japan and the Netherlands) tovalidate the four transgenic mouse models currently available for their capacity topredict carcinogenicity. The NCI is planning to augment its Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium to develop new experimental models that parallel human cancer related genes, path-ways and processes. The use of model systems, particularly the mouse with its pow-erful genetics, will elucidate the genetic basis of the etiology of cancer. The NIEHSis establishing Comparative Mouse Genomic Centers which will focus on developing mouse models for studying the biological function of variants of DNA repair andcontrol genes, found in the human population. Having identified relevant genes inthe mouse, we can then assess whether the comparable human genes contribute tothe cause of human cancer. Manipulating the genetics of the mouse experimentallywill enable us to decipher not just the major genetic risk factors, but also thosewhose effects on risk are more subtle. To find these same less penetrant genetic ef-fectors in human populations will require much more time and the accumulation ofvery large populations. Transgenic mice also afford the opportunity to test the con-tributions of nutrients and endogenous and exogenous environmental factors in can-cer etiology. Question. Isn't it well established that cancer can develop from the interaction of genes and the environment (broadly defined)? Answer. The importance of lifestyle and other environmental exposures as causes of cancer is unquestionable. The pivotal role of environment is reflected in the sub-stantial variation in cancer incidence around the world and in the changes in riskobserved among groups that migrate and become acculturated in a new host coun-try. Furthermore, epidemiologic research has succeeded in identifying a wide rangeof factors that affect cancer risk, including tobacco use, dietary components, sun-light, ionizing radiation, environmental chemicals, infectious agents, obesity, exer-cise, and hormones. Nevertheless, the causes of many cancers remain elusive. Whileimproved approaches to measuring exposures will provide new insights, it is clearthat the environment represents only part of the equation in determining who issusceptible to cancer. It is also important to understand cancer susceptibility. Forexample, why does one person with a cancer-causing exposure (such as smoking orinfection with human papillomavirus) develop cancer while another does not? Viewing such questions through the lens of genetics promises to provide insights into these apparent paradoxes. The scientific investment in cancer genetics, initially98 focused on the intensive study of rare cancer-prone families, already has paid huge dividends. These studies have opened a unique window into the basic mechanismsof cancer, with benefits extending well beyond the rare families from which theywere derived. This is because the genes identified by these studies are altered formsof normal genes involved in key biochemical pathways controlling fundamental cellprocesses. It has become clear that these same pathways contribute to the develop-ment and progression of the more common, non-hereditary forms of cancer. Despiteevidence that one 's genetic makeup may influence susceptibility or even resistance to cancer-causing exposures, only recently have the tools become available to sys-tematically determine how variations in these genes combine with environmentaland other factors to induce cancer in the general population. Question. What is the right balance? Answer. It is difficult to answer since NIH is striving to understand the causes of cancer through a comprehensive evaluation of genetic and environmental deter-minants as well as their interactions. In particular, by incorporating recent majoradvances in molecular genetics into epidemiologic studies, it will be possible to gainnot only insight into genetic susceptibility but also a more complete understandingof the specific lifestyle and other environmental exposures that are mediatedthrough genetic pathways and affect the risk of developing cancer. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR BENNIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL HEALTH STATUS OF AMERICAN INDIANS Question. It is my understanding that you have made statements regarding your support of efforts to improve the health status of American Indians and Alaskan Na-tives and that one of your most recent public statements was made last July to anumber of tribal leaders here in Washington. Could you clarify what role you seethe Department of Health and Human Services, outside of the Indian Health Serv-ice, taking in these efforts? Answer. A major goal of both the Department and the Administration is the elimi- nation of racial disparities in health outcomes. Accomplishing this goal will requiresubstantial improvements in health outcomes for Native Americans who suffer agreater disease burden than other Americans. The Indian Health Service has pri-mary responsibility for improving Native American health outcomes but many otherparts of HHS also have a role to play. For example, the Health Care Financing Ad-ministration has worked to increase Medicare and Medicaid collections at IndianHealth Services facilities by 103 percent since 1995. The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,and the National Institutes of Health all collaborate with the Indian Health Serv-ices, assist Indian communities directly, and or conduct research into diseases andhealth conditions affecting Native Americans. While it is not a health Agency, theAdministration on Children and Families supports empowerment and economic de-velopment of Indian communities through programs such as Head Start, Child Care,Social and Economic Development Strategy grants, and support for Tribes runningtheir own TANF and Child Support Enforcement programs. To ensure that all parts of the Department play their part, we hosted our first annual Department-wide tribal budget consultation meeting last May. This annualmeeting is called for in our policy on Consultation with American Indian/Alaska Na-tive Tribes and Indian Organizations. Our second annual meeting is scheduled fornext April. Question. I have heard that it was a Department view that Indian health issues were the responsibility of the Indian Health Service. Can you tell me how you ex-pect a direct health service organization to research the causes of disease among In-dian people or to test new prevention efforts for Indian people when, by all accounts,it cannot even fund the services necessary to treat existing health problems thatoccur in American Indian and Alaskan Native people? Answer. The Indian Health Service has primary responsibility for improving the health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives but many other parts of HHSalso have a role to play. The Indian Health Service has demonstrated its ability tomake significant improvements in Indian health, for example reducing maternaland infant mortality by more than two thirds since the early 1970s. In order to con-tinue these improvements, we have requested a ten percent increase for the IndianHealth Service, the largest requested increase for this Agency in over two decades.The total amount request for all Health and Human Service programs targeted toAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives is $3.05 billion, an increase of eleven percent99 over fiscal year 2000. The request for the Administration for Native Americans is also the largest increase requested for that Agency in over two decades. The Grants for Special Diabetes Program for Indians offers a good example of the work done by other HHS Agencies to assist the Indian Health Service. The Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention works with this program to ascertain the epide-miology of diabetes, provide technical assistance to tribal Diabetes Program grant-ees and helps to establish partnerships between grantees and State Diabetes Con-trol Programs. Much of our information about type two diabetes and its impact ofon Indian communities comes from ongoing cooperative studies between the Pimatribe and the National Institutes of Health. The National Institutes of Health andthe Indian Health Services are cosponsors of a national multi-center study to deter- mine if type two diabetes can be prevented in those at high risk for the disease.Volunteers from four Indian communities are participating in this study. Question. Aren 't there agencies located within the Department of Health and Human Services which specifically research the causes of disease and test preven-tion efforts that would be better able to handle those activities? Answer. The Indian Health Service was created to carry-out the Federal Govern- ment 's commitment to deliver health services to Federally recognized American In- dians and Alaska Natives. It has demonstrated its ability to make significant im-provements in Indian health, for example reducing maternal and infant mortalityby more than two thirds since the early 1970s. Other HHS Agencies address thehealth care needs of all Americans but they do so by focusing on differing areas:research at the National Institutes of Health, mental health and substance abuseat the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, disease controland prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each of theseagencies addresses the health care needs of Indian people as part of its overall mis-sion and each assists the Indian Health Service in its delivery of health services toFederally recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives. For example researchat the National Institutes of Health has provided much of our information abouttype two diabetes and its impact of on Indian communities. The National Institutesof Health and the Indian Health Services are cosponsors of a national multi-centerstudy to determine if type two diabetes can be prevented in those at high risk forthe disease. Volunteers from four Indian communities are participating in thisstudy. In addition to its work on diabetes, the National Institutes of Health supportsthe study of other disease in Indian populations such as asthma and lung cancer.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established the National Diabe-tes Prevention Center to address the epidemic of diabetes in Indian country, workswith tribes and tribal organizations to reduce breast and cervical cancer mortalityand is conducting studies to better control several Indian health problems includingHantavirus, Hepatitis A and Pneumococcal infections. The Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration provides funds to tribes and tribal organiza-tions to plan and evaluate systems of mental health care, prevent substance abuse,work with high risk youth, and provide substance abuse treatment services. HANTAVIRUS Question. I recently picked up the Washington Post and read a story alleging that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had diverted millions of dollars offunds slated for hantavirus research to other work. I know that several of my col-leagues are concerned about the way CDC officials handled the original hantavirusoutbreak, and now we hear that the same agency has been diverting millions of dol-lars of money it has claimed was used on hantavirus research, contrary to Congres-sional reports. Have you been able to determine exactly how much was divertedform the hantavirus research program? Answer. CDC made a mistake by not informing Congress of the need to use some of the hantavirus funding for other deadly infectious diseases, including ebola, lassafever and Nipah virus. We have commissioned an external firm,PriceWaterhouseCoopers, to conduct an audit to determine specifically how thehantavirus funds were spent in fiscal year 1999. In the fiscal year 2001 Congres-sional Justification, CDC has proposed changes related to the hantavirus line tomore accurately reflect that these resources will be used for hantavirus and otherspecial pathogens. In order to prevent such a situation from reoccurring, we have established the fol- lowing corrective action plan: \u2014The Department 's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) will review and certify, along with CDC 's Financial Management Office (FMO), the correctness of all of the National Center for Infectious Diseases ' (NCID) financial obligations through the remainder of fiscal year 2000.100 \u2014The Department 's CFO will ensure that all senior decision-makers in the NCID will receive certified budget execution and financial management training. \u2014CDC has initiated an external review of their fiscal management practices, similar to the review done at NIH, to be completed in six months. The resultsof this analysis will be communicated to Congress as soon as the review is com-plete. \u2014CDC program managers will conduct a top to bottom review of CDC 's 133 pro- grams and projects to make sure there are no other areas of concern. Duringa 90-day period, CDC managers will be able to fully and openly identify anyarea for which there may be a discrepancy between actual expenditures and theinformation provided to Congress. This information will be reported to Con-gress. \u2014CDC has commissioned Price Waterhouse Coopers, a firm of independent audi- tors, to thoroughly examine its hantavirus expenditures. The results will becommunicated to Congress immediately upon completion. \u2014CDC has appointed a new Acting Director for the Division of Viral and Rickett- sial Diseases while CDC seeks new leadership for its ' viral disease programs. INDIAN HEALTH RESEARCH Question. The President 's request unveiled an initiative to improve the lot of the ''First Americans ''. Yet at least one proposed program in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which would specifically fund research benefitting American Indians/Alaskan Natives, originally proposed as $40 million program, was firstslashed by 75 percent, then zeroed out as the budget process played out. Can youexplain why this program was such a low priority considering this ambitious ''initia- tive? '' Answer. Our fiscal year 2001 request includes significant budget increases, six percent for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ten percent for theIndian Health Service. While a separate grant program for Tribes was not includedin CDC, funding is requested for similar activities in both the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention and the Indian Health Service. Our request for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes $35 mil- lion for Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health to support communitydemonstrations to eliminate health disparities. Of the 32 grantees who receivedfunding to plan these demonstration, one was an Indian Tribe and two others fo-cused on health disparities of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Our $35 mil-lion request also includes an increase of $1.5 million to fund eight to ten Core Ca-pacity Grants for American Indian and Alaska Native organizations. The Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention is also working with tribes and tribal organiza-tions to address diseases such as diabetes and breast and cervical cancer. Our request for the Indian Health Service, the largest requested increase in over two decades, includes $230 million in total additional funding to increase access tohealth care and reduce the gap in health disparities. Included in this total increaseis $11.5 million for Preventive Health activities, including Public Health Nursing,Health Education, and tribal Community Health Representatives; $41 million to in-crease purchase of health care from the private sector, $40 million to provided con-tract support costs for tribes operating their own health programs, and $3 millionfor grants to improve the basic public health infrastructure of tribes enabling themto conduct effective community based injury prevention programs. Grants would beprovided to approximately 25 tribes. INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE BUDGET Question. Did you consult with Tribes or Tribal representatives in the develop- ment of the Department of Health and Human Services budget, outside of the In-dian Health Service? Did you consult with Tribes or Tribal representatives regard-ing the budget of the NIH or the CDC? Who did you consult with and what wasthe extent of your consultation? Answer. In August of 1997, HHS issued its first Department-wide policy on con- sultation with American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and Indian organizations.Under this policy, each Operating Division-including the Indian Health Service-de-velops its own tribal consultation plan. Budget matters are generally considered tobe critical for consultation. In May of 1999, HHS held its first Department-wide tribal budget consultation meeting prior to developing its fiscal year 2001 budget submission. Leaders from 35tribes and tribal organizations met with members of the HHS Budget Review Boardmaking recommendations covering the entire Department. This coming April, wewill hold our second Department-wide tribal budget consultation meeting to consider101 the fiscal year 2002 budget submission. As part of our consultation process, the Dep- uty Secretary has held a series of five regional meetings with tribal leaders overthe past year. INDIAN HEALTH RESEARCH Question. I see in your budget justification that there are a number of specific re- search initiatives for racial and ethnic groups, but I did not see any that were di-rected only toward a single American Indian or Alaskan Natives health issue. Forexample, there is a cancer research effort at the University of Hawaii which focuseson the high cancer incidence among Native Hawaiians, and a study of the excessiveprevalence of high blood pressure among African Americans. Yet I did not comeacross a single initiative that targets a disease that uniquely affects American Indi-ans. Can you explain? Answer. In general, the Department does not request funds for initiatives tar- geting diseases which affect particular racial and ethnic groups. One exception, ofcourse is the $230 million increase we have requested for the Indian Health Serviceto improve the health of Federally recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives.While funding in our other health agencies is not specifically requested for diseasesuniquely affecting American Indians, these agencies do carry-out specific activitieswhich improve the health of Native Americans. For example research at the Na-tional Institutes of Health has provided much of our information about type two dia-betes and its impact on Indian communities. In addition to its work on diabetes,the National Institutes of Health supports the study of other disease in Indian popu-lations such as asthma and lung cancer. In fiscal year 2000, NIH estimates it willspend a total of $98 million on research into diseases and health conditions affectingAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion is also addressing a number of diseases as they affect Indian people includingdiabetes, breast and cervical cancer, Hantavirus, Hepatitis A and Pneumococcal in-fections. In fiscal year 1999, CDC spent about $21 million for American Indians andAlaska Natives. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrationprovides funds to tribes and tribal organizations to plan and evaluate systems ofmental health care, prevent substance abuse, work with high risk youth, and pro-vide substance abuse treatment services. In fiscal year 2000, the Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administrations estimates it will provide a total of $64million for American Indians and Alaska Natives. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR PETEV. D OMENICI NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH /DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY PARTNERSHIP Secretary Shalala, as you are aware the fiscal year 2000 Labor-HHS Appropria- tions Bill contained a provision urging the Director of NIH to establish a pilot pro-gram to ensure the National Institutes of Health may benefit from technologies de-veloped within the Department of Energy weapons programs in terms of their po-tential to enhance health sciences and improve medical care. The Pilot seeks to en-sure that technologies developed within the nuclear weapons program, as well asother programs, of the Department of Energy are carefully evaluated for their im-pact on the health sciences, with the goal of achieving clinical applications and im-proved national health care. Question. What is the status of the NIH/DOE Medical Technology Partnerships? Answer. NIH is evaluating the adequacy of current interagency collaborations and the applicability of DOE laboratory technical resources and capabilities to improvinghuman health and quality of life. In the area of biomedical engineering, the NIHresearch institutes and centers have been made aware of DOE laboratory capabili-ties and biomedical research programs to through the Bioengineering Consortium(BECON) of which DOE has been a member since 1997. A meeting was held on Jan-uary 18, 2000, between the staff of the NIH Office of Extramural Research and rep-resentatives of the DOE 's Office of Science to discuss specific areas of interagency cooperation in bioengineering research and training. Possible joint research fundinginitiatives were identified and are being pursued. Potential interagency training andpersonnel sharing opportunities were discussed, as were ways for DOE staff to be-come more familiar with and involved in NIH research programs. With regard tothe weapons laboratories, a meeting of NIH Office of Extramural Research staff,NIH research institute staff, key DOE weapons laboratory technical representatives,and DOE Headquarters personnel was held on February 24, 2000, to identify areasof potential collaboration and ways to facilitate more effective interaction.102 At the upcoming April 19, 2000, BECON meeting, DOE 's Office of Science will make a presentation to NIH staff to provide further information on DOE 's labora- tory biomedical technology capabilities within its bioengineering program. NIH staffwill also be attending and participating in the DOE Bioengineering Contractor 's Meeting scheduled for May 16 -18, 2000, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Based on the results of these meetings and current NIH/DOE collaborative efforts, an evaluationwill be made of the need for a formal interagency partnership and appropriate fol-low-up actions initiated. Question. What other steps are being taken by NIH to ensure that technologies being developed by other Federal agencies are identified for possible medical/re-search applications? Answer. Since 1997, the NIH 's Bioengineering Consortium (BECON) has provided a link with other Federal agencies in areas associated with applications of engineer-ing/physical science technologies and principles to biomedicine. To ensure that tech-nologies developed by other Federal agencies are identified for possible medical ap-plications, BECON actively facilitates interagency communication, sponsors bio-engineering symposia, and coordinates NIH participation in interagency bio-engineering initiatives. To directly communicate biomedical research progress anddirections to NIH staff, other Federal agencies (e.g., DARPA, NSF, and DOE) areinvited to provide presentations during the regular monthly BECON meetings whichare open to the public. BECON also coordinates NIH participation in interagencybiomedical initiatives such as the Interagency Working Group on Nanotechnology(IWGN), the Multi-Agency Tissue Engineering Science (MATES) Working Group,and the Bioengineering Materials and Applications (BEMA) Roundtable. Informa-tion on these types of activities is shared with BECON members during regularmonthly meetings. To afford engineering and physical science researchers at all Fed-eral agencies opportunities to make the biomedical community aware of technologiesthat could have possible biomedical applications, BECON sponsors major annualbioengineering symposia that are open to all interested participants. Finally, theBECON has developed and maintains a Web site aimed at providing informationon all aspects of biomedical engineering (including technology development) to thegeneral public, scientific community, and Consortium members. DIABETES Question. Diabetes contributes to approximately 200,000 deaths each year and is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputations. The dis-ease costs the nation $105 billion annually in direct and indirect costs. Today CDCoperates only 16 comprehensive diabetes programs. Does CDC have any plan to ex-pand this program in a phased fashion to all 50 States? What will in take in yourprofessional judgment to reach all 50 States? Answer. The overall financial constraints in the fiscal year 2001 budget forced many hard choices in public health and other programs. One of those hard choiceswas whether to increase the number of comprehensive diabetes programs, or fundother pressing needs. CDC currently provides funding for diabetes programs in 50States; 16 comprehensive programs with average funding of $800,000 each, and 34capacity-building programs. CDC also carries out a wide range of surveillance, ap-plied research, and public education activities that are essential in making its part-nership with the States effective. The $51 million requested in the budget will en-able CDC to continue making significant progress in reducing the burden of diabe-tes. CDC has estimated that, absent competing needs in CDC and other agencies,its diabetes program could make good use of up to about twice that amount. NIH BUDGET Question. In recent years, NIH has recommended to Congress allocations that generally spread the funding increase evenly among institutes. This method of fund-ing causes smaller institutes that also have viable research opportunities to lack thenecessary monies to fund important research. Do you think that across-the-boardpercentage allocations every year adequately fund all new scientific opportunities?How about funding new scientific opportunities in those institutes who receive les-sor funding? How do automatic across-the-board percentage allocations really reflectnew discoveries? Answer. This is a time of great productivity in the biological sciences. Many fields of medical research deserve increased financial support and could move faster with more funds. However, historical factors and the level of research funds already com-mitted to grant recipients leave a relatively small fraction of each year 's appropria- tion that can effect changes in funding policies. Since resources are not infinite, pro-103 viding considerable funds to a particular area of emphasis limits what is available to others. Allocations to the Institutes and Centers do vary to reflect many factors and con- sultations. Decisions that affect resource allocation or priorities at the NIH, includ-ing distribution of funds among the ICs; how much to devote to a certain discipline,disease, or grant mechanism; or which applicants to fund are influenced by severalfactors: \u2014An obligation to respond to public health needs, as judged by the incidence, se- verity, and cost of specific disorders. However, calculations of public healthneeds are difficult, and the results cannot be correlated with research spendingin a simple manner. \u2014A commitment to support work of the highest scientific caliber. A basic tenet of our stewardship is the pledge to maximize the return on the public 's invest- ment in research; to do this, we demand that all requests for support pass strin-gent peer review in regard to scientific quality. \u2014A responsibility to seize the scientific opportunities that offer the best prospects to develop new knowledge and lead to better health. As administrators ofscience, we have learned that the most significant and rapid advances are likelyto occur when new findings, often serendipitous, lead to expansion of other re-search opportunities. \u2014A need to maintain a diverse portfolio that supports work in many scientific dis- ciplines and on a wide range of diseases. Because we cannot know when majordiscoveries will occur and what opportunities they will create, it is importantto support ongoing research across a broad frontier. \u2014An obligation to insure a strong scientific infrastructure, with a high quality workforce and excellent research facilities. Productive science cannot be donewithout well-trained investigators and modern equipment and laboratories. NIH BUDGET Question. Dr. Varmus was very fond of saying ''research in one area would lead to discoveries in other areas. '' How, then, are these promising areas being applied to those diseases that receive less funding? Answer. Research probes and seeks to understand the unknown. The scientific in- sights that provide a basis for solutions usually accumulate over many years, andoften are derived from the efforts of investigators from diverse disciplines with ex-pertise in specific areas of science working on and communicating about differingfacets of a problem. Medical discovery is marked by stops and starts, and a vitalinterplay among theories or questions (hypotheses), experimental evidence, and clin-ical observations. It is very hard \u2014if not impossible \u2014to predict the next discovery or to anticipate what advancement in prevention, treatment or diagnosis of one dis-ease will be applicable to new knowledge about another, seemingly unrelated, dis-ease. NIH's medical research program is a diverse and continually evolving portfolio that reflects the agency 's obligation to respond to public health needs, commitment to supporting research of the highest scientific caliber, and judgment as to the sci-entific opportunities that offer the best prospects for gaining new knowledge andbetter health. Sometimes scientists, when exploring the fundamental mysteries ofthe cell, know at the outset of their research that its findings will be applicable tounderstanding many diseases. For example, scientists hard at work determining thestructure and electrochemical properties of a specialized pore, called the potassiumchannel, that helps regulate heart rhythm know that this information will be usedin physiologic investigations of potassium channels, which are critical for many bod-ily functions, besides regulating the heartbeat, such as nerve signaling, digestion,and insulin release. A better understanding of potassium channels may help sci-entists develop drugs to treat diseases ranging form heart ailments to diabetes toepilepsy. However, despite our best efforts to ascribe or assign research to a particular dis- ease or condition, the serendipitous nature of science makes it hard to predict, withany real certainty, just which diseases will benefit from a particular line of inves-tigation. Although different disease processes vary in their nature and complexity,they often have some commonalities. The progress made in understanding one dis-ease often yields new ways of thinking about the etiology of another, seemingly un-related, disease. Thus, new knowledge gained from one line of research may helpre-frame or re-focus the entire approach being used to solve the most perplexingproblems associated with understanding a totally different disease. For example,cancer is a disease which has its origin in the function, or malfunction, of the mostfundamental process, cell division, and the enzymes that affect the process. New104 knowledge about the function of enzymes in cancer cells can have and indeed, has had a profound effect on scientists ' understanding of other diseases that may also have their origins in similar enzyme malfunctions, such as inherited metabolic dis-eases. Similarly, new information about how some osteoporosis drugs forosteoporosis preserve the integrity of bones, have suggested that these same drugsmight be useful in reducing the spread or metastasis of prostate and colon cancersto bone. A surprising example of this kind of cross-fertilization started in the area of car- diovascular disease. Years of research focused on the formation of new blood vesselsas a means of improving circulation in patients with atherosclerosis (hardening ofthe arteries). Researchers now have taken this knowledge and applied it to a totallydifferent goal \u2014if we knew how to promote the formation of new blood vessels, could we block their formation? And would this not impede the growth of tumor cells,which, like all living cells need a blood supply to survive and grow. This effect, thenset cardiovascular researchers to look at the role of blood vessel formation. Theyfound that such formation promoted the development of plaques that blocked theflow of blood. This intersection of scientific discoveries has now set researchers ona course to identify ways to block this effect and to develop new therapies for im-proving circulatory diseases. These stories are not unique in the annals of innova-tion and scientific discovery. In addition to basic research yielding discoveries that can be applied in many dif- ferent areas, discoveries from research in one specific disease area often prove tobe related to other diseases. For example, AIDS research is unraveling the mys-teries surrounding many other infectious, malignant, neurologic, autoimmune, andmetabolic diseases. AIDS research has provided an entirely new way to design drugsand to treat viral infections. The development of the new ''flu'' drug, RelenzaTm (zanamivir), which directly benefitted from AIDS research. Another drug developedto treat AIDS is now the most effective therapy for chronic hepatitis B infection.Drugs developed to prevent and treat AIDS-associated opportunistic infections alsoprovide benefit to patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy or receiving therapy toprevent rejection of transplants. AIDS research also is providing new understandingof the relationship between viruses and cancer. One line of investigation often yields several potential and unpredicted new uses, which can be applied to the treatment or prevention of more than one disease. Thus,because scientific findings cross disease lines, so does the distinction or attributionof research investment and discovery cross Institute and Center lines. Question. Don't automatic across-the-board increases for every institute each year actually pit one disease against another? By allowing large institutes to grow at thesame rate as small institutes, aren 't you actually ignoring many potential scientific opportunities in the smaller ones? Doesn 't this prevent NIH from following their own stated research funding criteria meant to identify areas of greatest need and greatest potential? Answer. Decisions that affect resource allocation or priorities at the NIH, includ- ing the distribution of funds among the ICs; how much to devote to a certain dis-cipline, disease, or grant mechanism; or which applicants to fund are influenced bythe numerous factors outlined above. Advice is solicited from and provided by alarge number of individuals and groups, including the members of the scientificcommunity, Advisory Councils, patient advocacy groups, Congress, the Administra-tion, and NIH staff. Each Institute and Center (IC) convenes meetings of its na-tional advisory council or board, composed of members from the public, medical, andscientific communities, to review a broad range of policies. Scientific opportunitiesarise with the advent of new technology and new discoveries in various diseases.As these discoveries are made, areas of greatest need and greatest potential areprioritized based on scientific opportunity and the financial resources that can beallotted to the study of these diseases so as to ensure that outstanding science isbeing funded and that such studies are aimed at obtaining results. Question. Given that CDC has called diabetes ''the epidemic of our time, '' do you think NIH devotes adequate funds to research this serious disease? If so, why? Ifnot what can be done to increase the diabetes research portfolio at NIH? Answer. The President 's fiscal year 2001 Budget Request for diabetes research across the NIH is $561 million. The NIH are implementing many of the new andexpanded initiatives in response to the scientific recommendations of the DRWG.However, there are scientific opportunities in diabetes-and indeed in most areas ofresearch \u2014that the NIH will not be able to pursue as rapidly or as fully as it might wish, given the NIH budgetary framework and our responsibility to support an over-all national biomedical research agenda that addresses the many diseases afflictingAmericans.105 QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR KAYBAILEY HUTCHISON Question. Madam Secretary, recently, there was an editorial in the Houston Chronicle by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Norman Borlaug, known as ''the Father of the Green Revolution '' on the benefits of agricultural biotechnology. A growing number of scientists and agriculture producers in Texas and throughout the world are real-izing the tremendous potential of biotechnology in agriculture to feed a growing pop-ulation with better environmental outcomes. In Texas, for example, over 60 percentof cotton grown in the Texas Panhandle is already enhanced by modern bio-technology. What measures are you and your Department taking to support, foster,and encourage this promising new technology? Answer. As you know, FDA has authority over the safety of nearly all domestic and imported foods and food products in interstate commerce, including bioengi-neered foods. One of the most important roles of this Agency in supporting this tech-nology is to ensure that the bioengineered foods that enter the marketplace are assafe as the traditionally developed products in our grocery stores, and that suchfoods undergo appropriate safety testing prior to marketing. We are confident thatthe bioengineered foods that have reached the U.S. market to date meet the stand-ards of safety that apply to other food products. In the fall of 1999, FDA announced an initiative to engage the public about foods made using bioengineering, and held a series of public meetings in November andDecember. One of the purposes of those meetings was to inform participants aboutFDA 's policy and processes for ensuring the safety of bioengineered foods. FDA per- sonnel shared the Agency 's experience over the past five years in reviewing safety and nutritional assessments conducted on foods from more than 40 bioengineeredplant varieties. FDA also solicited information from participants and the public re-garding whether FDA 's policy or procedures should be modified and also solicited comments on appropriate means of providing information to the public about bio-engineered products in the food supply. During those public meetings, we did not hear any evidence of food safety con- cerns about the products that have been marketed thus far, although some partici-pants expressed concerns about potential safety issues with products that may beincluded in the next generation of bioengineered foods. Other participants suggestedways in which FDA could better inform the public about its processes and proce-dures. FDA is currently reviewing comments received in response to the publicmeetings and the agency 's call for information. When we have completed that re- view, the agency will be in a position to develop and implement strategies for itsbiotechnology program and to articulate its plans for next steps. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR HERBKOHL Question. Why does the Administration fail to require background checks for all long-term care workers? Answer. The Administration has proposed a system of abuse registry and criminal background checks for nursing home workers. Our provider agreements make thesefacilities clearly identifiable, our statutory and regulatory authority and annual sur-veys provide the means for monitoring and enforcing the proposed new require-ments, and existing State nurse aide registries can provide information for the pro-posed national abuse registry. Our proposed system would include developing thenational abuse registry, adding FBI background checks, and creating a new capacityin each State to screen and report FBI data to nursing homes. Even with start upfunding and user fees, it would take some time for these systems to develop the abil-ity to promptly respond to background checks from the nation 's 17,000 nursing homes. For these reasons, it seems prudent to begin efforts on criminal backgroundchecks for long term care workers with nursing home staff. HCFA also has regulatory and survey authority for home health agencies, hos- pices, and ICFs/MR. Once we have developed the systems and experience to handlebackground checks for nursing home employees, we would be in a better positionto assess whether and how to expand such checks to these other three long termcare settings that we do not regulate or survey. It would be problematic and to effec-tively enforce employee background check requirements in these other settings. Question. As it appears in the HHS budget, it seems that the Administration 's background check proposal will be funded by user fees within both HHS and DoJ.Unfortunately, there are few details about how these two agencies would coordinatetheir systems so that facilities can have one-stop shopping. Could you please elabo-rate on how you envision this system working? Do you have estimates on how muchthis would cost nursing homes annually?106 Answer. For purposes of developing the President 's budget, HCFA assumed that the background checks would be a two step process. First, a nursing home wouldrequest a query of the national abuse registry. If a report comes back that the pro-spective employee has a history of abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of residentproperty, the process would end there with the individual disqualified from employ-ment with the nursing home. We estimate that nursing homes would pay HHSabout $4 per query for a total of about $4.3 million for this portion of the back-ground check in the first year of implementation. If the abuse registry check produces no disqualifying information, the nursing home would proceed to the second step, a criminal background check request. Thenursing home would obtain finger prints and other information from the prospectiveemployee and forward them to a designated agency in their State. From that point,the designated State agency would serve as the ''one-stop shop, '' collecting an addi- tional fee from the nursing home for the remainder of background checks. The des-ignated State agency would forward the finger prints and other information to ap-propriate law enforcement authorities in the State and in the FBI to conduct Stateand national criminal background checks. The designated State agency also wouldreceive the State and FBI data it receives to identify any disqualifying information,report the results back to the nursing home, and handle disputes by prospective em-ployees of the accuracy and relevance of disqualifying information. We estimate thatthe second, criminal background check phase of the process would cost nursinghomes about $70 per check or about $41.1 million in the first year, with the des-ignated State agency forwarding the appropriate portions of the fee to the FBI andState law enforcement agency. The first step in the development of this system will be to determine the most effective and cost efficient methods for implementing a national abuse registry.HCFA plans to conduct such a study to include an assessment of current processesused by States and providers. We will be examining ways to create a ''one-step shop '' where all information could be accessed. The information from the study will feedinto the ultimate implementation of the proposal. Question. As you know, I have worked hard for the past several years to boost funding for nursing home inspections under the Survey and Certification program.I realized that the Administration continues to work hard on the Nursing Home Ini-tiative to improve the quality and safety of nursing home residents. This year,you've asked for $234 million for Survey and Certification, but you 've again assumed $63 million that would come from user fees, which Congress has declined to enactin the past. Assuming that trend continues, will the Administration still support thefull $234 million and find money in the budget to pay for it? Answer. The Administration strongly supports the need for the full $234.1 million amount for the State Survey and Certification program. User fees have been pro-posed the past three years as a means of reducing pressure due to Government-widediscretionary funding limitations. If enacted as proposed, the user fee would reduceHCFA 's $234.1 million appropriation request by $63 million, to a total of $171.1 mil- lion in fiscal year 2001. Should Congress decide to not enact the user fee proposal,the Administration request the entire $234.1 million in appropriated funds to sup-port State Survey & Certification activities. Question. Would the Clinton Administration support, and more importantly, ac- tively advocate for legislation to restore the SSBG 's funding and transfer levels? Answer. Under section 8401 of the Social Security Act, the authorization for the Social Services Block Grant was reduced to $1,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 andeach year thereafter. In addition, under that same section, the limitation on theamount transferable to Title XX was reduced to 4.25 percent in the case of fiscalyear 2001 and each succeeding fiscal year. The President 's Budget for fiscal year 2001 for the Social Services Block Grant includes a proposal to increase the amount provided to the Block from$1,700,000,000 to $1,775,000,000. It also is expected that states will use state fundsto help offset any impact that this change might cause. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER CLASS SIZE REDUCTION Question. Mr. Secretary, it is my understanding that the class size reduction funds are to be distributed to the neediest schools with the highest numbers of poorchildren. If the very purpose of the program is to help schools that are struggling107 to resolve overcrowding in poor districts, how do you expect these schools to meet the matching funds requirement? Answer. The Department does not believe that requiring local districts to provide a 35 percent match on any new Class Size Reduction funds they receive would beburdensome for most districts, and those districts that would have the greatest dif-ficulty in providing such a match would be exempt from the requirement. In addi-tion, a district would match only the amount above what it received in fiscal year1999. At the 2001 request level, for an average district, the amount of the matchwould be only about $15,700. We need to help poor schools and districts overcome the challenges they face in preparing their students to meet high standards. Research has demonstrated thebenefits of reducing class size in the early elementary grades, particularly for lower-achieving, minority, low-income, and inner-city students. Class Size Reduction fundsenable districts to reduce class size, particularly in the early elementary grades, sothat teachers can provide students with more individualized attention, spend moretime on instruction, cover more material effectively, and provide students and par-ents with more detailed feedback on each child 's progress. The Department believes districts welcome Federal support to help them reduce class size in the early grades. Question. Further, how is the exemption for low-income school districts realistic when 80 percent of the formula grant relies on poverty data? Answer. All schools districts, not just districts that serve large numbers or per- centages of low-income students, are eligible to receive Class Size Reduction funds.We are proposing to exempt only those districts in which at least 50 percent of thestudents they serve are from low-income households. We estimate that, after ex-empting the highest-poverty districts, the average national match provided by localdistricts would equal 30 percent of the Federal appropriation. FLEXIBILITY IN CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PROGRAM Question. Given the diversity of needs that different school districts have through- out the country \u2014whether it is costs related to special education, books, or computer technology investments \u2014what is the disadvantage of using class size funds to ad- dress the most pressing demands identified by local school districts? Answer. I believe that the strong, demonstrated benefits of reduced class size in the early elementary grades justify making such an effort a national priority. Stu-dents who receive instruction in small classes make more rapid educational progressthan their counterparts in larger classes. This is particularly true for lower-achiev-ing, minority, poor, and inner-city children. Under the appropriations language and our proposal for authorizing the Class Size Reduction program as Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Actof 1965, districts that have met the target level in grades 1 through 3 may use theirfunds to further reduce class size in those grades, to reduce class size in additionalgrades, or to improve teacher quality. Also, States that can demonstrate conditionsin certain districts that would make achieving the goal of 18 students per classroomin the targeted grades a hardship, such as a lack of facilities or a shortage of quali-fied teachers, can apply to the Department for a waiver from some of the programprovisions. SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION Question. According to the 1999 School Planning and Management Construction Report, public school districts completed more than $15 billion worth of constructionin fiscal year 1998, an increase of almost $3 billion over the fiscal year 1997 level.The latest figures indicate that almost $18 billion worth of construction was com-pleted in fiscal year 1999 and districts are starting $23 billion in fiscal year 2000,resulting in roughly $70 billion of construction completed/planned in the last 4years. To support its $26.1 billion proposal, the Administration cites a GAO studythat estimated $112 billion was needed to bring schools into good condition. Mr. Secretary, given the tremendous progress being made and the fact that you have stated that the Federal Government is a junior partner in the area of edu-cation, please justify the Administration 's proposal to assume a significant Federal role within a State and local responsibility? Answer. School construction is, and will remain, primarily a State and local re- sponsibility under the Administration 's school construction proposal. The vast ma- jority of school facility needs will continue to be met with non-Federal resources,and decisions about school construction plans will continue to rest with State andlocal governments. However, some States and communities are not, on their own,able to meet the burden of providing adequate school facilities for all students, andthe poorest communities have had the greatest difficulty meeting this need. The Ad-108 ministration 's proposal would provide financial assistance to school districts with substantial construction needs and a limited ability to meet those needs. We owe it to our children to improve the condition of schools in order to improve their academic achievement and promote their physical health. Students have dif-ficulty learning when they attend schools that are overcrowded, poorly lighted, ei-ther too hot or too cold, or unable to accommodate modern technology. In addition,students can be exposed to health hazards when they attend schools that are poorlyventilated or contain hazardous substances, such as lead paint and asbestos. While expenditures for school construction have increased over recent years as the economy has improved, we believe that the need persists for approximately $112 bil-lion to bring schools into adequate condition. Substantial school construction ex-penditures are necessary just to keep from slipping further behind as school facili-ties continue to depreciate and student enrollments swell. In addition, the increasein school construction funding has not likely been targeted to those communitieswith the greatest need for school construction funds. FEDERAL SHARE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS Question. Over the last 4 fiscal years, the annual increase requested by the Ad- ministration for the State grants program, under the Individuals with DisabilitiesEducation Act (IDEA), has averaged about 5 percent per year. For fiscal year 2001,the request is once again for about a 5 percent increase. Over the same period, Con-gress has increased funding by over 20 percent per year. Federal funds are used tohelp pay for the excess cost of providing special education and related services forchildren with disabilities ages 3 through 21. The Administration claims that theFederal contribution toward meeting the excess cost of special education is currently13 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. Given the financial burdens that the requirements of the Individuals with Disabil- ities Education Act (IDEA) place on States and school districts, why are you so re- luctant to substantially increase spending for this program? Answer. No State is required to participate in IDEA. However, the rights and pro- tections embedded in IDEA are fundamental civil rights that guarantee childrenwith disabilities access to equal educational opportunity. IDEA authorizes a maximum Federal contribution toward meeting the excess cost of special education of 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. Webelieve that the legislative history surrounding the enactment of Public Law 94 -142 in 1975, which served as the basis for the current IDEA, indicates that membersof Congress regarded the 40 percent as a goal, not a promise or commitment, andmembers acknowledged that the authorized amounts were not likely to be appro-priated. I support that goal. However, I also believe that the requested level of funding for Special Education Grants to States provides an appropriate level of supportgiven the fact that States have the primary responsibility for educating all children,including children with disabilities. Our budget for the Department is designed toaddress a broad range of needs and a number of national priorities. We believe thatour budget request for the Department reflects the best combination of programsand funding to address the needs of all children within our limited resources. Question. How do you respond to school officials and parents who say that the Federal Government is not meeting its financial obligation with respect to specialeducation? Answer. There is a tendency to view the IDEA Grants to States program as the Federal program for providing assistance to States in serving children with disabil-ities. In fact, there are many Federal programs that assist States in serving thesechildren, but they are not focused solely on children with disabilities. These pro-grams include programs such as 21st Century Community Learning Centers, whichprovide a safe environment and expanded learning opportunities for children beforeand after school; and the Class Size Reduction program, which helps school districtsimprove education in the early elementary grades by providing funds to hire highlyqualified teachers and reduce class size. Federal subsidies for school constructionbonds that will be used to repair, renovate, and construct schools will help ensurethat our school buildings enhance the teaching and learning of all children, includ-ing children with disabilities. The $290 million increase requested for Special Education Grants to States would maintain the Federal contribution toward meeting the excess cost of special edu-cation at 13 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure by providing morethan sufficient funds to offset the impact of inflation and the additional cost ex-pected to result from serving more children.109 TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS Question. Mr. Secretary, the President 's 2001 budget request includes $1.4 billion for teacher recruitment and professional development programs, double the amountprovided in fiscal year 2000, excluding the amount provided for the Class Size Re-duction Initiative. Most of these programs are scattered throughout the Departmentand are unauthorized. Furthermore, a 1999 GAO report found that over $1.5 billionin Federal funds is invested in professional development programs, which span 13agencies through 87 different programs. The report also stated that over 86 percentof the Department of Education 's funding was used for professional development purposes. Mr. Secretary, shouldn 't the bulk of education dollars be delivered to the student, especially those in the greatest need? Answer. The Administration believes that investing in high-quality professional development and teacher recruitment is one of the best ways to ensure that all stu-dents, including those most at risk of school failure, get the help they need to raisetheir academic performance. That is why the Administration 's 2001 budget request would increase funds for teacher recruitment and professional development pro-grams, including $1 billion for the Title II programs that are included in the Admin-istration 's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). We believe that these programs, in total, will help States and school dis-tricts ensure that all students are taught by fully qualified teachers who have thetraining they need to teach to challenging State and local content standards. Research indicates that high-quality professional development, especially when it is focused on academic content, can contribute to improvements in teachers ' skills and practice and thereby raise student achievement. The most recent evaluation re-port of the Eisenhower Professional Development State Grants program (1999) indi-cates that teachers believe professional development contributes the most to improv-ing their knowledge and skills if it: (1) is sustained over an extended period of time;(2) is connected to State and district standards and assessments; (3) emphasizesacademic content and the way students learn that content; (4) encourages teachersfrom the same grade levels, departments, and schools to work in teams; and (5) of-fers opportunities to observe and practice the teaching techniques being introduced.The Teaching to High Standards State Grants program, the Administration 's pro- posal to reauthorize Title II of the ESEA, would encourage school districts to imple-ment professional development with these characteristics, so that all students canbe better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In addition, provi-sions in our Teaching to High Standards proposal ensure that funds are targetedto those students who are most in need. The 1999 General Accounting Office (GAO) report, Teacher Training: Over $1.5 Billion Federal Funds Invested in Many Programs , found that, in various Federal agencies in fiscal year 1999, over $579 million was provided by programs that focusexclusively on teacher training and that about $933 million was provided by pro-grams that are designed to achieve purposes other than just teacher training butsupport a significant amount of teacher training. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ALL FEDERAL TEACHER TRAINING Finally, I want to clarify findings in the GAO report. The report did not find that over 86 percent of the Department of Education 's funding was used for professional development purposes. Rather, the report states that teacher training programs ad-ministered by the Department of Education accounted for over 86 percent of the$1.5 billion provided for teacher training programs across the Federal Governmentin fiscal year 1999. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND EARLY INTERVENTION ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP Question. How do these programs address one of the most important components of narrowing the achievement gap, which is early intervention? Answer. Early Childhood Educator Professional Development Grants, a new pro- gram proposed as part of the Administration 's ESEA reauthorization bill, would cre- ate high-quality professional development opportunities to improve the knowledgeand skills of early childhood educators and caregivers who work in communitieswith high concentrations of young children living in poverty. The program wouldpromote school readiness and better learning outcomes for those children by focus-ing on professional development designed to further their language and literacyskills before they enter school.110 The National Research Council report, Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children (1998), concluded that the majority of reading problems faced by today 's adolescents and adults could have been avoided or resolved in the early years ofchildhood. Reading problems more often occur in children from poor families withlittle education, and, as more of those children enter group care settings, ongoinghigh-quality professional development for their preschool teachers and caregivers isa key strategy in helping cultivate children 's literacy and language skills as a foun- dation for reading. The Cost, Quality and Child Outcomes report (June 1999), partially funded by the Department, concludes that children 's cognitive and social competence in the second grade can be predicted by the experiences they had 4 years previously in child care,even after taking into account kindergarten and first-grade classroom experiences.The report also found that children who have traditionally been at risk for not doingwell in school are more affected by the quality of childcare experiences than areother children. Many early childhood providers have little formal education beyondhigh school, and preschool and other group care settings for young children, in par-ticular those available to families with limited economic resources, often provide rel-atively impoverished language and literacy environments. The Department would concentrate on funding projects that provide professional development opportunities for early childhood educators and caregivers working inhigh-poverty communities, including staff working in Title I preschools, Head Start, Even Start, and public day care programs. IMPLEMENTATION OF TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS Question. Please explain how the Department of Education plans to, first, inform States and local educational agencies of all of these programs; and second, ensurethat both the Federal and State governments implement them efficiently and effec-tively. Answer. The Administration would provide information about these programs to States, school districts, and other eligible recipients through the channels that theDepartment has found to be most successful in disseminating information about ourprograms. For example, the Department would publish Federal Register noticesabout the availability of funds, provide information about the programs at con-ferences, such as the Department 's annual Improving America 's Schools Conference, place information about the programs on the Department 's web site and in print materials, sponsor outreach meetings to alert eligible applicants about opportunitiesto apply for funds, and carry out other networking strategies the Department typi-cally uses to alert the public about new programs. Strong accountability provisions in the Administration 's reauthorization proposal for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (SEA) will help ensure that theseprograms are implemented efficiently and effectively, while allowing States andschool districts the flexibility that they need to address local needs. For example,accountability provisions include requirements that grantees develop and report ontheir success against performance indicators as part of annual performance reports,and States would provide annual data about the number of teachers who are fullycertified or licensed and who are teaching in their main teaching field. EDUCATION FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH Question. Mr. Secretary, there are over 2 million incarcerated adults in the United States, the highest incarceration rate in the world; and, according to the Depart-ment of Justice 's most recent study, there were 106,000 juvenile offenders residing in correctional facilities in 1997. The National Adult Literacy Study indicates thatthe majority of prison inmates either are illiterate or have marginal reading, writ-ing, and math skills. Most of these adults will return to free society in 4 years, hav-ing received little to no education, which has proven to be the key to preventing re-cidivism. In light of these facts, can you justify the President 's request for a $2 million re- duction in the State grants to incarcerated youth offenders program, and the elimi-nation of the Literacy Programs for Prisoners? Answer. The President 's request for 2001 would continue support for the Youth Offenders program at the fiscal year 1999 appropriation level of $12 million, whichis also the amount the Administration requested in fiscal year 2000. The request,which is $2 million less than the amount provided in the fiscal year 2000 appropria-tions act, will provide States with a level that is consistent with the Department 's general policy of targeting funding increases to other priority initiatives. At the re-quested level, States would have enough funds to serve approximately 6,700 youth111 offenders. Through the program, States expect to improve academic and vocational achievement, increase participation in job placement programs, lower recidivismrates, and increase job retention among youth offenders. The Department requested no funds for Literacy Programs for Prisoners in 2001 because this program 's authorization ended with the enactment of the Adult Edu- cation and Family Literacy Act of 1998 (AEFLA). States may use up to 10 percentof their AEFLA local grant funds for programs for corrections education and servicesto institutionalized individuals. 12-MONTH WORKING YEAR FOR TEACHERS Question. Mr. Secretary, in your recent address to the Nation on the state of American education, you proposed that teachers work a full year to improve teacherquality and raise their pay. Can you tell me specifically what steps the Departmentwill take to establish this policy? Answer. The annual State of American Education address gives me the oppor- tunity to take a broad view of our education system and talk about both what isworking and where we might make some improvements. With the success of thestandards movement, one area we are really focused on now is improving teacherquality. Our proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Actand our fiscal year 2001 budget request contain a variety of measures to strengthenteaching in our schools. My call for elevating teaching to a year-round profession was not a proposal for a new Federal policy, but a suggestion that we need to look at the teaching profes-sion in a new way. We need to attract highly qualified individuals to the profession,in part through better pay, and provide a working environment that lets them useall their talent and skill to teach to the new high standards. I believe one way todo this is through longer contracts that would give teachers more time to plan thecurriculum and improve their teaching skills. States and school districts, of course, are responsible for setting standards for teacher quality and determining the length of teacher contracts. I am not proposingany Federal intrusion into this area. What I said in my address is that I believenow is the time to begin a national discussion about making teaching a better-paid,year-round profession, and that governors and school boards should give serious con-sideration to this idea. Question. Given the Federal role in education, how will these steps affect deci- sions that are made on the State and local levels? Answer. We are not taking any specific actions to promote making teaching a year-round profession, merely putting an idea out for discussion at the State andlocal levels. Question. Is this approach part of the Administration 's reauthorization proposal for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which the Senate intends to con-sider in the next couple of weeks? Answer. No. As mentioned above, we are not proposing any specific actions to pro- mote the idea, but simply putting it out for discussion. YOUTH VIOLENCE PREVENTION Question. Mr. Secretary, please provide your observations of the relationship be- tween movies, video games, and other related forms of youth entertainment andyouth violence? Answer. Each day, children are exposed to numerous examples of violence in the media \u2014either through television, video games, music, or the Internet. A 1999 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that on a typical day, childrenspend five hours and 29 minutes using the media. Children ages 8 to 18 spent al-most seven hours; 2- to 7-year-olds spent nearly three hours and 34 minutes. Themedia have been successful in perpetuating, and even glamorizing, various imagesof violence aimed toward children. Norms supporting and justifying violence areseen daily in music videos, movies, and television. Yet, despite the far-reaching in-fluence of the media and popular culture on children, there is little consensus re-garding the impact that the media have on youth violence. Several studies have re-lated violence in the media to actual violence by children, while other studies havediscounted the role and influence of the media on children, since the media are onlyone of several sources of violent messages in our society. However, what we do know is that more and more children are being exposed to violence in the media on a daily basis and that much of this exposure is unsuper-vised by parents. And while we cannot point to a direct relationship between vio-lence in the media and violence in children, we can assume that the images por-112 trayed in music and on the screen may contribute to, or reinforce, violent behavior and a lack of empathy for victims. While it may not be possible to eliminate violence in the media, as parents and educators we can teach children how to be wise consumers of the media and themessages portrayed. Media literacy training can be useful, especially for studentsin the younger grades. In addition it is important for parents to monitor their chil-dren 's exposure to the media. Parents need to know what types of movies, videos, television, and websites they are viewing, and what types of music lyrics they arehearing. I have asked, and continue to ask, the leaders in the entertainment industry and our expanding Internet industry to step back and think about their responsibilities.Do we really need these violent video games to excite our children in order to gaina profit? Is that extra violent scene in a movie really needed to make a point? Doesevery action hero need to wear a long black coat and carry a sawed-off shotgun?The prime audience for movies in America today is the impressionable teenager, andthe key word is impressionable. I urge Hollywood to help us raise our children rightby ending their fixation with violence. We need their vision and creativity to helpin the fight for our children 's future. So my message to the entertainment industry is clear and simple \u2014stop glamorizing the assassin and the killer and the use of guns. Stop listening to scriptwriters and start listening to parents. Stop listeningto advertisers and start listening to teachers. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR KAYBAILEY HUTCHISON VOLUNTARY SINGLE -SEX SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM PROGRAMS Question. Mr. Secretary, as you may know, I have proposed specifically author- izing the use of Federal education funds for public, single-sex school and classroom programs, as long as the existing Department requirement is met that students ofboth sexes receive comparable educational opportunities. My amendment has passedoverwhelmingly in the Senate, by a vote of 69 to 29. Do you believe that publicschools should be able to use Federal funds for voluntary single-sex education pro-grams, and if so, will you support my effort to include this amendment in reauthor-ization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act? Answer. The Department of Education is examining whether there is a legal basis for interpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et.seq.) to permit single sex classrooms and schools where they are justified on edu-cational grounds and do not involve stereotyping or stigmatizing students based ongender, and where equivalent educational opportunities are afforded to students ofboth sexes. These issues are sensitive and complex, including consideration of theconstitutional implications of any change, but we have made substantial progressin our review and hope to issue proposed regulations this spring. With regard to your specific question, we are very committed to exploring the per- missibility of single sex schools and classes in public schools, but believe that thisissue should be addressed under Title IX, and the answers should apply whetherFederal, State, or local funds are used for that purpose. Developing a separate civilrights standard for single sex schools or classrooms under ESEA would create confu-sion and would be inconsistent with the Civil Rights Restoration Act. I hope thatwhen we release our proposed regulation we will receive your comments. In themeantime, however, I cannot support your amendment because it defines the per-missibility of single sex education only within the context of ESEA. CIVILIAN -BASED ''TROOPS -TO-TEACHERS '' PROGRAM Question. Mr. Secretary, while I understand your desire to hire additional teach- ers and reduce class size, I have an alternative or perhaps complementary proposalthat I would like your reaction to and consideration of. I have introduced legislationto expand the very successful Troops to Teachers program and apply it to the civil-ian world, under the direction of your agency. Would you agree to consider this pro-posal, and wouldn 't you agree that this may be a tremendous opportunity to place highly qualified, successful individuals in our classrooms? Answer. I support expansion of the highly successful Troops to Teachers program as one strategy for helping to ensure that our Nation 's classrooms have highly quali- fied teachers who can help all students achieve to challenging academic standards.In addition to the Administration 's request of $1.75 billion for the Class Size Reduc- tion program, the Administration has also requested $1 billion for a variety of pro-grams to improve teacher quality, including teacher recruitment and retention.113 Transition to Teaching program One of these programs is the Transition to Teaching program, which would con- tinue the highly successful Troops to Teachers program and provide additionalfunds to recruit, prepare, and support a wide range of talented career-changing pro-fessionals \u2014such as engineers and scientists, corporate professionals, and returning Peace Corps volunteers \u2014as teachers, particularly in high-poverty school districts and high-need subject areas. Former members of the military services would con-tinue to be a key focus of the new program 's recruitment efforts. The Transition to Teaching program is included in the Administration 's proposal to revise and reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.Under the Administration 's legislative proposal, the Secretary, before awarding any grants or contracts, would consult with the Secretaries of Defense and Transpor-tation to determine how much funding is needed to continue the Troops to Teachersprogram. Once the Secretaries agree on an amount, the Secretary would transferthese funds to the Department of Defense. Recruiting teachers for high-poverty areas With the remaining funds, the Secretary would award grants or contracts to insti- tutions of higher education, public agencies, and nonprofit organizations to recruit,prepare, place, and support mid-career professionals for teaching positions in high-poverty school districts. Allowable activities would include post-placement inductionprograms to support new teachers once they begin teaching, through mentoring andother activities that build upon their teacher preparation training. Grantees could use program funds to provide each program participant with up to $5,000 in training stipends and other financial incentives, including moving ex-penses. Participants who complete training would teach in a high-poverty school dis-trict for at least 3 years; those participants who received a training stipend or otherfinancial incentives but fail to meet their service obligation would be required torepay all or a portion of the stipend. IMPACT AID FUNDING AND THE ADMINISTRATION 'S CONSTRUCTION PROPOSAL Question. Your budget again contains what can only be described as a paltry re- quest for Impact Aid funding, particularly with regard to the critical constructionneeds at many of our coterminous and other Impact Aid school districts, the build-ings of which are in many cases owned by your Department. How can you supportan unprecedented and costly new role of the Federal Government in funding schoolconstruction when your Department and your Administration have completely ne-glected the construction needs of the school buildings you own, which are used toeducate tens of thousands of children, including the children of members of thearmed services and Native American children? Answer. We believe that money can and should be spent concurrently on both schools that are federally owned and those that are not. All of the schools that arecurrently owned by the Department are located on military bases and are used bylocal school districts for educating children whose parents are typically members ofthe uniformed services. The Administration requested $5 million, the same amountas Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2000, for Facilities Maintenance in orderto upgrade and transfer school facilities to school districts, which can manage schoolbuildings more effectively than can the Federal Government. In addition, thesefunds would be used to perform emergency repairs to those school buildings thathave not yet been transferred. The Administration is also concerned about the poor condition of school facilities that are not owned by the Department but are used to educate our Nation 's chil- dren, particularly American Indian children. The General Accounting Office esti-mates that it would cost $112 billion to bring our Nation 's public schools into good overall condition. The Administration 's School Renovation proposal would help meet this need by financing school renovation in communities that lack the resources torepair their schools. The proposal would reserve $50 million out of the $1.3 billionfor approximately 118 Impact Aid local educational agencies (LEAs) that have 50percent or more of their students residing on Indian lands. These LEAs lack the re-sources to undertake urgently needed renovations, such as roof or plumbing repairsand upgraded climate-control systems. The balance of the funds requested under theproposal would go to school districts that similarly lack the resources to meet theirurgent school construction needs.114 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR HERBKOHL FLEXIBILITY OF BLOCK GRANTS OVER TARGETED PROGRAMS Question. Mr. Secretary, I want to commend you for your commitment and hard work on behalf of our Nation 's public school children. Since 1994, we have made some important gains in raising the achievement of students. Unfortunately, I thinkwe share the same concerns that academic achievement has not been raised enough,and that the gap between economically disadvantaged and more affluent studentsremains alarmingly and inexcusably large. As you know, we have a full menu of Federal education programs today. Most are focused on very specific issues. I am concerned, however, that we have gotten awayfrom what I believe is the Federal Government 's central role as a partner in edu- cation: helping States and school districts lift academic achievement for all students,and eliminating the achievement gap between poor and affluent students. I am con-cerned that the current structure of Federal education programs \u2014that is, to create a new program to address each and every education issue \u2014actually results in spreading Federal dollars too thin to be useful for local educators. For example, one school district might need more money to buy computers, but they might not have any pressing safety issues to address. Another school districtmight have a sufficient number of after-school programs, but they might really needmore funding for school counselors. Under the current structure of ESEA, theseschool districts have little flexibility to move Federal money around. That means one of two things: either they get too little money to address their biggest problems,or they miss out on money from some Federal programs because those programshave no relevance for their schools. Don't you agree that States and local school districts are in the best position to know what their education needs are and to devise ways to address them? Answer. I absolutely agree that States and communities are in the best position to address their education needs, and that the Federal role is that of a junior part-ner. I also believe that Federal programs provide more flexibility than is commonlyrecognized. For example, the Goals 2000 State Grant program provides funds thatcan be used for a very wide variety of activities that support standards-based re-form, from teacher training to curriculum to buying computers. Title I funds alsosupport many different approaches to improving student achievement, includingearly childhood education, adoption of research-based reform models, after-schoolprograms, and school safety efforts. Question. Isn't it possible that consolidating many Federal education programs would actually give States and school districts even more resources to pour intotheir most pressing needs? Answer. Our experience with block grants has shown that this approach is what really leads to funds being spread too thinly to have much impact. In fact, in a re-cent report from the General Accounting Office on the Goals 2000 program, Stateofficials expressed concern that if Goals 2000 funds were not restricted to supportof State and local standards-based reform efforts, they would be diverted to non-re-form activities. Question. Isn't it possible that allowing maximum flexibility to move Federal money around might result in some of these needs being better met? Answer. It is possible, but in my view \u2014and I say this as a former governor \u2014not likely. I think it is important to remember that we are trying at the Federal levelto exercise leadership and stimulate change. One reason this is so hard is that peo-ple everywhere \u2014and not just in our schools \u2014tend to keep doing things the same way, the way they are comfortable with. In my view, the ''maximum flexibility '' you are talking about would only encourage this kind of educational inertia. The American people have made clear their support for more investment in crit- ical national priorities \u2014like smaller class sizes, expansion of after school programs, improving reading in the early grades, and helping students and their families getready for college. It is precisely because our role \u2014and our resources \u2014are limited that we must target the Federal education investment to those areas where it canmake a real difference. At the same time, we continue to work to provide the flexi-bility districts and schools need to raise student achievement, while ensuring ac-countability for the effective use of taxpayer funds. TURNING AROUND FAILING SCHOOLS Question. As you know, we have over 7,000 failing schools in our country. For years, regardless of the fact that they consistently fail to educate children, they con-tinue to receive a steady stream of Federal money. In effect, we are subsidizingtheir failure. I believe that failing schools should be given the tools they need to115 turn themselves around \u2014and successful schools should be rewarded for their hard work. However, at some point, I believe we actually do more harm than good forchildren when we continue to subsidize schools that fail to educate them. What do you believe should be done with chronically failing schools?Answer. Greater accountability is at the core of our proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The Administration 's reauthor- ization bill would strengthen statewide accountability systems, provide new re-sources for States and school districts to turn around failing schools, and requiretough measures for chronically failing schools. For example, schools in corrective ac-tion under Title I could be reconstituted with a new staff and curriculum or actuallyclosed down and reopened as a new school or as a charter school. Question. Does the Administration believe that at some point there must be real consequences for schools that can 't or won 't improve? Answer. Yes, we do. In addition to our reauthorization proposals, we are imple- menting the new Title I Accountability Grants program, which couples additionalresources for school improvement efforts with the requirement that gives studentsin schools identified for improvement under Title I the option to attend a better school. Our 2001 budget proposal would require all school districts participating inTitle I to give students attending schools identified for corrective action the optionof transferring to a school not identified for corrective action. Question. Doesn 't the Federal Government have a responsibility to taxpayers not to subsidize failure? Answer. I believe we do, and so does President Clinton. This is why he took the lead more than a year ago to launch a broad-based accountability initiative that in-cludes the measures described above. Other proposals to increase accountability,such as report cards for parents and tougher qualifications for teachers and para-professionals, have been incorporated into the President 's ESEA reauthorization bill. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR PATTY MURRAY CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PROGRAM \u2014TEACHERS HIRED Question. Mr. Secretary, the President has requested an additional $1.75 billion to maintain our goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to address the severe problemof overcrowded classrooms. Opponents of this funding have argued that these fundsmay not be accessible for all school districts and may never make it to the class-room. Can you provide for us a brief status report on how many teachers have beenhired to date and how many we could hire with the additional $1.75 billion? Answer. Based on data from 55 percent of districts, we estimate that local dis- tricts have used their 1999 Class Size Reduction funds to hire more than 29,000teachers. We estimate that the $1.75 billion budget request for the program in 2001, along with the 35 percent local matching requirement, would support the hiring of asmany as 49,000 teachers. Without the local matching requirement, the requestedamount would support the hiring of as many as 43,000 teachers. TECHNOLOGY LITERACY CHALLENGE FUND PROGRAMS AND PREPARING TOMORROW 'S TEACHERS TO USE TECHNOLOGY Question. Mr. Secretary, as you are aware, I have focused not just on class size but also working to make sure we give teachers the skills to use technology in theclassroom. It does little good to wire every classroom to Internet or to provide Inter-net access to every school if teachers are not prepared to use these tools in the class-room. Can you provide a brief summary of the President 's Technology Literacy Chal- lenge Fund activities as requested in his fiscal year 2001 budget? Answer. In 2001, we are requesting a total of $450 million for the Department 's Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF) program, an increase of $25 million.The TLCF helps local districts put into place strategies to enable all schools to inte-grate technology fully into school curricula to improve teaching and learning. TheDepartment 's proposal for reauthorization of the TLCF would limit eligibility for awards to districts with high concentrations of poor children and a demonstratedneed for technology, or to partnerships that include such districts. Districts woulduse their funds to increase the capacity of teachers in high-poverty, low-performingschools to use technology effectively in their classrooms. The amount requestedwould support approximately 3,400 local grants. In addition to the TLCF, the Department 's other educational technology programs help States, districts, and schools achieve the four goals of the Administration 's Technology Literacy Challenge, which are to: (1) provide access to modern, multi-116 media computers for all teachers and students; (2) connect every school and class- room to the Internet; (3) provide all teachers with the training and support theyneed to use technology effectively in their classrooms; and (4) develop effective andengaging software and on-line resources as an integral part of schools curriculum.The technology programs and the 2001 requested amounts are: \u2014Next-Generation Technology Innovation , for which we are requesting $170 mil- lion in 2001, would replace the current Technology Innovation Challenge Grantsand Star Schools programs. The new program would focus on developing ''cut- ting edge '' applications of educational technology. In 2001, new awards would focus on developing advanced technology applications, supporting the develop-ment of high-quality on-line coursework, and a special initiative to help prepare middle school teachers in the Mississippi Delta region to use technology effec-tively and to develop challenging coursework on-line. \u2014Preparing Tomorrow 's Teachers To Use Technology assists public and private entities to develop and implement teacher training programs that prepare pro-spective teachers to use technology to improve instructional practices and en-hance student learning. The $150 million requested in 2001, a $75 million in-crease over 2000, would support approximately 466 awards. \u2014Community Technology Centers supports efforts to establish or expand tech- nology centers to provide residents of impoverished rural and urban commu-nities with access to computers and technology, particularly educational tech-nology. The $100 million requested in 2001, a $67.5 million increase, wouldallow approximately 400 communities to establish or expand 1,000 technologycenters. \u2014Regional Technology In Education Consortia , for which we are requesting $10 million, the same as the 2000 appropriation, supports regional centers thatcarry out professional development, resource and information dissemination,and technical assistance to help States, districts, and schools integrate tech-nology effectively into classrooms. \u2014Ready To Learn Digital Television , for which we are requesting $16 million in 2001, supports the development of educational television programming and re-lated activities aimed at cultivating a love of language, reading, and learningin young children. \u2014Telecommunications Program For Professional Development , for which we are requesting $5 million in 2001, would replace the current TelecommunicationsDemonstration Project for Mathematics program. This new program would sup-port telecommunications-based projects designed to provide professional devel-opment to elementary and secondary school teachers in the core academic sub-jects. STUDENT DEBT \u2014GROWING IMBALANCE OF STUDENT EDUCATION LOANS TO GRANTS IN PAYING FOR COLLEGE Question. Over the past 10 years, I have witnessed a disturbing trend in higher education. We have a growing number of students who must depend entirely on bor-rowing in order to pay for their higher education. The percentage of loans versusdirect grants to students has dramatically increased. Students are graduating withhuge debts and many discontinue or do not pursue a postsecondary education sim-ply out of fear of carrying such a large debt. In addition, many students are lookingat careers based on starting salary because they know they will have large loan pay-ments. I realize this problem cannot be solved in one budget cycle, but I would wel-come your thoughts on steps we can begin to take to reverse this trend. Answer. One of the major steps we need to take is to continue increasing support for the Pell Grant program, where the maximum award has risen from $2,300 infiscal year 1994 to $3,300 in fiscal year 2000. The maximum Pell Grant in fiscalyear 2000 covers about 95 percent of the average tuition and fees at a 4-year publiccollege, but still only about 38 percent of the total cost of attendance. This programis vital to the overall student aid picture, as is funding for campus-based programssuch as Federal Work-Study where an estimated 1 million students will help earntheir way through college with Federal assistance in fiscal year 2000. We need to do a better job of counseling students up front on what amount of borrowing is appropriate to their specific situation. We also can encourage Statesand institutions to increase their level of assistance so that students may take ad-vantage of available non-Federal aid as well. Many students who are dependent on borrowing may be ineligible for grant aid due to family income levels. We, too, are concerned about the rising loan debt thatnumbers of these and other postsecondary students are carrying. One of our per-formance measures focuses on keeping median Federal debt burden below 10 per-117 cent of income in the first year of repayment. While this is not entirely within the Department 's control, since many outside factors play a role, there are options that we have instituted to help borrowers manage their debt. For instance, the Administration established flexible repayment plans such as In- come Contingent Repayment, which allows Direct Loan borrowers to repay based onsize of debt and income. Other options include graduated, extended, and income sen-sitive repayment plans that can help make monthly payments more affordable andkeep borrowers out of default. EDUCATIONAL TAX INCENTIVES In addition, we need to encourage eligible students and their families to use the variety of educational tax incentives available. For instance, taxpayers may be ableto deduct up to $2,000 in student loan interest in 2000. Hope and Lifetime Learningtax credits are another possibility to lower overall postsecondary tuition and fee ex-penses. The Hope tax credit allows up to $1,500 annually toward tuition and feespaid in the first 2 years of postsecondary education and the Lifetime learning tax credit currently permits up to $1,000. The Administration is seeking to expand theLifetime learning tax credit up to $2,800 annually and raise the income phase-outranges so greater numbers of families can take advantage of it. In combination, all of the ways mentioned above, represent positive steps that can help in alleviating the burden of student loan debt. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ROBERT C. B YRD BYRD SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM Question. Over the life of the program, how many students have received Byrd Scholarships and how many new and continuing awards have been made? Answer. Since the program was first funded in fiscal year 1987, 76,376 students have received Byrd Scholarships and a total of 173,897 new and continuing awardshave been made. In fiscal year 2000, 26,572 new and continuing scholarships willbe made and in fiscal year 2001, our budget would provide an additional 7,310 newscholarships and 20,024 continuing scholarships. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXPENDITURES FOR NEEDS -BASED STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Question. In 1999, how much did the Department of Education spend on needs- based student financial assistance? Answer. In 1999, the Department obligated nearly $7.7 billion in the Student Fi- nancial Assistance account in support of need-based student aid. Those funds, to-gether with required matching funds under the Campus-Based and Leveraging Edu-cational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) programs, less allowable administrativecosts, provided an estimated $10.2 billion in available aid to students. With an addi-tional $15.7 billion in need-based mandatory student loans (guaranteed and directsubsidized Stafford loans), the Department made approximately $25.9 billion inneed-based aid available to students in 1999. Obligations in the SFA Account in Fiscal Year 1999 25,000,000 Total obligations ...................................................................... 7,695,352,192 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXPENDITURES FOR MERIT -BASED STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Question. How much did the Department spend in the same year for merit-based student financial assistance? Answer. In addition to $39.3 million in the Byrd Honors Scholarships program for merit-based financial assistance to undergraduate students, in fiscal year 1999, the118 Department spent a total of $31 million in the Graduate Assistance in Areas of Na- tional Need (GAANN) and Javits Fellowships programs for merit-based assistanceto graduate students studying in areas of national need and doctoral students study-ing in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. REWARDING EXCELLENCE IN STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Question. The purpose of the Byrd Scholarship program is to award students who work hard at their schoolwork regardless of economic factors. How does the Depart-ment of Education intend to build upon these efforts to reward excellence? Answer. The Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget request recognizes the suc- cess of the Byrd Honors Scholarships program in helping high achieving studentspay for a college education and would build on this success by moving the programcloser to the maximum funding level authorized by law. In addition, the budget re-quest would continue support for the GAANN and Javits Fellowships programs be-cause of their critical role in rewarding excellence and encouraging continued learn-ing. SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION Question. With the Elementary and Secondary Education Act due to be marked up by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee this week, Iwould like now to turn to those issues of importance to students, parents, and teach-ers in creating a stronger, more educated national population. I strongly believe thateducating oneself is a lifelong journey, and the skills by which one learns to readand study are fostered at a young age, making these years of schooling extremelyimportant in shaping one 's future pursuit of education. Mr. Secretary, would you please respond to the following questions. I have noted the Department 's new efforts to increase budget spending for school construction. Specifically, how will these projections assist our small, rural schoolsin high poverty areas such as we find in my State of West Virginia? Answer. The Administration 's School Renovation proposal would provide $1.3 bil- lion in grants and loan subsidies to provide support for urgent renovations in areasof high need. These funds would assist schools in high poverty areas, such as thosein small, rural areas of West Virginia, because they would be targeted to school dis-tricts based on poverty rates, school repair needs, and fiscal capacity. Question. When available construction funding requires matching funds, how does the Federal Government assist the small rural communities with high poverty levelsand low tax bases to be competitive? Answer. The Administration 's School Renovation proposal would provide both grants that require no matching funds and subsidies equal to the size of interestpayments on 7-year loans. The Administration intends to target both the grants andthe loans to needy areas, while reserving the grants for areas with the greatestneed. TEACHER CERTIFICATION \u2014NATIONAL BOARD FOR PROFESSIONAL TEACHING STANDARDS Question. Are there any national efforts to encourage teachers to participate in the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification process? Answer. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) itself encourages participation in the certification process in several ways. One way isthrough Teacher Subsidies (funded at $2.5 million of the Department 's grant to the Board). The Board provides funds to each State to pay up to one half of the can-didate fee. As a result of the program, staff in the departments of education in eachState engage in a variety of strategies to increase the number of teachers in theirStates who are seeking certification. The Board also sponsors a series of nationalfacilitator institutes for individuals interested in helping recruit candidates and pro- viding support for candidates going through the certification process. The Board has also partnered with national organizations such as the Council of Great City Schools, the National Council of Social Studies, the International Read-ing Association, and the National Alliance of Black School Educators to increaseparticipation. The Board has exhibits at the national conferences of many majoreducation and content associations. In addition, the Board works with the privatesector to increase participation; e.g., State Farm is supporting candidates throughits offices in each State. Question. How can we assist States with very low numbers of participating teach- ers? Answer. In those States with large numbers of National Board Certified Teachers (NBCT), there is significant State support through financial incentives, including feesupport and salary increases, coupled with an increased awareness of the NBCT119 process. The reverse is true in those States with low numbers of National Board Certified Teachers. Through its grant to the NBPTS, the Department is helping to increase the num- ber of candidates for National Board Certification in States with low participationby providing support to the Board: \u2014to increase State and local incentives through meetings with State stakeholders and legislators; and \u2014to increase awareness of the NBCT process through partnerships with the pri- vate sector, encouragement of candidate support groups, participation in na-tional meetings involving teachers, and working with ED 's Regional Educational Laboratories and institutions of higher education. TEACHER SHORTAGES AND THE BUDGET PROPOSAL Question. With the incredible predictions for teacher shortage rates growing al- most daily, what efforts might we expect to see emerging to reverse this threateningcrisis? Answer. The Administration shares your concern about reports that many school districts are having difficulty hiring and retaining fully qualified teachers. Accordingto the National Commission on Teaching and America 's Future 's report, What Mat- ters Most: Teaching for America 's Future (1996), ''Much of the problem of teacher supply is a problem of distribution that could be solved with more thoughtful andcoherent policies. While there are shortages of qualified candidates in particular fields (e.g., mathematics and science) and particular locations (primarily inner cityand rural), the nation each year produces more teachers than it needs .... Thou- sands of teachers fail to make the transition from the places they were preparedto the places where the jobs are due to lack of information about where to apply,lack of reciprocity in licensing between States, and ridiculously cumbersome applica-tion procedures. '' (pp. 37 -8) In addition, the report concludes that inadequate efforts to retain teachers con- tribute to the teacher shortage. For example, the report states that ''Of all of edu- cation 's self-inflicted wounds, the continued tolerance for extraordinary turnover among new teachers is among the most remarkable. Chronic, high rates of teacherreplacement \u2014particularly for teachers in the first 2 or 3 years of their careers and particularly in urban school districts \u2014increase the pressure on teacher recruitment and initial placement systems incessantly. . . . Turnover in the first few years isparticularly high because new teachers are typically given the most challengingteaching assignments and left to sink or swim with little or no support. They areoften placed in the most disadvantaged schools and assigned the most difficult-to-teach students, with the greatest number of class preparations (many of them out-side their field of expertise) and a slew of extracurricular duties. With no mentoringor support for these teachers, it is little wonder that so many give up before theyhave really learned to teach. '' (p. 39) The Administration is requesting funds for several programs to help school dis- tricts address their immediate teacher shortage concerns, including a proposed newinitiative, Hometown Teachers, and the Transition to Teaching program. We believethat these and other teacher training programs, for which we are requesting a totalof $1 billion, would encourage school districts to develop and implement longer-termsolutions for recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers. For example, States andschool districts would be able to use funds to develop strategies that could includementoring programs for new teachers, higher teacher salaries, more desirable work-ing conditions, better professional development opportunities for teachers and schoolleaders, and other efforts to improve the quality of the teaching profession. DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSE TO TEACHER SHORTAGES Question. What is the Department doing to specifically address these issues? Answer. The Administration is requesting $1 billion in support of a comprehen- sive set of ESEA reauthorization proposals focusing on professional developmentand teacher recruitment. Programs that would be implemented as part of the pack-age include Teaching to High Standards State Grants (which would replace the Ei-senhower Professional Development State Grants and Goals 2000 programs), aSchool Leadership Initiative, National Activities for the Improvement of Teachingand School Leadership, the Eisenhower Regional Mathematics and Science Edu-cation Consortia, Teacher Quality Initiatives, Transition to Teaching: Troops toTeachers, and Early Childhood Educator Professional Development. The Administration believes that these programs, in total, would help States and school districts address their teacher shortages both directly and indirectly by help-ing them to develop and implement short- and long-term solutions to teacher re-120 cruitment issues and to reduce their teacher attrition rates. In addition to the pro- grams that specifically address teacher recruitment, such as the Hometown Teach-ers and Transition to Teaching programs, other programs in the $1 billion requestwould provide high-quality professional development to both teachers and schoolleaders to help ensure that all students are being taught by teachers who are fullyqualified and who are receiving the support they need to teach to challenging Stateand local standards. For example, the Administration is requesting $690 million for the Teaching to High Standards State Grants program, which would help educators improve learn-ing in American classrooms by supporting State and local efforts to align curriculaand assessments with challenging State and local content standards and to provideteachers with sustained and intensive high-quality professional development in thecore academic subjects. A $60 million set aside in this program would provide grantsto colleges and universities that agree to partner with at least one school districtto provide professional development in the core academic subjects. States would berequired to give priority to those colleges and universities that plan to focus on in-duction programs for new teachers that provide mentoring and coaching by trained mentor teachers. The Administration believes that induction programs such as thesecan provide the support that new teachers need to help them to become more effec-tive teachers and to improve the likelihood that they will stay in the teaching pro-fession. RECOGNIZING HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WITH EFFECTIVE ALCOHOL AND DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS Question. As you recall, I authored a component of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 to establish a National Recognition Awards program to iden-tify institutions of higher education with effective alcohol and drug prevention pro-grams. With the first year of the program complete, would you please provide mewith a report on the second year 's implementation status of the program, as well as any intentions the Department may have to broaden the program given the in-crease in funding? Answer. Because the second year of the program is being funded under a different authority than last year (that is, under Safe and Drug-Free Schools National Pro-grams rather than under the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Edu-cation), the Department has needed to undergo rulemaking to implement the pro-gram for 2000. On February 14, 2000, the Department published in the FederalRegister a notice of proposed priority, eligible applicants, and selection criteria forevaluating applications for new grants under for this program. We received very fewcomments from the public and expect to publish a final notice in the Federal Reg-ister in early April, at which time we will begin soliciting grant applications frominstitutions of higher education. The application deadline date will be May 12, 2000.The program will be operated in essentially the same manner as it was imple-mented in 1999. The Department is planning to use the additional $100,000 in 2000 funds to make additional awards and to support enhanced dissemination activities by each grantee.A total of $600,000 will be available for awards (compared to $500,000 in fiscal year1999). Once again $250,000 of the appropriation will be used to administer the peerreview process, conduct a recognition ceremony, and develop and disseminate a pub-lication describing the model programs. We plan to make grant awards in June, andanticipate making between eight and ten awards, ranging from $50,000 to $90,000each. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN TITLE I HOLD HARMLESS Question. You have given important opposition to the Title I ''hold harmless '' pro- vision that effectively negates the law 's requirement that the Department use the most up to date child poverty data in allocating Title I funds. Hold harmless provi-sions freeze in amounts to States whether the number of poor children goes up ordown. In fast-growing States like mine, the hold harmless hurts and we don 't get our fair share. California lost $40 million in fiscal year 2000 because of the holdharmless. California received $944.9 million instead of the $984.5 million we shouldhave received. Will you vigorously oppose the hold harmless publicly?Answer. I could not agree with you more on the harmful impact of the 100 percent hold-harmless on Title I allocations. This provision does indeed prevent Title I funds121 from flowing, as intended by the authorizing statute, to States and school districts experiencing rapid growth in poor students. Research shows clearly that high con-centrations of school poverty are directly correlated with low student achievement,and that even non-poor students tend to perform poorly in schools with high povertylevels. This is why the various Title I formulas are designed to target additional re-sources to high-poverty districts and schools. Unfortunately, in many cases the 100percent hold-harmless provision undermines this targeting and dilutes the impactof the $8 billion annual investment in Title I. Our budget would eliminate this pro-vision, and we certainly will support efforts by you and others to resist the continu-ation of this 100 percent hold-harmless requirement in the fiscal year 2001 appro-priation. STRENGTHENING TITLE I ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS TO INCREASE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT Question. Current law has some accountability requirements for the Title I pro- gram, yet I question whether there have been real achievement gains under the cur-rent program. I know you agree that the early years \u2014learning the basics \u2014are crit- ical to a student 's lifetime success. How can we strengthen Title I 's accountability requirements to make sure the funds are spent on improving learning in the core academic curriculum? Answer. As I indicated earlier, greater accountability is at the core of our proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We would strengthen statewide accountability systems to ensure that Title I schools are held to the samehigh standards as other schools, provide new resources for States and school dis-tricts to turn around failing schools, and require tough measures for chronically fail-ing schools. We also would require tough corrective actions for chronically failingschools, including reconstituting them with a new staff and curriculum or actuallyclosing them down and reopening them as a charter school. REAUTHORIZATION PROPOSAL TO INCREASE TITLE I ACCOUNTABILITY Question. What are your proposals? Answer. The Administration 's reauthorization proposal for Part A of Title I would encourage each State to develop a single, rigorous accountability system that holdsall local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools, including Title I schools, account-able for making continuous and substantial gains in student performance and in theperformance of the lowest-performing students. This statewide accountability sys-tem would be based on the State 's content and student performance standards, and would include procedures for identifying and intervening in LEAs and schools thatare not making gains in student performance, as well as recognition and rewardsfor successful LEAs and schools. States that do not operate such a system for alltheir schools would be required to develop one for their Title I schools. The Administration 's reauthorization proposal includes strong corrective actions to turn around consistently low-performing schools. Once a Title I school is des-ignated for corrective action, the LEA would be required to carry out one of the fol-lowing measures: (1) implement a new curriculum that research has shown offerssubstantial promise of improving student achievement; (2) redesign or reconstitutethe school, which may include reopening it as a charter school; or (3) close the schooland allow its students to transfer. Districts also could allow students in schools sub-ject to corrective action the option of transferring to a new school. The Administration 's reauthorization bill also includes a proposal to provide addi- tional resources to States and school districts to support school improvement efforts.The fiscal year 2000 Department of Education Appropriations Act jumpstarted thisnew initiative by providing $134 million for school improvement activities at theLEA level. These funds must be used for technical assistance and other interven-tions designed to improve low-performing schools and to help such schools enableall students to meet challenging State standards. In addition, Congress directed,through appropriations language, that all LEAs receiving these funds must providestudents enrolled in schools identified for improvement with the option to transferto another public school within the LEA that has not been identified for improve-ment. The President 's 2001 budget would expand funding for these new accountability grants to $250 million, with 30 percent of grant funds reserved for State-level ac-countability and school improvement activities and 70 percent allocated to LEAs.And to help ensure that no student is trapped in a chronically failing school, theAdministration 's 2001 budget proposal would require LEAs to give students attend- ing corrective action schools the option of attending another public school within theLEA that has not been identified for corrective action. This requirement would122 apply to all LEAs participating in Title I, whether or not they receive accountability grant funds. IMMIGRANT EDUCATION FUNDS Question. Under the immigrant education programs, the Department of Education awards grants to school districts based on the number of immigrant children en-rolled, if the district has an immigrant population of at least 500 or 3 percent oftheir enrollment. Students counted are those that have been in this country for lessthan 3 academic years. New immigrant students are probably the most at-risk students. In addition to language barriers, their schooling has been interrupted and they are in unfamiliarcommunities. Funding for this program has been flat \u2014at $150 million in 1998, 1999, and 2000. And you have requested $150 million for fiscal year 2001. California has 25 percentof the U.S. legal immigrants and 40 percent of the Nation 's illegal immigrants. Last year California received $36.5 million to educate immigrant children. In light of the serious needs these children bring to the classroom, shouldn 't we be increasing immigrant education funds? Answer. We strongly agree that school districts need Federal assistance in serving recent immigrant students. The Administration proposed, and Congress enacted, in-creased funding for this program in each of fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998. How-ever, since 1995, the number of eligible immigrant students in the Nation has de-clined by 2 percent, and in California by 29 percent. With this decline, we believethat the proposed appropriation level is adequate. As you know, for 2001, the Ad-ministration has proposed large increases for both the Title I and Bilingual Edu-cation programs that serve large numbers of immigrant students. FLEXIBILITY OF CLASS -SIZE REDUCTION PROGRAM Question. The Clinton Administration 's push to reduce class sizes in the lower grades is a good use of Federal education funds. California has been reducing classsizes in grades K -3 since the 1996 -1997 school year. Because these efforts have largely succeeded in reducing class sizes in grades 1 -3, in fiscal year 2000 California received a waiver that allowed my State to use class-size reduction funds to reduceclass sizes in higher grades. Will you accommodate States that have taken the initiative in reducing class size by making funds flexible enough to suit the specific class size reduction needs ofthe State? Answer. Districts have considerable flexibility in the use of their Class Size Re- duction funds. A district that has met the target level of 18 children or fewer inthe early grades, or has reduced class size to a State or local class size reductiongoal that was in effect prior to November 29, 1999, can use its funds to further re-duce class size in those grades, to reduce class size in additional grades, or to im-prove teacher quality. We will work with States to provide them with flexibility inthe use of the funds they receive under the Class Size Reduction program so thateach State is able to address its specific class-size reduction needs. REDUCTION IN IMPACT AID Question. Impact Aid is an important program without which many schools in California and other States would be in severe financial straits. Currently in Cali-fornia, $57 million in Impact Aid is spent educating 1 million students in 119 schooldistricts. Impact Aid is a basic obligation that the Federal Government has to schooldistricts to compensate them for the lost revenues because of tax-exempt Federalproperty. More than half of the Administration 's proposed $128 million cut in Im- pact Aid comes from the elimination of the ''Payments for Heavily Impacted Dis- tricts. '' Why did the Administration propose a drastic $128 million, or 15 percent, cut in Impact Aid? Answer. In the Administration 's budget, the types of Impact Aid funds that are targeted to the school districts with the clearest needs would increase. For example,Basic Support Payments on behalf of an Impact Aid ''a'' child would increase 7 per- cent on average from the 2000 level. (Impact Aid ''a'' children are generally those children who reside with their parents who both live and work on Federal land. Im-pact Aid ''b'' children are generally those students who reside with their parents who work or live on Federal land.) Under the Administration 's proposed funding level and formula, the Department estimates that school districts in Californiawould receive an increase of nearly 10 percent in Basic Support Payments, from$51.8 million in 2000 to $56.6 million in 2001.123 The Administration 's budget does not support payments on behalf of ''b'' children because we believe (as did previous Administrations) that ''b'' children do not present a real, uncompensated burden for school districts. Families that reside onprivate property either pay property taxes or rent property on which their landlordspay property taxes. Since local governments typically finance education using prop-erty taxes, the local cost of educating off-base children can be financed using prop-erty and other local taxes. The Administration proposes no funding for Payments for Heavily Impacted Dis- tricts because the program no longer meets its purpose under the authorizing stat-ute\u2014to assist school districts with large proportions of federally connected students and a strong tax effort in reaching the per-pupil expenditures of similar school dis-tricts in their State. The appropriations for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 essentiallyrewrote both the eligibility criteria and the payment formula for this supplementalfunding authority. The program now functions more as a set of funding earmarks than a legitimate program meeting a genuine need. No school districts in California receive Paymentsfor Heavily Impacted Districts. By eliminating funding for authorities that fail to meet their intended purpose, the Administration is able to focus on funding increases for high priorities, such asa substantial increase for payments on behalf Impact Aid ''a'' children under the Basic Support Payments formula. PAYMENTS FOR HEAVILY IMPACTED DISTRICTS Question. Why, if the Department of Education believes that the funds for heavily impacted schools are not targeted effectively, does the Department not try to changethe legislation rather than simply cutting the funding in its entirety? Answer. The Administration is proposing changes to the legislation for Payments for Heavily Impacted Districts in its proposal for reauthorizing the Elementary andSecondary Education Act. However, neither the Senate nor the House committeebills to reauthorize Impact Aid include these changes. The Administration 's proposed changes would simplify the payment formula and bring this program back to its original purpose of assisting school districts withlarge proportions of federally connected students and a strong tax effort to increasetheir per-pupil expenditures so that they would be in line with similar school dis-tricts. These changes would discontinue the practice of distributing these funds toschool districts that no longer have large proportions of federally connected children. HEAD START PROGRAM Question. Should the Head Start program be moved to the Department of Edu- cation and converted to a strong preschool program? Answer. I see no reason to move the Head Start program to the Department of Education. Head Start, as it now exists, is a strong program that helps prepare ourhighest need children to succeed in school. The Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS) has worked to ensure that Head Start is a comprehensive programthat integrates health and social services with education and learning and is gearedtoward promoting both social competence and school readiness for our Nation 's low- income children. With the greater focus on improving the standards and quality ofall aspects of Head Start in the last reauthorization, HHS has worked hard to focuson improving quality, including the improvement of key school readiness indicators. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences released information about critical re- search on the importance of preventing reading difficulties in young children by fo-cusing efforts on improving opportunities for young children to develop languageand literacy skills in preschool in order to enter school ready to learn to read. TheDepartment of Education has worked closely with HHS to focus Federal early child-hood programs on this goal and to disseminate this research widely. These effortshave focused on improving the language and literacy skills of young childrenthrough the Head Start, Title I, Even Start, and Reading Excellence programs. I amconfident that we will make great strides in helping all young children, especiallythose from poor families, improve their reading readiness. Question. Would the program be a stronger program if moved to the Department of Education? Answer. Again, I see no reason to move the program. Both of our agencies are working together to ensure that young children are able to start school ready tolearn \u2014by offering a wide range of approaches and services to reach the young chil- dren who are most at risk of school failure, by encouraging parents to become in-volved in their young children 's development, and by stressing the importance of cognitive development in young children. We have learned some important lessons124 in recent years about how to meet the range of needs of target families and how to manage our programs more effectively. HHS AND ED COORDINATION ON HEAD START Question. What is the coordination between HHS and ED vis-a `-vis Head Start? Answer. The Department of Education (ED) and the Department of Health and Human Services share the mission of providing services to young children in orderto ensure that they are healthy, safe, and able to start school ready to learn. Duringthe past 7 years, our agencies have worked to improve collaboration and commu-nication in order to serve our Nation 's children more effectively. While significant strides have already resulted from this increased interagency collaboration, we willcontinue our efforts to improve program efficiency and accountability. Some exam-ples of ways in which ED is working with HHS, specifically in the areas of earlychildhood services, research, and performance measures are: In the area of School Age Care and After School Programming, ED and HHS have collaborated on several successful programs, including the Federal Support to Com-munities Initiative (FSC), Safe School/Healthy Students, 21st Century CommunityLearning Centers, and Child Care and Development Block Grants (CCDBG). Theseprograms address the growing need to provide stimulating out-of-school-time pro-grams for our Nation 's children. In the area of accountability at the Federal level, Title I, Even Start, Head Start, CCDBG, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) programs are developingoutcomes systems for use in improving program effectiveness and complying withthe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). As a next step to-ward coordinated indicators and measures, ED and HHS will conduct an assessmentof the scope, quality, and frequency of measurement of the current set of ED andHHS program performance indicators for their early childhood programs. Includedin this analysis will be a comparison of the GPRA indicators for the programs, aswell as the studies, reporting systems and evaluations, and measures used to reporton the indicators and evaluate the programs. Even Start, Title I, and Head Start staff are coordinating programs on a number of fronts by focusing on ways to sustain coordination efforts at the Federal, State,and local levels. For example, Federal Even Start and Head Start staff are planninga joint conference for the summer of 2000 on coordinating accountability systems.This conference will include staff from Head Start State Collaboration Offices andEven Start Statewide Family Literacy Initiative grants, in addition to other keyState offices involved in early care, education, and family literacy. In addition, EDand HHS will soon issue guidance on models for collaborating and blending HeadStart, Special Education, Even Start, and Title I, Part A funds (i.e., models for com-bining funds to provide whole-day and year-round preschool services, or models withTitle I paying for educational services and Head Start paying for health, nutrition,and parent involvement). Also, HHS and ED are exploring ways to provide jointfamily literacy technical assistance through the Head Start Family Literacy Tech-nical Assistance Initiative. HHS is also partnering with ED in the development of ED 's Survey of Early Care and Education Programs, a nationally representative sample of child care providersand early childhood programs serving children under the age of six. This project isthe first national survey in recent years to examine the supply of center-based pro-grams and licensed home-based care. TEACHING OF COGNITIVE SKILLS IN HEAD START PROGRAMS Question. Are real cognitive skills being taught in the Head Start program? Answer. Yes. Head Start has adopted the ''whole child '' view of school readiness that was recommended by the Goal One Technical Planning Group of the NationalEducation Goals Panel. This view sees school readiness as comprising five develop-mental domains that are important to the child 's readiness for school: physical well- being and motor development, social and emotional development, approaches tolearning, language usage and emerging literacy, and cognition and general knowl-edge. Each of these domains is represented in the Head Start performance stand-ards and measures and in the battery of assessments in the FACES study, a nation-ally representative longitudinal study of Head Start children that is being used todetermine the effectiveness of Head Start. The FACES study, initiated in 1997, isentering its final phase in the spring of 2000. In the next year, the study should yield important information about how Head Start is succeeding in helping childrenachieve in the five designated development domains addressed in the study, includ-ing the cognitive domain.125 HEAD START PROGRAM STAFF SALARIES Question. What is the impact on the program of the low ''teacher '' salaries being paid to Head Start workers? Answer. Head Start salaries have increased in recent years as the Administration has continued to emphasize program quality. However, I cannot speak specificallyto the issue of the impact of the salaries of Head Start workers, since I do not ad-minister the program. I do know that low salaries tend to discourage some highlyqualified individuals from entering the teaching profession at the elementary andsecondary education levels, and I assume that that is also true for the Head Startprogram.

WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER Senator S PECTER . Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The hour of 9:30 having arrived, we will proceed with the hear- ing for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, HumanServices and Education. Today our hearing will focus on the National Institutes of Health, an extraordinary organization from very humble begin-nings in 1887 with a budget of $300. The NIH today is comprisedof 24 separate institutes and centers with 75 buildings of medicalcare on more than 300 acres in Bethesda, MD. The budget is some-what more than $300 today. And Senator Harkin and I have taken the lead on major in- creases, as you all know very well, with the cooperation of Con-gressman Porter and Congressman Obey on the House side. The achievements of NIH have been spectacular in my opinion. And we have added funding at very substantial amounts in recentyears, frankly, over the \u2014perhaps not quite over the objections, but without the enthusiasm of as many members of Congress as wewould like to see. Three years ago, we put up a resolution to add $1 billion to NIH funding. And on a Senate vote, it was defeated 63 to 37. But we found the money, Senator Harkin, Senator Taylor and I, and thesubcommittee, but candidly at the expense of other programs, be-cause it was not budgeted. And we ended up with $907,000 million3 years ago. Having lost the resolution for $1 billion, we decided the next year to try for $2 billion. And we got a few more votes, but still substan-tially under 50. And we found $2 billion 2 years ago, as you allknow. Last year, we went again for $2 billion and got a few more votes, but still less than 50. And Congressman Porter wanted to trumpthe Senate 's $2 billion with $300 million more. And when we had the final roundup last year on the budget negotiations, the leader-ship in both the House and the Senate did not like it; we were tak-ing too much money.129 But with your good work and our persistence, we put it in at $2.3 billion. And then there was the across-the-board cuts. So it camedown to $2.2 billion. And this year we have put in a resolution for $2.7 billion. And a question which I consistently get is: Is there too much moneybeing thrown at NIH? Is NIH able to utilize the money which ithas? And then there is always the issue of how well it is beingspent and what is being produced and what could be produced withmore. And as the funding has gone up, of course, you have moreapplications for grants. So we talk about those 100 doors out there, and we are only opening 29 or 30 or 31 of them. But when the grants go up, or theappropriations go up, rather, then your grants come in with highernumbers. But this subcommittee is dedicated to funding NIH generously, because we think you are worth it. When you have a Federal budg-et of $1.850 trillion, $18 billion for NIH is not really, in my judg-ment, too much. Well, having said that, I think we do not need a hearing. We will just bring out the bank. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF DR . RUTH L . KIRSHSTEIN NIH has been blessed with very able directors. We miss Dr. Har- old Varmus and we miss Dr. Bernadine Healey. And we have anoutstanding acting director at the moment. Dr. Ruth Kirschstein served as deputy director of NIH from July of 1993 until the present time. From 1974 to 1993, she served asthe director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences,the first woman to hold such a position. She came to NIH in 1956as a medical officer in clinical pathology. Dr. Kirschstein, that is the same year I started practicing law. So you and I are experienced. She received her bachelor 's magna cum laude from Long Island University and an M.D. from Tulane University School of Medicine. Welcome, Director Kirschstein. And the floor is yours.Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Mr. Chairman, I and my colleagues appreciate all the wonderful things you have said about NIH this morning.And we want to pledge to you that we will continue to do excellentwork. I am honored to appear before the subcommittee to present the President 's budget for NIH for fiscal year 2001. As you have al- ready said, I have been at NIH for many years. And although thisis the first time I am testifying about the overall NIH budget, ithas been my privilege to appear before this subcommittee annuallyfor 19 years as the Director of the National Institute of GeneralMedical Sciences. As you have also said, the increases for the NIH for fiscal year 1999 and 2000, both nearly 15 percent, were dramatic and unprece-dented and have allowed us to undertake many new and importantprograms. And it has been the support of this subcommittee and the sub- committee in the House that has made a substantial difference inimproving the public 's health and well-being. And so the funds re- quested for fiscal year 2001 will permit us to continue our fiscal130 year 1999 and 2000 initiatives and allow us to begin some new ones. I would like to mention just two of the many, many advances that occurred during the last year: First, the completion of the firstfull sequence of a human chromosome, number 22. Its genes haveimportance for immune system function and in the development ofcongenital heart disease, schizophrenia, mental retardation andseveral cancers. And second, the identification of the gene that causes salmonella bacteria to be deadly when ingested in food. And this should openup the possibilities for the development of new antibiotics, as well as vaccines. In fiscal year 2001, we propose to emphasize first clinical re- search on diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, neurological dis-eases, cancer and a host of other serious diseases and disasters,particularly those that have a disparate effect on minority and un-derserved populations. Second, the neurosciences will be emphasized; third, genetic medicine; and fourth, bioengineering, bioimaging and biomedicalcomputing. PREPARED STATEMENTS Finally, Mr. Chairman, we will strive to ensure that the NIH supports new initiatives that offer the most promise of expandingknowledge and improving health and to ensure the support of anappropriate number of new and young investigators of the highestcaliber. I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to your questions.[The statements follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. RUTH L. K IRSCHSTEIN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am Ruth Kirschstein, the Acting Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). I am honored to appear beforethe Subcommittee to present the President 's budget for NIH for fiscal year 2001. Although this is the first time I have appeared before this Subcommittee to testifyabout the overall NIH budget, it has been my privilege to appear annually for 19years as Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Mr. Chair-man, your support and the support of the members of the Subcommittee, has madea substantial difference inimproving the public 's health and well-being. Mr. Chairman, all of us, we at NIH, Members of Congress and the citizens we serve, have similar expectations for medical research. We want better ways of diag-nosing and treating, and, in the long run, preventing and curing disease. And wewant the federal dollars invested in medical research to result in the fulfillment ofthese expectations. In the last century, the scientific community, both public and private, worked in collaboration to cure or prevent once deadly infectious diseases that are now givenno more thought than the common cold. I was fortunate enough to be at the fore-front of the final development of the polio vaccine, one of the truly monumentalachievements of the last century. There is not enough time today to list the astound-ing medical breakthroughs that followed our increased understanding of medicalscience. I will mention just a few: the development of antibiotics and organ trans-plantation, life-extending and life-saving cancer therapies, the identification of theAIDS virus and the drugs to treat AIDS, and discoveries involving the chemicalsin the brain that are important in drug addiction and mental illness. As we begin a new century, medical science stands on the threshold of research advances that were once inconceivable. We have identified the genes responsible fora large number of our normal functions and the genetic abnormalities that causemany diseases, such as Huntington 's disease, cystic fibrosis, and certain forms of deafness. You will hear much more from my colleagues.131 In his budget plan for fiscal year 2001, the President is requesting $18.8 billion for the NIH, an increase of $1 billion or 5.6 percent more than the fiscal year 2000appropriation. By any measure, the amounts we received in fiscal year 1999 and2000, both nearly 15 percent increases, were dramatic and unprecedented. Thesegenerous budgets have allowed us to undertake many new and important programsand to improve conditions throughout the medical research enterprise. The funds re-quested in fiscal year 2001 will permit us to continue our fiscal year 1999 and 2000initiatives and to begin new undertakings and expand others under our Areas of Re-search Emphasis. I will say more about these areas later. We are pleased that the public, the Congress, and the Administration place a high value on good health and understand the role that medical research plays in im-proving the health of the American public. These improvements result from new di-agnostic advances, more effective treatment options, better ways to prevent somediseases, and ways to delay the onset or progression of other diseases and disabil-ities. We feel confident of public support for our research enterprise, but are aware of our need to deliver to the public the two things it most wants from the NIH: \u2014research advances, year after year, that improve the health of all members of society; \u2014assurance that we spend the public 's money wisely. What the Public Wants from the NIH: Research Advances that Contribute to the Health of Everyone In the past year alone, we have seen dramatic advances that are likely to have a direct, near-term effect on public health. The NIH will continue to emphasize clin-ical research in fiscal year 2001 because it is critical in improving public health: \u2014Scientists completed the first sequence of a human chromosome, 22, which has been implicated in immune system function, congenital heart disease, schizo-phrenia, mental retardation, birth defects, and several cancers, including leu-kemia. The 33.4 million nucleotides that make up chromosome 22 comprise thelongest continuous stretch of DNA ever deciphered. The magnitude of this workis amplified by the insights it will give us into many diseases. \u2014A clinical trial (carried out in cooaboration with scientists and clinicians in Uganda) has demonstrated an affordable and practical strategy for preventingtransmission of the HIV virus from mother to infant. A single oral dose of theantiretroviral drug nevirapine given to an HIV-infected woman during laborand another to her baby within three days of birth reduced the transmissionof virus by half compared with a similar short course of AZT. This treatmentmight prevent some 300,000 to 400,000 newborns per year from becoming in-fected and eventually developing AIDS at a cost which is affordable in devel-oping countries. \u2014Preeclampsia is a precursor to eclampsia, a potentially fatal complication of pregnancy. It is characterized by high blood pressure, excessive weight gain,and severe headaches. Eclampsia leads to convulsions and causes a variety ofbirth complications. Months before symptoms appeared, women withpreeclampsia were compounds, prostacyclin and thromboxane, which controlblood pressure. The discovery suggests new and early treatments for this condi-tion for which there is currently no cure or treatment. \u2014An important gene that makes Salmonella a deadly bacterium was identified. Without the gene, which encodes for the enzyme called Dam, Salmonella bac-teria not only did not kill the mice into which they were injected, but also serveas a vaccine against future infection by deadly Salmonella. Because Dam isfound in many other dangerous bacteria, this discovery opens possibilities fora whole new generation of antibiotics and vaccines. What the Public Wants from the NIH: Assurance that its Funding is Well Spent It is clear that the public wants a fuller understanding of the NIH 's funding allo- cations and how it sets priorities \u2014that is, an assurance that the taxpayers ' dollars are well spent. We believe, in fact, that the more the public knows about our proc-esses the more it will support both what we do and how we do it. I want to touchon six principles relevant to establishing priorities: \u2014An obligation to respond to public health needs, judged variously by the inci- dence, severity, and cost of specific disorders. However, calculations cannot becorrelated with research spending in a simple manner. \u2014A responsibility to capitalize on previous discoveries and to eize the scientific opportunities that offer the best prospects for obtaining new knowledge and bet-ter health. Not all problems are equally approachable, regardless of their impor-132 tance to public health. Some only yield to a new technology or insight. We must, however, create environments that stimulate new ideas about difficult problems. \u2014A need to maintain a diverse portfolio on a wide range of diseases. We cannot always know in advance which discovery will be applicable to which disease. \u2014An obligation to insure first-rate scientific workforces and research facilities. \u2014A need to seek advice from many sources, including the public. \u2014And last, but truly foremost in our minds, a commitment to support scientific work of the highest caliber. Peer review is the cornerstone of our efforts to fund the best science. To identify research worthy of funding, about 40,000 grant applications are peer reviewed atthe NIH each year. Of these, approximately 75 percent are evaluated within theNIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR). The NIH is ensuring that CSR has suffi-cient resources so that its review will recognize, and capitalize on, the opportunitiescreated by the diverse successes of the medical research enterprise, will anticipateemerging fields of research, and accommodate to the rapid pace of scientific change. In 1998, the Congress asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to review the NIH 's process for setting priorities. While supporting our principles, the IOM made someuseful suggestions about ensuring that our programs are responsive to the public.Over the past year, NIH has responded by appointing a Council of Public Represent-atives (COPR). The COPR improves our accountability by bringing public views tothe NIH, by looking at how the NIH carries out different aspects of its mission, andby conferring on trans-NIH issues. The COPR will be involved in many aspects ofNIH programs and policies. Following another suggestion in the IOM report, this past year the NIH Director required each Institute and Center to produce a strategic plan of research needs andopportunities over two to five years. The plans were developed with input from awide range of NIH constituents, including patient and other health advocates, sci-entists, health-care providers, the Congress, the Administration, NIH staff, andother representatives of the public. These strategic plans will be available in thenear future and should improve public understanding of the challenges all compo-nents of the NIH are facing. This past year, for the first time, the NIH held a Budget Retreat in June to help develop its presentation of priorities and Areas of Research Emphasis for the Presi-dent's 2001 budget. The meeting involved ten external advisors, five from COPR and five from the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), and created enthusiasmfor new areas for collaboration across institutes. In another major effort to bring public views to bear upon the NIH 's programs, priorities, and activities, 26 individuals from outside the agency \u2014scientists, physi- cians, other health-care providers, patients, and representatives of the ACD and theCOPR \u2014met in October to evaluate the scientific quality and relevance of the out- comes of NIH research, a requirement of the Government Performance and ResultsAct. A report of their assessment has been sent to the Congress as part of the Presi-dent's budget. Realizing the Potential of the fiscal year 2001 Budget Request Generous increases in the last two budget cycles have allowed the NIH to begin many new programs. The funds requested for fiscal year 2001 will advance theseprograms and, with sound management, allow us to begin new ones. To ensure thatNIH can support new initiatives that offer the most promise of expanding knowl-edge and improving health, and to ensure our ability to support a healthy numberof new and young investigators, we will limit growth in commitments and in thesize of awards to a two percent average increase for new and continuing grantawards. In addition to initiatives on mental health, cancer, and diabetes, new activi-ties include: Clinical Research. \u2014To take full advantage of rapid research advances in the last five years, which have provided abundant new therapies to study, the NIH willbegin a series of programs to expand clinical research. Career development pro-grams will continue to improve the number and quality of investigators. We willstart new pilot and early-phase clinical trials thereby speeding the testing of newtherapies. We will develop new, and expand older, networks for multi-center studiesof pediatric cardiovascular disease, diabetes, digestive diseases, and treatment fordrug abuse. We will establish new multi-center clinical trials to evaluate com- plementary and alternative medical practices for insomnia, pain relief, and liver dis-eases. Moreover, the public will have greater access to new information on an ex-panded national clinical trials database (ClinicalTrials.gov) to be launched soon . Itwill carry information on the many clinical trials funded by the NIH, by other fed-eral agencies, and by industry.133 Health Disparities. \u2014The NIH has a central role to play in eliminating persistent, even increasing, health disparities through medical research, research training, anddissemination of scientifically sound medical information. In fiscal year 2001, theNIH will continue to invest in this area, allocating $20 million to establish a newCoordinating Center for Research on Health Disparities within the Office of the NIHDirector. A new trans-NIH Working Group will develop a strategic plan to eliminateor reduce health disparities among different segments of the American population. The plan, will include goals, timetables, and mechanisms for tracking budgets andaccomplishments. Genetic Medicine. \u2014Last November, the Human Genome project finished sequenc- ing one billion of the estimated three billion base pairs of human DNA and depos-ited them in GenBank, NIH 's public database, thus putting us on schedule to have a working draft of the full human genome by this spring. Scientists can use thisinformation to find the genes involved, e.g., in heart diseases, cancer, epilepsy, Alz-heimer 's, and psychiatric disorders. Companion activities, like developing genomic resources for organisms such as mice, rats, and fruit flies, will help speed the ar-rival of more precise medical interventions. We are rapidly moving to a time whendiagnosis, treatment and even prevention will depend on a precise understandingof the genetic makeup of an individual. Neurosciences. \u2014This is a particularly exciting time for expansion of research in fields of neuroscience, such as neurogenetics and imaging. To foster collaborationand sharing of ideas among the many Institutes which support intramural researchin this area, we are requesting funds for construction of a facility for the new Na-tional Neuroscience Research Center to house outstanding trans-NIH neuroscienceresearch programs. A total of $73 million is requested over two years, with $47 ad-vance for fiscal year 2002. Other Sciences, Including Biomedical Computing. \u2014Many medical advances build on the knowledge and technology of other scientific disciplines. To exploit our newunderstanding of biological processes, we need new teams of diverse and skilled re-searchers to overcome complex technological and research problems. In fiscal year2001, NIH will establish an Office of Bioengineering and Bioimaging to help the In-stitutes and Centers set priorities in these areas of science and to enhance collabo-ration with other agencies. Based on a report by outside experts, NIH has developed the Biomedical Informa- tion Science and Technology Initiative to work toward an intellectual fusion of bio-medicine and information technology. In fiscal year 2001, the NIH plans to providethe infrastructure to train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, to de-velop new means for storing, managing, and accessing vast data collections, and toenhance basic research in biomedical computing. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening statement. I will be glad to respond to any questions. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. YVONNE T. M ADDOX Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: I am pleased to be here today to dis- cuss the fiscal year 2001 budget request for the Office of the Director (OD). The ODprovides leadership and coordination for the research activities of NIH, both extra-mural and intramural. The OD also is responsible for a number of special programsand for management of centralized support services essential to the operation of theentire NIH. The President has proposed that the OD receive $262.5 million in fiscal year 2001, an increase of $25.2 million over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. In-cluding the estimated allocation for AIDS in both years, total support proposed forthe OD is $309.0 million, an increase of $27.0 million over the fiscal year 2000 ap-propriation. Funds for OD efforts in AIDS research are included within the Officeof AIDS Research budget request. The OD guides and supports research by setting priorities; allocating funding among these priorities; developing policies based on scientific opportunities and eth-ical and legal considerations; maintaining peer review processes; providing oversightof grant and contract award functions and of intramural research; communicatinghealth information to the public; facilitating the transfer of technology to the privatesector; and providing fundamental management and administrative services such asbudget and financial accounting, and personnel, property, and procurement manage-ment, administration of equal employment practices, and plant management serv-ices, including environmental and public safety regulations of facilities. The prin-cipal OD offices providing these activities include the Office of Extramural Research(OER), the Office of Intramural Research (OIR), and the Offices of: Science Policy;134 Communications and Public Liaison; Legislative Policy and Analysis; Equal Oppor- tunity; Budget; and Management. This request contains funds to support the func-tions of these offices. The OD also maintains several trans-NIH offices and programs to foster and en- courage research on specific, important health needs. I will now discuss the budgetrequests for each of these trans-NIH offices in greater detail. HEALTH DISPARITIES , THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON MINORITY HEALTH , AND THE MINORITY HEALTH INITIATIVE The Secretary, through the Department 's Healthy People 2010 initiative, has made a major commitment to reduce health disparities affecting minorities andother medically underserved socioeconomic groups of Americans. To address theseinequities, NIH has established health disparities research as a budget priority andan area of emphasis. This year, we have established the Office of Research on Mi-nority Health (ORMH) as the Coordinating Center for developing a trans-NIH Stra-tegic Plan for Health Disparities that will integrate the various research activitiesof the ICs toward the goal of significantly reducing health disparities. Additionally,in fiscal year 2001, NIH is requesting $20 million in new funding and related legis-lative authority for the Coordinating Center to award grants for minority health re-search under exceptional circumstances, when the Institutes and Centers do notfund such research that has been identified as a priority. The Minority Health Initiative (MHI) is a comprehensive, trans-NIH program with a focus on developing and testing ways to reduce the disproportionate burdenof disease among minority populations and on developing strategies to promote posi-tive health behaviors across the life span. The MHI specifically targets the elimi-nation of health disparities experienced by racial and ethnic minority populationsin four key areas: infant mortality; breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screeningand management; cardiovascular disease; and complications arising from diabetes.The MHI will also support the Minority Institution Cancer Center Partnerships de-signed to create collaborative relationships between institutions that primarily serveminorities and the NCI-designated cancer centers to conduct research, training, edu-cation, and outreach activities that focus on the disproportionate incidence of cancerin ethnic minority populations. THE OFFICE OF DISEASE PREVENTION The Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) has several specific programs/offices that strive to place new emphasis on the prevention and treatment of disease. In fiscal year 2001, the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) will continue to de- velop the Dietary Supplements Research Centers Initiative. Currently, three suchCenters are being funded in conjunction with the National Center for Complemen-tary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the National Institute of General MedicalSciences (NIGMS), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(NIEHS), and the Office of Research on Women 's Health (ORWH). The long-term goal of the Initiative is to fund eight Centers, four on botanicals and four on othercategories of dietary supplements. The ODS will continue to support investigator-initiated research through the Research Enhancement Awards Program (REAP),and through collaborations with other Institutes and Centers at NIH. In continuing efforts to inform the public about the benefits and risks of dietary supplements, the ODS plans to release a new computer information database on die-tary supplements, and will offer, with the NIH Clinical Center, the first collectionof public-oriented information pages (fact sheets) on specific dietary supplements, inprint and through Internet access. ODS will follow with a series of fact sheets forbotanical and herbal supplements to be released in collaboration with NCCAM. Another component of ODP, the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD), supports research activities on rare diseases and conditions, develops and disseminates information tohealth care providers and patient support groups, and forges links among investiga-tors with ongoing research activities in this area. The ORD continues to supportworkshops and symposia to stimulate research and to identify research opportuni-ties related to rare diseases. The effectiveness of these workshops as a valid mecha-nism to stimulate research on rare diseases and conditions is now being evaluated. THE OFFICE OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES RESEARCH As NIH continues its efforts to improve health outcomes, there is increasing awareness that many of our most serious health concerns are related to individualbehaviors and social context. In fact, four health-damaging behaviors-tobacco use,physical inactivity, dietary patterns, and alcohol abuse \u2014are responsible for nearly 40 percent of the annual deaths in our Nation. The Office of Behavioral and Social135 Sciences Research (OBSSR) works to integrate a psychological and social perspective across all research programs at NIH and to increase the support for behavioral andsocial science research and training. One strategy that OBSSR uses to increase support for behavioral and social sciences research is the development of broad trans-NIH initiatives that addressissues relevant to many Institutes and Centers. In order to gain a better under-standing of the obstacles and facilitators to engaging in healthy behaviors, OBSSRand 16 other NIH Offices, Institutes and Centers recently specifically solicited grantproposals for research on disease prevention through behavior change which focusedon tobacco use, insufficient exercise, poor diet and alcohol abuse. The OBSSR, withseveral ICs, also supports centers to investigate aspects of the interactions betweenmind and body in health and disease. In addition, OBSSR has joined with 12 Insti-tutes to solicit grant applications addressing the problem of inadequate adherenceto prescribed medications and therapies. OBSSR has long been concerned about the issue of violence in our society as a public health problem, and has worked to establish a trans-NIH Expert Panel onYouth Violence. This panel found that more research on youth violence interven-tions was needed. Subsequently, OBSSR developed a trans-NIH grant solicitationfor interventions to prevent and reduce youth violence. THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN 'S HEALTH The Office of Research on Women 's Health (ORWH) is the focal point for women 's health research at NIH and strives to ensure that research supported by NIH ad-dresses the health concerns of women, that women are appropriately included assubjects in research protocols and clinical trials, and that women are encouraged topursue careers in medical research. The science-based activities of ORWH are deter-mined by the Agenda for Research on Women 's Health for the 21st Century, an agenda developed following public hearings and scientific workshops involving some1,500 representatives dedicated to improving the health of women. In fiscal year2001, the ORWH will pursue a number of recommendations within this agenda in-cluding research on the effects on women of therapeutic agents, studies to developgender-based treatments for kidney disease, studies that address prevention andelimination of lung cancer in women. In addition, the ORWH will support career de-velopment programs that encourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary research careersrelevant to women 's health and encourage patient-oriented or population-based clin- ical research careers. Finally, ORWH will continue to monitor compliance with es-tablished policies for the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research. OTHER OD ACTIVITIES The OD also supports a number of additional NIH programs that promote re- search and enhance research career development. The Office of Extramural Research (OER) coordinates the Academic Research En- hancement Award (AREA) program to provide grants to institutions that award de-grees in health sciences but are not major recipients of NIH grant funds. Theseawards enable college students to participate in research projects and encouragethem to pursue careers in medical research. OER also sponsors the Extramural As-sociates Research Development Award (EARDA) program to provide competitivelyawarded grants to institutions that have a significant enrollment of underrep-resented minority students who, with their faculty, participate in medical researchprograms. The grants are designed to provide faculty at these institutions withskills needed to become more competitive in obtaining Federally sponsored researchfunds. In May of fiscal year 2000, the Office of Bioengineering/Bioimaging (OBB) will be established within the OER to advance the fields of bioengineering and bioimaging.OBB will foster new collaborations among the biomedical and engineering/physicalsciences with the goals of developing innovative technologies and novel products forimproving human health. The OBB will develop and coordinate programs for transdisciplinary training and career development, sponsor major symposia and smaller meetings aimed at en-hancing communication among the biomedical and engineering/physical science com-munities, and focus attention on research in bioengineering and bioimaging. TheOBB will also coordinate the Bioengineering Consortium (BECON), which consistsof senior bioengineering representatives from all NIH research institutes and cen-ters and other federal agencies. The OER request will also provide funds for the new Extramural Clinical Re- search Loan Repayment Program. This program is designed to counter economicbarriers to the pursuit of clinical research careers and to provide an incentive to en-136 gage in this area of research. The program will award contracts to repay the edu- cational costs of health professionals conducting clinical research in extramural in-stitutions who agree to enter into two-year service contracts to pursue clinical re-search. The NIH, through the Office of Intramural Research (OIR), maintains intramural loan repayment and scholarship programs as important instruments for recruitinghigh quality candidates in basic and clinical research positions. The request con-tains funds for the NIH Clinical Research Loan Repayment Program and the Under-graduate Scholarship Program, both for individuals from disadvantaged back-grounds, and for the General Research Loan Repayment Program. Each programprovides for the payment of educational costs in return for specific commitments ofservice in NIH 's intramural research facilities. The Office of Science Policy (OSP) has a role in addressing science policy issues on behalf of NIH and in coordinating several science education activities. Specifi-cally, the OSP has developed, with the Institutes and Centers, curriculum supple-ments to complement existing science curricula in grades K -12 that benefit both students and teachers and encourage students to consider careers in research. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. I will be pleased to answer questions. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. RICHARD D. K LAUSNER Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to appear before you for the fifth time to describe our progress in and hopes for the programs of the Na-tional Cancer Institute (NCI). I would also like to recognize with personal sadnessthat this will be the last hearing where I will have the pleasure of appearing beforeour remarkable Chairman, Mr. Porter. THE BURDEN OF CANCER Each year, I have begun this testimony by reporting one critical measure of the cancer burden, the annual statistics of cancer incidence, survival rates and mor-tality. We have recently begun to review the latest numbers and the decrease inoverall cancer mortality rates first observed in the early 1990s are accelerating be-tween 1995 and 1997, the latest year for which we have data. Drops continue to be seen for the four major cancer sites of lung, colorectal, breast and prostate. Can-cer sites where mortality rates are still increasing include liver and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma. Overall, mortality rate drops are seen in both the black and white popu-lation. Remarkably, the magnitude of these drops are such that, for the first time,between 1996 and 1997, the total number of cancer deaths did not rise, despite agrowing and aging population. As this Subcommittee has discussed before, the burden of cancer is not equally experienced across our population. Monitoring rates and trends over time, by geog-raphy, by gender, age and racial and ethnic groups has been a priority for the NCI.We are particularly concerned about the disproportionate burden of cancer amongthe poor, the medically underserved and among certain ethnic minorities. In re-sponse to our planning processes, we are in the midst of a number of expansionsin our programs aimed at the ability to assess, explain and affect the unequal bur-den of cancer. These expanded and new initiatives address the important messageof last year 's Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on the unequal burden of cancer. We are in the process of expanding the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Re- sults (SEER) program (our cancer surveillance program) to enhance coverage ofrural whites and blacks, non-Mexican Hispanics and Native Americans. We are com-pleting a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) to formalize collaboration and integration of theNCI's surveillance and surveillance research programs with the CDC 's National Pro- gram of Cancer Registries. This will allow a strategic integration of the NCI 's more intensive surveillance and research system with the CDC-funded state registry sys-tems, to help develop data standards and tools for pooling data. In fiscal year 2000, we will begin to fund a new research program to create Spe- cial Population Networks (SPNs) for cancer control and research. These new con-sortia will be based within various communities serving different segments of our137 diverse society in order to establish cancer control and research infrastructures to work within and to serve these communities. To support the activities of theseSPNs, we are establishing a cancer control academy at the NCI for training and willlink these community-based research networks to the full range of information andcommunication resources of the NCI. These SPNs, we hope, will provide the basisfor a new national platform for cancer research to address the distinct cancer bur-dens of special populations. We are setting aside $50 -60 million over five years to fund about 14 SPNs, the largest program of its kind we have ever funded. This year, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health, we began funding five research partnerships between NCI-designated cancer centersand minority institutions to create active and successful research programs linkedto our most successful cancer research institutions. We plan to release a new Re-quest for Applications (RFA) to sustain and enhance these new enterprises. A morecomplete description of our activities in this crucial area can be found at the NCIOffice of Special Populations Research Web site (www.ospr.nci.nih.gov). Monitoring cancer incidence and mortality trends can help us formulate questions about the distribution of cancer control and care, as well as about possible causesof cancer. This year, the NCI released, for the second time in its history, 25-yearcancer mortality maps. These cover all 3,100 United States counties and state eco-nomic areas, for 40 cancer sites, by gender and race. These maps are available onthe NCI Web site in a user-friendly and dynamic format. They do not tell us causesof cancer or indeed whether a geographic pattern reveals either a localized environ-mental factor, a behavioral pattern or a socio-economic pattern. But, by providingthe starting point for addressing these issues, these maps are crucial resources. TheNCI will release a Request for Application (RFA) to support two types of studieslinked to these maps: epidemiologic research to search for explanations for geo-graphic and temporal cancer patterns, and methodologic research to develop Geo-graphic Information Systems (GIS) for evaluating environmental associations withcancer. These maps are one part of NCI 's extensive ($472 million in fiscal year 1999) program in establishing environmental (exogenous) causes of cancer. PROGRESS IN BASIC RESEARCH Progress in our understanding of the biology of cancer continues at an astonishing pace. Let me highlight two examples. For decades, scientists have tried to define theminimum number of molecular changes and the number and nature of molecularpathways that must be perturbed to turn a normal cell into a cancer cell. This year,NCI-funded investigators identified that alterations of only three genes and four mo-lecular pathways are sufficient to transform a normal human cell to one capable ofproducing a tumor. These identified pathways are already providing long-sought tar-gets for new therapeutics. Identifying the specific molecular pathways that defineeach type of human cancer has allowed us to begin to replicate these changes inthe genes of mice. As predicted, these mice develop cancer and for the first time,we can accurately mimic human cancer in the mouse. This is allowing us to finallytest whether molecular changes associated with human cancer and its developmentare actually the causes of the progression and behavior of cancer. To accelerate theoutput of these breakthroughs and to use them to discover and test ways of pre-venting and curing cancer, we have established the Mouse Models of Human Can-cers Consortium, an international collaboration of over 70 institutions. This consor-tium will support the development and validation of mouse models for human can-cer. It is a new research structure that will enable the sharing of reagents and ex-pertise, the development and dissemination of new technologies, the establishmentof standards and prioritization of research questions. We hope to expand the activi-ties of the MMHCC to support the development and utilization of these importantnew cancer research tools. NEW APPROACHES TO DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS The knowledge that cancer cells develop by changing their molecular profile has set the stage for a new and systematic approach to both early detection and accu-rate diagnosis. Three years ago, the NCI set out to establish a full index of all thegenes that are altered in each type of cancer. This project, called the Cancer Ge-nome Anatomy Project or CGAP, has been extremely successful, identifying tags forthe vast majority of human genes, annotating what types of cells and cancers ex-press those genes, developing catalogues of chromosomal changes in cancer and dis- covering common genetic variations that will help to explain why individuals aredifferent in their risk of getting cancer, their sensitivity to diet and the environmentand their response to therapy. CGAP has become one of the most widely used138 sources of information and reagents in the research world (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ncicgap/). As we approach a complete list of all of the molecular tags associated with each cancer and its development, we can systematically search for ''markers '' for the early detection of cancer. To utilize the wealth of discovery coming from CGAP in the de-velopment of cancer markers, we have created a new national research infrastruc-ture, called the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN). The EDRN is a noveland complex research structure established to discover, develop and validate mark-ers for the early detection of cancer. Researchers from multiple institutions willwork together to assure that potential markers are prioritized, developed into reli-able and standardized assays and validated on readily available and well character-ized clinical materials. Four components of the EDRN are now funded: (1) Markerdiscovery laboratories (18 institutions); (2) Marker development laboratories (2 insti-tutions); (3) Clinical and Epidemiology Centers (8 institutions); and (4) a data andstatistical center. In its first year, the EDRN will focus on markers for breast, pros-tate, ovarian, lung and GI cancers. Systematic gene discovery through CGAP and other projects is about to pro- foundly change our approach to the classification and therefore the accurate diag-nosis of cancer. To do this has required the development and dissemination of newtechnologies to read the complete molecular profiles of cancer. To enable this, theNCI funded the establishment of 24 ''microarray '' centers across the country. Next, the Institute announced a new funding initiative called the Director 's Challenge whose goal is to identify new molecular classification schemes for cancer to replacethe purely histologic schemes of the last century. The initial funding established 10consortia involving 24 institutions addressing breast, prostate, ovarian, andcolorectal cancers as well as lymphomas and leukemias. Already, results from thesegroups are revealing new types and subtypes of cancer that appear to predict whichpatients will respond to particular therapies. This year, we hope to expand this pro-gram to more types of cancer and to define the clinical implications of these newclasses of cancers to help predict prognosis and guide the choice of therapy. IMAGING CANCER Four years ago, the NCI identified imaging as one of its extraordinary opportuni- ties for investment. We have developed new funding mechanisms for exploratory, in-novative grants (almost 150 grants received), the establishment of six small animalimaging centers, and the establishment of a national clinical trials network to rap-idly evaluate the clinical utility of new imaging approaches. This network, called theAmerican College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) has a number of clinicaltrials in preparation including a comparison of Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Com-puted Tomography (CT) in gynecologic malignancies, the use of Positron EmissionTomography (PET) to follow response to chemotherapy, the value of spiral CT forlung cancer screening, comparative studies of virtual colonoscopy and of digitalmammography. We are also funding the development of centers to foster the newfield of functional imaging, whereby we can detect not only the presence of a tumorbut query its molecular characteristics and its behavior. This year, we will be ableto fund 2 -3 full multi-disciplinary In Vivo Cell and Molecular Imaging Centers (ICMICs). In addition, 27 institutions have applied to receive planning grants to de-velop such centers. This year, we created the Unconventional Innovations Program(UIP) aimed at developing truly novel detection and imaging systems by bringingrevolutionary technologies of molecular sensing, nanoscale devices and micro-explorers to enable the remote sensing of cancer. We have funded six consortia ofinvestigators to be part of this program and hope to add more members in responseto a second release of this Broad Agency Announcement. Over the past year, ourinvestment in imaging research and technology has increased 30 percent. Finally this year, the NCI organized a unique forum to bring together academics, industry (through the National Electrical Manufacturer 's Association), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) tocoordinate practices relevant to the development, testing and adoption of new imag-ing modalities and applications. This collaborative enterprise will be a standingforum to facilitate communication and progress in this critical area. MOLECULAR TARGETS \u2014NEW APPROACHES TO PREVENTION & TREATMENT For the past three years, the NCI has been redirecting its drug discovery program to one based on the success of basic research in identifying the precise moleculartargets implicated in the development (prevention targets) and behavior/survival(therapeutic targets) of cancer. The recent encouraging results of Herceptin for thetreatment of advanced breast cancer, Rituximab for the treatment of non-Hodgkin 's139 lymphoma, STI 571 for the treatment of leukemia, tamoxifen for reducing the risk of breast cancer and a growing list of others, all point to the future face of molecu-larly targeted therapeutics and preventives. We have funded four new centers to de-velop new libraries of chemical diversity and to screen for promising molecular tar-gets, and this year, we will fund new Centers of Excellence for drug development,each of which will focus on specific cancer pathways to speed the discovery of usefultargets. Last year, we initiated a novel program called RAID (Rapid Access to Intervention Development) that evaluates promising drug candidates in the laboratories of aca-demic investigators and, via peer review, manages the movement of these candidatedrugs from the lab to the point of clinical trial. To date, 32 novel agents have en-tered the RAID pipeline and in one year 4 have reached or are ready for clinicaltrials. We will expand this successful program in the coming year. CLINICAL TRIALS \u2014A CORNERSTONE OF PROGRESS FOR PATIENTS Last year, the NCI supported over 1500 clinical trials in prevention and treat- ment, covering virtually all human cancers and asking a wide variety of clinicalquestions. We initiated the formal restructuring of our national clinical trials sys-tem, as described to the Subcommittee last year. This restructuring is aimed at im-proving the quality of scientific questions asked, increasing the speed and efficiencyand decreasing the administrative burdens of participating in clinical trials. Fur-thermore, it aims to assure that all patients and all participating physicians have access to the full menu of available clinical trials. This year, we continued the devel-opment and deployment of a standard informatics system, funded a central ClinicalTrials Support Unit to serve the entire national clinical trials system and began dis-ease-specific state-of-the-science meetings to develop prioritized clinical trials ques-tions and opportunities. This past year, 20,000 new patients were enrolled in NCI-sponsored treatment trials. Over the past three fiscal years, our investment in ournational clinical trials program has increased almost 43 percent. Clinical trials are complicated enterprises, and streamlining and improving their function while maintaining the highest standards of rigor, care and protection ofhuman subjects requires attention to many different facets of the initiation, review,approval, funding, oversight and management of trials. This year, we have contin-ued to expand the use of simplified and uniform informed consent documents andin the spring, in collaboration with the Office for Protection from Research Risks(OPRR), we will begin an important pilot project to test the feasibility and perform-ance of a central Institutional Review Board (IRB) for multi-institutional trials. This year, we unveiled a new, user-friendly clinical trials information system to enable patients and physicians to readily access information about all NCI-spon-sored trials (www.cancernet.nci.nih.gov). We continue to work with the FDA and in-dustry to expand this database to include industry and other sponsored trials. Each year, clinical trials results help shape the course of clinical practice and set the stage for new questions that need to be addressed. This year, we saw the first,long-awaited results on the value of high dose chemotherapy with peripheral stemcell or bone marrow rescue for women with advanced breast cancer. These resultsdid not support the significant and hoped-for benefits that this approach dem-onstrated in earlier, non-randomized clinical trials. These results underscored thecrucial role that such clinical trials play in the type of evidence-based medicine towhich we all aspire. In the past two years, the results of clinical trials have set newstandards for increasing the effectiveness and reducing the toxicity of regimens forchildhood cancers, leukemia, myeloma, breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS), cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, prostatecancer and others. QUALITY CANCER CARE \u2014A RESEARCH AGENDA One of the themes of NCI activities is to address gaps \u2014gaps between what we need to know and our current state of knowledge, gaps between the burden of can-cer across different segments of our population, and gaps between scientific dis-covery and medical breakthroughs. One of the most important gaps is between evi-dence-based best practice and actual practice. It is this last gap that we intend toaddress via a new major initiative called the Quality Cancer Care Committee(QCCC). This initiative was formulated in response to a recent report of the Na-tional Cancer Policy Board (NCPB) called ''Ensuring Quality Cancer Care. '' The NCPB was established at my request as part of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) ofthe National Academy of Sciences. Its purpose is to provide a forum of independentand broad-based expertise to advise the Nation on cancer-related policy issues. TheQCCC will be a trans-agency initiative led by the NCI to develop a comprehensive140 research infrastructure to address the issues of quality cancer care across the cancer continuum from prevention to treatment to survivorship and end-of-life care; and toprovide a mechanism whereby the health delivery and reimbursement activities ofDHHS, especially HCFA, are informed by a discussion of evidence and through di-rect interaction with the cancer research agenda of the various research agenciesof the Department. The research agenda of the QCCC will focus in four areas: 1)developing measures of cancer outcomes; 2) strengthening the methodologic and em-piric base for quality assessment; 3) strengthening the national clinical trials infra-structure; and 4) improving the quality of cancer communications. I am pleased to present the President 's non-AIDS budget request for NCI for fis- cal year 2001, a sum of $3.25 billion which reflects an increase of $183 million overthe comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation forAIDS, total support requested for NCI is $3.505 billion an increase of $193 millionover the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NCI efforts in AIDS researchare included within the Office of AIDS Research budget request. With this, we cansustain the many new and productive programs, some of which I have tried to illus-trate in this testimony. NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Gov- ernment Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the perform-ance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 re- sults to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our performancemeasures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indi-cators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continuously im-prove programs across the NIH and the Department. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. CLAUDE LENFANT Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to address this Com- mittee, once again, on behalf of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(NHLBI). During the latter half of the Twentieth Century, tremendous progress wasmade in improving the health of the American public. Research supported by theNHLBI was instrumental in enabling us to diminish, halt, and eventually reversethe epidemic of deaths from two major chronic diseases \u2014coronary heart disease and stroke. Vital statistics indicate that, since its peak in 1963, the death rate for coro-nary disease has fallen 60 percent and the rate for stroke fell 66 percent during thattime period. This has been a tremendous achievement. Nonetheless, these two diseases have retained their ranking as the first and third most common causes of death in the United States and, during the past decade,mortality has not fallen as rapidly as it once did. We have, in a sense, weeded outmany of the ''easy'' cases; those that remain are more complex and demand far more sophisticated solutions. Our challenge is twofold: first, to make maximal use of thenew technologies that are rapidly becoming available and, second, to ensure that''real world '' health practices reflect a rapid and thorough utilization of the knowl- edge that we have acquired. Both are essentially matters of closing the gap betweenwhat can be done and what is being done. PROGRAMS FOR GENOMIC ANALYSIS The generous increases in funding that the NIH has received in the past several years have provided extraordinary opportunities to invest in cutting-edge researchprograms to capitalize on the new technologies. As you know, the Human GenomeProject is on the verge of producing its draft ''blueprint '' for the entire genetic make- up of humankind, which will be invaluable to the research community. In anticipa-tion of this tremendous resource of data and technologies, the NHLBI is establishingPrograms for Genomic Analysis in cardiovascular, lung, and blood diseases andsleep disorders. This ambitious new undertaking will call upon the expertise andcollaboration of scientists from a wide variety of disciplines \u2014and often from diverse geographical areas \u2014to identity relevant genes, understand their function, and test hypotheses about the causes and treatments of disease. An essential requirementof the Programs is that the information and reagents generated will be made imme-diately and freely available to the research community, a practice that will enablea broad range of investigators to exploit the promising opportunities provided bythis fast-moving field. This initiative has generated tremendous enthusiasm withinthe research community, and it promises to advance our knowledge of health anddiseases in ways that could not have been dreamed of a decade ago.141 PROGRAMS OF EXCELLENCE IN GENE THERAPY Despite the recent troubling publicity about gene therapy, the NHLBI remains committed to pursuing this approach because of its potential usefulness for manyintractable diseases. We just have to do it right. Accordingly, we are establishingcomprehensive Programs of Excellence in Gene Therapy that will focus on rapidtranslation of findings from basic research into pilot studies in human volunteers,with appropriate attention to safeguarding the welfare of the patients. A major goalof this initiative will be to provide shared access to specialized services such as pre-clinical toxicology testing and the development of ''vectors '' to ferry therapeutic genes to their target tissues. The promise of gene therapy to cure hemophilia, cysticfibrosis, sickle cell disease, and other devastating diseases has long been recognized,but the path to its fulfillment has been fraught with many difficulties. We believethat this coordinated approach will make it a reality. USING MRI TO DIAGNOSE HEART ATTACK A pilot program at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda is testing a new approach to diagnosing heart attack patients who may be candidates for thrombolytic therapy.The value of this clot-dissolving treatment in limiting damage from a heart attackhas been well established for some time. However, its effectiveness is highly depend-ent on the promptness with which it is administered, and many patients have nothad the opportunity to benefit from this approach. We have been working throughour National Heart Attack Alert Program to reduce delays in treatment, and datafrom the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction indicate that the time betweenarrival at the emergency room and administration of thrombolytic therapy has beenreduced from 60 minutes to about 35 minutes in patients for whom an EKG is diag-nostic of a heart attack. However, for many patients, diagnosis currently requiresmeasurement of enzymes that appear in the bloodstream only hours after the heartattack has occurred \u2014too late for effective thrombolysis. The experimental program at Suburban Hospital is using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) technology, whichcan provide a diagnosis in about 35 minutes. In light of recent evidence that thrombolytic therapy may also benefit patients who experience a thrombotic stroke,we have also teamed up with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders andStroke to use MRI in evaluating patients who come to the emergency room withstroke symptoms. We have every confidence that this program will form the basisfor an entirely new approach to delivering prompt treatment to patients who arelikely to benefit from it. CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORKS During the past few years, the NHLBI has been an innovator in establishing clin- ical research networks to close the gap between what is known about the causesand mechanisms of disease and the tools that are available to treat them. Thesenetworks maintain a core structure of clinical centers and a data coordinating cen-ter that collaborate in conducting high-quality, systematic, rigorous clinical re-search. The advantage is that promising findings from basic research can rapidlybe translated into information to assist the practicing physician in making the bestpossible decisions about how to treat patients. We began in 1994 with clinical re-search networks for adult asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),and then moved on to develop such a network for pediatric asthma. This year, weare establishing a Thalassemia Clinical Research Network, which is expected to pro-vide an invaluable resource for evaluating new therapies for patients with Cooley 's anemia, who are few in number and widely scattered across the country. We havealso announced plans for a similar effort in pediatric cardiovascular medicine, whichwill enable rigorous testing of both medical and surgical approaches to treating avariety of cardiovascular malformations in children. Our experience with the ARDS Clinical Network illustrates the value of this ap- proach. ARDS is a form of respiratory failure that affects about 150,000 Americansannually \u2014many of whom were previously healthy \u2014and kills about half of them. We have struggled with it for 30 years, but made very little headway, in part becauseof the daunting logistics of attempting to conduct timely and meaningful clinicaltrials in large numbers of critically ill patients. The ARDS Network, established in1996, has already moved the field forward immeasurably by establishing the effec-tiveness of an innovative approach to mechanical ventilation. The new approach wasshown to reduce mortality by 25 percent \u2014a remarkable achievement for a disease in which mortality had remained stubbornly high despite many years of research.The results of this study are currently being implemented in intensive care units142 throughout the world. It is evident that clinical research networks save time, save money, and produce results of tangible value to the patient. FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT One of the most promising new developments that we foresee is the increasing ability to understand individual susceptibility to a disease, or individual responseto an intervention, so that we can target our treatments accordingly. We currentlyemploy many broad \u2014brush approaches in the expectation that at least a portion of the population will benefit. For example, we recommend that everybody limit so-dium intake to prevent high blood pressure \u2014prudent advice, in that the subset of people who are sensitive to salt will profit and no harm will come to others. All thesame, it makes for a fairly ''weak '' public health message that has not been univer- sally adopted. On the horizon, however, are several promising tests to identify saltsensitivity; they may enable us to more narrowly focus our dietary recommendationsand, thereby, gain the attention of individuals who most need to heed them. A second example is in the area of sudden cardiac death, a fatal arrhythmia that claims the lives of about 150,000 Americans annually. There is much recent interestin placing automatic defibrillators in public places to ''rescue '' victims of this mal- ady, and we have just initiated a community-based research program on the topic.However, this is an after-the-fact approach, and it is clear that much more couldbe achieved in the long run if we were able to identify susceptibility to fatal ar-rhythmias and initiate preventive measures. In this regard, we are greatly encour-aged by research that points to two possible approaches. One, called T-wavealternans, is a measure of irregular electrical activity of the heart that appears tocorrelate with the potential for life-threatening arrhythmia. An even simpler ap-proach \u2014which might someday, for instance, be used by coaches to screen young ath- letes \u2014is suggested by the recent finding that a delay in the return of the heart rate to a normal pace after exercise is strongly predictive of mortality. Of course, the hope of understanding individual response to treatment or indi- vidual variations in the course of a disease is what drives our efforts to unravel thegenetic basis of disease, and we are looking at many diseases in this light. Withregard to congestive heart failure, for instance, scientists have recently reportedthat a fairly common gene variation is associated with disease severity, and we seemuch potential for ultimately developing approaches targeted to patients whose dis-ease is likely to follow a rapid downhill course. Particularly aggressive efforts arebeing made with respect to sickle cell disease, which has long been a puzzle becauseall patients have the same genetic ''mis-code '' yet the severity of the disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. We recently initiated a new research program to iden-tify other aspects of a person 's genetic make-up that modulate disease severity. This work has taken on particular urgency because we now have a cure for sickle celldisease in the form of stem cell transplantation, but we have been reluctant to useit in this country because it is literally a cure that can kill. If we were able to distin-guish, early in life, the patients who will suffer severely from the disease, it wouldopen the door to applying this treatment selectively in cases where the potentialbenefits substantially outweigh the risks. ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES Despite impressive strides toward our goal of disease prevention, we are acutely aware that not all segments of society have benefitted equally from this trend.Death rates from cardiovascular diseases, for example, are disproportionately highamong U.S. blacks \u2014and among blacks in Mississippi, they are the highest in the nation. The NHLBI 's Jackson Heart Study is exploring the reasons for this phe- nomenon in a long-term study of 6,500 men and women. In addition to collecting data on conventional risk factors, the study will focus on newer areas, includingearly indicators of disease, genetics, socio-cultural influences such as socioeconomicstatus and discrimination, and physiological relations between common disordersthat are related to cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, obesity, anddiabetes. We have emphasized the involvement of local people in the developmentand support of this study, and are optimistic that it will provide new directions fordisease prevention in the black community. NEUROFIBROMATOSIS As a final note, we have been asked by the Committee to comment on our activi- ties with regard to neurofibromatosis, a condition that appears to be linked to cer-tain forms of congenital heart disease. The NHLBI recently provided funding forsome research in neurofibromatosis, in the expectation that it may help unravel mo-lecular pathways that affect abnormal heart development not only in143 neurofibromatosis, but also in other conditions. The NHLBI will be working with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and other NIH componentsto develop a workshop, planned for 2000, that will summarize the current statusof NIH-supported neurofibromatosis research, identify needs and opportunities, andstimulate and focus future NIH research in this area. PRESIDENT 'S REQUEST I am pleased to present the President 's non-AIDS budget request for the NHLBI for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $2,069,582,000 which reflects an increase of$108,679,000 over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the esti-mated allocation for AIDS, total support requested for the NHLBI is $2,136,757,000,an increase of $110,327,000 over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for theNHLBI efforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Researchbudget request. GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that the Committee may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. HAROLD C. S LAVKIN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $263.1 million, whichreflects an increase of $14.1 million over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropria-tion. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, total support requested forNIDCR is $284.2 million, an increase of $15.0 million over the fiscal year 2000 ap-propriation. Funds for the NIDCR efforts in AIDS research are included within theOffice of AIDS Research budget request. DISCOVERING SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS In his classic analysis, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas S. Kuhn puts forward the concept of science as a pursuit to solve complex problems. Solvingproblems can range from a chess match between grandfather and granddaughter,to the challenges of discovering fundamental principles of biological systems, findingsolutions to health promotion in a diverse society, preventing disease, and designing''smarter '' diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases and disorders that compromise health. By discovering solutions to the complex problems posed by craniofacial, oraland dental diseases and disorders, NIDCR-funded scientists are fulfilling the mis-sion of the Institute to improve and promote health through research. BURDEN OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL DISEASES AND DISORDERS The mission of our Institute is to reduce the burden of diseases and disorders that are among the most common health problems both nationally and globally. TheNIDCR supports research ranging from the prenatal developmental processes thatform the human face and dentition, to the many local and systemic diseases anddisorders that involve craniofacial tissues and structures throughout the lifespan. These include spontaneous preterm births possibly linked to maternal oral infec-tions, birth defects like cleft lip and palate, trauma to the head, face and teeth, se-vere malocclusions, oral infectious diseases, head and neck cancers and chronic anddisabling facial pain. Oral microbial infections producing dental caries, periodontaldiseases, candidiasis and herpes lesions are common. Chronic and disabling facialpain is a major component of temporomandibular joint diseases (TMD), Bell 's palsy, trigeminal neuralgia and fibromyalgia. Oral manifestations of systemic diseasessuch as AIDS, diabetes and osteoporosis are also common. Finally, oral complica-tions from both cancer therapies and numerous therapeutic drugs often includeyeast infections termed candidiasis, xerostomia (dry mouth), aggressive dental car-ies, and severe bone loss. Health disparities are associated with the burden of these diseases and disorders, falling disproportionately upon children and adults from particular ethnic and racial144 groups, historically underrepresented minorities, and lower socioeconomic classes. To accelerate discovery of solutions to these complex problems, we plan to link re-search, training and access to oral health care using innovative and collaborativeCenters to Reduce Oral Health Disparities located in critical areas around the coun-try. The emphasis is placed on the oral health needs of children and their care-givers. We envision these Centers as partnerships between academic health scienceinstitutions, state and local health and health financing agencies, community andmigrant centers, Indian Health Service clinics, Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention (CDC)-sponsored Prevention Research Centers, minority and minority-serv-ing institutions, and other interested groups. Our strategy is to partner with theHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), CDC, the National Instituteof Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Nurs-ing Research (NINR), and the NIH Offices of Behavioral and Social Sciences Re-search, Research on Women 's Health, and Research on Minority Health, with fund- ing to begin in fiscal year 2001. GENE DISCOVERIES : THE RAPID RATE OF PROGRESS NIDCR actively supports the rapid discovery of genes related to inherited dental and craniofacial diseases and disorders, head and neck cancer genes, and genes re-lated to the pathogenicity of viral, bacterial and yeast infections in the humanmouth. The rapid rate of progress in these three areas is highlighted in. The discovery of craniofacial, oral and dental genes that are altered or mutated in more than a thousand inherited diseases, leads to smarter diagnosis and possi-bilities for improved treatments and new biomaterials. Of the 5,878 gene loci rel-evant to inherited human diseases, 1,250 of these are associated with craniofacial-oral-dental diseases and disorders. Over the last 5 years, more than several hundredmutated craniofacial regulatory and structural genes have been found to cause ab-normal formation of the skull, cranial sutures, maxilla and mandible, teeth, tongue, salivary glands, bone, cartilage, cementum, dentin, enamel and periodontal liga-ment. Curiously, many of these genes involved in craniofacial development also havefar-reaching effects, directing formation of such diverse body parts as the brain,limbs, thyroid glands, heart and kidney, and even has a role later in life with neo-plastic diseases such as the role of patched mutations in Gorlin 's syndrome. Fur- thermore, evidence is beginning to assist in solving the complexities of multiple genenetworks and their collective interactions with environmental factors. For example,variant gene forms for enzymes required for folic acid metabolism are implicated inspina bifida and craniofacial malformations. We now assume that multiple gene-en-vironment interactions produce birth defects in more than one hundred thousandbabies each year. NIDCR is actively collaborating with other NIH Institutes andfederal agencies to reduce the burden of craniofacial birth defects. Discovery of the multiple and sequential gene mutations involved in the progres- sion of oral and pharyngeal cancer will result in early diagnosis and improved treat-ments and therapeutics. The Head and Neck Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, acollaboration between NIDCR and the NCI Cancer Genome Anatomy Project(CGAP), was recently established. Genes expressed in squamous cell carcinoma andnormal head and neck epithelial tissues are being compared. This strategy is ex-pected to identify a specific combination of multiple gene mutations involved in thepremalignant to malignant neoplastic process, and will also provide clinically usefulbiomarkers that can be used for diagnosis and for monitoring the progression ofhead and neck cancers. A remaining complex problem is to determine how microbes living in homeostatic ecosystems or biofilms in the mouth become infectious pathogens. Discovery of mi-crobial genes will lead to remarkable advances in early diagnosis and targeted drugdevelopment for improved treatments of oral infectious diseases. Since Antoni vanLeeuwenhoek invented the microscope and discovered microbes growing in biofilmscrapings from his own teeth in the 17th Century, we have come to understand thatmore than 6 billion microbes live in the oral cavity, and these billions of microbesbelong to a list of more than 500 different strains that continues to expand. Just2 months ago, scientists identified 37 previously unknown strains of bacteria thatreside in the biofilms on the surfaces of teeth. To address this problem, NIDCR andother NIH Institutes have accelerated efforts to decipher the genetic lexicon of 60microbial genomes. additional microbial organisms with sig-nificant roles in oral infections are planned for the near future.145 ORAL INFECTION LINKED TO SYSTEMIC DISEASE There has been extraordinary progress in the understanding of periodontal dis- ease in the last 25 to 30 years. A most significant discovery is our new appreciationfor linkages between oral infection and systemic diseases, and this paradigm shifthas already provided important new diagnostic, preventive, early intervention andtreatment strategies for patients with periodontal diseases and beyond. The pres-ence of oral infections has been associated with systemic diseases including sponta-neous preterm births, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and diabetes. One ex-ample is particularly useful in conveying how investments in scientific research mayresult in significant human and cost savings benefits. Accumulating evidence sug-gests that maternal infections are a major risk factor for spontaneous preterm ba- bies. Preliminary findings supported by NIDCR and NICHD suggest a dose-responserelationship between the level of maternal oral infection and the risk of preterm lowbirth weight babies. The risk posed by the oral infection may prove to be amenableto treatment interventions. If successful, future intervention studies would dem-onstrate a cost effective approach to reduce some of the burden of spontaneous pre-mature births. GENES OF INFLAMMATION AND TOOTH LOSS Molecular genetic studies have discovered genes that regulate chronic inflamma- tion processes and tooth loss. Papillon-Lefe `vre syndrome (PLS) is a genetic disorder that typically affects both skin and teeth. Two new studies have discovered genemutations in the cathepsin C gene (CTSC) as the primary cause of PLS. Severeearly onset periodontitis in PLS patients is unresponsive to traditional oral thera-pies and results in premature loss of both primary and permanent teeth; in somecases, all primary teeth are lost by age 4 years and all permanent teeth are lostby age 14 years. The periodontitis infection results in severe destruction of bone tis-sue in the jaws needed to support the teeth. This new discovery demonstrates theemerging significance of gene discovery and the availability of smarter diagnosisand future therapies for the oral manifestations of systemic inflammatory diseasesand disorders. GENETICS OF TOOTH AGENESIS We are discovering that multiple gene networks are required to produce teeth. Mutations in several of these genes have been found to cause congenitally missingteeth. These molecular foundations will eventually provide the basis for the bio-mimetic design and fabrication of replacement teeth later in the 21st century. Near-ly 20 percent of the U.S. population has congenitally missing teeth. The missingteeth are often third molars, but may be any of the other teeth found in the humandentition. The forms of missing teeth ranging from least to most severe, are calledhypodontia, oligodontia, and anodontia, respectively. Recent studies identified mul-tiple gene networks that control the formation of teeth. Mutations in two of thesegenes, in particular, MSX1 and PAX9, have been discovered to cause missing teeth. The MSX1 gene is essential to tooth development and is found in chromosomes of multiple species including the fruit fly, the mouse, and humans. In a mousemodel, deletion of the MSX1 gene resulted in animals with cleft palates and noteeth. Recently, selected families with congenitally missing teeth, known as familialtooth agenesis, were found to have a mutation in the human MSX1 gene. A secondstudy, published last month, found that a mutation in the PAX9 gene resulted incongenitally missing molar teeth in three generations of a particular family. PAX9is a member of a transcription factor family of genes involved in eye, primary andsecondary palate, tooth, and thyroid gland formations. These discoveries are rapidlybecoming gene-based diagnostics for dental anomalies, and also provide a biologicalbasis for the future design and fabrication of tooth replacements. The NIH budget request includes performance information required by the Gov- ernment Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the perform-ance material is the first NIH performance report, comparing fiscal year 1999 re-sults to the goals in the fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our performancemeasures mature and trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indicators to sup-port the identification of strategies and objectives to continuously improve programsacross the NIH and the Department. Finally, I want you to know how privileged I feel to have been selected by Harold Varmus to be part of the leadership team at the NIH. It has been a unique honorto lead the world 's largest sponsor of dental, oral and craniofacial research. My ten- ure at the NIH has been memorable, including: Government shutdowns, the bliz-zard of 1996, a 50th anniversary and a name change for our Institute, growth of146 the NIDCR portfolio into significant new scientific areas, remarkable growth in NIH funding, development of novel funding mechanisms, and most recently, another bliz-zard. I especially want to thank you Mr. Porter and the Committee Members foryour confidence and support over the last 5 years as I have served as the sixth di-rector of this Institute. This coming July, my wife and I will return to our homein California and I will return to the private sector. Thank you. My colleagues andI will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. ALLEN M. S PIEGEL Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to testify on behalf of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).This year is the NIDDK 's 50th anniversary. I have been with the Institute for near- ly 27 of those 50 years \u2014for the past 3 months as Institute Director. Throughout this time I havehad the privilege of conducting and directing basic and clinical research,often in collaboration with superb investigators at many academic centers and atNIH. The unique juxtaposition of laboratories and patient facilities in the NIH Clin-ical Center has afforded me a valuable perspective on the connections between basicand clinical research. As NIDDK Director, one of my main goals will be to strength-en those connections in order to accelerate progress toward relieving the burden ofthe many chronic and costly diseases within our mission. The challenges posed bythese diseases are enormous. Significant gaps in our knowledge concerning theircauses leave us as yet unable to prevent or treat them as effectively as we wouldwish. Yet, we are poised as never before to make dramatic progress in closing thesegaps. New, powerful tools are becoming available to propel our progress. The sup-port provided to NIH and NIDDK has been greater than ever before. Thus, it is withgreat scientific excitement and optimism that I have accepted the challenge, as Di-rector of NIDDK, of leading the effort to alleviate the burden of diabetes, endocrineand metabolic diseases; digestive and nutritional disorders; and kidney, urologic andblood diseases. POWERFUL RESEARCH TOOLS Shortly, we will have in hand the sequence of the entire human genome. Merely knowing the sequence, however, does not allow one to utilize this powerful tool. Thissequence or ''book of life '' is not written in English and lacks obvious punctuation marks. An NIDDK intramural scientist has recently discovered gene ''insulators, '' a type of punctuation mark that allows a gene to be expressed without interferencefrom surrounding regions. This discovery is already finding wide application in thebiotechnology industry. Within the ''book of life '' are genes that either cause or con- tribute to many of the diseases within our mission. Our task in making full use ofthe human genome sequence is to identify all the genes within it, discover theirfunction and how changes in these genes cause disease. New tools such asmicroarray technology allow simultaneous measurement of changes in expression ofthousands of genes. Bioinformatics methods allow us to analyze vast amounts of se-quence information. These tools will help us to apply new genetic knowledge to revo-lutionize diagnosis, prevention and treatment of many diseases. Bioinformatics methods have revealed that many human genes have counterparts in the genomes of yeast, roundworm and fruitfly. The function of these genes canthus be studied at the cellular level in these experimentally simpler model orga-nisms. Vertebrate models such as zebrafish and mouse, while more difficult to studythan worms or flies, are closer in organ structure and genetic sequence to humans.Zebrafish mutants with disorders of red blood cell formation or of appetite regula-tion have been discovered. Mouse mutants expressing too much or too little of al-most any gene in any organ can now be created. Such models not only help clarifythe function of genes and their role in causing disease, but also provide systems fortesting possible treatments and preventions in ways not feasible in humans. Power-ful imaging methods are being developed that will allow detection of subtle changesat the cell and organ level, thereby helping to elucidate the causes of disease, mon-itor disease progression, and assess preventive or therapeutic measures not only inanimal models but in humans. Bioengineering approaches to cell and organ replace-ment hold great promise as well. RESEARCH ADVANCES : PKD, HEPATITIS C , AND DIABETES Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common inherited disorders and the fourth leading cause of end-stage kidney failure, according to the U.S. RenalData System. A long hunt led to identification of the gene responsible for the most147 common form of PKD, and shortly thereafter, researchers found a second gene re- sponsible for a rarer form. The molecular function of these two gene products is stillincompletely understood, but the recent surprising discovery in the roundworm \u2014 that mutations in one of the corresponding genes leads to defects in the functionsof sensory neurons \u2014opens up new avenues to understand the basic defect in PKD. Studies of PKD genes in humans have established that cyst formation is an abnor-mal growth process, analogous to benign tumor formation. Indeed, just last month,NIDDK-supported investigators reported that treatment with an inhibitor of a cel-lular receptor for a growth factor in a mouse model of PKD prevents cyst formationand dramatically enhances survival. Of course, further studies are needed beforehuman trials, but NIDDK is already supporting research to develop noninvasive im-aging methods to monitor cyst growth. Such methods will be critical in evaluatingthe effectiveness of new treatments. The CDC estimates that 4 million Americans are infected with the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of chronic hepatitis and the most com-mon reason for liver transplantation in the United States. Epidemiologic studiesshow that 70 to 80 percent of infected individuals fail to clear the virus and as manyas 20 percent of these develop chronic liver disease. Intramural NIDDK studies firstshowed that interferon, an antiviral agent, is effective in treating hepatitis C, butit completely clears the virus in only a small minority of patients. Recently, NIDDKinvestigators reported a major advance in treatment; by combining interferon withanother antiviral, ribavirin, they were able to clear the virus in up to 40 percentof patients. Developing even more effective treatments and a vaccine to prevent in-fection remain as major challenges. According to data compiled by the congressionally established Diabetes Research Working Group, diabetes affects an estimated sixteen million Americans. It is achronic and costly disease both in human and financial terms. The complications ofuncontrolled elevation in blood sugar make diabetes the leading cause of end-stagekidney failure, adult blindness, and non-traumatic amputations, and a major riskfactor for heart disease. Type 1 diabetes affects primarily children and young adults,with more than 13,000 new cases per year in the United States. This form of thedisease is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-secreting betacells of the pancreatic islets. Type 2 diabetes affects primarily adults, and is increas-ing in the United States at an alarming rate, nearly 800,000 newly diagnosed casesper year. It is caused by both reduced insulin secretion and resistance to insulin ac-tion. Genetic abnormalities contribute to both forms of diabetes, but unlike singlegene disorders such as PKD, most cases of diabetes are thought to be due to subtleabnormalities in multiple genes. Even before completion of the human genome se-quence and full deployment of new genetic tools, significant progress has been madein identifying genes that cause diabetes. Why is such information important? In type 1 diabetes, knowledge of which genes predispose to the disease should allow identification of those at risk and to whom preventive measures should be tar-geted. Advances in understanding the immune basis for type 1 diabetes have identi-fied candidate interventions to ''re-educate '' the immune system to prevent beta cell destruction. One such intervention is being tested currently in an NIDDK-supportedmulti-center trial. For those with type 1 diabetes in whom beta cell destruction hasprogressed to the point where little or no function remains, preventive measures aretoo late. The focus must be on maintaining excellent control of blood sugar, as thelandmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed clearly that intensivetreatment with insulin can prevent or delay the onset of kidney, eye and other com-plications. Trying to maintain tight control of blood sugar with insulin treatment,however, can be difficult and frustrating, particularly in children. For this reason,NIDDK is committed to supporting research both to improve existing insulin treat-ment and to find innovative, new treatments that will represent a true cure for thisdisease. Recent improvements in glucose-sensing devices that can eliminate theneed for multiple finger sticks represent a small step toward the goal of an artificialpancreas. Recent animal studies using novel methods to block the immune systemhave demonstrated the feasibility of pancreatic islet transplantation. These prom-ising results are being carefully extended to studies of kidney and islet transplantsin humans in a newly opened NIDDK branch in the NIH Clinical Center. In type 2 diabetes, genetic studies have shown that rare forms of the disease with onset at younger than usual age can be caused by single gene mutations. At leastfive such genes, each involved in some aspect of regulation of insulin secretion, havealready been identified. A striking example is the gene termed insulin promoter fac-tor-1, in which different degrees of mutation result in different conditions. Mutation of both copies of this gene leads to failure of the entire pancreas to develop. A severemutation in one copy of the gene is one cause of the rare forms of early onset type2 diabetes. Recent studies have shown that more subtle mutations of the same gene148 contribute to the more common form of type 2 diabetes by impairing insulin secre- tion. Identification of disease genes is important in providing novel targets for drugdevelopment and in enabling individualized therapy that is optimally effective foreach patient. Another recent advance illustrates how information about a drug target can be used to identify a new diabetes gene. A new class of diabetes drugs that increaseinsulin sensitivity was shown to act on a cell receptor protein termed PPAR-gamma.This led investigators to search for mutations in the gene for PPAR-gamma in type2 diabetes patients. Such mutations were found in rare patients with an early onsetform of diabetes characterized by insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and abnor-mal blood lipids. Because all of these features are frequently seen in patients with type 2 diabetes, more subtle defects in the PPAR-gamma gene may be responsiblefor more common forms of type 2 diabetes. Thus, understanding the genetic basisof even rare forms of type 2 diabetes is important, not only for care of patients withthose forms of the disease, but also for what it can tell us about the causes of morecommon forms. FUTURE RESEARCH PLANS While these advances are indicative of the important progress we have made, clearly extraordinary challenges remain for virtually all the diseases within theNIDDK mission. Indeed, the congressionally-established Diabetes Research WorkingGroup identified five extraordinary diabetes research opportunities: genetics,autoimmunity and the beta cell, cell signaling and regulation, obesity, and clinicalresearch and trials. The NIDDK intends to seize each of these opportunities. Totake full advantage of the soon available human genome sequence, we will bolstera consortium formed to identify type 2 diabetes genes and try to form a similargroup to identify type 1 diabetes genes. We will form a diabetes trial network todo pilot studies of innovative methods to prevent type 1 diabetes, as clues emergefrom studies of the mechanism of beta cell destruction. We will stimulate researchusing the most advanced methods to image islet beta cells, so that effectiveness ofdiabetes preventions can be sensitively monitored, and more rapidly tested. We willexpand our support for studies of islet transplantation in humans by establishinga consortium and an islet transplant registry so that progress may be maximized.We will form a ''Virtual Center '' of interdisciplinary investigators whose goal will be a complete understanding of the biology of the beta cell. This will include identi-fication of every gene expressed at every developmental stage and their regulatoryinteractions, so that we would ultimately know how a stem cell differentiates to be-come a beta cell. It would include elucidation of all the signaling pathways regu-lating insulin secretion, so that we would know every step at which this process canmalfunction and identify new targets for correction. We will form a consortium ofinvestigators who will create new mouse models to understand the causes and testpossible treatments for the complications of diabetes. We will launch a major newtrial to study whether sustained weight loss can be achieved in obese individualswith type 2 diabetes, and if it can, to determine whether this is in fact beneficialto health. We also plan an obesity prevention initiative building on recently success-ful pilot programs. Health disparities pose a particular challenge for NIDDK, because minorities are disproportionately affected by many of the diseases for which we have research re-sponsibility including type 2 diabetes, hepatitis C, and end-stage kidney failure. Ourmajor type 2 diabetes prevention trial has enrolled nearly fifty percent of its pa-tients from minority groups, and we will be supporting a new initiative directed atthe alarming incidence of type 2 diabetes in children, especially from minoritygroups. We are supporting efforts to understand why certain groups such as Afri-can-Americans and Native Americans show increased susceptibility to the kidneycomplications of diabetes, so that we can learn how to prevent them. We are plan-ning a clinical trial of interferon treatment in African-Americans to determine whythey are less responsive to treatment. This should lead to improved therapies. Inaddition to these areas, NIDDK will be emphasizing basic and clinical studies ofprostate disorders, such as BPH and prostatitis; bladder disorders such as intersti-tial cystitis; inflammatory disease and irritable bowel syndrome; progressivekidney failure; food-related illnesses; and other health problems within our researchmission. In developing our future research agenda, we have the benefit of input from our National Advisory Council, from our many constituency organizations both lay andscientific, and from investigators attending the scientific workshops convened by ourstaff. As the new NIDDK Director, I have already met with many of these groupsand will continue actively to reach out to them, so that we may effectively collabo-149 rate in framing future research directions. Working together, we can take full ad- vantage of this unique time of scientific momentum to mobilize the national bio-medical research enterprise for the benefit of all the people of this country. I am pleased to present the President 's non-AIDS budget request for the NIDDK for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $1.186 billion which reflects an increase of $66.8 mil-lion over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated al-location for AIDS, total support requested for the NIDDK is $1.209 billion, an in-crease of $67.8 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for theNIDDK 's efforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research budget request. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. GERALD D. F ISCHBACH Mr. Chairman and Committee Members: I am pleased to present the President 's non-AIDS budget request for the NINDS for fiscal year 2001, a sum of$1,050,412,000, which reflects an increase of $54,327,000 over the comparable fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, total supportrequested for NINDS is $1,084,828,000, an increase of $55,085,000 over the fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NINDS efforts in AIDS research are in-cluded within the Office of AIDS Research budget request. I became Director of NINDS eighteen months ago with great enthusiasm about neuroscience research and the likelihood of significant advances in treating neuro-logical disorders that were considered intractable only a few years ago. My enthu-siasm has grown with time because new discoveries, generous public support anda widening sphere of collaborations within the NIH and with outside organizationshave brought our mission of reducing the burden of neurological diseases into clear-er focus. We are now in the second year of a strategic planning process that has galvanized our research and patient communities as well as our own staff. Last year 's planning document, ''Neuroscience at the New Millennium, '' identified major targets of oppor- tunity and laid out a strategy for approaching disease problems and for strength-ening the capacity of the research community to continue the stunning advances of recent years. The momentum generated by this process, that engaged efforts of morethan 100 distinguished extramural and intramural scientists, professional societies,and many patient advocates, resulted in many new initiatives. The Strategic Planis based on the cross-cutting topics of and behavior,and the neural environment. Our Plan is now in its second phase. Because the plan-ning panels were so successful, we reorganized the extramural program staff intoworking clusters that track the major planning topics. This flexible, non-hierarchicalstructure has led to productive interactions among our program directors, seniorstaff, and external advisors in advancing our research agenda and in responding tothe initiatives of investigators and to concerns of the lay members of the planningcommunity. USES OF FISCAL YEAR 2000 INCREASE The fiscal year 2000 appropriation will allow NINDS to maintain and build on critical initiatives begun in fiscal year 1999 and to take advantage of new, extraor-dinary opportunities, including support of 200 more project grants and 50 more sci-entists in training and career development. I am pleased to report that in fiscal year1999 we were able to fund eight new Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence in Par-kinson 's Disease, instead of the five we had planned. Together with the three Cen- ters funded in late 1998, we now have a national network of eleven Centers thatincludes a wide spectrum of basic and clinical research. Annual meetings of the Cen-ters, along with ongoing informal interactions, will increase opportunities for col-laboration and maximize this significant investment. Each Center has a trainingcomponent, so new investigators will be introduced to Parkinson 's disease and re- lated disorders each year. Another new initiative this year seeks to explore the promising new technology of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson 's disease and other neurological disorders.150 Studies of electrode design, patterns of stimulation, and clinical trials will determine if DBS can halt the progress of neurodegeneration as well as reverse disablingsymptoms. Another solicitation is concerned with the safety of the blood supply. We seek a rapid and sensitive test for the infectious agent (prion) responsible for the new vari-ant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The public must be confident in the safety of theblood supply. During the current year we will expand our efforts to apply sophisticated tech- nology to map the location and timing of gene expression in the brain. This is anessential step in determining the function of normal and mutant, disease-causinggenes. We will expand our successful neural prosthesis program, and we will de-velop innovative, high throughput screens for potential therapeutic agents. We in-tend to promote new approaches to spinal cord injury, and we plan a broad ap-proach to analyze the efficacy of neural stem cells in repairing focal and generalizedlesions. Building on one of our most successful innovations in fiscal year 1999, weplan to expand our support for a full range of infrastructure needed for modern neu-roscience research. Finally, we plan to increase our investment in training physi-cian-scientists who are most likely to engage in translational research and patientoriented research. Looking to the future, I would like to tell you about just a fewof our major initiatives and priorities for fiscal year 2001. A HEALTHY BRAIN FOR LIFE We are concerned with neurological disorders over the entire lifespan. It is impor- tant to focus on developmental and degenerative disorders of children that canproduce a lifetime of disability. Our efforts range from a new, exploratory grantsprogram looking for new insights into common disorders such as autism and epi-lepsy, rare disorders such as Rett 's Disease, Batten 's Disease, and lipid storage dis- eases. We have emphasized gene discovery in epilepsy because it seems that eventhe most common forms such as febrile convulsions have a heritable component. Atthe same time we seek to promote better treatments, and even a cure, for the largenumber of people with ''intractable '' epilepsy. Many of these individuals are chil- dren, whose lives are disrupted by inadequately controlled seizures. Later thisspring we will sponsor a White House-initiated conference, ''Curing Epilepsy: Focus on the Future. '' HALTING THE PROCESS OF NEURODEGENERATION As requested by the Appropriations Committees, NINDS is working on the first phase of an effort to develop a comprehensive research agenda for Parkinson 's dis- ease. We were joined in this effort by NIH Institutes and Centers with significantprograms in Parkinson 's disease, by patient advocacy groups, and by distinguished intramural and extramural scientists. We are confident that the proposed researchagenda will advance the fight against Parkinson 's disease and point the way for similar progress in other neurodegenerative disorders. Neurodegeneration is more widespread than previously thought. In addition to classical adult neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's, Parkinson 's, Hun- tington 's and Lou Gehrig 's diseases, neurodegenerative processes are at work in a number of serious disorders of childhood. Neurodegeneration also complicates condi-tions as disparate as stroke, spinal cord injury, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and de-pression. A cell death program, named apoptosis, appears to be a ''final common pathway '' in the process of neurodegeneration. Encouraging evidence indicates that inhibition of this pathway may be a useful therapeutic strategy, regardless of theinitial causes of the degeneration. We must not lose sight of our goal of cognitive and emotional health throughout life. The study of disease is teaching us that decline in cognitive and emotionalhealth is not an inevitable consequence of aging. For many, perhaps most of us, ahealthy brain is as realistic a goal as is a healthy heart. But we cannot achieve ourgoal without a much better understanding of disease, particularly the risk factorsand early changes that point to possible preventive or corrective measures. A newpatient registry for Parkinson 's disease, to be followed by a larger population-based study, will point the way to further study of neurodegenerative diseases at everystage of life. Through collaboration with other Institutes, we will expand these stud-ies to include cognitive and emotional disorders and to define and promote cognitiveand emotional health across the life span. REPAIRING THE INJURED NERVOUS SYSTEM Modern neuroscience is rewriting the textbooks that tell us that nerve cells cannot recover from deadly injury. Research on a number of fronts has produced tantalizing151 evidence that manipulating the cells ' environment \u2014by adding factors that promote growth or interrupting processes that disrupt it \u2014will eventually redefine the future for those who have lost function due to injury. A recent initiative is seeking addi-tional research on interneuronal circuits to restore lost function. As in so manyother areas of neuroscience, the ability to manipulate and implant stem cells froma variety of sources is particularly promising for both acute and chronic injury.Complementing these efforts are advances in our ability to design neural pros-theses-devices that connect with the patient 's own nerves and muscles to restore or augment function. REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES As we rejoice in the progress of modern medicine, we must not neglect those who, by virtue of biology or circumstance, bear a disproportionate share of the burden ofdisease. NINDS enthusiastically shares the commitment of NIH to reducing healthdisparities, and we will continue our leadership in this area. Stroke is a majorhealth problem for the entire population but one that disproportionately affects mi-nority citizens, particularly African-Americans. We support a broad program di-rected at the impact of stroke on minority populations, ranging from epidemiologicaland descriptive studies of disease patterns to specific therapies and educational ap-proaches. The neurological complications of diabetes, another common disorder thatparticularly affects minority groups, is a major focus of interest. Progress against health disparities also depends on building a diverse scientific workforce \u2014a strategy that makes sense in general but is particularly important in working with minority populations. NINDS has a long history of leadership on thisfront. More recently, with support from the Office of Research on Minority Health,we initiated the first prototype of a Specialized Neuroscience Research Program(SNRP) at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. A unique feature of theprogram is the establishment of collaborations and professional networks betweeninvestigators at minority institutions and those from more research intensive insti-tutions and community-based organizations. Based on excellent results from thepilot program at Morehouse, and recognizing the work still to be done, the NINDS,in collaboration with NCRR, is now supporting additional SNRPs. This year we willexpand the program to include a focus on HIV/AIDS, a particular problem in thenervous system, where the virus can cause dementia and neuropathy even whenother manifestations of disease are well controlled. WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGHT BRAIN DISEASE Neuroscience is recognized as one of a few great unifying themes in modern science. Nowhere is this more evident than at NIH, where almost every Instituteand Center is involved to some extent in brain research. Here we have a uniqueopportunity to break down what is increasingly recognized as an artificial barrierbetween mind and brain, between neurology and psychiatry. Our goal is to developa model for collaborative neuroscience with an emphasis on translational research.The National Neuroscience Research Center, for which start-up funds are requestedin the Buildings and Facilities budget, will provide an environment that will pro-mote modern neuroscience in the form of collaboration, communication, and sharedresources. It will build on the impressive progress already made by intramuralscience leaders and on the example being set by the National Vaccine Research Pro-gram. The emphasis on collaboration will, in my view, stand out as the distinguishing feature of NIH in our time. NINDS is actively working with one or more Institutesand Centers on diseases including autism, Duchenne and facioscapulohumeral dys-trophy, and neurofibromatosis. Our efforts against neurodegenerative disease in-clude collaborations with the National Institute of Aging on clinical trials for Alz-heimer 's disease and with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences on Parkinson 's disease, as well as plans for an innovative public-private partnership to foster future research. Our collaboration with the National Cancer Institute tomap the genes involved in a deadly form of brain tumor has blossomed into the for-mation of a joint Progress Review Group for brain tumor research, building on aplanning technique that has been highly successful for research on other forms ofcancer. In stroke, we have joined forces with the National Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute and with Suburban Hospital in Bethesda to improve rapid diagnosis andtreatment of both stroke and heart disease. We continue to work with the Brain At-tack Coalition to raise public and professional awareness of stroke as a preventableand treatable disease. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-152 formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. For NINDS, this effortwill be augmented by our strategic planning process, which provides an ongoingforum for assessing progress and setting priorities, and by our strong commitmentto efficient and effective management of our resources. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to answer questions you or the other Members may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. ANTHONY S. F AUCI Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for fiscal year 2001. The non-AIDS portion of the budget request is$935,166,000, which reflects an increase of $54,019,000 over the comparable fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, total supportrequested for NIAID is $1,906,213,000, an increase of $109,582,000 over the fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Funds for NIAID efforts in AIDS research are includedwithin the Office of AIDS Research budget request. I would note that the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) budget request includes the performance information re-quired by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominentin the performance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. GLOBAL HEALTH The NIAID research program is predicated on the view that we live in an inter- connected, global community. Because of the enormous volume of international trav-el and trade, we cannot separate the health problems of the United States fromthose of the rest of the world. Clearly, it is folly to think that we are somehow iso-lated from diseases that are public health challenges elsewhere. In 1999 alone, wewitnessed the first known appearance of West Nile fever in the western hemisphere(in New York City and surrounding areas), as well as alarming reports of denguefever outbreaks in Texas and Florida. The yearly U.S. epidemic of influenza, whichoriginates in Asia, is the prototypic example of the maxim ''microbes do not recog- nize borders. '' Indeed, the memory of three recent influenza pandemics (1918, 1957 and 1968), as well as the ever-present threat of another flu pandemic is perhapsthe best reminder of humanity 's shared vulnerability to disease. As a nation, our interest in global health stems both from humanitarian concerns and what has been called ''enlightened self-interest. '' In addition to our obligation to ameliorate human suffering wherever possible, history tells us that healthy, sta-ble countries make strong allies and trading partners. Conversely, poor health sta-tus can have a profound negative impact on social and economic development, andfrequently contributes to political instability. Significantly, this year the United Na-tions Security Council for the first time devoted an entire session to a health issue \u2014 AIDS in Africa \u2014recognizing the enormous threat that the disease poses to the secu- rity not only of that continent but the world. INFECTIOUS DISEASES : CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1,500 people die each hour from an infectious disease. Half of these deaths occur in children under five yearsof age, and most of the rest are working adults who frequently are breadwinnersand parents. Virtually every year one or more newly recognized diseases add to theburden of known infectious conditions; in 1999, for example, the deadly Nipah virusemerged in Malaysia and Singapore. Because of the emergence of microbial drug re-sistance, many infectious diseases are increasingly difficult to treat. In addition, itis now clear that many chronic diseases have an infectious etiology: approximately20 percent of all cancers are related to infections, and mounting evidence indicatesthat pathogenic organisms may be the underlying causes of chronic diseases suchas coronary artery disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and chronic lung diseases. NIAID 's Strategic Plan, available on the World Wide Web at http:// www.niaid.nih.gov/strategicplan outlines the progress made in infectious disease re-search, including advances in HIV treatment, prevention and vaccine development,and delineates the scientific opportunities to strengthen our preparedness for infec-tious threats, known and unknown.153 THE PROMISE OF PATHOGEN GENOMICS Many of the challenges posed by infectious diseases lend themselves to research in a relatively new field: pathogen genomics, or sequencing of the genes of microbes,a central focus of the Institute. Pathogen genomics, coupled with data from theHuman Genome Project, as well as the use of new tools such as microarray andDNA ''chip'' technologies to delineate the functional expression of these microbial genes, will likely underpin infectious diseases research for the coming decades andwill be critical to the development of new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics. In an important technical achievement, researchers have determined the complete genetic sequence of chromosomes 2 and 3 of P. falciparum, the most deadly malariaparasite. This new information will help to identify virulence factors and proteins involved in the parasite 's lifecycle that may serve as targets for the development of drugs and vaccines. Researchers also have determined the complete genomic se-quence of two strains of M. tuberculosis, the TB bacterium. These sequencing effortsare central to NIAID 's detailed plans for the development of malaria and TB vac- cines. NIAID-supported researchers have also published complete or partial genomic se- quences of the agents of the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and syphilis,as well as the leishmaniasis parasite Leishmania major. The Institute also supportsthe genetic sequencing of many other important pathogens that exact an enormoustoll and are increasingly drug-resistant. Examples include important species ofenterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, including Stapyhlococcus aureus, whichin some cases has become virtually untreatable because of drug resistance. VACCINE DEVELOPMENT Vaccination has been recognized as the greatest public health achievement of the 20th century, and vaccine research has long been a cornerstone of the NIAID re-search portfolio. NIAID-supported research has been instrumental in the develop-ment of many new and improved vaccines, such as those against hepatitis A andB, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pertussis, typhoid, varicella, A new vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae , the leading cause of mor- bidity and mortality in children worldwide, shows particular promise. Widespreaduse of this vaccine could greatly reduce the 1.2 million child deaths worldwide at-tributed to S. pneumoniae each year, according to WHO. The domestic potential of this new vaccine is also significant: pneumococcal disease causes 40,000 deaths,500,000 cases of pneumonia, and 7 million middle ear infections in this countryevery year, according to CDC. The rapidly evolving science base in pathogen genomics, immunology and microbi- ology will facilitate further progress in developing new and improved vaccines. Inparticular, vaccines that target mucosal surfaces such as those in the intestine orrespiratory tract are of great importance, because many pathogens gain entry to thehost via mucosal sites. Vaccines administered orally, nasally or transdermally areeasy to administer and therefore have potentially great utility in developing coun-tries and for mass immunization programs. The development of new adjuvants,which boost the immune response to vaccines, is another important area of researchthat has progressed rapidly in recent years. In addition to the development of vac-cines against classic infectious diseases, vaccines are being pursued to fight poten-tial agents of bioterrorism; chronic diseases with infectious origins; and autoimmunediseases and other immune-mediated conditions. ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) AIDS, caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is one of the greatest threats to global health and one of the most destructive scourges in human history.Since the beginning of the HIV pandemic, more than 50 million people worldwidehave been infected with HIV, of whom more than 16.3 million have died, accordingto UNAIDS. In the United States, approximately 650,000 -900,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS; an additional 420,200 people with AIDS had died as of June 30,1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). UNAIDSestimates that the global HIV-infected population continues to expand: in 1999alone, there were 5.6 million new infections worldwide, half of which occurredamong people younger than 25 years of age. In the United States, the rate of newHIV infections has reached an unacceptable plateau of 40,000 per year, with minor-ity communities disproportionately affected. Although potent combinations of anti-HIV drugs have reduced the number of AIDS deaths and new AIDS cases in many western countries, the utility of thesemedications is limited by their substantial cost, toxicities, complicated and disrup-154 tive dosing regimens, and the development of drug resistance. Many patients do not respond adequately to current regimens; even in patients who are successfully treat-ed, the virus persists in sanctuaries where the drugs cannot penetrate and in a la-tent form on which the drugs have no effect. Therefore, the development of a newgeneration of therapies remains a major priority. In addition, approaches to purgingthe virus from its sanctuaries in certain cells and tissues are being vigorously pur-sued, as are methods to boost the body 's immune defenses so they can better fight the virus. In developing countries in which per capita health care spending may be only a few dollars a year, and where health care infrastructures are weak, anti-HIV thera-pies are invariably beyond the reach of all but the privileged few. This situation, coupled with the upward trajectory of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, underscoresthe urgent need for effective and affordable tools of HIV prevention. Notableprogress has been made. For example, an NIAID-supported study in Uganda foundthat two doses of the drug nevirapine, one given to the mother at the onset of laborand one given to the infant within 72 hours after birth, can markedly reduceperinatal HIV transmission. The entire regimen costs $4.00, making it feasible inresource-poor settings. Other methods of preventing HIV transmission, such as edu-cation and behavior modification and the social marketing and provision of condomshave also proven effective, both in the United States and in developing countriessuch as Uganda, Senegal and Thailand. Approximately 46 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS are women. An impor- tant NIAID focus is developing interventions that will empower women to protectthemselves in situations where they are unable to avoid sex with HIV-infected part-ners or cannot persuade their partners to use a condom. A critical effort is the de-velopment and testing of products for vaginal use \u2014called topical microbicides \u2014that may protect women (and their partners) from HIV and other sexually transmitteddiseases. Promising microbicide candidates are now in various stages of testing inanimal models and in humans. The development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV infection is a central goal of AIDS research, and a necessary tool to bring the HIV epidemic under control. Inaddition to the Institute 's substantial commitment to pre-clinical HIV vaccine re- search, NIAID has conducted more than 50 clinical studies of HIV vaccines. Amongthese is the first HIV vaccine trial in Africa, a study initiated in Uganda last yearin a growing effort to collaborate with scientists from developing countries to iden-tify safe and effective vaccines suitable for worldwide use. Last year also markedthe dedication of the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center, a programwithin the NIH intramural research program to stimulate multidisciplinary vaccineresearch. IMMUNE -MEDIATED DISEASES The burden of immune-mediated diseases is staggering; these conditions, like in- fectious diseases, are important global health concerns. For example, 100 to 150 mil-lion people worldwide suffer from asthma; in this country alone, 15 million peopleare asthmatics. Asthma-related deaths worldwide number approximately 180,000annually and are increasing both in the United States and abroad. The past two decades of intense and highly productive research on the immune system have resulted in a wealth of new information and extraordinary growth inconceptual understanding. These accomplishments now provide realistic opportuni-ties for major advances in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a broad rangeof immunologic conditions. Among the most exciting developments is our growing understanding of tolerance induction. By blocking only those components of the immune system that attackhealthy tissues, it may be possible to prevent graft rejection in transplant patientswithout immunosuppressive drugs that dampen protective immune responses aswell as deleterious ones. The ability to selectively block the immune response alsoholds great promise for treatment of many immune-mediated conditions, includingautoimmune diseases such as juvenile (type 1) diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis andmultiple sclerosis, as well as asthma and allergic diseases. In addition, under-standing the mechanisms of immune tolerance will likely prove important for effortsto prevent unresponsiveness to vaccines, and for enhancing natural host responsesand defenses to infection. In October 1999, NIAID launched a major initiative to develop new ways of induc- ing immune tolerance, in partnership with the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Inter-national and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.The Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance involvesmore than 40 research institutions. Network researchers will conduct clinical trials155 to improve the success of kidney transplants using tolerogenic approaches and clin- ical trials are planned for patients receiving transplanted human islets to treat type1 diabetes. Network investigators will test similar therapeutic approaches for otherautoimmune diseases, such as systematic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritisand multiple sclerosis, and will pursue better ways to measure immune tolerancein humans. In addition, the network plans to conduct clinical trials in immune mod-ulation to treat asthma and allergic diseases. ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES Virtually all of NIAID 's research efforts address the health disparities that exist in our country, as well as the growing gap in health status between developed anddeveloping countries. Perhaps the best example of this is the development of vac-cines to prevent infectious diseases, which disproportionately affect the poor, bothat home and abroad. Other efforts, such as HIV treatment and prevention research,hepatitis C research, asthma research, tissue typing and other transplantation re-search, and autoimmunity research, address conditions that exact a significant tollin minority communities. In addition, NIAID has a long-standing commitment to in-creasing the cadre of minority investigators involved in biomedical research. CONCLUSION The United Nations, in the International Declaration of Health Rights, asserted that ''The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fun- damental rights of every human being. It is not a privilege reserved for those withpower, money or social standing. '' As the NIAID faces the new millennium, we an- ticipate that our research efforts will result in new and improved vaccines,diagnostics, and treatments that will make ''the highest attainable standard of health '' a global reality. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. MARVIN CASSMAN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, good morning. I am pleased to present the President 's non-AIDS budget request for the National Institute of Gen- eral Medical Sciences (NIGMS) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $1.389 billion, whichreflects an increase of $73 million over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropria-tion. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, the total support requested forNIGMS is $1.428 billion, an increase of $74 million over the fiscal year 2000 appro-priation. Funds for the NIGMS efforts in AIDS research are included within the Of-fice of AIDS Research budget request. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. The mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences is to support basic biomedical research that is not targeted to specific diseases. NIGMS fundsstudies on genes, proteins, and cells, as well as on fundamental processes like com-munication within and between cells, how our bodies use energy, and how we re-spond to medicines. The results of this research increase our understanding of lifeand lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.NIGMS attempts to ensure the vitality and continued productivity of basic bio-medical research, while producing the next generation of scientific breakthroughsand training the next generation of scientists. I am particularly pleased to announcethat once again the current Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine, Dr. GunterBlobel of Rockefeller University, was supported by NIGMS during the period whenthe work for which he was recognized was performed. SNAPSHOT OF THE CELL 'S PROTEIN FACTORY I would like to begin by describing a major advance of the past year, the deter- mination of the detailed structure of the ribosome. This stunning accomplishmentis the result of a broad body of research, largely supported by NIGMS, over a periodof several decades. The ribosome is the particle in the cell where proteins are syn-thesized. It is a factory, made up of many molecules, which is small by our dailymeasures but is a giant compared to most other elements in the cell. It carries outa central activity for life \u2014the accurate synthesis of the proteins that form the body 's156 structures, such as muscle and collagen, and that catalyze the chemical reactions in living systems. Consequently, ribosomes are found everywhere in nature, andthey don 't appear to differ much between species. It 's as if nature got it right the first time and didn 't want to make many changes. A major goal of modern biology has been to lay bare the mechanism by which the protein synthesis factory functions. To do so, it was ultimately necessary to identify,in great detail, the three-dimensional structure of the particle, using x-ray crys-tallography as a primary tool. The difficulties of this undertaking can be appreciatedwhen it is understood that the ribosome is made up of two subunits of unequal size,comprised of a total of 54 individual proteins as well as three RNA strands. Thedetermination of a single protein structure can still be a difficult process, so at- tempting to understand such a complex entity was an intimidating prospect. The astonishing breakthroughs of the past year are the result of dogged effort, with contributions over many years from many sectors of science. The next figureshows the different avenues of research leading to the current achievements. It rep-resents selected highlights, with the NIGMS-supported efforts shown in yellow.What is clear is that contributions were required from chemistry and physics, aswell as genetics, biochemistry, and structural biology, to arrive at our current un-derstanding. We are particularly pleased to have supported Dr. Ada Yonath, fromthe Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, at a time when there was still greatdoubt that it would be possible to achieve the structure. This investment, and oursubsequent support over 15 years, demonstrates the value of funding high-risk,high-payoff approaches. Although the detail currently visible is not yet at a level sufficient to identify indi- vidual atoms, we are confident that the research teams we are supporting will ar-rive at this goal. This should provide unique insights into antibiotic action and re-sistance, since many antibiotics \u2014including erythromycin and tetracycline \u2014work by blocking bacterial ribosome function. Even this will only mark a new beginning,since, as with any factory, the various machines operate to absorb raw material,process it, and then release it in a form that can be used. To follow this process,it will be necessary to capture and visualize the machine at different points in themanufacturing cycle. But this is yet to come, and where we are today is excitingenough, for the new knowledge will greatly improve our understanding of a funda-mental component of living systems. MAJOR INITIATIVES I would like to spend the rest of my time describing some of the opportunities that are being addressed with the increased funds that Congress appropriated toNIGMS. In particular, I would like to focus on three new initiatives \u2014 pharmacogenetics, structural genomics, and large-scale collaborative research \u2014and then close with a description of the expansion in our support for minorities in re-search. Pharmacogenetics is the effect of inheritance on drug action. In 1998, it was re- ported that adverse drug effects account for 100,000 deaths per year, as well as 5 - 10 percent of hospital admissions. The old joke of ''take two pills and call me in the morning '' may be appropriate for many people, but what works for the majority of the population may not be effective, and could even be dangerous, for some. The pro-gram we have initiated plans to systematically collect and interpret informationabout the inherited variations in humans that result in poor responses to drugs. Thescientists we will support will coordinate their activities in a research network sothat the results obtained can be maximally useful, and all will deposit their resultsin a shared repository. This effort will be conducted in collaboration with the Na-tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the National Human Genome Research In-stitute; the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; the National Insti-tute of Mental Health; and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. As part of the pharmacogenetics initiative, we assembled an advisory group in May of 1999 to consider possible areas of misunderstanding and the ramificationsof future research in pharmacogenetics. Since many identifiable differences in theresponse to drugs have emerged from studies of populations, it is necessary to con-sider issues of stereotyping and stigmatization of communities, and the possible re-sulting harm to individuals, such as discrimination in access to various social bene-fits, that might arise from membership in an identified group. The members of theadvisory group, as well as participants in several follow-up focus groups, felt thatthe possible benefits of the pharmacogenetic research efforts outweighed the risks.However, they recommended that we provide a clear statement to the public of thegoals of the research and the issues involved, and that we ensure that we have ap-propriate mechanisms in place to maintain privacy and confidentiality.157 A second major effort is the Protein Structure Initiative, which attempts to use the information developed by the Human Genome Project and other genomic pro-grams to identify the structures of all the proteins in nature. The benefits of under-standing three-dimensional protein structure have been demonstrated many times.Applications include drug design and understanding of the molecular basis of dis-ease. It is certain that a complete catalog of structures and their relation to functionwould provide insights into the operation and integration of biological systems thatwe cannot now fully comprehend. However, such an experimental effort directed atsolving the structure of every protein in nature is not feasible. It would take decadesand be extremely expensive. Fortunately, there is a shorter route to this goal. Pro-teins appear to fall into ''families '' of related structures. If the detailed structure of one or a few members of each family is known, it is possible to infer the structuresof the other family members. We have mounted a program, beginning in fiscal year 2000, to test approaches to identifying appropriate protein family targets, as well as to develop high-speedprocedures to determine structures. Grant recipients will be asked to operate as aninteractive team, sharing information about progress on a regular basis and depos-iting data in a shared repository to ensure there is no duplication of effort. This willbe integrated with other such programs around the world. To this end, an inter-national meeting to ensure coordination and collaboration is planned for the springof 2000. The last initiative I would like to describe attempts to address major problems in biomedical research by facilitating the collaboration of large groups of investiga-tors. Although awards to individual investigators are the mainstay of our supportfor research, it has become clear that to put all the information together to under-stand how biological systems operate, something more may be required. We are at-tempting to provide that additional support through an approach which we term''glue grants. '' This is because we will supply the ''glue'' that will catalyze the inter- actions between already funded investigators to aim at problems that they could notpursue individually. In general, the glue grants will support large-scale, inter-disciplinary approaches to significant biological problems by providing the resourcesfor such items as core facilities, database development, and electronic media for ef-fective collaboration. This approach is itself an experiment in the organization of sci-entific effort. It should provide one opportunity to see how the flood of informationcoming from individual laboratories can be integrated and amplified to address im-portant problems of biology. Finally, a major goal of the NIGMS is to establish programs that will result in a cadre of highly qualified researchers. This requires developing flexible trainingmechanisms that reflect the rapidly changing needs of science, as well as providingcross-disciplinary training. The NIGMS predoctoral training programs remain abenchmark for graduate training, and have evolved to incorporate new areas asscience developed. Most recently, we have initiated a training program inbioinformatics \u2014the field at the interface of biology and computer science \u2014to ad- dress this emerging area. Bioinformatics is increasingly needed to manage and minethe vast quantities of data that biomedical scientists are generating. Similarly, we have expanded our programs targeting underrepresented minorities to ensure that future demands for scientific personnel will be met. We have devel-oped new programs to enhance the research environment at minority-serving insti-tutions; to support computer infrastructure via supplements to existing grants; toprovide technical assistance in grant writing; and to combine a traditionalpostdoctoral experience with an opportunity to develop teaching skills throughmentored assignments at minority-serving institutions. At the same time, the aver-age size of individual research budgets in our Minority Biomedical Research Support(MBRS) programs has doubled over the last 3 years, while the number of studentssupported in these programs has increased by 60 percent. We anticipate our in-creased investments to show real benefits in an increasing number of minority stu- dents going into biomedical research, and we are developing evaluation proceduresto track the outcomes of our efforts. We are particularly pleased with the results of the Bridges to the Future Pro- gram, which is cofunded by NIGMS and the NIH Office of Research on MinorityHealth. The results indicate that students in the program make the transition from2-year to 4-year institutions and receive bachelor 's degrees at a rate of about twice the national average. Although the part of the program that supports the transitionfrom a master 's degree to a Ph.D. has as yet only small numbers, the data available also suggest that the transfer rate of these students to Ph.D.-granting programs isalso about twice the national average.158 In conclusion, NIGMS remains dedicated to developing approaches to ensure that biomedical research continues to progress. The resources that we have received willpermit us to take advantage of the rapidly expanding opportunities in science. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. DUANE ALEXANDER Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2001 President 's budget request for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The request of $810.5 million reflects an increaseof $40.8 million over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including theestimated allocation for AIDS research, total support requested for NICHD is $904.7million, an increase of $45.4 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Fundsfor the NICHD efforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Re-search budget request. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. The NICHD seeks to assure that every individual is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no adverse consequence from the reproductive process, and thatall children have the opportunity to fulfill their potential for a healthy and produc-tive life unhampered by disease or disability. In pursuit of this mission, the NICHDconducts and supports laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological research on the re-productive, neurobiologic, developmental, and behavioral processes that determineand maintain the health of children, adults, families, and populations. MENTAL RETARDATION Since this Institute was established 37 years ago, a major portion of our research has been devoted to better understanding the causes, treatments, and prevention ofmental retardation. One by one, in large part as a result of the support for researchfrom this Committee, causes of mental retardation are Our progress toward understanding and eliminating the causes of mental retarda- tion has continued during the last year. In a highly significant advance, Dr. HudaZoghbi, an NICHD grantee in our Mental Retardation Research Center at Baylor,identified the gene responsible for Rett Syndrome, a mysterious condition thatcauses seemingly normal infant girls to lose their ability to walk and to developsymptoms of severe mental retardation. After years of exploration, researchers dis-covered the genetic difference between girls with Rett Syndrome and unaffectedchildren. Girls with Rett Syndrome have a defective gene on one of their two X chro-mosomes. These girls have some normally functioning copies of the gene, so theirsymptoms are not immediately apparent at birth. However, between 6 and 18months of age, these girls begin to exhibit the symptoms of Rett Syndrome whenthe function of the normal single gene is insufficient to meet the growing child 's needs. [This discovery also sheds light on why only females are affected by the syn-drome. Males with the Rett Syndrome gene possess only the mutant version of thegene because they have only one X chromosome. Presumably, male fetuses with thegene for Rett Syndrome die before birth or soon thereafter because they do not havea back-up copy of the normal gene.] The gene that is abnormal in Rett syndrome,called MECP 2, controls the function of several other genes, so when it is defective,multiple other genes, including some that are essential for brain development andfunction, operate improperly. Based on this exciting discovery, the NICHD is en-couraging investigators to try to find pharmacologic agents that can substitute forthe control mechanism, and thereby reverse or prevent the progression of Rett Syn-drome. Another significant finding we reported this year may provide a way to reduce the risk of mental retardation for children born to women who have hypothyroidism159 during their pregnancy. We have known for many years that congenital hypothyroidism in children is associated with a lower IQ and we have eliminatedthat problem by screening all newborn infants. Now NICHD research has dem-onstrated that children born to mothers who have untreated hypothyroidism duringpregnancy scored lower on IQ tests than children of healthy mothers, with 19 per-cent in the borderline or retarded range. However, when mothers withhypothyroidism were being treated for the condition, their children 's IQ scores were virtually identical to those of children born to healthy mothers. This study suggeststhat screening women for hypothyroidism before or early in pregnancy may providea way to prevent mental retardation. A protocol is in preparation to test this possi-bility in the 14 ob-gyn departments that are part of the NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network. This network is also studying ways to reduce the incidence oflow birth weight, another significant cause of mental retardation. NICHD has also provided important testing for a proposed new treatment of au- tism. In recent months a number of reports suggested a potential benefit to usingsecretin in the treatment of autistic children. We were intensely interested in thesereports, but they contained no scientific data to assess the degree or duration of po-tential benefits. For this reason, NICHD launched a series of placebo-controlledstudies to investigate potential benefits and risks of using secretin to treat autism.In results from the first of these studies, NICHD researchers found that treatmentwith the synthetic version of secretin offered no more benefit for children with au-tism than did treatment with placebo. Additional studies will seek to determine ifsecretin may be effective when given at various doses or on more than one occasion.We are also investigating whether secretin benefits autistic children with a par-ticular group of symptoms and whether biological secretin is more effective than thesynthetic version. HEALTH DISPARITIES Another area in which the NICHD has both a deep concern and a deep commit- ment is the elimination of health disparities among minority populations. The Insti-tute is developing a comprehensive and coordinated research plan for eliminatinghealth disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Our plan will address infantmortality, reproductive health, medical rehabilitation, and child and adolescenthealth. I would like to highlight some of the initiatives which illustrate our strongcommitment to eliminating health disparities. Over the last two years, the NICHD awarded funds to 20 departments of obstet- rics and gynecology to develop young investigators in the field and prepare the nextgeneration of principal investigators. We also support 15 Reproductive Science Re-search Centers. In fiscal year 2001, the NICHD will enhance these programs byfunding a program of Specialized Centers for Research in Reproductive Medicine inMinority Institutions that pairs minority institutions with established research cen-ters. The goal of this program is to increase the capacity of minority institutionsand investigators to conduct cutting-edge research in the field of obstetrics and gyn-ecology, focusing on problems particularly prevalent among minorities. The Institute 's national Back to Sleep campaign, which urges caretakers to place infants on their backs to sleep, has met with significant success. In the five yearssince the campaign was launched, deaths due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome(SIDS) have dropped 38 percent. Despite this overall success, both the SIDS rateand the rate of stomach sleeping among African-Americans remain more than dou-ble that of white infants. To address this marked disparity, the NICHD invited theleaders from a number of national African-American organizations, as well as offi-cials from Federal, state, and municipal governments, to join us in developing andimplementing strategies for reducing SIDS in African-Americans. The group identi-fied the need for culturally sensitive materials and programs designed by and forAfrican-American communities. The NICHD is committed to carrying out this strat-egy. As a first step, NICHD is conducting research with African-American care-takers such as parents, grandparents, relatives, and child care workers to identifymore effective ways to communicate the Back to Sleep message. One component isa transit ad, which will be used first in the DC Metro system, and eventually inother cities around the country. The Institute 's goal is to eliminate the racial dis- parity in infant back sleeping position within three years and hopefully therebyeliminate the racial disparity in SIDS rates. We are also exploring ways to improve reading skills in populations of culturally and linguistically diverse students. Three years ago, the NICHD began a readinginstruction research program with nine DC public schools. The purpose of the pro-gram was to determine whether applying what we have learned in other readingprograms could be applied successfully with regular teachers in regular classrooms.160 Data from the Early Intervention Project are still being collected and analyzed, but preliminary data show a pattern of remarkable improvements in reading ability. Forinstance, reading scores in schools that have historically been at the 10th to 15thpercentile have improved to better than the 50th percentile. Moreover, the entireclass in intervention schools is now performing at the national average. In a relatedarea, the NICHD and the Department of Education this year are jointly solicitingresearch proposals for systematically studying the most effective ways to teach read-ing English to children whose primary language is Spanish. HIV RESEARCH In previous years, I reported on the research that led to the remarkable reduction in the rate of HIV transmission from mother to infant during pregnancy and birth.NICHD and NIAID research have made another important contribution to reducingmaternal HIV transmission this past year. Grantees discovered that the amount ofHIV in a pregnant woman 's blood, known as maternal HIV viral load, is the prime risk factor for transmitting the virus to the baby. By focusing treatment on reducingthe viral load during pregnancy, the risk of HIV transmission from mother to infantcan be further decreased. In the developing world, where logistics and the cost of multiple drug therapy for HIV are often prohibitive, research reported last year showed that administeringthe antiviral drug nevirapine to the mother just before delivery and to the infantjust after birth can reduce HIV transmission significantly. NICHD and NIAID arenow conducting studies to evaluate whether nevirapine, administered during thetime a mother is breast-feeding can reduce the rate of HIV transmission throughbreast milk. PEDIATRIC TRAUMA REHABILITATION We also plan to expand research for children and teens in the area of trauma. Injury is the leading cause of death for children five to 18 years old; violence is thethird leading cause of death for this age group. However, many clinical treatmentsfor trauma are tailored exclusively to adults and fail to consider the long-term ef-fects of these interventions on a developing child. The NICHD is planning a multi-disciplinary, collaborative program to address this issue, led by the Institute 's Na- tional Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research. This program will allow us to de-velop and assess therapies specifically targeted to the physical, emotional, and socialneeds of children. As part of this program, we will start a collaborative pediatricinjury and trauma clinical trials network. Concurrently, we will be examining waysto actually prevent the risky behaviors that often result in injury and trauma. In 1998, the NICHD held a consensus conference on traumatic brain injury or TBI. The panel identified specific concerns that require further study regarding theimpact of TBI on children. Brain injuries can have a profound impact on new learn-ing and future physical and mental development of children. Based on the panel 's recommendations, the NICHD will establish specialized research programs on treat-ment tailored directly to the needs of young children with traumatic brain injury. BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH In the area of behavioral research, the Institute is identifying some of the major influences on the health and health behavior choices of young people. Since 1994,the Institute has supported The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,also know as the Add Health Study. The study has provided new insights into theways that peers, families, schools and neighborhoods can influence positive healthoutcomes, as well as negative outcomes, such as violent behavior, smoking, drinking,illegal drug use, and sexual behavior. Data from this survey informed and will con-tinue to inform public policy. With the increased funding provided by this Com- mittee in fiscal year 2000, the Add Health study will collect additional data fromthe full original cohort. This study will help identify the major determinants ofhealth and health behaviors during the transition from adolescence to early adult-hood. Mr. Chairman, the support from this Committee for the research of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has contributed to the elimi-nation and near elimination of some of the major causes of childhood diseases andlifelong disabilities. We are proud of this progress but we know we still face manydaunting yet exciting research challenges. In the years ahead, with your continuedsupport, I am confident that we will return to this room and report back to you thatwe have eliminated some of the causes of learning disabilities, that we have elimi-nated some of the causes of infant mortality, that we have eliminated some of thelife-long adverse consequences of child-bearing, and that we have contributed in a161 significant way to eliminating the health disparities that separate racial and ethnic communities. I will be pleased to answer any questions you have at this time. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. CARLKUPFER Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Eye Institute (NEI), for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $462.8M, which reflects an increase of $23.6M over the comparablefiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, totalsupport requested for the NEI is $474M, an increase of $23.9M over the fiscal year2000 appropriation. Funds for the NEI efforts in AIDS research are included withinthe Office of AIDS Research budget request. THIRTY YEARS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT The NEI was formally established by Congress in 1968 and began full operations in 1970. Significant progress has been made in the last 30 years in understandingand treating many diseases of the eye and visual system, including: \u2014Developing highly effective treatments for severe diabetic retinopathy, a poten- tially blinding disease that affects half of the 16 million Americans with diabe-tes, according to the NIH 's Diabetes in America. Thirty years ago, half of those who developed severe retinopathy were blind within five years of diagnosis, ac-cording to the British Journal of Ophthalmology. Today, because of NEI-spon-sored clinical research, people with advanced retinopathy have less than a fivepercent chance of becoming blind when they get timely and appropriate treat-ment, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u2014Finding that Black and White individuals with advanced glaucoma may respond differently to two surgical treatments for the disease, with Blacks likely to re-spond more favorably to one treatment, and Whites likely to respond more fa-vorably to the other. \u2014Identifying a freezing treatment called cryotherapy that significantly reduces vi- sion loss from advanced cases of retinopathy of prematurity, a potentially blind-ing visual disorder affecting premature infants. \u2014Showing that rejuvenation of the immune system of people with AIDS will pre- vent progression of a potentially blinding AIDS-related eye complication calledCMV retinitis. \u2014Developing two new medical therapies \u2014latanoprost and dorzolamide \u2014for glau- coma. Both are given as eye drops. \u2014Finding that an antiviral drug \u2014acyclovir \u2014decreases the recurrence of herpes infection of the eye, a very painful and potentially blinding eye disorder. \u2014Identifying a gene that causes juvenile macular degeneration. This finding may bring researchers closer to finding the cause of age-related macular degenera-tion, a blinding eye disease affecting about 1.7 million older Americans, accord-ing to the NEI 's Beaver Dam Study. \u2014Identifying several defective genes suspected of causing retinitis pigmentosa, a group of inherited, blinding diseases that slowly damage the retina and affect100,000 Americans, according to the American Journal of Ophthalmology. Iden-tifying these genes may lead to treatments that prevent nerve cell degenerationand visual loss. \u2014Discovering a more effective treatment for optic neuritis, which primarily affects women ages 15 -45 and is often associated with multiple sclerosis. This treat- ment \u2014a combination of intravenous and oral corticosteroids \u2014restores vision more rapidly and decreases relapses. \u2014Finding a simpler, more successful treatment of an infection of the inside of the eye which, if left untreated or inadequately treated, can cause loss of vision. \u2014Demonstrating that a surgical procedure thought to be beneficial in treating an inflammation of the optic nerve is instead potentially harmful. \u2014Developing a questionnaire to assess the impact of vision loss on a person 's quality of life. Called the Visual Function Questionnaire, it is being used toevaluate the effectiveness of new treatments being tested in clinical trials. LOW VISION NEI-supported researchers continue to focus on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and hopefully cure diseases of the eye and visual system. Despite these ef-forts, there are, according to The Lighthouse, about 14 million Americans \u2014one in 20\u2014who have low vision due to eye diseases and disorders of the visual system. We define low vision as a visual impairment, not correctable by eyeglasses, contact162 lenses, medicine, or surgery, that interferes with the ability to perform everyday ac- tivities. As our population ages, it is expected that the number of people with lowvision will increase dramatically. The impact of low vision on quality of life can be devastating. It can lead to a loss of independence. It can affect people 's ability to move about safely, to make de- cisions, and to communicate with others. It can lead to frustration and uncertaintywith profound lifestyle and economic consequences. To bring the message that information and help are available to people with low vision and their families, the NEI launched a Low Vision Education Program lastOctober. The goal of the Program is to help improve the quality of life for peoplewith low vision and outline steps people can take to use their remaining vision moreeffectively. A public awareness program that conveys positive, encouraging, and up-lifting messages will alert the public and health professionals to this issue. Peoplewith low vision need to know that help exists, such as visual rehabilitation servicesand devices. The eye care professional should never tell his or her patient that noth-ing can be done about low vision. The fact is something can be done about it. As part of the program, we have introduced a Low Vision Traveling Exhibit that increases public awareness about low vision and provides important information forpeople who do not see well. This exhibit, which will be displayed in shopping mallsnationwide during the next few years, is now debuting in Birmingham, Alabama.The exhibit features an interactive CD -ROM touch screen program and provides first-person stories of how Americans are living successfully with the condition. Theexhibit will help us reach those who need this information the most \u2014people with low vision and their families and caregivers. The Low Vision Education Program is part of the National Eye Health Education Program (NEHEP), the first Federally-funded eye health education program. It iscoordinated by the NEI in partnership with close to 60 public and private organiza-tions united behind a nationwide effort to educate people about the importance ofgood eye health. Through this network of ''grass roots '' organizations, the NEHEP multiplies its efforts in educating the public. As we launch the Low Vision Education Program, the National Eye Institute is furthering progress in the area of low vision research, and is currently supporting26 grants at a cost of about $6 million. Some of these projects involve laboratoryresearch. Some involve research to develop low vision devices and explore emergingtechnologies. The auto focus binocular low-vision telescope has been improved. Re-search has yielded several new methods of presenting magnified text on computerscreens. Another key advance is the development of new technology, such as routeplanning database systems and personal guidance systems, to improve way findingfor people who are visually impaired. The NEI is a full partner in the NIH 's bio- engineering initiatives that bring together the necessary basic science, engineering,and/or clinical expertise to focus on a significant area of bioengineering research. TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH Although the NEI is a clinically-oriented Institute, work performed in the labora- tory is a fundamental pillar of research on visual impairment and blindness. It mustbe conducted before new therapies for preventing or treating disease can be devel-oped and tested in a clinical trial setting. One of the greatest strengths of the NIHintramural program is that laboratory research can be conducted, and the findingsquickly applied, to a small group of patients before large-scale testing. An excellent example of our ''lab-to-bedside '' research is the discovery of a possible new treatment for uveitis, a severe eye inflammation that affects children andyoung adults. The current treatment for uveitis involves powerful drugs that cancause serious side effects, such as decreased kidney function, cataracts, glaucoma,and brittle bones. A collaboration between scientists at the NEI and the NationalCancer Institute will result in an alternative therapy, called humanized anti-Tacmonoclonal antibody, which can be given intravenously once a month. This biologi-cal substance seems to control uveitis as effectively as the standard treatment inthis study, but with a marked decrease in complications and side effects. This studyserves as a model for future studies. VISUAL HEALTH DISPARITIES The NEI is supporting a number of studies to improve understanding of eye dis- ease and visual impairment in traditionally underserved populations. For example,among African Americans, glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness. Results fromNEI-funded studies confirm the rates for blindness due to glaucoma in African-Americans are six times higher than the rates for Whites. On the other hand, age-related macular degeneration is rare for Blacks as compared to Whites.163 Clinical Studies will help identify people at highest risk for glaucoma and those most likely to benefit from early medical treatment. To closely follow people who areat moderate risk of developing glaucoma, the NEI is conducting a clinical trial calledthe Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study. This multi-center clinical trial has en-rolled 1500 patients, of which 25 percent are African-American. The high percentageof African Americans participating will enable analyses of the effectiveness of top-ical medications in preventing the development of glaucoma in Blacks. Previous research has provided estimates of the prevalence of eye disease among Whites and Blacks in the US, but no published comparable data exists on the USHispanic population. This paucity of data hampers the design of appropriate eyehealth services. The NEI is now supporting two large studies \u2014The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study and the Visual Impairment Among Hispanics in Arizona Study \u2014 that will help direct manpower and resources toward the major eye health needsof the Hispanic population. The NEI is also conducting an investigation of eye development and nearsighted- ness in schoolchildren. This study will compare and contrast normal eye growth anddevelopment in Hispanic, African-American, and Asian schoolchildren ages 6 -14 years with what happens in Caucasian children. With this information, we hope tobe able to predict nearsightedness in small children before it is clinically evident. FUTURE DIRECTION OF VISION RESEARCH There are eye diseases that have resisted our best efforts at improving treatment. But the NEI is exploiting new advances in molecular biology, genetics, immunology,cell biology, and other disciplines to accelerate efforts to find cures for blinding dis-eases. The NEI has outlined new therapeutic strategies \u2014such as gene replacement, tis- sue and cell transplantation, and growth factor therapy \u2014that show great potential. We can produce \u2014and directly view \u2014abnormal blood vessels in the eyes of animal models. This allows us to determine if various treatments for diabetic retinopathyand macular degeneration are effective in eliminating these blood vessels, whichlead to blurred vision. The vision researcher has the advantage of utilizing noninvasive technology. Adaptive optics technology has recently been applied to the visual system, giving theclearest views yet of the living retina inside the eye. This may allow scientists totrack the progression of a number of retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosaand diabetic retinopathy, and evaluate the efficacy of rescue of cell types in the ret-ina. To help develop genomic resources that facilitate understanding of the normal vis- ual system and related disorders and diseases, NEI sponsored a two-day multi-dis-ciplinary functional genomic workshop last September. The purpose of genetics stud-ies related to the eye is not only to identify eye genes, which will be aided greatlyby NIH 's Human Genome Project, but also to determine what the genes do normally and what happens when the genes are mutated. Some ideas generated at the work-shop included creating a visual system web site to enhance access to existing, ornewly created, databases for genes expressed in the visual system; producing andcharacterizing expressed genes of the visual system; and encouraging programs forgenomics, functional genomics, and disease. We have begun to implement many ofthese suggestions. Research will continue to examine all these possibilities, guided by our goal of the past 30 years to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of all diseasesof the eye and visual disorders. Much remains to be done. We understand thatprogress does not always occur as quickly as we would hope. But we put ahead ofus this goal and vision for the new century. With the continued support of theAmerican people and the research priorities outlined in our strategic plan, we willendeavor to protect this most precious sense of sight for all Americans and all ofhumanity. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to answer your questions.164 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. KENNETH OLDEN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for NIEHS for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $460,971,000 which reflects an increase of $25,824,000 over the comparable fiscalyear 2000 appropriation.

As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, this data will help identifynew strategies and objectives to improve programs across NIH and the Department. There is a paucity of information to make important environmental health regu- latory decisions. When it 's time for many of us to buy a car or a house, we take great pains to study the market, examining factors like reliability, safety and resalevalue, before committing ourselves to make such a major investment. As a nation,however, we frequently make decisions about how (or whether) to regulate chemicaland physical agents to improve environmental health \u2014moves that cost the public and private sectors hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014without adequate information. This lack of information is becoming more evident as we move into an era whenthe biggest threats we face are from exposures to low doses, not the high doses we have traditionally faced and tried to control. The most commonly used words in reference to environmental health risks are ''not enough information. '' For example, a committee by the National Research Council recently concluded that ''there is insufficient research, and therefore insuffi- cient evidence, to say whether particular environmental contaminants known as en-docrine disruptors may be dangerous to humans. '' This information gap is not unique to endocrine disruptors. Most experts agree that inadequate information ex-ists regarding the toxicity of chemicals, the variation in susceptibility to toxic sub-stances, the type, pattern, and magnitude of human exposure to chemicals throughthe diet, the workplace, and the environment. In part, the current dilemma has resulted from the success of environmental re- mediation and pollution control and reduction efforts over the past 30 years. Theseefforts have dramatically reduced the human health threats posed by the thousandsof new chemicals and technologies introduced into our environment. In fact, thereare those who argue the environment no longer represents a serious threat tohuman health because the low-dose exposures currently experienced by most Ameri-cans pose no significant health threat. But the assumption that low-dose exposuresdo not present a potential health risk is seriously flawed. We now know that chroniclow-level exposures have the capacity to accumulate and attain toxic concentrationsin brain and other tissues. For example, it is well documented that ingestedmethylmercury can be completely absorbed from the digestive tract and easily accu-mulate in the brain and poison the neurons involved in learning and memory proc-esses. Managing today 's risks will also require consideration of biological concepts that were not part of the environmental health science vernacular as recently as tenyears ago. Concepts such as susceptibility, environmental genomics, high-through-put screening and transgenic technology were not among the priorities of the envi-ronmental health research enterprise. We need to develop new science, new tech-nologies and new ways of conceptualizing and investigating threats to humanhealth. Environmental decisions of the future will require better information andpollution prevention strategies than currently exist today. New approaches areneeded to promote greater participation of local communities and public health offi-cials in environmental health research and policy development in terms of prioritysetting and development of prevention strategies to protect public health. Particularemphasis should be made to include disadvantaged and minority populations in re-search and policy determinations. These groups often bear the greater burden of en-vironmental hazards and, as has been clearly documented, suffer from poorer healththan do more affluent groups. Realizing the public health and economic potential of environmental health re- search requires a number of critical investments. I will focus on three of them \u2014high throughput technologies, susceptibility to environmental toxicants, and exposure as-sessment.165 HIGH THROUGHPUT TECHNOLOGIES In my testimony before this Committee in 1997, I updated you on our efforts to develop and validate high throughput technologies for carcinogenicity and toxicitytesting, including transgenic animal models. Today, I am pleased to report that be-cause of our leadership in this area of research, transgenic animal models, as a toolto study chemical carcinogenesis, is the subject of intense research. In fact, a recentpaper used one of these models to successfully assess chemical carcinogenesis invascular tissue. The hope is that such animal models can be used in a carcino-genicity testing strategy, potentially reducing our dependence on the conventionaltwo-year rodent bioassay. The transgenic bioassays use fewer animals, cost less, andtake less time because of their increased sensitivity to carcinogens and low incidenceof spontaneous tumors. While I am optimistic that transgenic animals will be vali-dated for assessment of carcinogenic or toxic potential of chemicals, we have alreadyinitiated efforts to develop the second generation of alternative test systems basedon differential gene expression. Given that gene expression is continuously modu-lated by environmental cues, exposure to toxic agents can be expected to elicitunique patterns of gene expression. Thus, DNA microarray technology, which canmonitor gene expression, could be a sensitive tool to assess toxicity. The assumptionis that toxic exposures are likely to evoke quantitative and qualitative changes ingene expression. Therefore, this technology should allow toxicologists to expose cellsor tissues to chemicals whose toxicity is unknown and match the results against the''signature, '' or common set of changes in gene expression, produced by a known class of toxicants. This would reduce the need for lengthy and expensive rodent bio-assays (conventional and transgenic) and would lend itself to testing at low dosesand to automation. Today, I want to announce our intent to establish a DNAMicroarray Resource Center to develop and distribute so-called ''Tox-Chips '' con- taining candidate genes \u2014genes known to be involved in cell growth and prolifera- tion and in the biotransformation of environmental carcinogens or toxin \u2014derived from human, mouse and other animal sources. This approach to developing and ap-plying this new technology to the field of toxicology will ensure that all investigatorswill have access to this expensive resource and that the products are the highestquality. SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS It is well known that most smokers do not develop lung cancer and most women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol never develop vaginal and cervical cancer. Acommon question asked of physicians is, ''Why me, Doc? '' One answer to this ques- tion is that genetically-determined differences in susceptibility are at least partly re-sponsible. Significant advances in our understanding of human genetics have shown that specific genes play key roles in disease susceptibility. For example, mutations inBRCA1, P53, XPB, and ATM are predisposing telangiectasia, respectively. Thus, it isreasonable to expect that several of the genetic alterations in other genes will alsohave a significant influence on disease susceptibility. With rapid advances in cloningand sequencing of the human genome, it is now possible to identify the genetic al-terations responsible for differences in susceptibility. The ''sequence '' of the entire human genome will be elucidated within the next 12 months. However, the orderof the bases in the human genome is not one sequence but rather many variationsof a common theme. In fact, sequence variation is ubiquitous in human populations;what differs is the frequencies of these variations. Susceptibility also is influenced by the timing of exposure, the gender and behav- ior of the individual, the nutritional state and socioeconomic status. For example,exposure during rapid or critical stages of development of the various organ systemssuch as embryonic development, adolescence, puberty and old age, is likely to be animportant factor in disease development. We currently have little information toguide decision-making with respect to these issues since most toxicologic assess-ments have been done in adults, both animals and humans, under otherwise opti-mal conditions. To investigate the genetic basis for differences in predisposition to disease, NIEHS extended the domain of genomic mapping and sequencing to address the challengeof genetic diversity. The Environmental Genome Project, initiated two years ago,seeks to identify genetic changes that increase risk for disease development, and theresults from these studies will have profound implications for the practice of medi-cine and environmental health risk assessment. The challenge will be to create arepository of all common variants \u2014a diversity map \u2014and correlate them with spe-166 cific exposures and disease phenotypes through functional and epi- demiologic studies. Today, I am announcing our intent to support the development of Comparative Mouse Genomics Centers that will make use of all available DNA sequence vari-ation data to produce novel transgenic and knockout mouse models which will mir-ror specific variants of human environmentally responsive genes found in the gen-eral population. The Mouse Genomics Centers will bring together a team of inves-tigators to develop mouse models of environmentally relevant human diseases, pro-vide a comprehensive analysis of their phenotype and genotype, and validate themfor their use by the research community. The new models produced by the Centerswill then be used by the scientific community to study diseases resulting from spe-cific insults, including exposure to environmental agents, viruses, nutritional fac-tors, pharmacological drugs, and other physical and chemical stresses. It is important to emphasize that susceptibilities modify risk rather than cause disease. This ''gene-hunt '' and ''mouse-model '' development exercise could have pro- found implications for risk assessment in terms of setting standards for environ-mental exposures. Data on the prevalence of susceptibility genes could take theguesswork out of environmental decision-making with respect to susceptible popu-lations. These studies challenge a fundamental tenet of toxicology; that is, that thedose makes the poison. We now know that it is the host, plus the dose and the timeof exposure, that makes the poison. EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT Exposure monitoring is a ''right-to-know '' issue for citizens who are involuntarily exposed to environmental pollutants. However, little is known about actual humanexposure and body burdens of environmental pollutants. This knowledge gap ham-pers regulatory decision-making and introduces uncertainties in setting exposurelimits. It also limits our capacity to develop effective prevention strategies. Exposure is typically estimated using indirect surrogates of environmental quality such astoxic release and production inventories and environmental monitoring. Individualexposure, though, is highly variable and is a function of individual uptake, metabo-lism, excretion and behavior. So the assumption that everyone living in the samegeographic area have similar exposure is seriously flawed. What we need are directmeasures of exposure based on tissue analysis or deposition. Simple monitoring oflevels of chemicals in the environment does not necessarily reflect amounts takenup and deposited in tissues. Exposure assessment is emerging as a scientific field due to the revolutionary ad- vances in genetics, molecular imaging, molecular biology, and microenvironmentaland personal measurement technology. As these technologies become more robust,sensitive and inexpensive, they will provide the scientific foundation for the quan-titative assessment of human health risk. Exposure analysis provides the long-awaited connection between toxicology and epidemiology, and will provide the basisfor hypothesis-driven research and examination of exposure-disease relationships. Several public health areas will benefit from improvements in exposure assess- ment. The absence of adequate exposure data restricts our ability to (1) evaluatelow-dose effects of exposure to chemicals encountered in the home, workplace andgeneral environment, (2) identify at-risk populations based on age (e.g., children),genetic susceptibility and socioeconomic status, (3) design studies to efficientlyevaluate exposure/response relationships, (4) make full use of the human genomeeffort for studying gene/environment interactions, and (5) to link exposure to humandiseases. In September 1999, the NIEHS and the American Industrial Health Council co- sponsored an interagency workshop on ''The Role of Human Exposure Assessment in the Prevention of Human Disease. '' With more than 400 participants, the three- day workshop represented experts from the various federal agencies, public interestgroups, academia, and industry. Participants considered the workshop a landmarkevent in the field of exposure assessment in that it provided the vision and enthu-siasm for moving the field of exposure assessment away from solely an applied dis-cipline to one in which hypothesis-driven research can effectively connect techno-logical advances to public health problems and controversies. Since the workshop,NIEHS has developed a collaborative relationship with the National Center forHealth Statistics and the U.S. Geological Survey to develop a population-based geo-graphical information system and disease prevalence maps. In conclusion, the power of the science base for environmental health decision- making can now be transformed at a pace that could not have been foreseen a dec-ade ago by even the most astute visionaries. The scientific opportunities presented167 1Small, GW, Rabine, Barry, PV, Barry, PP, et. al. Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Disorders.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. RICHARD J. H ODES Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Institute on Aging (NIA) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $721,651,000, which reflects an increase of $37,933,000 over thecomparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation forAIDS, total support requested for the National Institute on Aging is $725,949,000,an increase of $38,088,000 over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for NIAefforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research budgetrequest. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. Since the NIA 's inception in 1974, tremendous strides have been made in uncover- ing the mysteries of the aging process, reducing disease and disability, and improv-ing the quality of life for older Americans. The pace of scientific discovery has beenimpressive, and the Institute anticipates building upon these advances in the future.I am pleased to report the NIA 's recent progress, in reducing disability and extend- ing healthy active years of life for all Americans. ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE RESEARCH Alzheimer 's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is the result of ab- normal changes in the brain that lead to a devastating decline in intellectual abili-ties and changes in behavior and personality. Tragically, as many as four millionAmericans 1now suffer from Alzheimer 's disease \u2014a number that threatens to in- crease dramatically as the population of people most at risk for dementia, thoseaged 85 and older, reaches almost 20 million by the middle of the 21st century. 2 NIA, as the lead Federal agency responsible for Alzheimer 's disease research, recog- nizes the urgency of this looming public health threat and is supporting basic, clin-ical, and behavioral research to improve AD diagnosis, treatment, and patient care,and to delay, and eventually prevent, the onset of this devastating disease. Ad-vances in our understanding of AD over the last 20 years have been substantial,enabling the NIA to launch the Alzheimer 's Disease Prevention Initiative. In col- laboration with other Federal agencies and the private sector, the AD PreventionInitiative is invigorating discovery of new treatments, risk and preventative factors,methods of early detection and diagnosis; and strategies for improving patient careand alleviating caregiver burdens. The initiative is also accelerating movement ofpromising new treatments and prevention strategies into clinical trials, and is im-proving understanding of normal brain function. In 1999, the NIA launched the first large-scale AD prevention clinical trial sup- ported by the NIH, the Memory Impairment Study (MIS), being conducted at morethan 65 medical research institutions in North America. In this trial, vitamin E,and donepezil (Aricept) will be evaluated over a three-year period for their effective-ness in slowing or stopping the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI),a condition characterized by a memory deficit without dementia, to AD. Other ongo-ing or upcoming AD prevention trials will examine the effectiveness of ibuprofen (ananti-inflammatory drug) in reducing the development of AD; the effect of estrogenreplacement therapy in preventing AD in women with a family history of the dis- ease; and whether treatment with a variety of agents, such as aspirin, vitamin E,antioxidants, or combined folate/B6/B12 supplementation can prevent AD. The ef-fects of these agents on normal age-related decline will also be evaluated. Informa-tion about ongoing clinical trials is available to the public through the NIA-sup-ported Alzheimer 's Disease Education and Referral Center web site (www.alzheimers.org) and toll-free number (1 -800-438-4380). The ability to assess the effectiveness of early treatments or interventions, such as those being tested in the AD Prevention Initiative, will be enhanced by our abil-168 ity to visualize brain function using new imaging techniques. In a recent study, in- vestigators used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine volume measure-ments of the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for memory function,in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (Chart #1). Based on threeyears of observations, researchers found that in older people with MCI, the smallerthe hippocampus at the beginning of the study, the greater the risk of developingAD later. This imaging study illustrates how abnormal cerebral function or anatomycan be detected before clinical diagnosis and how diagnostic advances can help en-sure the effective application of emerging early interventions. Advances in imagingtechniques also have important diagnostic implications for other neurodegenerativediseases, such as Parkinson 's disease. Developing effective treatments for AD based on advances in basic research is a major focus of NIA-supported studies. The ability of researchers to conceptualize ef-fective treatments was enhanced by the discovery of two enzymes, beta and gammasecretase, that are involved in the clipping of a normal cell surface protein toproduce the amyloid peptide that forms the senile plaques found in the brains ofAD patients (Chart #2). Identifying and understanding how these two enzymes workwill accelerate the development of interventions to block their action and stop thedevelopment of AD plaques. NIA will also support research to evaluate the potentialof an immunization approach recently developed by researchers in the private sec-tor, which, in mice, prevented the formation of amyloid plaques associated with AD. A transgenic mouse strain that expresses a human tau gene and develops AD-like tau tangles has been developed. This model will help scientists understand how tauproduces AD in the brain, and together with other AD models, will move research-ers closer to developing effective preventive or treatment interventions. In anotherstudy, researchers demonstrated that shrinkage and dysfunction of certain braincells that occur with age might be reversible. Researchers inserted into skin cellsa gene that makes human nerve growth factor (NGF) and then injected the modifiedcells into the brains of experimental animals. After three months, the older animalsinjected with NGF-expressing cells had brains that resembled those of younger ani-mals. Such gene transfer approaches to recovering cellular function could eventuallyhave important implications for the treatment of AD and other chronic age-relatedneurodegenerative disorders in humans. BIOLOGY OF AGING Research on the biology of aging has led to a revolution in understanding the cel- lular and molecular changes that occur with aging and the abnormal changes thatare risk factors for or accompany age-related diseases. Further, research is revealinggenetic and other biologic factors associated with extended longevity in animal mod-els, contributing to the development of interventions to reduce or delay age-relateddegenerative processes in humans. Presently, caloric restriction is the only interven-tion known to slow the intrinsic rate of aging in mammals. Rodents and other lab-oratory animals that are given a diet that includes necessary nutrients, but 30 to40 percent fewer calories than in usual diets, live far beyond their normal life spansand have reduced rates and later onset of diseases. A recent study analyzed thegene expression profiles of cells from young and from old mice on usual or caloricallyrestricted diets. Of the 6,347 genes surveyed by new micro-array techniques, fewerthan one percent displayed a greater than twofold decrease in expression. Thus, theaging process may be associated with changes in expression of a limited subset ofgenes, rather than involving widespread changes in most genes. It was further ob-served that caloric restriction completely or partially suppressed age-associated al-terations in expression of a large proportion of genes. This type of molecular assess-ment of mammalian aging will provide new tools to evaluate experimental interven-tions for age-related conditions. Over the last ten years, numerous genes have been implicated in normal aging processes, in age-related pathologies and diseases, and in determination of longevityin several species including humans (Chart #3). Understanding the molecular genet-ics of aging and longevity is a rapidly advancing field; recent research advanceshave greatly expanded our knowledge of genes and biological pathways which playsignificant roles in determining longevity and health span. Recent discoveries innon-mammalian species including S. cerevisiae (yeast), C. elegans, (roundworms),and D. melanogaster, (fruit flies), have identified striking effects of mutations, ei-ther singly or in specific combinations, on lifespan, increasing life spans 2 to 3 timeslonger than those of (wild type) normally aged animals. These findings suggest sig-naling and metabolic pathways that may be critical in determining longevity. In ad-dition, cross-species comparisons have identified homologous (similar) genes in ani-mals and in humans that have similar or related functions. For example, mutations169 that double the life span of C. elegans occur in genes that are homologous to genes associated with insulin and glucose (sugar) metabolism in humans, and may there-fore be relevant to weight control and diabetes. REDUCING DISEASE AND DISABILITY Studies have shown that disability rates for people age 65 and older have been falling at an accelerating pace since 1982 and that the benefits of this trend extendto both men and women, and to minority groups. Initial field reports from the 1999wave of the National Long-Term Care Survey indicate that disability rates havecontinued to fall. These data parallel heartening news from investigators who foundthat many centenarians remain functionally independent for the vast majority oftheir lives. More research is needed to understand the genetic and environmentalfactors responsible for centenarians ' prolonged good health and extreme longevity. Similarly, more research is necessary to understand the causes and economic con-sequences of the decline in disability rates and to further accelerate these improve-ments. Increasingly, researchers are understanding the benefits of exercise, especially for older people, as a key to preventing or delaying the onset of disease and disability.Specifically, studies have revealed that moderate physical activity can: reduce therisk of falls; benefit people suffering from a variety of ailments, including osteo-arthritis and depression; and may enhance learning, memory and the generation ofbrain cells. There is also scientific evidence that exercise may be a factor related to increased life expectancy and the number of years people live free of disability.In a recent study, it was shown that becoming fit, even in later years (as measuredby performance on an exercise treadmill test), is associated with lower mortalityrates (Chart #4). The study, which included 9,000 men aged 20 to 82, compareddeath rates in physically unfit men who remained unfit over five years with phys-ically unfit men who became fit during the same period. The study found that unfitmen aged 60 and over who became fit had death rates 50 percent lower than thosewho remained unfit. In another clinical trial involving chronically ill older adults,aged 70 and older, researchers reported that one year of increased physical activity,combined with chronic-illness self-management resulted in fewer reported hos-pitalizations and total hospital days. These studies show that exercise can benefitolder people and that it is never too late to start. The challenge remains to motivatemore people to engage in regular physical activity \u2014particularly older women and minorities who, according to national surveys, are consistently less active. Last year,the National Institute on Aging published a free manual, Exercise: A Guide fromthe National Institute on Aging, the cornerstone of the Institute 's ongoing campaign to encourage older people to exercise. The Guide is based on scientific evidence andis intended to help people design their own exercise program. To date, the Institutehas distributed over 230,000 copies. REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES Health disparities are associated with a broad, complex, and interrelated array of factors, including race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age, education, occu-pation, and as yet unknown lifetime and lifestyle differences. Prevalence rates ofspecific diseases are also associated with race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.One recent multi-ethnic epidemiologic study indicated that prevalence rates for Alz-heimer 's disease may be higher for African-Americans and Hispanics. In an exam- ination of genetic risk factors for AD, although APOE4 is associated with higher riskof AD among Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanic elders with the APOE4allele were not at higher risk than those with other APOE alleles. Understandingthe genetic and environmental risk factors contributing to this difference will becrucial to developing effective interventions to reducing the disparity. NIA has made reducing health disparities a major priority of its five-year stra- tegic plan. Last year, with support from the NIH Office of Research on MinorityHealth, the NIA intramural program designed a mobile medical research vehicle toextend the opportunity to participate in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Agingand in other clinical research projects to minority and socioeconomically diverse sub-jects. The NIA, working with the National Advisory Council on Aging, also under-took a comprehensive review of its minority aging research activities and traininginitiatives. The NIA is developing an implementation plan to integrate the resultingrecommendations into its programs, such as the Resource Centers for MinorityAging Research, which provide mentoring and training opportunities to individualsinterested in studying the health of minority elders, and the Alzheimer 's Disease Centers satellite clinics, which recruit minorities for research protocols conducted bythe NIA 's 28 AD centers.170 Investigators supported by the NIA continue to report exciting scientific advances that may help eliminate health disparities among groups of elders. Investigators re-cently published a study, which suggests that there is a difference between African-American and Caucasian women in their experience of peri-menopausal symptoms.African-American women were significantly more likely than white women (58 per-cent vs. 29 percent) to experience hot flashes, but fewer than 7 percent had dis-cussed menopausal management with their physicians. Given our developing under-standing of hormone replacement therapy in controlling menopausal symptoms aswell as in reducing risk of problems in later life, such as osteoporosis, improved, cul-turally-appropriate patient education programs should be encouraged. A decade ago, few interventions were available to address the major health con- cerns of older people. Entering the 21st century, the outlook has improved consider-ably. More interventions exist and research into treating, as well as preventing, theonset of age-related diseases is escalating. With the knowledge this research will de-rive, aging will be a healthier, more vigorous stage of life. I am happy to answeryour questions.171 172 173 174 175 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. STEPHEN I. K ATZ Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased to present the President 's non-AIDS budget request for the NIAMS for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $363,479,000, which reflects an increase of $19,021,000 over the comparable fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, total supportrequested for the NIAMS is $368,712,000, an increase of $19,232,000 over the fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NIAMS efforts in AIDS are included withinthe Office of AIDS Research budget request. I am honored to appear before this Subcommittee. I want to begin by providing a context for the research mission of our Institute. As the Director of the NIAMS,I am acutely aware that the every day life of the American people is enormouslyimproved by the research that our Institute supports. Children on the playground,women and ethnic minorities who are disproportionately afflicted by the many dis-eases that affect their daily activities, adults in the work place, and elderly Ameri-cans striving to live independently \u2014all have their lives enhanced or compromised by the health and functioning of their bones, joints, muscle, and skin. Ensuring im-proved quality of life and increased longevity of life for all Americans is our primarymission. I want to express my appreciation for the fiscal year 2000 appropriation \u2014the sec- ond year of an extraordinary budget that enabled us to invest in medical researchwith much more breadth and depth than ever before. I will share specific examplesof ways in which we invested our budget over the last year and some of the researchdirections we are pursuing. CLINICAL RESEARCH The focus of most of my remarks today will be on clinical research. While the backbone of medical science has been and will continue to be fundamental researchon how the body functions, the ultimate goal of research supported by the NIH isimproving public health. In order to achieve this, we must also serve as trans-lators \u2014translating the basic research findings from the laboratory to improving pa- tient care at the bedside as well as utilizing the information learned at the patientbedside to inform more focused and sophisticated basic studies. This translation isthe cornerstone of the research supported by the NIAMS. Highlights of particularly exciting and promising translational research on bones, joints, muscles and skin include the findings that lower doses of estrogen than wenormally prescribe can be effective in preventing osteoporosis, that some of the newtreatments for rheumatoid arthritis can be targeted directly at the disease-causingfactors, that normal hair growth is controlled by genes that encode for proteins thatmay be excellent targets for new therapies, and that proteins that are essential fornormal muscle formation can, in mouse models, be produced by injecting particulargenes into the muscles that contain the defective proteins. These examples provideonly a broad sample of some of the most recent findings from research studies that we have supported. The reality is that clinical research is vitally important, but is also very costly. The significant increase in our appropriation last year enabled us to launch a num-ber of clinical initiatives in particularly challenging areas of health, including: (1)Pilot studies in rheumatic diseases and skin diseases \u2014These studies include ex- panded research on some of the most difficult public health challenges such as legulcers, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, spondylitis and others where newtreatment approaches are needed. (2) Osteoporosis in men \u2014A major clinical trial will determine the extent to which the risk of fracture in men is related to bonemass and structure, biochemistry, lifestyle, tendency to fall, and other factors. Thestudy will also seek to determine if bone mass can be correlated with an increasedrisk of prostate cancer. (3) Combination therapies for osteoporosis \u2014It is important to determine whether combinations of drugs, often produced by different pharma-ceutical companies, will be more effective and have fewer side effects than any ofthe drugs used alone for osteoporosis. (4) Treatment of back pain \u2014Back pain is very common and has a serious impact on people 's personal and professional lives, and results in significant costs to businesses and the American economy. We havelaunched a major clinical trial studying surgical versus nonsurgical treatment ofthree different back disorders. We anticipate that this study will have a significanteffect on clinical practice and the cost of medical services for people with any ofthese three back disorders. (5) The Spondylitis Consortium \u2014The NIAMS has partnered with the American Spondylitis Association in establishing the NorthAmerican Spondylitis Consortium to search for genes that determine susceptibilityto ankylosing spondylitis, a painful inflammatory disease of the spine, also knownas arthritis of the spine. and (6) Clinical research training and career develop-176 ment \u2014Because we need to develop and maintain a pipeline of researchers who are training to plan, conduct, analyze, and disseminate the findings of clinical research,the NIAMS has enthusiastically embraced and participated in the NIH initiativesto develop and maintain careers in clinical research. AUTOIMMUNITY The NIAMS supports a broad and diverse portfolio of research on autoimmunity, including studies of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus skin diseases \u2014all po- tentially devastating chronic diseases which exact a huge toll in human sufferingand economic costs. The additional funds provided by Congress for theAutoimmunity Initiative last year provided the opportunity for the NIAMS to ex-pand its research in the following key areas: (1) pilot trials on innovative therapiesfor rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma; (2) target organ damage in autoimmunediseases, also focusing on scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis; (3) autoimmune ratrepository and transgenic resource \u2014a national resource and development center for rat models of autoimmune disorders; (4) NIAMS patient data registries \u2014in which information will be collected on neonatal lupus and on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,with an expansion to include genetic studies; and (5) new imaging technologies forautoimmune diseases, through a project involving in vivo imaging of tiny blood ves-sels in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis. FIBROMYALGIA The NIAMS has a firm commitment to identifying the causes of fibromyalgia and improving the daily life of people affected by this debilitating disease, and we havea broad portfolio of research in this area. Last year the NIAMS as well as theNIDCR, NINDS, and the ORWH funded fifteen new clinical and basic research stud-ies on fibromyalgia, and we are confident that these new studies will provide much-needed information on the causes of fibromyalgia as well as new strategies for treat-ments. MUSCLE DISEASES People affected by muscle diseases face profound changes and challenges in their every day lives. We now know that many of these diseases are caused by genetic mutations, and we are supporting research to further define these mutations andto overcome the current barriers to effective gene therapy of muscle diseases. Weare optimistic that genetic manipulation of skeletal muscle will improve therapy formuscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Facioscapulohumeraldystrophy. The Institute, in collaboration with the National Institute of NeurologicalDisorders and Stroke, is sponsoring workshops in both of these areas in May 2000and we are looking forward to hearing recommendations from experts in these fieldson research directions we could pursue in fiscal year 2001. OSTEOARTHRITIS As many Americans are well aware, osteoarthritis is the most common disease of joints. The NIAMS continues to support a substantial amount of research across thefull spectrum of scientific approaches and strategies to understand this disease andimprove life for affected people. In July 1999 we sponsored a major conference onosteoarthritis with the participation of leading experts in this field and many re-lated fields. We used this opportunity to have a tandem educational meeting for pa-tients whose daily lives are affected by osteoarthritis. We learned a great deal aboutthe disease from both kinds of experts \u2014those doing research on osteoarthritis and those living with it. We are carefully considering the recommendations made fromboth sets of experts to strengthen our portfolio in osteoarthritis using the fiscal year2001 appropriation, particularly in the area of prevention. The NIAMS is alsopartnering with our colleagues in the National Institute on Aging, the Food andDrug Administration, many pharmaceutical companies, and several professional andvoluntary lay organizations to try to create a public-private partnership to identifybiomarkers for osteoarthritis. Our goal is to support clinical and laboratory evalua-tions of biomarkers and imaging techniques as potential surrogate endpoints forclinical trials that would assess the efficacy of osteoarthritis disease-modifying inter-ventions. OSTEOPOROSIS We have known for some time that osteoporosis has genetic components, but the genes that are actually associated with fractures themselves had not previously177 been identified. Scientists have found that older women who have the gene for apolipoprotein E, also known as APOE*4, are at increased risk for hip and wristfractures. We know about this gene from other studies of its association with com-mon, late-onset forms of Alzheimer 's disease and with osteoporosis in patients on dialysis. This represents a promising area for further study in patients withosteoporosis as well as those with Alzheimer 's disease, who are known to have a higher risk of hip fracture. In March 2000 the NIAMS and other NIH components will hold a Consensus De- velopment Conference on osteoporosis to address many key questions and to bringa focus to scientific opportunities that could be pursued in this major public healthproblem that compromises daily activities for millions of Americans of all ages. Theinformation that comes from this Conference will be broadly disseminated to physi-cians and other caregivers, as well as to the public. SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS In genetic studies of lupus, researchers have found an association between the disease and a region on chromosome 1. Fine mapping of this region has identifiedanother candidate gene involved in immune function. Studies of the genetics oflupus may identify potential therapeutic targets and may facilitate the developmentof markers of disease activity. While medical research has certainly made a signifi-cant difference in the daily lives of people (primarily women) with lupus, this re-mains a major public health problem that compromises the quality and longevity of life for many Americans. In addition to the many systems of the body that areaffected, patients with lupus also have a higher risk of neuropsychiatric manifesta-tions and accelerated atherosclerosis. In 1999 the NIAMS sponsored workshops inboth of these areas, and we intend to follow-up on the many excellent recommenda-tions from experts who participated in these two meetings. SKIN DISEASES Gene therapy has potential for treating many skin diseases, diseases that signifi- cantly compromise daily life for millions of Americans both physically and psycho-logically. In addition, skin can also serve as a factory for the production of moleculesincluding hormones such as insulin and human growth hormone that are used inthe treatment of many systemic diseases. Skin provides a number of advantages forgene therapy approaches, including the ability to remove genetically altered skin bysimple excision if problems develop. The NIAMS is supporting a scientific conferencein March 2000 to increase the level of interest in gene therapy using skin and toidentify scientific opportunities and needs in this area. HEALTH DISPARITIES While we know that disease can strike people at every age, of either gender, and in every ethic group, we also know that many diseases affect women and membersof minority groups disproportionately \u2014both in increased numbers and increased se- verity of the diseases. Even if variables such as socioeconomic status, access tohealth care, and insurance coverage are eliminated, the fact remains that diseaseslike lupus, scleroderma, osteoarthritis, and vitiligo all account for disparities in thehealth of women and minorities. We are actively seeking to understand the causesof these gender and ethnic differences, and we are expanding our commitment tobetter understanding of health disparities. We are also increasing our efforts to dis-seminate health information to minority populations and have established a toll-freeline in both Spanish and English as well as produced a number of our publicationsin Spanish. Plans are underway for a workshop to address promising opportunitiesfor research in this area. In addition, members of our Intramural Research Programare designing an outreach program targeted toward the minority community. Whileit is still in preliminary stages, it will ultimately include both local and national out-reach efforts. CONCLUSION Bones, joints, muscles, and skin are central components of the human body. When the functions of any of these areas are affected, the daily lives of people are com-promised. We are committed to continuing to support basic research as well as themany clinical studies underway, including those exploring the roles of genetics, theenvironment, diet, and behavior in disease. I cite our scientific achievements withpride, and I pledge to continue my commitment to support high quality science thatwill continue to improve the health of the American people.178 The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the perform-ance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 re- sults to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our performancemeasures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indi-cators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continuously im-prove programs across the NIH and the Department. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES F. B ATTEY , JR. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget for the National Institute on Deafness and Other Commu- nication Disorders (NIDCD) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $276.4 million, which re-flects an increase of $14.3 million over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropria-tion. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, total support requested forNIDCD is $278 million, an increase of $14.3 million over the fiscal year 2000 appro-priation. Funds for the NIDCD efforts in AIDS research are included within the Of-fice of AIDS Research budget request. Within the last year, we have witnessed out-standing research progress in human communication and communication disordersby NIDCD-supported scientists and clinicians, progress further accelerated by theefforts of other NIH institutes. DEVELOPMENT How Inner Ear Hair Cells Grow .\u2014In humans, auditory sensory cells (hair cells) and other internal parts of the ears develop within the third month of development.These fragile, highly specialized cells, which are essential for the hearing process,are often damaged or lost as a consequence of noise, genetic mutation, drugs orother environmental insults. The resulting hearing impairment is permanent, sincethese cells do not regenerate in humans. NIDCD-supported scientists are examiningthe cellular and molecular processes that direct progenitor cells to differentiate intohair cells, leading to new approaches to stimulate hair cell regeneration after dam-age. These investigators have shown that in the mouse, the Math1 gene is essentialfor regulating the development of hair cells and progenitor cells. These findings pro-vide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating hair cell differentiationand specification. INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD Better Procedures to Screen Infants for Hearing Impairment .\u2014The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association estimates that as many as 12,000 infantseach year in the U.S. are born with significant hearing loss, making it a commoncongenital disorder. Research supported by NIDCD has shown that detection ofhearing impairment and intervention within the first six months after birth is veryimportant for optimizing language development in young children. In a five-year,multi-center study, NIDCD-supported scientists determined the optimal test proce-dures for neonatal hearing screening. This study was the first controlled comparisonof normal hearing and hearing-impaired infants evaluating physiological responsesto sound. The development of precise and timely diagnostic screening techniques forhearing impairment is the first step in providing early intervention strategies thatwill optimize the development of either spoken or signed language skills. TheNIDCD is supporting research to develop and validate intervention strategies thatare tailored to the individual with hearing impairment. Hereditary Hearing Impairment \u2014Gene Discovery and Implications .\u2014Not only is hearing screening becoming available to all newborns, breakthroughs in medical ge-netics will enable scientists to identify the precise genetic change leading to heredi-tary hearing impairment. NIDCD-supported scientists have learned that about one-third of all recessive hereditary hearing impairment within the U.S. is caused bymutations in the GJB2 gene. But further studies have shown that there is signifi-cant variation in the degree and time-of-onset of hearing impairment among individ- uals with exactly the same mutation in both GJB2 genes. Given this variation, itwould be difficult to predict onset and degree of impairment in these infants usingonly data from a GJB2 genetic test. The NIDCD is interested in pursuing areas ofresearch to develop and validate diagnostic genetic tests, to assess the potential im-pact of genetic testing and the utilization of genetic information on attitudes andbehaviors of various cultural groups and individuals.179 Otitis Media \u2014Vaccine Development and Genetic Susceptibility .\u2014In an NIDCD- supported study, scientists have discovered that there is a strong heritable compo-nent to prolonged time with and recurrent episodes of otitis media (middle ear infec-tion) in children. The results of this study may have future implications for primarycare physicians to identify children and siblings at high risk for otitis media forcareful monitoring and early intervention. In addition, with the recent emergenceof antibiotic resistant bacterial isolates, it is clear that the best long-term strategyfor otitis media is prevention. NIDCD scientists have developed a detoxifiedlipooligosaccharide-protein conjugate to be used as a possible vaccine against non-typable Haemophilus influenzae , a leading cause of otitis media in children for which there is no vaccine currently available. A Phase I clinical study is nearingcompletion in adult volunteers to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of theinvestigational vaccine. Preliminary data from this study show that the vaccine isable to elicit the production of specific antibodies against the bacteria in a numberof volunteer subjects. The results of this trial suggest that this investigational vac-cine may be useful for preventing otitis media in children. Cochlear Implants May Improve Language Achievement in Children .\u2014The coch- lear implant is an array of electrodes that converts sound into electrical impulsesthat stimulate the acoustic nerve, restoring the perception of sound. It is the onlyneural prosthesis in widespread clinical use with over 20,000 recipients, about one-half of whom are children. Scientists supported by the NIDCD conducted a studyto measure language achievement in children with cochlear implants. The study,comparing a group of children who had received cochlear implants and a secondgroup who were using hearing aids, showed significant differences in languageachievement levels favoring the children using cochlear implants. Improved Methods for Diagnosing Early Childhood Stuttering .\u2014Stuttering is a disorder that typically begins between the ages of 2 and 5. When it persists, thedisorder causes serious impairment in verbal communication that is often associatedwith significant difficulties in emotional and social adjustments. NIDCD is sup-porting a large-scale longitudinal investigation of children who stutter to examinevarious aspects of stuttering as it persists or subsides during childhood. In addition,the study is identifying risk factors that can help differentiate between children whodevelop persistent stuttering and those who tend to recover. The data reveal astrong genetic component to stuttering and differences in genetic liability betweendifferent subsets of children who stutter. Based on these findings, NIDCD-supportedinvestigators have initiated a genetic association study to map and identify thegenes that predispose individuals to stutter. Defining and Identifying Specific Language Impairment in Children .\u2014Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a language disability observed in the absence of anyother cognitive disorders, affecting as many as 8 percent of all kindergarten-agechildren. Research to understand and treat SLI has been hampered by the lack of uniformity in the definitions and measures that are used to identify preschool-agedand older children, adolescents or adults with SLI. NIDCD-supported researchershave developed definitional guidelines and research directions that will lead to en-hanced abilities to diagnose and assess SLI, determining that a brief non-word rep-etition task is a powerful predictor of SLI. This test differentiates between childrenwho will benefit from language intervention and children who will not require inter-vention to achieve normal language skills. Eliminating Health Disparities in Hearing and Language Disorders .\u2014As research moves forward to reduce the burden of disease in America, the NIDCD is committedto the idea that all segments of American people should benefit from this progress.In comparison to the general U.S. population, Native American children have oneof the highest rates of otitis media. The NIDCD is continuing its support of a studyon the epidemiology of this disorder and hearing loss among Native American in-fants, from birth to age two, at the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. Recentassessment shows that intervention programs should focus on parental smoking asa significant risk factor for otitis media in Native American infants. The study alsoincludes the development and implementation of prevention strategies to reduce theburden of otitis media such as promoting breastfeeding. Treatment for Deafness Caused by Neurofibromatosis Type 2 .\u2014The NIDCD is con- ducting research on neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a genetic disorder that oftenresults in bilateral tumors of the acoustic nerves causing deafness in children andadults. Scientists supported by the NIDCD have determined that specific mutationsin the NF2 gene result in different levels of severity of the disease. This finding willfacilitate early DNA-based diagnoses that will improve disease management and in-crease the preservation of hearing in NF2 patients. For many individuals with NF2,surgical intervention required to remove tumors also involves resection of bothacoustic nerves, so that sound perception cannot be restored with cochlear implanta-180 tion. To help these individuals, NIDCD is supporting to develop a special- ized auditory prosthesis for NF2 patients. implanted directly into the ventral cochlear nucleus of animals, the por-tion of the central auditory system where the acoustic nerve fibers once made con-nections. These animal studies have demonstrated the safety of this technique anddeaf NF2 patients are now scheduled to be fitted with these devices within the nextfew years with the hope of restoring auditory perception. ADULTHOOD The Hazards of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss .\u2014When an individual is exposed to sounds that are too loud, the hair cells needed to detect sound in the inner ear canbe damaged, resulting in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). NIHL is a major healthconcern, but it is preventable. In a public outreach effort, the NIDCD has launchedthe ''WISE EARS! '' campaign, where a national coalition of over 60 government agencies, public organizations, businesses, industries and unions is working to in-form the public about the risk of NIHL. Molecular Mechanisms Governing Our Sense of Taste .\u2014In humans, the loss of taste sensation can contribute to the loss of appetite and poor nutrition, a particu-larly common problem for older Americans. In a collaborative effort joining molec-ular biologists supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Re-search, NIDCD, and investigators at the University of California, San Diego, can-didate sweet and bitter taste receptors have been cloned and characterized. Thesereceptors are selectively expressed in a non-overlapping subset of taste receptor cellson the tongue. This research is an important step in determining the molecularpathway activated by sweet and bitter substances, and will guide future researchstudies in identifying additional molecules in this poorly understood pathway. Genetic Association and Age-Related Causes for Hearing Loss .\u2014A recent NIDCD- supported study has demonstrated that a genetic component exists for age-relatedhearing loss. It is likely that different mutations in the same genes that cause pro-found hereditary hearing impairment in children also cause age-related hearing loss(presbycusis), a common problem for older Americans. With the ability to predictwho is at increased risk, better strategies to minimize or delay hearing loss withinthe aging population can be developed. NIDCD/Department of Veterans Affairs Hearing Aid Clinical Trial Yields Impor- tant Results .\u2014The prevalence for hearing impairment significantly increases with age and hearing aids are the most common means of assistance for persons withhearing loss. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the NIDCD conducted amulti-center trial, which included elderly volunteers, to compare the efficacy of threecommonly used hearing aid circuits. Data from the trial showed that performancedifferences among the three hearing aid circuits were minimal. Of greater impor-tance, the trial demonstrated that each circuit improved speech recognition with im-provement observed under both quiet and noisy listening conditions. NIDCD re-mains committed to support research leading to smaller and better hearing aids,capitalizing on bioengineering advances in microelectronics. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. STEVEN E. H YMAN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $896,059,000, an increase of $50,083,000 (or 5.9 percent) abovethe comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation forAIDS, total support requested for NIMH is $1,031,353,000, an increase of$56,680,000 over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NIMH efforts inAIDS research are included in the Office of AIDS Research budget request. AREAS OF NEW INVESTMENT This has been a remarkable year for the NIMH, both in our development of sci- entific programs and in our ability to contribute to public understanding of mentalillness. Thanks to a healthy increase in our budget, we expanded our newTranslational Centers program, which aims to bring basic science as rapidly as pos-sible into the clinical arena. We built on our investment in studies of genetic risk181 factors for schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, and early onset major depres- sion, with particular emphasis on expanding our gene repository for research on au-tism. We initiated two major clinical trials, one on best use of new antipsychoticdrugs and one on the treatment of individuals with depression who do not benefitfrom standard, initial treatments. We reported the findings of a multi-site collabo-rative study on treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a public healthproblem of immense concern to parents, teachers, and health care providers, and wehave initiated epidemiologic studies that will enable us to address disparities inmental health treatment outcomes with ever greater effectiveness. HEIGHTENED PUBLIC AWARENESS OF MENTAL ILLNESS Growing recognition that mental illnesses are real diseases of an organ, the brain; that they are diagnosable and treatable; that they represent an enormous publichealth burden \u2014for example, depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States; and that current treatments can have an enormous impact on dimin-ishing that burden spurred several important public education efforts in 1999. Theseincluded the White House Conference on Mental Health and Mental Illness, and theSurgeon General 's Report on Mental Health, the first-ever on this topic. Responding to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics that 31,000 Americanscommitted suicide in 1996, more than half again the approximately 20,000 U.S.homicides that year, the Surgeon General issued a Call to Action to Prevent Suicide,which now is the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. and, as the Centers for Disease Control reports, the third-leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year oldAmericans. NIMH has been privileged to play a critical role in providing scientificdata and educational materials for all three of these activities. We have come far in the science of mental illness and mental health, but we still have much to learn. We are thankful that the generous support of the Americanpeople, through the Congress, has made it possible to attack difficult problems atmany levels. Perhaps most critical to our long-term goals of curing \u2014and ultimately preventing \u2014serious and disabling diseases like autism, schizophrenia, manic de- pressive illness, depression, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders, is our enhancedability to expand long-term investments aimed at understanding the fundamentalorganization of brain and behavior. This is a time of remarkable progress in molec-ular and cellular biology, systems-level neurobiology, and cognitive neuroscience,and a time of unparalleled opportunity afforded by technologies ranging from genechips to noninvasive neuroimaging. As our basic science matures, we have initiatedprograms aimed at speeding and enhancing the translation of that basic science intoclinical applications. CENTERS FOR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE What do I mean by ''translational science? '' Let me describe briefly how several projects at one Center link basic and clinical research. Collaborating scientists atthe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University are testing a hypoth-esis that certain abnormalities in thinking (or cognition) that are characteristic ofschizophrenia reflect an impairment of functions in a particular brain region, thedorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. This disorder typically strikes in the late teen yearsor early twenties \u2014just when families and, indeed, society are completing their in- vestment in the education of a young person. Thus, this project is examining in ani-mal models and in clinical research how the brain 's circuitry changes over the course of development and, particularly during adolescence. Since both genes andenvironment influence brain development, one component of this study uses newgene chip technologies to examine how genes influence the circuitry of the prefrontalcortex; using the new chip technology, the investigator can determine which geneshave been active and which have been suppressed in the post-mortem brains of pa-tients with schizophrenia compared with normal controls; a similar gene analysisis being done with adolescent monkeys. Other facets of the project involve studiesof a neurotransmitter, dopamine, that plays a critical role in memory functionsserved by the prefrontal cortex, and functional brain imaging studies of patientswith schizophrenia and controls, with the aim of determining the extent to whichcognitive abnormalities can be ascribed to the effects of dopamine on frontal cortex.What 's exciting is that each of these discrete projects is addressing fundamental bio- logical questions, allowing investigators to relate findings obtained from basic ani-mal studies to clinical research with an unprecedented degree of coordination. Giventhe awesome complexity of the brain, we believe that team efforts like this have thebest chance of understanding what goes wrong in the brain in schizophrenia. In another Translational Center, investigators are exploring the relationship be- tween fear and stress in animal models; a key aim is to determine whether the ef-182 fects of stress on fear circuits mimic changes that occur in fear-related disorders in humans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and panic disorders, andparanoid schizophrenia. Investigators at NYU, Columbia University, and RockefellerUniversity, are using an identical behavioral paradigm \u2014fear conditioning \u2014to exam- ine fear circuits from multiple perspectives, in animal and human studies. One ef-fort that will benefit immensely from its interaction with other Center studies willfollow up on findings that acute and chronic stress inhibits neurogenesis \u2014that is, the generation of new neurons in the adult brain. This question has extraordinaryramifications for understanding mental disorders and refining treatments. IDENTIFYING VULNERABILITY GENES FOR MENTAL DISORDERS We have greatly augmented our investment in the genetics of schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, major depression, autism, and other mental disorders. Itis now certain that these disorders have a genetic component, but solving the genet-ics and identifying disease vulnerability genes is extremely difficult because vulner-ability to these disorders results from the effects of many genes, each contributingrelatively small and interactive effects, as opposed to an illness, such as Hunting-ton's disease, in which a single gene contributes a large effect. However, as we have learned from other central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer 's disease, the discovery of vulnerability genes can lead to the identification and validation ofexciting new targets for development of therapies. During the coming year, all ofour genetics efforts will be aided by the sequencing of the human, mouse, and otheranimal model genomes and by ongoing projects to investigate human genetic diver-sity, especially as it might apply to disease risk. TREATMENT RESEARCH ON AUTISM Pending findings from the genetics studies that I mentioned, NIMH remains deep- ly committed to improving treatments currently available for autism, a brain dis-order that affects between 1 to 2 of every 1,000 Americans, with often devastating,lifetime effects on thinking, feeling, and social functioning \u2014all uniquely human at- tributes. A network of five NIMH-supported psychopharmacology research units areevaluating drug treatments for autism, such as risperidone and valproate. Amongstudies of psychosocial treatments in autism, we fund two projects evaluating parenttraining interventions that are tailored to the particular characteristics of child andfamily. Of course, we participate in the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee. NEW CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS During the last fiscal year, NIMH has initiated large-scale clinical trials on the best use of new antipsychotic medications and the treatment of individuals whofailed to respond to initial antidepressant treatments. Along with our ongoing trialsin adolescent depression and in bipolar disorder, which we initiated over the pasttwo years, this thrust represents a substantial recommitment to clinical treatmentstudies for people with mental illness. These particular studies represent a newfrontier in clinical treatment research because they will study truly representativesamples of individuals with mental disorders. That is, eligibility for participating inthese treatment studies no longer is limited to rarified populations within academichealth centers, but is open to general populations in diverse health care settings.This new approach requires NIMH take great care to observe appropriate steward-ship of the trials while our field develops the infrastructure and expertise to conductsuch trials. In future years, we hope to expand this program to address such issuesas depression in young children, and mood disorders that co-occur with psychoticdisorders. We are also interested in cross-NIH collaborations to focus on co-occurringsubstance use problems with mental disorders. RESEARCH ON YOUTH VIOLENCE As recognition grows that violence by young people represents a public health problem, we are encouraging a new generation of studies that will attend, particu-larly, to the relationships between mental disorders and violence, including suicide.We know that anxiety disorders, depression, or suicidal ideation often co-occur withbehavior problems, and that the combination of depression with conduct problemsmay be a combustible mix. Also, youth with conduct problems often exhibit inatten-tion and impulsiveness, often coexisting with hyperactivity. We are coordinating ourresearch involving dissemination of prevention and early intervention strategieswith the Centers for Disease Control and other federal agencies, including the de-partments of Education and Justice. Finally, I am pleased to report that NIMH willassume a lead role in developing a Surgeon General 's report on the topic of youth183 violence. Dr. Satcher and, indeed, all of us have been gratified by the overwhelm- ingly positive response of the American public to the Surgeon General 's Report on Mental Health, and we believe this follow-up report will be an effective and highlycredible means of educating the public about the interaction of mental disorders andyouth violence. MULTI -MODAL TREATMENT ASSESSMENT OF ADHD In December, NIMH and collaborating investigators reported findings from the landmark Multi-Modal Treatment Assessment Study \u2014the MTA study \u2014of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, a major public health problem that affects 3 -5 percent of school children. The experiences of 600 children enrolled in the study revealedthat carefully monitored medication management, with monthly followup and inputfrom teachers, is more effective than intensive behavioral treatment. For measuressuch as improved academic performance and family relations, combining behavioraltherapy and medication proved effective and satisfying to parents and teachers andpermitted somewhat lower doses of medication. Among the important insights of theMTA study was documentation of the extent of undertreatment or inappropriatemedication treatment in normal, community-based care. RESEARCH ON HEALTH DISPARITIES A primary goal of NIMH and NIH research is to ensure that advances in treat- ment benefit all Americans, including racial and ethnic minorities who experiencesignificant disparities of outcomes with respect to many illnesses. Within the pastyear, NIMH conducted the first two of a projected series of State-wide conferenceson mental health needs and opportunities that permit us to hear, first-hand, citi-zens' perspectives on health disparities. We initiated a large-scale study of the epi- demiology of mental disorders among African Americans and plan on parallel stud-ies to understand the epidemiology of mental disorder in other minority groups.These studies will complement a new, state-of-the-science epidemiologic study ofmental disorders in the broader population that will be funded under a 5-year, $7.3million dollar grant to investigators at Harvard University who will survey a rep-resentative sample of 10,000 Americans ages 15 and over. For several decades,NIMH has set the standard for modern mental health epidemiologic research, andthis new study will ensure that we have data necessary to allocate resources anddesign policies in this era of massive change in the U.S. health care system. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will supportthe identification of strategies and objectives to improve programs across the NIHand the Department. NIMH is committed to a research portfolio that stretches from molecules and genes to brain and behavior to clinical investigation to health services research andeconomics. This research portfolio is thriving thanks to the development of new sci-entific approaches ranging from genomics to neuroimaging to new clinical trial de-signs. In parallel, we have been able to renew our Institute structure and also thevitality of our Intramural Research Program by a combination of rigorous reviewand recruitment of outstanding scientists. I look forward to this new millenniumwith humility about the scope of the problems that we must address but great opti-mism about the ability of our research community to meet the challenge. I will be pleased to answer any questions. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. ALAN I. L ESHNER , DIRECTOR , NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $496.3 million, which reflects an increase of $27.1 mil-lion over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated al-location for AIDS, total support requested for NIDA is $725.5, million an increaseof $38.1 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NIDA effortsin AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research budget request.184 BUILDING ON RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS Thanks to the commitment of both the Administration and the Congress, includ- ing particularly this Committee, NIDA has been able to launch some truly signifi-cant activities in the past year. Perhaps the most noteworthy undertaking has beenestablishing the foundation for a vehicle that will increase dramatically the qualityof drug addiction treatment throughout this country. Last year, we promised tobuild a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to test anddisseminate new science-based addiction treatments in real life settings. I ampleased to be able to tell you that we not only have established the first five nodesof this Network, but are about to begin implementing the first three protocols. More-over, adding five more nodes to this infrastructure this year will take the CTN one step closer to becoming the truly national research and research dissemination net-work that we know it can and should be. Under NIDA 's overall guidance, the CTN will foster partnerships between treatment researchers and community-based treat-ment providers to move well-tested science-based addiction treatments into use indiverse patient settings. We are also building other areas of our research portfolio to better inform how this country approaches drug addiction, including looking more closely at the rolegenetic factors may play in determining the likelihood someone will become addictedto drugs. In the same way we are making great progress in understanding how ge-netics can predispose one to cancer, heart disease, or diabetes, drug abuse research-ers are making similar advances in the addiction arena as well. By better under-standing the factors determining an individual 's vulnerability to addiction, our treatment and prevention success rates will dramatically improve. The research community is committed to this endeavor. The response to NIDA 's ''Genetics of Drug Addiction Vulnerability '' Initiative has been overwhelming. We were able to fund five new grants last year to examine the role of genetics in nico-tine, cocaine, and heroin addiction, and we hope to support in the coming yearssome of the other outstanding proposals we received in response to this initiative. LONG -TERM NEUROBEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF DRUGS OF ABUSE Advances within NIDA 's neuroscience research portfolio also continue coming at an accelerated pace. Let me give you one example of how far our science has comesince last year 's appropriations hearing. You may recall that I showed you images of how drugs, such as methamphetamine and MDMA (Ecstasy), produce long-lastingchanges in brain function, changes that persist even years after the individualsstopped using the drugs. Researchers have now taken those research findings onestep further and have begun to unravel exactly how these brain changes dramati-cally affect an individual 's behavior. For example, researchers studying the residual effects of methamphetamine in users who were drug free for ten months before this study began, found that theyhad significantly impaired motor and memory function. When they were asked tocomplete a battery of tests that examined working memory and reaction times, aswell as verbal memory skills, these former methamphetamine users did far worsethan non-drug-using individuals. Importantly, the researchers also found that theimpaired memory in the former users was clearly associated with significant reduc-tions in the functioning of the brain 's dopamine neurotransmitter systems, in this case the number of dopamine reuptake transporters. And the study showed that thegreater the degree of transporter loss, the greater the memory deficits. Researchers at NIDA 's intramural program have found similar cognitive deficits with chronic cocaine abusers. Thus, these studies are clarifying how it is that illicitdrugs compromise cognitive and behavioral abilities. NIDA-supported researchers are not just using new imaging and molecular ge- netic technologies, they are also making significant contributions to the field by ad-vancing the technology themselves. This is best exemplified by our efforts in the fastpaced world of nanotechnology. For example, NIDA-supported researchers recentlydeveloped a biosensor system to analyze what is happening inside a single cell.These techniques are allowing us to see how important neurotransmitters likedopamine are stored and can move in and out of cells. This opens up many newavenues of research; allowing us to see with much greater resolution the impactthat drugs of abuse have on the brain. DETERMINANTS OF DRUG USE PREFERENCES AND PATTERNS Understanding why some individuals abuse drugs while others do not and why some develop more problematic drug use than others are some of the most chal-lenging dilemmas being probed by researchers today. As we bring new and improved185 technologies and new groups of researchers into the search for answers to these questions, we are beginning to unveil some important and astonishing results. Forexample, using the advanced brain imaging technique of positron emission tomog-raphy (PET), researchers have found the first clues as to why some individuals areprone to use stimulant drugs and why some are not. As an example, as shown inPOSTER 1, these studies have shown a dramatic association between an individ-ual's pre-drug exposure brain dopamine receptor levels and how much the individual reports ''liking '' or ''disliking '' a psychostimulant. Here you see two individuals with different levels of dopamine D2 receptors shown before any drug exposure. (Brightercolors represent higher numbers of receptors). The individual whose brain is shownon top and who had high levels of D2 receptors reported an unpleasant responseto the mild stimulant methylphenidate. On the other hand, the individual on thebottom, with low D2 receptor levels, found the stimulant quite pleasant. This sug-gests that differences in brain chemistry predisposes people to respond in differentways to drugs of abuse. UNDERSTANDING THE TRANSITION FROM DRUG USER TO ADDICT In past years, we also have shown you data clearly indicating that we know quite a bit about both the behavioral and the biological differences between addicted andnon-addicted individuals. What we do not know much about, however, is the literaltransition that occurs between these states. What is actually happening both behav-iorally and biologically when one moves from being an occasional to a compulsive,addicted drug user? What changes an individual from a voluntary to a compulsivedrug user? Understanding this transition is central, of course, to developing moreeffective addiction prevention and treatment strategies, and its importance has ledNIDA to develop a focused ''Transition to Addiction '' initiative. NIDA-supported researchers will approach these issues from many disciplinary perspectives. As just one example, they will use new molecular biology techniques,such as microarrays, to build on recent discoveries from animal studies suggestingthat gradual increases in the levels of a specific brain protein, delta Fos B, are acritical part of this transition process. We know that this protein triggers the ex-pression of other genes and the use of this technology will help identify which genes are expressed, when, and where in the brain. RESEARCH BRINGING ABOUT SHIFTS IN NATIONAL STRATEGY Scientific advances have not only improved our fundamental understanding of ad- diction, but continue to reduce many of the public health and safety consequencesof this destructive disease as well. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in thephilosophical shift in strategic thinking about drug abuse and its consequences thatis occurring throughout many levels of society. A case in point is how advances inaddiction research are leading to a blending of criminal justice and health ap-proaches to dealing with drug abuse and criminality. NIDA-supported research hasdemonstrated that treating drug users while under criminal justice control dramati-cally reduces recidivism to both later drug use and later criminality by 50 to 70 per-cent. This finding is one of the reasons why NIDA and other facets of the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services have teamed with the Justice Department towork toward making drug abuse treatment more commonplace in the criminal jus-tice environment. ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES Members of minority populations are disproportionately affected by the con- sequences of drug abuse. Accordingly, NIDA is taking extra effort to understand thecauses of and contributing factors to these inequalities and working to ensure thatminority issues are addressed and minority populations are adequately representednot only in NIDA 's comprehensive research portfolio, but in our research commu- nities as well. NIDA supports a wide array of programs to recruit minority popu-lations into drug addiction research fields. In fact, NIDA has increased the numberof supported minority researchers by 97 percent in the past six years. In the lastfew years, NIDA has also put together three new working groups representing Afri-can-American, Asian-Pacific Islander, and Hispanic researchers and scholars to helprecruit and train new minority investigators and improve the quantity and qualityof minority-related research. These working groups are helping NIDA expand opportunities for working with scholars who are most knowledgeable about these populations. Minority researcherswill be particularly helpful as NIDA increases its efforts to study the impact andhealth consequences of drug abuse in minority populations. By simultaneously in-186 creasing research and research training efforts, NIDA expects to make significant improvements in racial and ethnic disparities. RAPID AND AUTHORITATIVE RESEARCH DISSEMINATION EFFORTS As the world 's ability to exchange information expands exponentially, NIDA con- tinues to take full advantage of these opportunities to disseminate science-based in-formation more effectively and rapidly to a wide variety of audiences. For example,when one of our early drug warning systems, NIDA 's Community Epidemiology Work Group, noted increases in the use of ''club drugs '' such as methamphetamine and ecstasy among adolescents and young adults, NIDA initiated a multi-elementresearch and education campaign to stave off further growth of this problem. NIDAwill increase funding for relevant research by 40 percent. In addition, the Institutehas joined with an array of partners in the drug abuse professional and constituencycommunities to launch a multi-media education campaign as well. We developedand disseminated a community drug alert bulletin that has been sent to over150,000 people, developed a new website (www.clubdrugs.org), and teamed with theAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Community Anti-DrugCoalitions of America, Join Together, and National Families in Action to hold a na- tional meeting to increase awareness and attention to this problem, share researchfindings, and identify research gaps. We also have taken an idea from what has become a NIDA bestseller, our Preven- tion booklet, ''Preventing Drug Use Among Children and Adolescents: A Research- Based Guide, '' and created a corresponding ''Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research-based Guide. '' Since the guide debuted in October, more than 100,000 copies have been disseminated. This lay language booklet provides health care pro-viders, patients, families, and policy makers with the latest science-based informa-tion on drug treatment. It describes the nature of addiction and the addiction treat-ment enterprise, and then outlines 13 overarching principles that characterize effec-tive drug addiction treatment. We are also taking full advantage of other dissemination opportunities. In fact, we are doing exactly what members of this Committee encouraged us to do lastyear. We are taking state-of-the-art brain scans showing the effects of drug abuseand addiction and using them as the core of a multi-media public education cam-paign. What you see here is a portion of a story board (POSTER 2) for one of ourpublic service announcements emphasizing how drug use can damage your brain inimportant ways. In addition to using powerful images, we are using findings fromthe prevention research arena on what works and what does not work to developpersuasive, and scientifically accurate messages. We plan to send these messagesto television outlets nationwide this spring. GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. CONCLUSION In conclusion, NIDA is taking advantage of emerging technologies to confront the disease of addiction head on. Our comprehensive research portfolio, our track recordin sharing our research findings, and a continued commitment from the Administra-tion and the Congress to furthering the science will serve as this Nation ' s best de- fense against this devastating public health and safety plague. I will be pleased toanswer any questions you might have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. ENOCH GORDIS Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the NIAAA for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $288,578,000, which reflects an increase of $14,587,000 over the comparable fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS, total supportrequested for the NIAAA is $308,661,000, an increase of $15,427,000 over the fiscalyear 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NIAAA 's efforts in AIDS research are in- cluded within the Office of AIDS Research budget request.187 Nearly 14 million American adults meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol addiction or abuse, and 100,000 Americans die of alcohol-related causes each year, accordingto NIAAA epidemiology data. While death is the ultimate consequence of alcohol-use disorders, their impact on the living, in sheer numbers, is even greater. TheNIAAA 's epidemiology research reveals that 442,000 people occupy hospital beds each year as a result of these disorders. The financial burden that alcohol misuseimposed on the Nation in 1998 was approximately $185 billion, in direct and indi-rect costs, according to the Lewin Group. The sequelae of alcohol-use disorders in-clude damage to the liver, brain, and other organs; cancer; fetal alcohol syndromeand the lifetime disabilities it produces; accidental injury to self and others; prop-erty damage; crime; broken families; and loss of productivity that deprives the Na-tion of valuable resources. Biological, behavioral, and social factors converge to produce alcohol-use disorders, making them particularly complex diseases. In terms of biology, alcohol is uniqueamong addictive substances, in that it targets not just one but manyneurotransmitter systems \u2014chemical messengers between nerve cells \u2014resulting in unusually pervasive effects on the entire nervous system and in unique challengesfor scientists. Researchers have made striking advances in identifying the molecularstructures where alcohol binds to these neurotransmitter systems and in learninghow variations in genes determine alcohol 's actions on them. NEUROSCIENCE Because alcohol 's effects on the nervous system are so pervasive, neuroscience is a particularly active field of research at the NIAAA. One promising area involvesneuropeptide Y (NPY), a substance in the brain that increases food consumption andrelieves anxiety. Studies are underway to determine the role of NPY in controllingalcohol consumption. Preliminary studies suggest that NPY may, indeed, play a rolein propensity for alcohol. Surprisingly, these studies revealed that mice in which theNPY gene was inactivated (knocked out) drank more alcohol than did their normalsiblings and were less sedated by alcohol. If NPY is found to play a key role inhuman alcohol-use disorders, NPY and its receptors \u2014its ''docking sites '' on cells \u2014 become potential targets for medications to control alcohol intake. Physical problems from long-term alcohol use do not necessarily resolve once peo- ple stop drinking. Using new MRI techniques, researchers have found persistentdamage in the cerebellum, the locus of gait and balance in the brain, even in long-abstinent alcoholics. Previous anatomic measurements of cerebellar damage weredifficult, because of the cerebellum 's convoluted structure, resulting in less accurate data. Scientists can use these new imaging techniques to clarify the potential forreversing cerebellar damage in recovered alcoholics and to explore a new topic: therole of cerebellar damage in cognitive impairment. These and other findings from the NIAAA 's comprehensive neuroscience portfolio reflect the ubiquitous nature of alcohol 's effects on the nervous system. For example, research designed to identify the protein structures where alcohol binds to nervecells may, one day, provide groundwork for development of better medications totreat alcoholism. In another protein-related finding, NIAAA-supported scientistshave found that genes in the brains of deceased human alcoholics produced less ofa crucial nervous-system protein, myelin, than did those in nonalcoholics. With thisinformation, scientists can better define changes in gene activity that result in dam-age to specific areas of alcoholics ' brains. Other investigators are identifying alcohol- related neurobiological risks that fluctuate during adolescence and that might be re-lated to the higher risk of adult alcoholism predicted by earlier onset of drinkingin the young. GENETICS That genetics underlies much of the biology of alcohol-use disorders is unquestion- able. Variations in genes result in variations in many components of the nervoussystem, and, thus, in how people 's bodies handle alcohol. The way in which people 's bodies ' handle alcohol affects, in turn, their behaviors toward alcohol and risk for alcoholism. Evidence suggesting that alcoholism is a polygenetic disease \u2014that many genes contribute to it \u2014greatly complicates the search for the genes involved. The Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), a major project supported by the NIAAA, has identified several chromosomal regions likely to con-tain genes that influence the risk for alcoholism. The NIAAA is pleased to announcethat it is making available to the general scientific community the substantial dataand DNA samples generated by COGA. Scientists who take advantage of these re-sources can analyze them further in their own research projects, expediting thesearch for genes that contribute to alcoholism. The data also can be used to evaluate188 new methods of statistically analyzing genetic data, not only for alcoholism, but also for other diseases. Among the goals of the COGA project is to elucidate the genetics of alcoholism in African Americans. While COGA recruits both Caucasian and African-Americansubjects, the latter have not been present in numbers large enough to permit a reli-able examination of whether the genetic basis of alcoholism is different in BlackAmericans than in White Americans. Through a NIAAA grant, Howard UniversityMedical School will study this question and contribute its findings to the growingCOGA database. Neuropeptide Y, discussed earlier, is one of more than 20 substances that NIAAA scientists study as gene knockouts, to determine their influence on alcoholism. Someof these substances are found to increase alcohol consumption; others are found toreduce it. A recent study examined the effects of knocking out, in mice, the genethat produces protein kinase C epsilon (PKC ), an enzyme involved in intracellularsignaling. Absence of PKC resulted in significantly less alcohol consumption and ab-normally high sensitivity to alcohol 's sedating properties. Insensitivity to alcohol 's sedating effects is among the factors that portend alcoholism at some point in life.Since much of the mouse genome resembles the human genome, these types of find-ings may lead to clues about human genetic defects related to alcoholism. TOXICOLOGY Alcohol is unique among abused drugs in the extent of the organ damage it causes. Animal studies by NIAAA intramural researchers have demonstrated thatchronic alcohol use leads to a decrease in essential fatty acids (EFAs), nutrients thatplay a crucial role in brain health. The same investigators recently demonstratedthat EFA-deficient rats lose nerve cells in an area of the brain involved in memoryand learning, another common result of chronic alcohol use. The NIAAA continuesto perform research to evaluate the potential of EFA supplementation to reduceorgan damage among alcoholics. Between 40 percent and 90 percent of U.S. deaths from cirrhosis are due to alco- hol, according to NIAAA epidemiology data. These statistics underscore the impor-tance of understanding the potential for reversing this currently irreversible dis-ease. Scientists suspect that an immune-system protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), plays a role in alcohol-induced liver damage. NIAAA-funded researchers re- cently found that alcohol-fed mice in which TNF 's molecular receptor had been ge- netically knocked out, eliminating TNF 's actions, suffered liver pathology seven times less severe than that of alcohol-fed mice with normal TNF levels. This find- ing strongly supports the assertion that TNF is involved in alcohol-induced liver damage and is lent even more significance by the recent development of pharma-ceuticals that inhibit TNF in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as ar- thritis. ADVANCES IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Recent studies illustrate what the NIAAA 's prevention research can contribute to decisions about alcohol legislation. Many states have taken the important step oflowering their legal definition of drunkenness from a blood-alcohol concentration(BAC) of 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent. However, studies of simulated merchant-shippiloting by maritime cadets revealed that even half of that concentration, a BAC of0.04, resulted in significantly impaired performance. The cadets failed to sense theirdecreased judgment, underscoring the hazards of alcohol use in the context ofheavy-machinery operation and the workplace. Many states still allow people todrive cars with a BAC more than twice that of the alcohol-impaired cadets. The public also benefits from prevention findings that the NIAAA provides to alco- hol-treatment practitioners. Thirty percent of Americans are subjected to domesticviolence at some point in their lives, according to studies published in the New Eng- land Journal of Medicine and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Emergency Medical Foundation, and the UCLA Southern California Injury Pre-vention Research Center. NIAAA-funded investigators recently concluded, in theJournal of Studies on Alcohol , that a combination of behavioral marital therapy and standard treatment for alcoholism resulted in a six-fold reduction in domestic vio-lence. Of significance here is not only the magnitude of reduction in violence, butalso that the reduction is sustained, as investigators determined in a 2-year follow-up study. In the treatment arena, NIAAA-supported studies reveal that the new medication nalmefene is at least as successful in preventing relapse among recovering alcoholicsas is naltrexone, the recently FDA-approved drug of choice. Nalmefene may haveadvantages over naltrexone, including less risk of liver toxicity, providing another189 option for recovering alcoholics whose livers have been damaged by alcohol. A Finn- ish company plans to seek FDA approval for this new medication. ADOLESCENT ALCOHOL USE During last year 's hearings, the NIAAA reported that initiation of drinking earlier rather than later in youth is associated with a dramatically higher risk of alco-holism at some point in life. For this and many other reasons, the NIAAA continuesto make drinking among adolescents a research priority. The ''hard-wiring '' of the brain is vulnerable to change during adolescence, including change caused by toxicsubstances. Investigators supported by the NIAAA have found that adolescent ani-mals are less sensitive than adult animals to the motor-incapacitating and sedatingeffects of alcohol. This suggests that adolescents have higher drinking capacities,perhaps putting them at higher risk for alcohol-related problems. Other researchershave found that human youths who engaged in heavy, protracted drinking duringearly and middle adolescence, when compared with nonabusing adolescents of simi-lar demographics, score significantly more poorly on neuropsychological tests, andthat these deficient scores may persist. For example, young people who have with-drawn from alcohol recently have poor visuospatial functioning, and those who havewithdrawn in the past show poor retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information. The Washington Post and CNN recently reported another NIAAA finding: An esti- mated one in four U.S. children is exposed to alcoholism in the family. The stressfuland unpredictable environment in such families can lead to a variety of problemsin these children. OUTREACH In addition to conducting research on adolescent alcohol abuse, the NIAAA has taken a leadership role in the Surgeon General 's campaign to prevent alcohol use among youth and engages in numerous outreach activities. Recently, the NIAAAissued a pamphlet that educates parents about alcohol use among youth, and thispamphlet now is being written in Spanish. The NIAAA also is collaborating withthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to recruit governors ' spouses in a National Leadership Initiative to Keep Children Alcohol-Free . In January, the NIAAA and Mothers Against Drunk Driving held two press briefings, one for editors of teenmagazines and the other for editors of women 's magazines. The NIAAA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) are pre-paring to award a grant for public-service announcements aimed at preventing un-derage drinking. In addition, prominent scientists and 10 college presidents haveformed a subcommittee of the NIAAA Advisory Council, to identify ways of reducingbinge-drinking among college students. Other NIAAA outreach activities include Alcohol Screening Day, the first of which was held last year. Almost 500 college campuses were among the 1,700 sites thatparticipated. Approximately 52,000 people attended, and 29,000 of them asked to bescreened. This successful event will be held again on April 6, 2000. To ensure that its research findings reach the people to whom they matter most \u2014 people who suffer from alcohol disorders \u2014the NIAAA, in collaboration with State agencies and SAMHSA, cosponsors a Research-to-Practice initiative. Senior clinicalinvestigators spend several days at alcohol-treatment facilities, giving staff hands-on help in incorporating innovations from basic and clinical research into theirtreatment regimens. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. PATRICIA A. G RADY Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $84,714,000, which reflects an increase of$2,672,000 over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the esti-mated allocation for AIDS, total support requested for NINR is $92,524,000, an in-crease of $2,985,000 over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NINR190 efforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research budget request. I would like to thank the Committee for your interest and support for NINR and for nursing research. In this period of rapid technological and demographic change,it is imperative that nursing research grow to help meet present and future needsand expectations of our nation 's people for improved health care. More people will live longer and face chronic illness and disabilities in older age. More will be care-givers who will need to know how to live their own lives while caring for ill relativesand friends. Many will be minorities at risk for experiencing disparities in the inci-dence, prevalence and seriousness of disease and access to care. How people live andhow they experience illness will be influenced by new technologies in the healthcare system. Increasingly, they will demand a role in managing their own health. Indi-viduals will appreciate the value of prevention, but will still need help in achievinghealthier lifestyles. And virtually everyone wants to die with dignity and a senseof control. Today I will discuss our targets for fiscal year 2001 that relate to theseconcerns. CHRONIC DISEASE \u2014A LONG -RANGE VIEW ABOUT LONG -TERM ILLNESS Chronic illness continues to be an important NINR research emphasis. We are in- vestigating how to both avoid complications of disease and disability and controlsymptoms such as pain, nausea and poor sleep. Other studies will be directed atpatients who are discharged early from the hospital and still need substantial careat home. A special focus will be on family caregivers, who have varying expertiseand financial and complex care demands for multiple lengthy illnesses. In addressing early hospital discharge, recent nursing research has verified the value of a transitional care model that has been tested in several patient popu-lations. The model uses a multidisciplinary team and involves comprehensive dis-charge planning, including determination of patient care needs outside the hospital,and follow-up in the home by advanced practice nurses specializing in geriatrics. Asthe chart shows, six months following discharge, the intervention group of olderadults with common medical and surgical problems had 48 percent fewer rehos-pitalizations, 54 percent fewer multiple hospital readmissions, and 65 percent fewerdays in the hospital at a 48 percent savings to the healthcare system when com-pared to controls. Widespread use of this model could save significant healthcaredollars and improve quality of care. Early hospital discharge has placed a research spotlight on family caregivers, who often undertake the responsibility for care of their ill relatives. Caregivers of Alz-heimer 's patients bear special burdens. They must cope with the physical downward spiral of illness, and they also must deal with the stress of patients ' behavioral prob- lems that include agitation, depression, and wandering. Nurse researchers have de-veloped a successful intervention that offers behavioral management skill trainingto caregivers. Five months after the intervention, researchers found that caregiverstress continued to be reduced when coping with disruptive behaviors of older adultsin their care. The study also showed a moderate decrease in caregivers ' perceptions of their burdens in providing care. Furthermore, those who were initially depressedwere less depressed. These positive results may be applicable to caregivers of pa-tients with other chronic illnesses, such as stroke or congestive heart failure. A life-long chronic illness that often starts in childhood, Type I diabetes, rep- resents 5 to 10 percent of the total number of people with diabetes, and can seri-ously impact physical health and quality of life. Our research on adolescents withthis condition compared two types of recommended intensive therapies \u2014either mul- tiple daily injections of insulin \u2014three or more a day \u2014or subcutaneous infusion of insulin delivered by insulin pump \u2014a therapy which is currently used by fewer than 5 percent of young people. Adjusting to the insulin pump has been difficult foryoung adults, but when they are provided with an intervention consisting of instruc-tion and support, the outcomes have been positive. Advanced practice nurses visitedthe adolescents every four to six weeks and provided them with diabetes education,adjustments in managing their diabetes and clinical assessments, including meas-urements of hypoglycemia and adherence to dietary restrictions. Investigators foundthat compared to teens on multiple daily injections of insulin, those who used theinsulin pump had fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes and were able to maintaintheir blood glucose levels within the proper range. The ''pump '' group scores also showed better self esteem, coping skills, and quality of life. This finding identifiesthe education and support that enables adolescents to use the newer pump tech-nology effectively. NINR is committed to expand chronic illness research in fiscal year 200l to help patients manage their conditions over time. This involves a major investment of re-191 sources. We will focus on strategies to be applied broadly across chronic illnesses, including prevention of disease and its complications, self-monitoring by patients ofthe course of their disease, and promotion of patient success in problem solving andin maintaining a healthy lifestyle. THE END OF LIFE \u2014AN EMERGING RESEARCH FOCUS Just as biomedical advances are changing the way we live with illness, they are also changing the way we eventually die. The duration of both chronic illness andthe dying process has been prolonged. In fiscal year 2001, we will expand our focuson end of life to better understand at what point palliative care becomes the pri-mary goal. We also need to know how best to facilitate communication and decisionmaking among all involved in the end-of-life period \u2014the patient, nurse, physician, family, and friends. NINR is pleased that the response to last year 's Request for Applications for re- search on end-of-life care resulted in more than 100 applications \u2014an impressive re- sult for a relatively new area of research. Those that were funded will form a basisupon which to build an important, growing effort. HEALTH DISPARITIES \u2014CLOSING THE GAP Another area of importance to nursing research and to the nation is reduction of persistent health disparities among certain populations in our country. We mustprovide interventions that are more responsive to the needs of our multiethnic andmulticultural society. Nursing research has long incorporated ethnic and culturalfactors in designing projects and testing interventions \u2014with the goal of tailoring care to the individual patient 's needs. Yet more research is needed to identify why disparities exist and what to do about them. Let me provide an example of nursing research that addresses an area of dis- parity in a growing population. For many years, there were few resources availablefor Hispanics with arthritis to help them manage their condition. Limited fluencyin English had the effect of excluding them from most health research projects. Inresponse to this need, nurse researchers developed and tested a successful Spanishlanguage arthritis education program. This endeavor was not limited to translationfrom English to Spanish. Cultural differences within Latino communities and accu- rate Spanish language measurement tools were also addressed. During the program,patients learned how to exercise, communicate with health care professionals, andmanage pain, fatigue and depression. Throughout a one-year period, patients experi-enced significant improvements in all areas. The components of this course haveprovided a useful model that is being tested for Hispanic populations with coronaryartery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Type II diabetes. NINR plans to continue its ongoing programs next year to help eradicate healthcare disparities. We will focus specifically on diabetes and its gaps in mor-bidity across ethnic groups. We will emphasize strategies for effective self-manage-ment of illness, and investigate the influence on health of genetics, education, pov-erty, diet, behavior and social support. Another goal is to increase the number ofwell-trained investigators to conduct minority health research. To do this, we planto expand core research centers and career development opportunities. CLINICAL RESEARCH Most nursing research studies are clinical in nature, although they can also in- volve basic research. An example of a recent finding concerns the use of feedingtubes to provide required nutrition. Every year an estimated one million hospitalpatients or residents of nursing homes are fed through use of feeding tubes. Incor-rect insertion or dislocation of the tube may deliver food to the respiratory system,which can be fatal to the patient. Studies have shown that current clinical methodsthat rely on a stethoscope rather than X-rays for tube placement are correct only6 to 34 percent of the time. Nurse investigators have discovered that an accurate,less costly alternative to both techniques is measuring pH and bilirubin levels inaspirated contents from the feeding tube. This method has identified themisplacement of tubes in lungs with 100 percent accuracy and is less expensive andsafer than repeated X-rays. Another important innovation for clinical research and practice is telehealth \u2014a long distance technology to reach underserved areas, such as rural communities.NINR has been active in supporting telehealth studies for treatment and monitoringof patients and for providing health information. In the next fiscal year, NINR plansto expand research to determine the effects of telehealth on various patient popu-lations and cost savings associated with telehealth strategies. We also plan to target192 patients most likely to benefit from telehealth interventions, identify barriers, and find ways to integrate telehealth into other treatment and care regimens. BUILDING NURSING RESEARCH CAPACITY Next year provides an opportunity to initiate new programs to increase the nurs- ing research capacity. In the current fiscal year, we are launching the Summer Ge-netics Institute for extramural researchers. This new eight-week training course em-phasizes genetics in clinical practice, in the research laboratory, and in nursing cur-ricula. Other training initiatives include an intramural career transition award thatcombines postdoctoral training with subsequent support for beginning research atan extramural institution. NINR continues its collaboration with the Office of Research on Minority Health in a career development program for minority nurse researchers. Studies being car-ried out by these minority investigators include reduction of serious developmentalproblems of migrant infants, suicide prevention in a population of rural Indian youth, and improving screening for prostate cancer in African-American men. NINRis also collaborating with the National Coalition of Ethnic Nursing Associations ona workshop to identify important research questions and training needs for minoritynurse scientists. GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS ACT (GPRA) Prominent in the GPRA performance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 perform-ance plan. As our performance measures mature and performance trends emerge,the GPRA data will serve as indicators to support the identification of strategiesand objectives to continuously improve programs across the NIH and the Depart-ment. CONCLUSION In conclusion, health research, health care, and health choices are increasingly interdependent, and nurses and nurse researchers play a vital role in all threeareas. Continued growth of nursing research is critical to meet public demands andurgent national health needs. Our contributions to the scientific foundation thatnourishes the work of healthcare practitioners are already making a difference inhealth care or have significant potential to do so. This base of knowledge merits ex-pansion in creative new directions. NINR looks forward to the challenge. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to answer any questions the Committee may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. FRANCIS S. C OLLINS Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $353.4 million, which reflects an increaseof $21.8 million over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including theestimated allocation for AIDS, total support requested for the NHGRI is $357.7 mil-lion, an increase of $21.9 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds forthe NHGRI efforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Re-search budget request. The NIH budget request includes the performance informa-tion required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993.Prominent in the performance data is NIH 's first performance report that compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan.As our performance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRAdata will serve as indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectivesto continuously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. This is my seventh appearance before this Subcommittee. I am again pleased to report that the Human Genome Project continues to be ahead of schedule and underbudget. When I appeared before you last February, Human Genome Project sci-entists had just completed sequencing the DNA of the worm known as C. elegans ; laying out the entire genetic code of an animal for the first time. At that time, 405million base pairs of human DNA sequence had been deposited in GenBank by thelarge scale human DNA sequencing pilot projects that were initiated in 1996. Theseprojects tested new ways to apply sequencing strategies to the large and complexhuman genome.193 HUMAN DNA SEQUENCING A lot has happened in a year. Following the success of the pilot projects, the NHGRI, the Department of Energy, and our international partners (the U.K.,France, Germany, Japan, and China) initiated last March full-scale production se-quencing of the 3 billion bases that comprise the human genetic instruction book.The newly tested sequencing strategies, coupled with advances in sequencing tech-nology, provided the necessary foundation to begin full-scale production. Later this year, this international consortium will produce a ''working draft '' of the human genome sequence, an essential resource for the whole research commu-nity. The working draft will provide 90 percent coverage of the human genome withan accuracy of 99.9 percent. Then we will move on to complete the final, highly ac-curate, finished human genome sequence in 2003 or sooner, two years ahead of theoriginal schedule All sequence data produced by the international consortium is deposited every 24 hours in GenBank, where it is freely available to any researcher with an internetconnection, without restrictions on use. The rapid public availability of the sequenceis invaluable to academic scientists studying the molecular basis of human healthand disease, as well as corporate researchers engaged in drug development. By No-vember 17, 1999, the consortium had deposited the sequence of one billion bases inthe human genome. Today, over half of the sequence, approximately 1.7 billion basepairs of non-redundant sequence, resides in GenBank. This marks the production of over a billion base pairs of human DNA since last year 's hearing. To reach this milestone, Human Genome Project participants actually had to se- quence over 12 billion base pairs of human DNA in overlapping pieces. As projectmanager, I know this could not have been done without the tireless work of thehundreds of dedicated scientists and technicians at the major sequencing centers.The largest five of these are referred to as the G -5 (the Whitehead Institute at MIT, the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, the Baylor College ofMedicine in Houston, the DOE 's Joint Genome Institute in California, and the San- ger Centre in the U.K.) and will do about 85 percent of the work. CHROMOSOME 22 The Human Genome Project achieved another historic milestone this year when an international scientific team announced the unraveling of the genetic code of anentire human chromosome for the first time. The 33.5 million base pairs of Chro-mosome 22 were published in the December 2, 1999 issue of the journal Nature. Re-search now will focus on determining what it all means. Sequencing and mappingefforts have already revealed that genes on chromosome 22 are implicated in theworkings of the immune system, congenital heart disease, schizophrenia, mental re-tardation, birth defects, and several cancers including leukemia, but many more se-crets will be discovered in this decoded text. The results of this work give scientistsinsights into the way genes are arranged along the DNA molecule and pave the wayfor major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Until last year, scientists were uncertain about whether an entire human chro- mosome could be sequenced in this manner. For example, they did not know wheth-er insurmountable problems would prevent completing the assembly of largestretches of contiguous sequence. The work done on chromosome 22 not only an-swered any doubts about the ability to sequence a chromosome, it validated thestrategy being pursued by the publicly supported Human Genome Project in se-quencing the entire human genome. BEYOND THE HUMAN SEQUENCE While laying out the precise sequence of the 3 billion letters of the human genome is an awesome and audacious undertaking, it is but one of the many important ob-jectives of the Human Genome Project. The 5-year research plan published in theOctober 23, 1998 issue of Science outlines seven other ambitious goals critical to thesuccess of the Project. One such tool is a catalog of common genetic variants. HUMAN GENETIC VARIATION Any two human beings, regardless of ethnic or racial self-identity, are 99.9 per- cent the same at the genetic level. But certain changes in the sequence, some assubtle as a single letter change, contribute to disease or disease risk. Today, to findthe misspelling, or misspellings, that contribute to common diseases, such as cancer,Parkinson 's disease, asthma, depression, or heart disease, researchers must study pedigrees and search through large chromosome ''neighborhoods '' using the genetic map. But having the reference sequence, and new technologies for finding those194 places in the genome that vary among us, means that assembling a catalog of com- mon genetic variants is now possible, and will greatly speed the process of diseasegene discovery. Most variants will be single letter differences, known as SNPs or single nucleotide polymorphisms. Any SNPs found to be associated with a disease will provide targetsfor further study to understand the biological processes underlying health and dis-ease and facilitate development of diagnostic tests. This understanding will in turnfuel development of improved prevention and treatment strategies. Because geneticvariants can also contribute to individual differences in response to drugs, the iden-tification and understanding of these variants will allow doctors to choose the mosteffective drug based on a patient 's particular genetic makeup. In fiscal year 1999, with contributions from 16 NIH institutes, the NHGRI began an initiative to discover and catalog common variants in human DNA. In the nexttwo years, NIH-supported researchers expect to find about 100,000 SNPs. Over thepast year, this initiative has been complemented by an innovative collaboration inthe private sector. Last April 15, a collaborative effort of 10 large pharmaceuticalcompanies IBM Motorola and the Wellcome Trust, announced the formation of TheSNPs Consortium (TSC). The Consortium 's goal is to identify an additional 310,000 SNPs. All SNPs identified by either the NIH or TSC are regularly deposited intothe publicly available SNP database. This collaboration between the public and pri-vate sectors has already produced and deposited 25,000 SNP 's into the public data- base. SEQUENCING THE LABORATORY MOUSE Last fall, NHGRI began sequencing of the genome of the laboratory mouse, one of The most frequently used mammals in biomedical research. Ten laboratories, nowreferred to as the Mouse Genome Sequencing Network (MGSN), collectively receivedfunding. All mouse sequence produced will fall under the same data release prin-ciples adhered to for the sequencing of the human genome, i.e., assemblies greaterthan 2,000 base pairs will be released to public databases within 24 hours. Mouse and humans are approximately 70 percent identical at the genetic level. Both genomes contain approximately 3 billion base pairs and encode an estimated100,000 genes. The invaluable contribution of mouse models toward a better under-standing of human disease has long been recognized in biomedical research. For ex-ample, mouse models provide scientists with unprecedented insights into the molec-ular basis of disease and the response to potential therapeutic agents. Intramuralscientists at NHGRI are developing and utilizing mouse models to study a diversearray of human diseases. These include brain disorders such as Huntington 's dis- ease, Parkinson 's disease, neural crest disorders, and blood disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia. Sequencing the mouse is a priority for a wide spectrum of biomedical scientists. Every institute at NIH, with support of the NIH Office of the Director, made a con-tribution to the first year of funding. NHGRI has assumed responsibility for fundingthe mouse sequencing network in the second year and beyond. A significant fractionof NHGRI 's fiscal year 2000 increase is dedicated to support of mouse sequencing. FINISHING THE FLY GENOME Looking ahead, achievement of another significant milestone is just around the comer. Publication of the complete sequence of the fruit fly, Drosophilamelanogaster, is expected within a matter of weeks. The fruit fly is another usefulmodel organism for studying genetics, with a genome of 160 million base pairs ofDNA. Providing this research tool is important because understanding the role ofa gene in the human body is often clarified by comparing its DNA code to that ofother organisms. NHGRI supported scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the Baylor College of Medicine carried out the initial scaffold sequencing of the fruit flygenome. In 1998, encouraged by NHGRI, Celera Genomics began a collaborationwith these groups. In order to facilitate the work in both sectors, a Memorandumof Understanding (MOU) was prepared between the publicly funded scientists andCelera Genomics to outline the respective roles of each of the partners. The MOUmaintained the public sequencing effort 's commitment to seeing that complete, accu- rate sequence for this important model organism is made freely accessible to all sci-entists by requiring that the annotated sequence be released to GenBank upon pub-lication.195 TOOLS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN GENOME Once we have the sequence of the human and key model organisms in hand, we will need the tools to allow us to explore and understand its significance in healthand disease. While this exploration will take many years, it will be aided by toolsnow in development by the Human Genome Project; tools that enable researchersto study the entire genome and all its genes in a single experiment. NHGRI has launched a number of initiatives to develop tools to understand gene function that will grow in coming years. One such initiative is the Mammalian GeneCollection, led jointly by NHGRI and NCL This initiative will create a complete col-lection of cloned and sequenced genes for humans and other mammals. In the fu-ture, scientists will be able to go to the freezer to pull out any gene they want to study. In parallel, new technologies such as microarrays are being developed, thatcan measure and compare the extent to which a gene is active under various condi-tions and in various tissues. The NHGRI intramural program is one of the worldleaders in this technology. Many other clever approaches to studying gene functionare being explored and the field is expanding rapidly. Both genomic sequencing and these new functional studies generate vast amounts of data that must be organized, stored and analyzed in order to allow scientists topursue new leads in medical research. One significant outcome of the Human Ge-nome Project has been the transformation of biology into a field that is rich in data,which has spawned a new discipline, called computational biology. New tools forhandling data to make it readily accessible to scientists, as well as new approachesfor understanding the significance of the data, are urgently needed. In view of thisneed, NHGRI plans to place a major emphasis on funding computational genomicsstudies in the future. In fiscal year 2001, NHGRI will launch a new Genome Cen-ters of Excellence program to support the development of novel technology and com-putational approaches for studying the function of genomes. in addition to fundinginnovative science, these Centers will also provide an environment in which a newgeneration of genomic scientists can be trained. The concept for the centers is simi-lar to that recommended by an Advisory Committee to the NIH Director for ''Pro- grams of Excellence in Biomedical Computing. '' The NHGRI anticipates that these Genome Centers of Excellence will meet many of the objectives outlined in the Com-mittee 's report, known as the ''BISTI '' (Biomedical Information Science and Tech- nology Initiative) report. SAFEGUARDING THE FAIR USE OF GENETIC INFORMATION From the outset of the Human Genome Project, the NHGRI has supported re- search into the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genomic research andfostered the development of relevant policy recommendations. We have a funda-mental obligation to assess and deal with concerns such as protecting the privacyand fair use of genetic information, and the integration of new genetic technologiesinto health care. If we do not and the public is fearful of obtaining or disclosing ge-netic information, or has limited access to genetic technologies, the promise of ge-netic medicine will not be realized and we will have achieved little. Progress on safeguarding the fair use of genetic information was made just in the last few weeks. On February 8, 2000, President Clinton signed an Executive Orderto protect federal workers from discrimination based upon their genetic information.This is built on the bedrock principle that an individual 's predictive genetic informa- tion should be used for their benefit and not for harm. A variety of important orga-nizations, such as the American Medical Association, Hadassah, the Genetic Alli-ance, the American College of Medical Genetics, the Biotechnology Industry Organi-zation (BIO) and the National Society of Genetic Counselors, immediately expressedtheir support for the President 's action. The Executive Order, which built upon the recommendations published by the NIH-DOE ELSI Working Group and the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, isan important step toward assuring federal workers that their genetic informationwill be kept private and be used against them by their employer. It also providesfederal and state legislators with a useful template for extending protections to allworkers. We hope to see this step built upon in 2000 by the passage of effective fed-eral legislation barring the discriminatory use of predictive genetic information inhealth insurance and employment. CONCLUSION The dramatic progress of the Human Genome Project has exceeded the expecta- tions of even the most optimistic just a few years ago. In a matter of months, themajority of the fundamental ''Book of Life '', the human sequence, will be in hand.196 Having this virtual guidebook to the human genome will permit many exciting op- portunities. Combining this with the catalog of human variation, and with new toolsand technologies developed by the Human Genome Project, will lead to unlockingthe mysteries of diseases, such as diabetes, Parkinson 's, schizophrenia, and common forms of cancer. That in turn will allow new approaches to prevention based on eachindividual 's disease risk factors. And we can, a few years hence, predict a host of new gene-based therapies specifically designed to fit an individual 's genetic makeup. Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, it has truly been a privilege to be a part of this historic effort, known as the Human Genome Project. At the begin-ning of the new millennium, genetics has come to encompass nearly every aspectof health research and will surely transform how we diagnose and treat disease inthe future. It will enhance our concepts of shared humanity, regardless of racial orethnic identity. My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JUDITH L. V AITUKAITIS Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $602.7 million which reflects an increase of$33.6 million over the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allo-cation for AIDS, total support requested for NCRR is $714.2 million, an increase of$39.1 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the NCRR effortsin AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research. It is a pleasure once again to have the opportunity to present the accomplish- ments of NCRR-supported investigators and future directions for NCRR programs.Before the recent turn of the millennium, doomsayers predicted the end of the worldas we know it, and in some respects they were right. Advances in computer tech-nology, bioengineering, imaging technologies, neuroscience and genomics will revolu-tionize biomedical research in the 21st century. The NCRR mission is unique amongthe NIH institutes and centers. While the other NIH components focus on particulardiseases, organ systems, or categories of research, NCRR alone has a trans-NIHmandate \u2014to develop and maintain the research infrastructure that enables all lines of biomedical inquiry. This effort transcends both clinical and basic research.NCRR 's nationwide networks for basic and clinical research discern the molecular causes of disease, develop new preventive strategies, and assess novel therapies fordiseases that affect majority as well as minority populations across this Nation. By providing scientists access to advanced technologies and sophisticated research fa-cilities for collaborative clinical and basic research, NCRR serves as a facilitator \u2014 or catalyst \u2014for biomedical discovery. One of NCRR 's main objectives is to utilize scarce or expensive resources to the fullest by sharing them among many investigators. This strategy is efficient andcost effective. Each year more than 20,000 investigators, supported by more than$2.5 billion in competitive grant support from the other NIH components, useNCRR-supported research resources. To meet the needs of biomedical investigatorsfor access to costly technologies, NCRR collaborates with the Department of Energyand the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide access for biomedical inves-tigators to high-energy x-rays at the synchrotron facilities operated by those twoagencies. In addition, NCRR provides access to advanced computing for health-re-lated research by partnering with the NSF-supported San Diego SupercomputerCenter, one of the two National Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infra-structure currently supported by the NSF. NCRR-funded resources have been critical to numerous projects that advance bio- medical science. Many NCRR-supported discoveries have immediate benefits for pa-tients; others help basic research move forward toward this ultimate goal. For exam-ple, separate groups of scientists, using NCRR-supported beamlines for x-ray crys-tallography, have determined the three-dimensional structure of ribosomes \u2014our cells' protein factories \u2014in unprecedented detail. These studies may expedite dis- covery of newer, more effective antibiotics. Animal studies conducted at an NCRR-supported primate center have shown that it is possible, by gene therapy, to reversethe brain cell destruction that is characteristic of Alzheimer 's disease; and NCRR- supported clinical investigators have developed methods to assess changes in par-ticular areas of the brain of depressed patients. The identification of these specificbrain areas is fundamental to designing improved treatments for depression. Ac-cording to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression affects more than 19million American adults and costs society more than $30 billion in 1990.197 BIOENGINEERING , COMPUTERS , AND ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION The ongoing technological revolution has made it abundantly clear that bio- medical science is no longer the sole province of physicians, biochemists, and biolo-gists. Engineers, physicists, and computer scientists are essential partners for devel-oping and adapting new instruments and technologies for health-related research.For example, improved imaging systems are needed to investigate thepathophysiology of human disease by studying patients as well as small animalsand nonhuman primates as disease models. To obtain the same resolution as in hu-mans, these imaging systems must have sensitivities that are up to 2,500 fold great-er. NCRR proposes to support further technological development of high resolutionimaging tools that include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), and positron emission tomography. Functional MRI imaging has provided investigators a powerful technology for studies of the human brain and has contributed significantly with other complemen-tary technologies to a virtual revolution in neuroscience research. To further takeadvantage of these imaging and related technologies, NCRR proposes to support theestablishment of regional MRI imaging resource centers where experts in developingand using functional MRI can work with neuroscientists to study brain disordersand also explore novel therapies, including stem cell therapy to arrest, reverse, oreven cure neurodegenerative diseases. NCRR plans to functionally link those NCRR-supported Biomedical Technology Research Resource Centers equipped with sophis-ticated imaging capabilities with General Clinical Research Centers at the samehost institution in order to accommodate patients from across this country for stud-ies of neurodegenerative and other brain disorders, supported by NIH categoric in-stitutes. The use of high-level computers and advanced computer programs are essential components of today 's biomedical research, but many biomedical scientists are not sufficiently familiar with bioinformatics, a key enabling technology. To help alleviatethis urgent need, NCRR proposes to establish bioinformatics centers that will ad-vance research in particular areas of biomedical investigation, as part of the Bio-medical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI). Those centers willcreate homes for interdisciplinary teams that will establish nurturing environmentsfor exploration and research. Biomedical investigators are generating data in pro-fuse quantities. For example, a single biomedical laboratory can produce up to 100terabytes of information a year \u2014about the same as the information in one million encyclopedias. In order to be useful, the data must be indexed and stored, analyzedand abstracted. To facilitate analysis of this data, NCRR proposes to establish an-other program that will foster development of tools to design future studies. Synchrotron resources \u2014which produce the high-energy x-rays used for deter- mining the 3 -D structures of molecules \u2014have an enormous impact on structural bi- ology and drug design. The number of NIH users at NCRR-supported synchrotron beamlines doubled between 1995 and 1997, and requests for access to these facilitiesare increasing at an exponential rate. NCRR proposes to alleviate the projected sub-stantial shortfall for access to beamtime by adding more technical staff so that tech-nical support is available around the clock. New beamlines at the Advanced PhotonSource at the Argonne National Laboratory may allow investigators to address moreadvanced structural biology grand challenges. In addition, several new beamlinesmust be built at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab-oratory and designed for high throughput studies of less complex structures to meetthe anticipated high volume of need for this approach. This effort will combine newdevelopments in beamline design, x-ray detectors, cryocrystallography, robotics, andcomputational software. GENETIC MEDICINE Manifestations of gene action are explored through phenotypic assessment of ge- netically altered animals and biologic characterization of macromolecules expressedby both normal and altered genes. NCRR proposes to support regionally-linked re-source centers for phenotypic studies of genetically altered research animal models.These resource centers will provide a critical infrastructure for analysis of genefunction in animal models of human diseases. NCRR must provide those regionalresources and several other biorepositories for genetically altered biologic collectionsand additional funding for more technical staff to help maintain the rapidly expand-ing biologic collections. Additional staffing is also needed to curate and standardizethe genetic databases for those important research models \u2014including flies, fish, and worms. Without continuous updating and editing, databases quickly become uselessand as a result, unnecessary duplication of research results.198 HEALTH DISPARITIES NCRR proposes to help alleviate health disparities for several diseases that dis- proportionately affect minority populations by competitively establishing severalComprehensive Centers on Health Disparities (CCHD). Those centers are to behosted by medical schools located at universities that have an NCRR-supported Re-search Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) facility for clinical research. TheNCRR CCHD initiative will focus on diabetes, AIDS, and infant mortality, but ini-tially will place increased emphasis on cancer screening and management of cardio-vascular disease and stroke. This effort will be in partnership with appropriatecategoric NIH institutes and with nearby General Clinical Research Centers. RESEARCH CAPACITY NCRR proposes to continue support for construction or renovation of biomedical research facilities to assure that state-of-the-art research laboratories are availableto conduct the most sophisticated research. According to a 1998 National ScienceFoundation survey, at least 65 percent of biomedical research laboratories are inad-equate to host sophisticated research. Grant awards for construction or renovationthrough NCRR 's Research Facilities Improvement program are not intended to be the major source for institutional funding of research laboratory construction or ren-ovation. NCRR proposes to expand its Animal Facility Improvement program to meet insti- tutions ' needs nationally to upgrade animal research facilities to perform genetic re- search with rodents, nonhuman primates and other animal models. To assist re-search-performing Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority-serving institutions in bringing their animal research facilities up to AAALACstandards, NCRR proposes a special initiative to address this problem. CAREER DEVELOPMENT Over the past several years, fewer young physicians have pursued research ca- reers. To help address that problem, NCRR has initiated programs to increase thenumber of young physicians in the clinical research pipeline. NCRR proposes to ex-tend that effort in fiscal year 2001. That effort includes expanded support for ayear-long medical student mentored clinical research training program. The intentof this program is to serve as a catalyst for young physicians to pursue careers inpatient-oriented research. The institutional GCRC or the RCMI-funded Clinical Re-search Center will serve as a focal point for patient-oriented research, throughmentored didactic training and ''hands-on '' research. This new program will support up to 90 students per year. NCRR also proposes to increase the number of MentoredPatient-Oriented Research Career Development Awards to physicians and dentists at GCRC sites. This very successful program was formerly known as the ClinicalAssociate Physician (CAP) program. A serious shortage exists of trained veterinary pathologists to meet the collabo- rative research needs of scientists to assess the phenotypic manifestations of geneti-cally altered animal models of human disease. To enhance the pipeline, NCRR pro-poses to initiate a one-year program for veterinary students that will provide amentored biomedical research experience at research-intensive institutions. In addi-tion, NCRR proposes to increase the number of Special Emphasis Research CareerAward to train veterinarians in health-related research as pathobiologists. TheNCRR programs are intended to address the inadequate number of research-trainedveterinarians who participate in biomedical research. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our perform-ance measures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serveas indicators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continu-ously improve programs across the NIH and the Department. My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. STEPHEN E. S TRAUS Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the National Center for Complementary and Al- ternative Medicine for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $71,362,000, which reflects an in-crease of $3,381,000 over the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Includingthe estimated allocation for AIDS, total support requested for the National Center199 for Complementary and Alternative Medicine is $72,392,000, an increase of $3,381,000 over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the National Centerfor Complementary and Alternative Medicine efforts in AIDS research are includedwithin the Office of AIDS Research budget request. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the per-formance data is NIH 's first performance report that compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our performancemeasures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indi-cators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continuously im-prove programs across the NIH and the Department. At the outset, I should note that NCCAM 's work reflects the growing public inter- est in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and the belief that variousCAM therapies may play a role in improved public health. Approximately 42 percentof U.S. healthcare consumers spent $27 billion on CAM therapies in 1997. CAM en-joys particular popularity among baby boomers. A number of practices, once consid-ered unorthodox, have proven safe and effective and assimilated seamlessly into cur-rent medical practice. Diet and exercise are today commonly used to prevent andcontrol disease. Acupuncture is routinely applied to manage chronic pain and nau-sea associated with chemotherapy. Some of our most important drugs \u2014digitalis, vincristine, and taxol \u2014are of botanical origin. Additional CAM practices have the potential to prevent and treat chronic disease, to improve understanding of how healing works and to be integrated into the rou-tine practice of medicine. Absent definitive evidence of effectiveness, however, alter-native practices may impart untoward consequences for large numbers of people. As the NCCAM 's first permanent director, I am excited by the challenge afforded me to help provide the American public the guidance it deserves. As CAM use bythe American people has steadily increased, many have asked whether reports ofsuccess with these treatments are valid. It is critical that untested but widely usedCAM treatments be rigorously evaluated for safety and efficacy. It is similarly im-portant to identify promising new approaches worthy of more intensive study. Thepromising areas for future investments are numerous. In order to best seize these opportunities, the NCCAM 's strategy must differ from that used by other NIH Institutes and Centers. Others ' projects are usually driven by basic science discoveries. In contrast, the NCCAM must focus first on definitiveclinical trials of widely utilized modalities that, from evidence-based reviews, appearto be the most promising. Credible, not anecdotal, data must be provided to the pub-lic, and we must educate conventional medical practitioners about the panoply ofeffective CAM practices, so they can be integrated into patient care. In recognitionof these needs, Congress responded in 1998 by elevating the NIH Office of Alter-native Medicine (OAM), expanding its mandate, creating the NCCAM, and affording it administrative authority to design and manage its own research portfolio. TheCongress continued to reflect the growing interest in CAM by further increasingfunding for the Center in fiscal year 2000 to $68.4 million. We are indeed appre-ciative of this support. The Congress vested the NCCAM with a broad statutorymandate to conduct and support CAM research, support research training, and dis-seminate information on validated CAM therapies. Accordingly, the NCCAM is cur-rently developing a strategic plan to ensure that our continued growth, developmentand research directions are consistent with these responsibilities. Five strategicareas have been identified as: Investing in research; training CAM investigators; ex-panding outreach; facilitating integration; and practicing responsible stewardship. In seeking to fulfill its mandate, the NCCAM has undertaken a number of initia- tives, established critical contacts with CAM practitioners, and begun to fashion thescientific underpinning that will enable future research discoveries. Before describing these activities, I want to share with the Subcommittee my vi- sion of where I expect complementary and alternative medicine to be in the yearsto come. As a result of rigorous scientific investigation, several therapeutic and pre-ventative modalities currently deemed elements of CAM will prove effective. There-fore, in future years, these interventions will be integrated into conventional med-ical education and practice, and the term ''complementary and alternative medicine '' will be superseded by the concept of ''integrative medicine. '' The field of integrative medicine will be seen as providing novel insights and tools for human health, andnot as a source of tension that insinuates itself between and among practitionersof the healing arts and their patients. Advances in neurobiology will reveal moreabout ancient practices such as acupuncture and meditation, as well as the phe-nomenon of ''the placebo effect '' as we tap the healing power of the mind. The med- ical basis for effectiveness of selected herbal and nutritional supplements will be200 clarified, leading to their standardization and routine use. Other modalities will be found unsafe or ineffective, and an informed public will reject them. My vision is an optimistic one. However, I am confident that, as it is realized, the NCCAM will have not simply expanded in those ways required to meet its re-search mission. Rather, owing to a tradition of superb science and consumer service,the NCCAM will become the leader \u2014and recognized as such \u2014within a vibrant, and global, CAM research community. Already, I have begun to recruit key experts to join me in developing our pro- grams in intramural research, clinical research, international and traditional healthstudies, and traditional medicine and indigenous systems. We will continue to growour intellectual capital and research capacity. Setting these cornerstones in placewill enable us, together with our partners in CAM research, to provide definitiveanswers regarding CAM treatments. CURRENT RESEARCH STUDIES In its first year, NCCAM has developed a diverse research portfolio in partnership with the other NIH Institutes and Centers. I am pleased to highlight for you oursupport of some of the largest, and certainly the most definitive Phase III clinicaltrials ever undertaken for a range of CAM therapies. For centuries, extracts from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree have been used as Chinese herbal medicine to treat a variety of medical conditions, including age-related decline in memory. A new NCCAM study, in collaboration with the NationalInstitute on Aging (NIA), may help resolve these questions. This study includes fourclinical centers and will enroll almost 3,000 participants who will receive eitherGinkgo biloba or a placebo. Arthritis is a major public health problem for older Americans. Accordingly, in col- laboration with NIAMS, NCCAM has mounted two critical clinical trials for thetreatment of osteoarthritis. One is the first U.S. multi-center study to investigate the dietary supplements glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate \u2014two natural sub- stances, found in and around joint cartilage. The other study is an evaluation ofacupuncture for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. I am pleased to report that our study of St. John 's wort for depression is nearing completion. This study, sponsored by the NCCAM, NIMH, and the NIH Office of Di-etary Supplements (ODS), represents the largest and most rigorous assessment ofthe effectiveness and safety of St. John 's wort. Investigations of St. John 's wort il- lustrate the complex challenges afforded by some CAM modalities. A recent studyreported in The British Medical Journal showed that St. John 's wort is more effec- tive than placebo in treatment of depression, and perhaps as effective as an oldergeneration anti-depressant drug Imipramine. NCCAM 's study, which is considerably larger than the European trial, compares St. John 's wort with placebo and with Zoloft, currently one of the most commonly used anti-depressants. However, thetherapeutic promise of St. John 's wort and of botanical products like it, is accom- panied by risks that the public has largely ignored. An NIH study published Feb-ruary 12th in the Lancet found that St. John 's wort, when taken together with the important HIV protease-inhibiting drug, Indinavir, increased the rate at whichIndinavir was eliminated from the bloodstream, to the extent that blood levels fellbelow the acceptable level for effective AIDS treatment. NCCAM continues support for four Specialized Research Centers (cardiovascular disease, substance abuse, pediatrics and chiropractic) funded originally by the Officeof Alternative Medicine. By the end of fiscal year 1999, NCCAM made five addi-tional Specialty Research Center awards. The nine Center grants total approxi-mately $63 million. Each focuses on one of several areas, including pediatrics, addic-tion, cardiovascular disease (CVD), minority aging and CVD, aging, neurological dis-orders, craniofacial health, arthritis, and chiropractic medicine. In addition to thesenine Centers, NCCAM and ODS jointly established two Dietary Supplements Re-search Centers to advance the science of botanicals, including issues of their com-position, safety, and biological action. Another request for Center grant applicationsfocusing on asthma and cancer recently was released for fiscal year 2000. This, cou-pled with our anticipated solicitation of one more botanical center in fiscal year2000, will likely bring our total number of NCCAM-supported centers to as manyas 15. (BPH), or non-cancerous enlargement of the pros- tate, is the most common benign tumor found in men. Anecdotal reports suggestedthat the botanical product saw palmetto decreases prostate swelling. To determinethe validity of these observations, NCCAM, in collaboration with National Instituteon Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), is supporting the first rig-201 orously designed, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of saw palmetto ex- tract on symptoms and quality of life in men. FUTURE SCIENTIFIC PLANS AND PROJECTS Because of the dearth of credible scientific evidence on CAM practices, there is unprecedented opportunity for determining the efficacy and safety of CAM modali-ties. We have developed the following initiatives to address them: NCCAM has planned a collaboration on the treatment of liver disease with the NIDDK and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Theproject will examine the efficacy of milk thistle extract \u2014Silybum marianum \u2014when used to treat Hepatitis C and other hepatic diseases. NCCAM has already begun a number of activities that will serve to facilitate the integration of validated CAM therapies into conventional medical practice. TheNCCAM plans to make awards to foster incorporation of CAM information into thecurricula of medical and allied health schools and continuing medical education pro-grams. Also, the NCCAM must educate eager medical students about CAM so thatthey may knowledgeably guide an avid patient base toward safe and effective CAMapplications. We must also work to overcome the reluctance of conventional physi-cians to consider validated CAM therapies and to assimilate proven ones into theirpractice. The Center has established a Clinical Research Curriculum Award (CRCA)to attract talented individuals to CAM research and to provide them with the crit-ical skills that are needed. A majority of the CAM modalities practiced in this country have arisen from the traditional healing practices of other nations. Some of the practices have ''evolved '' or been adapted to work within the context of our society, and often in parallel withconventional medical practices. Moreover, most of these practices are not well docu-mented within the context of their native cultures or understood within the contextof our own. Unraveling these issues will provide some important insights into howthese CAM modalities are practiced and impact upon the health of U.S. minoritypopulations \u2014new immigrants like Hmong (from southeast Asia) and established groups like the Navajo. Likewise, the development of culturally sensitive studieswill enable NCCAM to establish methodological feasibility and strengthen the sci-entific rationale for proceeding to full-scale, randomized, clinical trials on the appli-cation of traditional, indigenous systems. The ability to validate some of these thera-pies will also expand healthcare options for those who are primarily consumers ofconvention medicine. The international character of CAM necessitates that theNCCAM develop a broad-based international research program that reaches out toCAM practitioners across the world. Therefore, in collaboration with several otherICs, NCCAM is committed to support locally-based, traditional, indigenous researchprojects in countries where the opportunities for promising CAM research are great-est. That process will ensue with the forthcoming appointment of a Director forInternational and Traditional Medicine Studies, who will develop a long-range planfor the pursuit of studies on a global scale. Foreshadowing this appointment, I havealready authorized NCCAM support, in collaboration with the NICHD, for inter-national studies of traditional medical approaches to the health of women and chil-dren. The NCCAM will establish an Intramural Research Program that will develop a critical mass of CAM research to stimulate collaboration in the NIH Clinical Centerwith other Institutes and Centers, our Federal research partners, and others. Theintramural program will serve as a focus for training future CAM researchers. Lastmonth I formed a search committee to identify the Director of this program. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION Specific statutory authority enables the NCCAM to disseminate information re- garding the safety and effectiveness of CAM therapies to health care providers andthe public. A focal point for information about NCCAM programs and research find-ings, the NCCAM Information Clearinghouse develops and disseminates fact sheets,information packages, and publications to enhance public understanding about CAMresearch supported by the NIH. Its quarterly newsletter, Complementary & Alter-native Medicine at the NIH is distributed to 6,000 subscribers. The NCCAM 's award winning World Wide Web site, first established two years ago, reflects the NCCAM 's growth in size and stature. Averaging more than 460,000 hits per month, the siteincludes links to NCCAM program areas, news and events, research grants, fundingopportunities, and resources. Assembled by NCCAM from the National Library ofMedicine 's (NLM) MEDLINE database, the CAM Citation Index (CCI) affords the public access to approximately 175,000 bibliographic citations searchable by CAMsystem, disease, or method. Also, in February 1999, NCCAM joined the federally202 supported Combined Health Information Database (CHID), which includes a variety of health information materials not available in other government databases, includ-ing nearly 1,000 CAM citations not available elsewhere. To facilitate our outreach to the general public, I have initiated a series of town meetings; the first will be held on March 15 in Boston, in conjunction with the Cen-ter for Alternative Medicine and Education of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Cen-ter. I am now happy to take your questions about these or any other of NCCAM 's ac- tivities and plans. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. GERALD T. K EUSCH , DIRECTOR , FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget request for the Fogarty International Center (FIC) for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $32,532,000, which reflects an increase of $3,620,000 over thecomparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation forAIDS, the total support requested for the FIC is $48,011,000, which is an increaseof $4,683,000 over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Funds for the FIC efforts inAIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research budget allowance. I am delighted to relate our progress over the past year and our proposed plans for fiscal year 2001. The FIC has taken a lead role in formulating and implementingbiomedical research and policy. The programs of the FIC, developed in close con-sultation with this Committee, reflect our Nation 's enduring commitment to global health equity. But disparities in health still exist. While one-fifth of the world 's pop- ulation enjoys an average life expectancy approaching 80 and a life comparativelyfree of disability, two-thirds of the world 's population, living in the least well-off countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, suffer overwhelmingly from the world 's burden of illness and premature death. According to statistics compiled by theWorld Health Organization (WHO), each year in the developing world 15 millionchildren die from infection and malnutrition \u201440,000 children per day \u2014and the toll in sickness and life-long disability has even greater social, economic, and politicalconsequences. Arguably, reversing this deepening disparity is a public health ur-gency in the new decade that demands increasingly creative actions from the sci-entific community. Disparities in health are not limited by national boundaries. Research on condi- tions related to poverty in resource-poor nations have universal applications. Mostrecently, this has been demonstrated by the development of short-course treatmentregimens for tuberculosis, field tested initially in Tanzania and now applied by pub- lic health authorities throughout the United States. Adapting research advances inbiomedicine to populations at home and abroad requires a continuing commitmentto basic science as well as rigorous clinical and applied studies. Our mandate at FICis to serve as NIH 's international catalyst by enabling U.S. institutions to extend the geographic scope of research and training. FIC supports over one hundred U.S.institutions that collaborate with more than ninety nations. These efforts are multi-disciplinary, embracing clinical, epidemiological, basic biomedical and behavioral re-search. They are multisectoral, coordinated with our sister institutes at NIH andwith international organizations with health and development mandates, includingthe World Health Organization and World Bank. One principal strategy of the FIC is to create the human capital and institutional capabilities in developing nations necessary for a productive research enterprise.FIC places priority in four foundation disciplines: First, information science andtechnology, as both an analytical tool and a means to create global laboratorieswithout walls; second, epidemiological and clinical methodologies necessary to char-acterize disease burdens and devise and evaluate therapeutic or preventive inter-ventions; third, human genetics and genomics, so that developing nations may con-tribute to and benefit from international efforts to apply genetic discoveries to clin-ical practice and therapeutics; and fourth, ethical principles and practice in patient-oriented research, with the intent of ensuring the depth and transparency of theprocess of ethical review and the involvement of co-investigators and study volun-teers as equals in accordance with international guidelines as well as local norms. The selected examples that follow characterize several of our leading priorities in global health research and training. DEVELOPING COST -EFFECTIVE METHODS OF PREVENTING HIV Over ninety percent of the world 's estimated 33 million persons infected with HIV live in developing countries (UNAIDS). Within the next five years, 61 of every 1,000203 children born in southern Africa will not reach their first birthday due to AIDS and increasing longevity gains will be reversed. Progress in preventing future infectionsis dependent on rigorous scientific links with developing nations. This is the objec-tive of FIC 's AIDS International Training and Research Program, the most exten- sive HIV research and training network among U.S. schools of medicine and publichealth and counterparts in developing nations. In partnership with the National In-stitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, FIC provided training and infrastructuralsupport for Ugandan-based trials to prevent perinatal HIV transmission throughregimens of the anti-retroviral drug nevirapine. A single oral dose given to an HIV-infected women in labor and another given to her infant within three days of birthreduced the transmission rate by half at a cost of $4.00 per mother-infant pair. If implemented widely in developing nations, this intervention could prevent some400,000 newborns per year from beginning life infected with HIV. NOVEL APPROACHES TO TREATMENT AND CONTROL OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES Coupled with the AIDS crisis, parasitic and other infections continue to compound the burdens of mortality and chronic illness as well as impede economic growth inaffected regions. According to WHO, malaria kills close to 2 million people eachyear, most are children under the age of five, and an estimated 12to 1 billion cases of malaria occur, and this is closely associated with poor economic performance inthe affected countries. Progress will require a new public health paradigm: An inte-grated approach to prevention and control, incorporating improvements in casemanagement, rational drug use to limit the spread of resistance, monitoring andevaluation of control measures, and development of new diagnostic tools, drugs andvaccines. Moreover, the spread of HIV is hastened through the use of unscreenedblood to treat the life-threatening anemia that often develops in malaria-infected in-dividuals. This reinforces the need for operational strategies to ensure the safety ofthe blood supply and transfusion practices for the anemia of malaria, a major com-plication of the infection. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM), an allianceof scientific and development agencies and African partners, was launched withmajor support from FIC and NIAID to address these critical needs. FIC now servesas the worldwide focal point for the MIM. To promote the agenda to reduce the bur-den of malaria, FIC has initiated a new research and training program to link U.S.and, in particularly, African institutions. The MIM constitutes a maturing model\u2014a paradigm of cross-sectoral cooperation that FIC hopes to adapt to other globalhealth urgencies. The field of malaria and other tropical infections has reached a watershed, dem- onstrating the potential for application of tools of molecular and cell biology torender formerly intractable problems approachable. For example, dengue fever andits most severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, are consid-ered among the most important and widespread reemerging infectious diseases inthe developing world, including the Caribbean. Global warming impacts on mosquitovectors that makes this a threat to the U.S. mainland as well. To date, existingmethods to diagnose and characterize dengue viruses have been costly and com-plicated to perform, particularly in developing countries with limited capabilitiesand resources. Under FIC support, the University of California at Berkeley and theMinistry of Health in Nicaragua have developed a new technique to rapidly, accu-rately, and inexpensively define the virus responsible for dengue in Central Amer-ica. This method is known as restriction site-specific PCR (polymerase chain reac-tion). Using this new information, local health authorities now are able to track themovement of the dengue virus from Asia and Africa to the Americas, which is thestart of control efforts. Dengue is among more than thirty-five infectious diseases that have emerged or reemerged around the world in the past twenty-five years. Most recently, the out-break of encephalitis in the New York region was attributed to the West Nile Virus,its first known introduction into the Western hemisphere. Although it is not clearhow the virus migrated to the United States, this outbreak is representative of thecontinual challenge that newly emerging microbes present for U.S. citizens. Emerg-ing infectious diseases are infections that are new in the population, rapidly increas-ing in incidence or expanding in geographic range. Most are caused by ''microbialtraffic''\u2014that is, the introduction and dissemination of existing agents into humanpopulations either from other species or from smaller populations, often precipitatedby rapid ecological and environmental change. To better comprehend the con-sequences of changes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems on human health, theFIC, in partnership with several NIH Institutes, the National Science Foundation,and other U.S. agencies, initiated an interdisciplinary research program to elucidatethe underlying biology of habitat and biodiversity changes that may lead to in-204 creased disease prevalence in humans and, thus, fill an important gap in our under- standing of these interrelated dynamics. With this information, we will be able todevelop data and predictive models to anticipate future outbreaks and devise correc-tive actions before the disease strikes. TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS EMERGING EPIDEMICS OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE : FISCAL YEAR 2001 INITIATIVES The classic burdens of infectious diseases in developing nations are now joined by a new class of epidemics. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study commis-sioned by the World Bank, over the next twenty-five years as populations age andrisk exposures shift, non-communicable diseases will become the leading source ofdisability and premature death in developing nations. Both the pace of thesechanges and the sheer numbers affected will exceed the Western experience. Byworking in partnership with scientists in low- and middle-income nations, risk fac-tors may be evaluated and interventions developed that will be of benefit to bothindustrialized and developing nations. The emerging epidemics of chronic disease indeveloping nations constitute FIC 's major programmatic thrust for fiscal year 2001. In cooperation with the WHO Tobacco Free Initiative and multiple NIH partners, FIC will establish a research and training program to improve international effortsto control the tobacco epidemic. Among other objectives, the program will addresslarge gaps in our knowledge relating to the burden of death and disability associ-ated with tobacco use in developing nations, such as behavioral determinants of smoking uptake in youth. The Center also will launch a similar effort directed atprevention and management of mental health disorders \u2014an unseen epidemic in most developing countries. At any give time, an estimated 10 percent of the popu-lation in developing nations suffers from severe anxiety, depressive disorders andother psychosocial problems (World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Nations, Oxford University press, 1995). Through international partner-ships, we hope to begin to rectify the shortfall of well-trained clinical investigatorsand epidemiologists in mental health fields in developing nations. Moreover, we willbegin to generate epidemiological data on the incidence of mental health disordersand risk factors, including sociocultural determinants of mental health in societiesundergoing transition to industrialized economies. In fiscal year 2001, the FIC also proposes to create new linkages with developing nations in the field of molecular medicine, emphasizing research and training re-lated to the complex interplay between genes and the environment. The geneticmaps, physical maps and technologies that have emerged from the human genomesequencing effort have enabled the research community to accelerate dramaticallythe discovery of genes underlying disease or risk factors for disease. We are nowpositioned to advance understanding of population genetics and dynamics for chron-ic conditions that affect industrial and developing nations alike, such as hyper-tension, type 2 diabetes, asthma, and breast cancer. FIC 's long-range goals are to define some of the genes involved in multigenic disorders of global priority and thentest the predictive strength of these particular polymorphisms in prospective, com-munity-based studies. Ultimately, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prevention strategieswill evolve. Our current efforts in this field already have yielded promising leads. Scientists at the University of Washington have teamed with scientists from Tel Aviv Univer-sity in Israel and Bethlehem University in the Palestinian Authority to map andclone the genes responsible for different types of inherited deafness \u2014both progres- sive and early-onset. The incidence of preverbal deafness is an estimated five to tenpercent in this region, among the highest in the world. Loss of hearing may be dueto environmental factors or to genetic mutations in any one of a large number ofgenes. These genes encode proteins crucial for the proper development, structureand function of the inner ear. There may be more than 100 such genes, howeveronly a fraction have been identified. Identifying these genes and defining themutations that cause deafness through these novel studies will lead to a better un-derstanding of the biology of hearing. CONCLUSION These programs and initiatives are representative of a broad spectrum of inter- national research and training efforts supported by FIC. The programs of FIC recog-nize a deeper philosophic purpose and vision. Advances in biology over the past dec-ades have demonstrated social and global interdependence. This is a condition ofhealth for the biosphere as much as it is an imperative of societal well-being. Thereis a deepening consensus that individuals and nations share an inherited and ac-quired sense of social altruism \u2014an understanding of common fate and a shared set205 of social obligations. The pursuit of health through international scientific coopera- tion is an inherently global enterprise and one that ultimately improves the publichealth of this Nation as well. The NIH budget request includes performance information required by the Gov- ernment Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the perform-ance data is NIH 's first performance report, which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year 1999 performance plan. As our performancemeasures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indi-cators to support the identification of strategies and objectives to continuously im-prove programs across the NIH and the Department. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be pleased to answer any questions. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. DONALD A.B. L INDBERG Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's non-AIDS budget for the National Library of Medicine for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $224,942,000, which reflects an increase of $14,806,000 over the com-parable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. Including the estimated allocation for AIDS,total support requested for NLM is $230,135,000, an increase of $16,067,000 overthe appropriation for fiscal year 2000. Funds for the NLM 's efforts in AIDS research are included within the Office of AIDS Research budget request. HEALTH INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC In the best tradition of American enterprise, NLM has within a few short years re-engineered its information services to benefit directly both health professionalsand the public. The public has always been the ultimate beneficiary of NLM 's serv- ices. But today 's consumer now has the same access as doctors and scientists to the Library 's immense databanks. NLM has also created new services aimed directly at the general public that are proving popular with Web users. These changes, encour-aged by this Committee and supported by Congress, have been endorsed by NLM 's Board of Regents. The NLM has a two-step strategy to maximize the utility of its services. The first is to respond to the needs of the Web-using public. It is estimated that 40 to 50percent of Americans are connected to the Internet, and health information is a pop-ular topic for searching. In three years the Library has seen the number of searcheson its MEDLINE database rise from 7 million searches a year to 250 million. TheLibrary estimates that 30 percent are done by the members of the public for them-selves and their families. That a database of 10 million references and abstracts tomedical journal articles would prove to be so popular is remarkable and dem-onstrates an eagerness for authoritative health information by the public. The Library has created for consumers a new service, MEDLINE plus, to com- plement its databases of scientific literature. MEDLINE plus has grown rapidly in little more than a year, and provides links to information on 350 diseases and med-ical conditions. This information, reviewed and selected by highly trained medicallibrarians, originates from such trusted sources as the Institutes of NIH and profes-sional societies. NLM constantly scans these and other organizations for up-to-dateinformation and the links are checked daily. MEDLINE plus contains a feature unique in the world of Web-based information for the public: carefully pre-formu-lated searches of the MEDLINE database that will return references and abstractsdeemed especially useful for the average consumer. A new service, ClinicalTrials.gov, was introduced by NLM on behalf of NIH in February 2000. This database, accessible through MEDLINE plus, contains vital in- formation about thousands of clinical trials sponsored by the NIH and other Federalagencies. Now patients, families, and members of the public can find out about cut-ting-edge research being conducted around the U.S. and whether they are eligibleto join a study. ClinicalTrials.gov contains a statement of purpose for each clinicalresearch study, together with the recruiting status, the criteria for patient participa-tion in the trial, the location of the trial, and specific contact information. The data-base will be expanded to include clinical trials sponsored by private industry andin other countries. Not all Americans, however, can search the Internet. Thus, NLM 's second strat- egy is to improve access for this group by encouraging medical libraries to workwith local public libraries and other community organizations. In 1999 NLM com-pleted a pilot project with public libraries in nine states and the District of Colum-bia. The purpose was to evaluate whether these libraries, using the Internet, couldhelp meet the needs of the public for good health information. The project revealedthat MEDLINE plus is an excellent place for consumers to begin their search and206 that public librarians need training in answering health reference questions and in finding and evaluating health information on the Web. Building on what we learnedin this project, the NLM made awards in February 2000 to fund 49 electronic healthinformation projects in 34 states that will increase Internet access in many settings,from middle schools serving low income and educationally underserved students toshopping malls and senior centers. These imaginative and well-targeted projects willstimulate medical libraries, local public libraries, and other organizations to worktogether to provide electronic health information services for all citizens in a com-munity. Crucial in this effort is the Regional Medical Libraries and members of theNational Network of Libraries of Medicine. HEALTH DISPARITIES The NLM has in place a number of programs that in recent years have been di- rected toward remedying the disparity in health opportunities experienced by seg-ments of the American population. One of these programs deals with toxic wastesites and other environmental and occupational hazards that are much more likelyto occur near homes in poor neighborhoods than where affluent Americans live. TheLibrary has a program to train health professionals, community leaders, and othersin minority neighborhoods to use the NLM 's databases of information about haz- ardous waste information. The Library provides minority schools with state-of-the-art equipment, software, and free access to computerized information sources, in-cluding NLM 's own toxicology and environmental health information databases. Other Federal agencies have joined with NLM and the project has grown from 9participating minority institutions to more than 60. Similar to the program for toxicology and environmental health, the Library has been working with institutions that serve minority populations to encourage the useof NLM information services relating to HIV/AIDS. These include the databasesAIDSLINE (references and abstracts), AIDSTRIALS (clinical trials), AIDSDRUGS(drugs being tested), and DIRLINE (organizations that provide health informationto the public). The NLM has in place a program to train health professionals, com-munity organizers, information professionals, and patient advocates in the use ofthese resources. Requests for this training have been strong and sustained, andNLM has responded to the extent its resources permit. In addition to the programsmentioned above, NLM grants and contracts have been targeted to support healthinformation programs for African Americans, Latinos, and Native American popu-lations in the south; rural hospitals in the Midwest; Native Americans in Alaskaand the Pacific Northwest; African American and Latino populations in the PacificSouthwest; and Puerto Rico. To illustrate, telemedicine in rural Alaska is being test-ed as a strategy for controlling costs and for raising the quality of health care fora minority population that is scattered across a vast area. The NLM is a key participant in the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria Research effort in Sub-Saharan Africa. Scientists in many developing countries are unable tocommunicate easily with other scientists, search biomedical databases, or collabo-rate with colleagues in industrialized countries. This results in poor coordinationand monitoring of research, redundancy of effort, and a growing disparity in re-search productivity. The Library is supporting the implementation of high end com-munications hardware and software in remote malaria research sites in Mali,Kenya, Cameroon, Ghana, and Tanzania. Since Internet connections can effectivelycarry voice, data, and video image transmissions, the Library is helping to bringthem to scientists in those countries. The Ghana sites, for example, are engaged inmalaria vaccine development and testing readiness. MEDICAL INFORMATICS A recently released report recommends that the NIH invest heavily in computer and information technology so as to be able to manage data and model biologicalprocesses. It also observes that there is an acute need for training specialists com-petent in computational biology. This recommendation falls within the scope of theNLM 's medical informatics training program under which the Library supports 12 programs at U.S. universities to train experts to carry out research in generalinformatics and in the genome-related specialty of bioinformatics. NLM plans toaugment some of these training programs with additional resources so that they canmake use of the advantages they already enjoy: experienced faculty, curricula, sanc-tioned university status, and ready access to potential candidates. NLM envisionsexpanding the program beyond 12 centers with the addition of training awards tonew institutions. To ensure that the Internet will continue to support the health sciences, the NLM is a strong supporter of the Next Generation Internet (NGI), a partnership of indus-207 try, academia, and government agencies that seeks to provide affordable, secure in- formation delivery at rates thousands of times faster than today. Advanced medicalimaging, for example, requires more bandwidth than is currently available. Otherapplications require a guaranteed level of service (for example no data loss, or as-sured privacy protection) that today 's Internet cannot provide. To help the health sciences prepare to use the capabilities the next few years will bring, the Libraryis supporting the development of innovative medical test-bed projects that dem-onstrate the application and use of the capabilities of the Next Generation Internet.Spread out over three phases, the support includes a variety of telemedicine-relatedprojects, advanced medical imaging, and patient-controlled personal medical recordssystems. In the last phase there will be a scale-up of especially promising projectsto regional or national level. The Visible Human Project is an example of a program that requires both ad- vanced computing techniques and the capability of the Next Generation Internet.The two very large datasets of anatomical data represented by the Visible HumanMale and Female are being used (without charge) by 1,240 licensees in 41 countries,and at four mirror sites in Asia and Europe. In addition to the varied uses to whichthese licensees are applying the data (for example, recyclable cadavers, virtualcolonoscopies, and brain surgery rehearsal), the Library is seeking to create a publicsoftware ''toolkit '' that will allow anyone to use the data to ''create '' any anatomical object. A collaborative project of the NLM, in partnership with several NIH Insti-tutes and the National Science Foundation, is extending the Visible Human Projectby developing an extremely detailed atlas of the head and neck. GENETICS OF MEDICINE As a result of the accelerating pace of research, the GenBank database of DNA sequence information maintained by NLM 's National Center for Biotechnology Infor- mation is growing to gargantuan sizes. It now contains some 5 million sequenceswith a total of nearly 5 billion base pairs, and the NCBI Web site, where GenBankis made freely available, receives some 800,000 queries per day from 120,000 sci-entists and others around the world. In addition to academic institutions, major bio-technology and pharmaceutical firms are among the heaviest users of the NCBIWeb site. They not only search GenBank, but use NCBI-created computational toolssuch as that which allows researchers to use the growing body of known 3-dimen-sional structures to infer approximate 3D sequence structure from similarity rela-tionships. NCBI scientists have also collaborated with 64 colleagues from govern-ment, university, and commercial laboratories around the world to produce a new''gene map '' that pinpoints the chromosomal locations of almost half of all human genes. This milestone in the Human Genome Project, available on the Internet, willexpedite the discovery of human disease genes and by extension, contribute to ad-vances in detection and treatment of illnesses. BASIC SERVICES Despite the NLM 's extensive involvement with computer and communications technology, the staff is ever mindful of its responsibility to maintain the integrityof the world 's largest collection of medical books and journals. Increasingly, this in- formation is in digital form, and the NLM, as a national library responsible for pre-serving the scholarly record of biomedicine, is developing a strategy for selecting,organizing, and ensuring permanent access to digital information. Regardless of theformat in which the materials are received, ensuring their availability for futuregenerations remains the Library 's highest priority. The expanding NLM collection and research and development programs continue to put pressure on current NLMstorage capacity. The issue of NLM space needs will be considered as NIH revisesits Master Plan. In the meantime, NIH has assigned NLM space in the NatcherBuilding, located adjacent to the NLM Building to address the immediate needs aslonger term options are developed and evaluated. The NIH budget request includes the performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. As our performancemeasures mature and performance trends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indi-cators to support the identification strategies and objectives to continuously improveprograms across the NIH and the Department. My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to any questions you may have.208 PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. NEALNATHANSON Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the AIDS research programs of the National Institutes of Health for fiscal year 2001, a sum of $2,111,224,000, an increase of $105,041,000above the comparable fiscal year 2000 appropriation. NIH budget request includesthe performance information required by the Government Performance and ResultsAct (GPRA) of 1993. Prominent in the performance data is NIH 's first performance report which compares our fiscal year 1999 results to the goals in our fiscal year1999 performance plan. As our performance measures mature and performancetrends emerge, the GPRA data will serve as indicators to support the identificationof strategies and objectives to continuously improve programs across the NIH andthe Department. The Office of AIDS Research (OAR) is responsible for setting the scientific agenda for the large and diverse NIH AIDS research program. To this end, we develop theannual AIDS research plan and budget, based on the most compelling scientific pri-orities that will lead to better therapies and prevention for HIV infection and AIDS.Those priorities are established through a collaborative process involving the NIHinstitutes and non-government experts from academia and industry as well as thefull participation of the AIDS-affected community. Mr. Chairman, at our hearings here last year initiated unprecedented attention on the international dimension of the AIDS epidemic. Your support and attentionto critical global needs at those hearings were a catalyst for efforts that have in-creased throughout the year. In January, the United Nations Security Council de-clared that AIDS is now a national security issue, representing a new kind of threatto political stability. AIDS in Africa is killing ten times as many people as war, sab-otaging economic development, leading to massive social breakdown, and creatinga generation of orphans. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke called AIDS ''a direct, can- cerous growth on the political, social, and economic security of Africa. '' THE UNRELENTING PANDEMIC By every definition, AIDS is the great plague of the 20th century \u2014an epidemic of biblical proportions. (Chart 1) AIDS already has killed more than 16 million peo-ple, surpassing tuberculosis and malaria as the leading infectious cause of deathworldwide, according to recent data from the Joint United Nations Programme onHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO). In 1999, a record2.6 million people died from AIDS \u2014more than in any prior year. UNAIDS estimates that in India between 3 and 5 million people are infected, with new infections dou-bling every 14 months. New epidemics are rapidly increasing in Russia, Eastern Eu-rope, and in China. AIDS remains a serious threat in Latin America and the Carib-bean. Africa (Chart 2) remains the epicenter of the pandemic, bearing the largestdisease burden, with 70 percent of people living with AIDS worldwide, 83 percentof global AIDS deaths, and 95 percent of the world 's AIDS orphans. HIV-infected women aged 15 to 49 outnumber infected men. In Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe,40 percent of adults are HIV-infected. The impact of AIDS on developing nationsand many former communist countries is staggering, with even greater potentialdisaster to come. AIDS is reversing decades of progress from important publichealth efforts, lowering life expectancy, and significantly affecting internationalbusinesses. Lost productivity and profitability, the cost of sickness and death bene-fits, and the decline in a skilled workforce in the developing world will have eco-nomic effects worldwide. AIDS is affecting the military capabilities of some countriesas well as the international peacekeeping forces. THE EVOLVING EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES In the U.S., the incidence of new AIDS cases has declined, thanks largely to ex- panded use of new antiretroviral therapies that prevent progression of HIV infectionto AIDS. The previous decline in death rates has now leveled off. The state of Illi-nois just announced a 24 percent increase in AIDS cases in 1999. Most significantly,the annual incidence of new HIV infections has not declined since 1990 (Chart 3).This means that although therapeutic interventions are delaying death, at least fora time, we have not slowed the epidemic. Chart 4 shows that HIV infection ratesare continuing to climb in two major groups \u2014women and minorities. Rates are also increasing in young homosexual men and people over 50 years of age. AIDS affectsthe disenfranchised in our society \u2014the poor, the homeless, and those with addictive or mental disorders. Further, drug resistant strains of HIV present a serious publichealth concern.209 These data forebode an epidemic of even greater magnitude ahead, and shape our most urgent research priorities. These priorities (Chart 5) address two critical popu-lations \u2014those living in developing countries, and the minority populations of the U.S.\u2014with a two-pronged agenda: therapeutic research to treat those who are al- ready infected; and prevention research to reduce HIV transmission. Our preventionagenda includes both vaccine and non-vaccine strategies, such as behavioral re-search, development of topical microbicides, and prevention of perinatal trans-mission. PRIORITY : INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH We are increasing our international AIDS research porfolio. As more than 90 per- cent of new infections occur in developing countries, where therapeutic interventionsare unaffordable and undeliverable, NIH is pursuing interventions that can be im-plemented in these resource \u2014and infrastructure-deprived nations. I will cite just a few examples. A recent NIAID-sponsored clinical trial in Uganda demonstrated thatnevirapine, an antiretroviral drug costing less than $4, given once to the mother andonce to the baby at birth, could reduce mother-to-child transmission by 50 percent.The NIH vaccine research effort underscores the crucial role of NIH in addressingprevention needs worldwide. Clinical trials within both the new NIAID VaccineTrials Network and Prevention Trials Network are expected to involve internationalsites. The OAR is supporting the first international conference on microbicides tostimulate new research initiatives in this critical area. To further our efforts andenhance international collaboration, the Fogary International Center is expandingits research and training programs in many developing nations. The OAR fiscal year2002 annual plan, which we are now developing, includes a special section for inter-national research, and we have established an International AIDS Research Col-laborating Committee to bring together all of the Departments of the U.S. govern-ment conducting AIDS research, along with international partners such as theUNAIDS and the World Bank. PRIORITY : HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE UNITED STATES The disproportionate impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on U.S. communities of color is demonstrated graphically on Chart 6. AIDS remains the number one causeof death among young African American men. OAR established a new group, theAd Hoc Working Group on Minority Research, to advise us on the scientific prior-ities in this critical research area, and we added a new section to our plan on re-search targeting minorities. We are directing increased resources toward new inter-ventions that will have the greatest impact on these groups, including those thataddress co-occurrence of other STDs, hepatitis, drug abuse, and mental illness, andinterventions that consider the role of culture, family, and other social factors in thetransmission and prevention of these disorders in minority communities. NIH ismaking significant investments to improve research infrastructure and training op-portunities for minorities, and we will continue to assure the participation of minor-ity subjects in AIDS clinical trials as well as natural history, epidemiologic, and pre-vention studies. In accordance with the Congressional Black Caucus initiative, theOAR has provided additional funds to projects aimed at: increasing the number ofminority investigators conducting behavioral and clinical research; targeting thelinks between substance abuse, sexual behaviors and HIV infection; increasing out-reach education programs targeting minority physicians and at-risk populations;and expanding our portfolio of population-based research. We estimate that withthis budget request, NIH will devote approximately $427 million to research tar-geting AIDS in minority community communities. PRIORITY : BETTER THERAPIES The development of protease inhibitors has had a significant impact on the length and quality of life for many HIV-infected people in the U.S. But the news in thisarea is not good. At the recent scientific meeting on retroviruses, the overridingtheme was the long and serious list of problems for patients receiving these HIVtherapies, including: (1) failure to obtain a satisfactory reduction in viral load evenfor patients who comply with treatment regimens; (2) expensive and complicatedregimens that make compliance difficult; (3) drug toxicities; (4) metabolic and car-diac complications, including diabetes; and 5) drug resistance. We must develop andtest new, simpler, less toxic, and cheaper anti-HIV drugs. Chart 7 summarizes ourkey priorities to accomplish that goal: (1) develop new targets for the design of newantiviral drugs; (2) conduct clinical trials to answer key questions such as: At whatpoint in the disease process should therapy be initiated and which combination ofdrugs should be used? At what point should the drugs be switched and to which210 drugs? How can toxicities and drug resistance be prevented? How can regimens be simplified and compliance improved? and (3) translate research results into clinicalpractice information that is useful to caregivers and their patients, particularly inminority communities. PRIORITY : HIV PREVENTION NIH supports a comprehensive approach to HIV prevention research that includes contributions from the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. The OAR preven-tion science research agenda (Chart 8) targets interventions to both infected anduninfected at risk individuals to reduce HIV transmission. In addition, differentstrategies must be applied to each subepidemic in the US and around the world.Our biomedical prevention research priorities include areas such as the developmentof topical microbicides for women; perinatal prevention strategies, including under-standing of breast-feeding risk; and management of sexually transmitted diseasesthat enhance risk of HIV transmission. NIH also supports behavioral research strat-egies, including prevention interventions related to drug and alcohol use. We are fo-cusing efforts on infected individuals who may not know they are infected, but inaddition, data suggest that some HIV-infected individuals successfully responding totherapy believe that they are less infectious and that they cannot be reinfected. Asa result, they may re-engage in risky behaviors. Thus NIH is supporting researchto develop HIV prevention interventions targeted to HIV-infected individuals. PRIORITY : VACCINES A safe and effective vaccine is the critical missing element in our armamentarium. In 1997, the President challenged the nation to develop an AIDS vaccine. Consistentwith this challenge, NIH has moved forward aggressively to build a comprehensivevaccine research enterprise. Funds in this request represent more than a 100 per-cent increase in NIH vaccine research since fiscal year 1997. These funds will pro-vide new grants to foster innovative HIV vaccine research and allow theinvigoration and reorganization of the NIH vaccine clinical trials effort. The newDale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center will be occupied this summer. Dr.David Baltimore continues to chair the AIDS Vaccine Research Committee whichadvises the NIH on the overall vaccine program. In February 1999, NIH-supportedinvestigators initiated the first AIDS vaccine trial in Africa. In collaboration withindustry partners, NIH has now tested 28 different HIV vaccine candidates, individ-ually or in combinations, in over 3000 uninfected volunteers. Several new vaccines,including vaccines designed to induce mucosal immunity, novel DNA vaccines, andmore complex vaccines presenting several viral proteins, have entered phase I trials.In addition, recent studies of ''therapeutic vaccines '' that do not prevent infection, but can prevent or delay disease progression in animal models has offered opportu-nities for additional vaccine strategies. There have been significant incremental advances in the development of an AIDS vaccine. A number of candidate vaccines have been formulated for use in rhesusmonkeys where they can be tested for their ability to protect against a ''challenge '' with a simian immunodeficiency virus that has been shown to produce AIDS inthese animals. This permits the rapid testing of the potential protective efficacy ofvaccine concepts. The left part of Chart 9 shows the blood levels of two groups ofmonkeys, one vaccinated and one given a placebo control. The vaccinated monkeyshad a much reduced infection, with a much better survival than the control group.Protection of this magnitude has been seen with several candidate vaccines. Theright part of the chart shows one of the most recent vaccines that has been testedin humans for its ability to produce immune responses. Both versions of the vaccineinduced the production of antibodies and cellular immune responses (CTLs), but only in a proportion of immunized subjects. Although this was not a trial of effec-tiveness, the subjects were followed for HIV infections. There appeared to be abouthalf as many infections in the immunized subjects, although the numbers were toosmall to be statistically significant. Results of this kind are encouraging and leadus to hope that full scale trials of vaccine effectiveness may begin in humans in thenext few years. BENEFITS TO OTHER DISEASE RESEARCH AIDS research is unraveling the mysteries surrounding many other infectious, malignant, neurologic, autoimmune and metabolic diseases. AIDS research has pro-vided an entirely new paradigm for drug design and development to treat viral in-fections. One example this year was the development of the new flu drug, Relenza,which directly benefited from AIDS research. The drug known as 3TC, developedto treat AIDS, is now the most effective therapy for chronic hepatitis B infection.211 Drugs developed to prevent and treat AIDS-associated opportunistic infections also provide benefit to patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy or receiving anti-trans-plant rejection therapy. AIDS is also providing new understanding of the relation-ship between viruses and cancer. SUMMARY The transmissible nature of HIV \u2014between individuals and across borders and populations \u2014makes it radically different from non-transmissible diseases such as heart disease and cancer. There is the potential for unlimited spread, and also thepossibility for a dramatic reduction in new infections \u2014and thus ultimate control of the pandemic \u2014in a way that can never be possible for noninfectious diseases. The impact of an intervention that reduces the probability of transmission, breaking thelink in the epidemic chain, extends far beyond the treated or protected individual. We have made enormous strides in our fight against this horrible disease, but these were only small skirmishes in a major global war. As this Committee clearlyrecognizes, our progress will be meaningless unless we can make the benefits of ourresearch findings available to populations desperately in need both here in our owncountry and around the world. The worldwide human and economic toll of this in-sidious disease is profound, and we will never solve the problem of AIDS for ourown citizens without controlling the epidemic in the rest of the global village. Wecannot afford to leave anyone behind. We are deeply grateful to the Committee for your steadfast support. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have. PRESIDENT 'S BUDGET Senator S PECTER . Well, thank you very much, Dr. Kirschstein. You say you are happy to present the President 's budget. You are honored to present the President 's budget. Well, what was the in- crease he requested? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . 5.6 percent. Senator S PECTER . How much of that is in dollars? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . The increase in dollars is $1 billion. Senator S PECTER . So you are honored to present a request for an increase of $1 billion. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Yes, sir. Senator S PECTER . I am just kidding with you a little here. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . I know. I also said I was honored to appear before you.Senator S PECTER . Would you be more honored to receive an in- crease of $2.7 billion? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . I certainly would. Senator S PECTER . I mean, if it is just a question of honor, I want to get the issue straight. RESEARCH GRANTS What percentage of applications are recipients and grants?Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . We will fund the largest total of research grants we have had ever. But the percentage that we will be fund-ing varies between institutes, but will be an overall of about 26percent. Senator S PECTER . Well, the percentage of grants then has not in- creased in the past, say, 3 years as more than $5 billion has beenadded to the NIH budget. Is that correct? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . It has increased somewhat over the last 3 years. It was less than the level that I gave you several years ago. Senator S PECTER . Well, I heard several years ago, 3, 4 years ago, a figure of 28 to 34 percent. And now you are saying that there are212 26 percent. And of course the question is: Are you getting a lot more grant applications? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . We are getting a lot more grant applications, but there are other reasons as well. Senator S PECTER . What are those reasons? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Well, in the years during which the NIH budg- et was constrained, the level of funding for each individual grantwas constrained as well. And we felt, as our funds were increased, that it would be impor- tant for us to try to provide each investigator all of whom are beingfunded to do and are doing superb work, and that is why we arefunding them, an amount of money closer to what their peers inthe review process had suggested that they are able to use appro-priately. And so we have tried to provide, as much as possible withthe increased funds, full funding for the research grants. In addition, we know by the way science has been changing that it is very important to begin to provide our investigators, and theyhave actually asked us, with certain resources that are not nec-essarily required in each individual grant budget: Databases; banksof nucleic acids and proteins from which they can draw from to en-hance their own research; information systems; instrumentation;very large instruments which they can share. So we have used our funds not only to provide individual inves- tigators with the ability to do work, but provide them with the re-sources that are needed. Senator S PECTER . When you say that 26 percent of the applica- tions receive grants, can you give us an estimate, a judgment, onhow many of the balance of 74 percent which do not receive grantsare meritorious and, under ideal circumstances, should receivegrants? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . In the past, we considered that about one-third of all the grants, 33, 34, 35 percent, would be an appropriate num-ber to strive for. However, recently the institute directors and Ihave discussed this. And in many cases, we feel that the numbercould go even higher, up to 40 or so percent, and meritoriousscience would continue to be funded. Senator S PECTER . What would it take by way of NIH budget to fund, say, 40 percent of the applications? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . It would take about $2 billion more, not quite. Senator S PECTER . $2 billion on top of your current budget? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Not quite, but almost. Senator S PECTER . So if we come in with $2 billion more \u2014\u2014 Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . No. $2 billion more on top of the 2000 budget. Senator S PECTER . On top of the 2000 budget. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Yes. Senator S PECTER . The 2000 budget is right at $17.9 billion. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Yes. The 2000 budget is $17.9 billion. You are correct. Senator S PECTER . So if we gave you $2 billion more, you could increase grant of applications from 26 percent to 40 percent. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Closer to one-third. Senator S PECTER . Well, OK. Now answer my 40 percent question. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . I think that would take more, and I am not ab- solutely sure. I will try to work that out.213 Senator S PECTER . Well, the subcommittee would like as precise an evaluation as you can give us on how many of those applicationsare meritorious. We always talk about opening up those closeddoors. And then we would like to know what it would cost to dothat. My own sense is that the potential for medical research is phe- nomenal, life saving. The most important asset we have is ourhealth. So we would like to know what the maximum is and seeif we cannot do something about that. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Each of the institute directors has provided in- formation to that effect. And we will ask them to provide evenmore for you. And we will try to provide it in total. Senator S PECTER . Well, maybe we will just take the time to go around the room, giving you a little notice. And the questions Iwould like to have answered are: Current budget, what percent ofthe applications are granted? How many are meritorious, wouldyou like to grant? And what would that cost? Sometimes we do not really get the answers later in writing. And sometimes when we get the answers, we do not read them. So let us try that this morning.I want to yield now to my distinguished ranking member, Sen- ator Tom Harkin. In your absence, I was saying good things behind your back, Tom. So beware. Senator H ARKIN . I have to be careful about that now. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your great leadership on this committee, but espe-cially as it deals with NIH funding. I was proud to join you lastyear in your great effort to secure a historic increase for NIH. AndI am proud to join you again this year, hopefully for another his- toric increase in NIH funding. I also want to thank Dr. Kirschstein for her leadership at NIH, for always being there when we needed someone to take the helm,especially one \u2014as I figure, you have been there 44 years. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . That is correct. Senator H ARKIN . And I want to thank you for 44 years of service to our country and beyond that, I guess, service to all humankindin terms of biomedical research. I think you are a great example,I hope, to a lot of young people today as to what research affordsand what it can mean in terms of contributions they could make,if they were to stay in research. That is one of the reasons that I hope that we can continue to increase this funding for NIH and get it doubled in 5 years, asChairman Specter has set the course to do, and that is to let a lotof young people know today that they can have a career in re-search, a good career in research. So I compliment you for that and, through you, to all of the insti- tute directors who are here today and to thank each one of them,each one of you, for all of your work and your leadership in thearea of medical research.214 PREPARED STATEMENT With that, I would just ask that my statement be made a part of the record, Mr. Chairman. Senator S PECTER . It will be made a part of the record without ob- jection. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOMHARKIN Mr Chairman, I want to thank you for holding this hearing today and I want to welcome Dr. Kirschstein and her colleagues from NIH who are testifying before ustoday. NIH is the premier medical research institution in the world \u2014research fund- ed by NIH is key to maintaining the quality of our health care and key to findingpreventive measures, cures and the most cost effective treatments for the major ill-nesses and conditions that strike Americans. But I must say that the timing of this hearing is interesting. Yesterday, the Sen- ate Budget Committee marked up a budget resolution that cuts nondefense discre-tionary spending from last year. Nondefense discretionary spending is cut by $7 bil-lion from a freeze! Last year, this subcommittee was able to secure a $2.3 billionincrease for NIH \u2014the second year in an effort to double NIH funding over five years. Mr. Chairman, as you know, you and I introduced legislation earlier this yearcalling for a $2.7 billion increase for NIH in fiscal year 2001 \u2014building on last year 's increase for NIH as we move to doubling funding for NIH over a five-year period. But, it is going to be next to impossible to find that money with a cut in our allo- cation this year. But, Mr. Chairman, I know you will find a way \u2014it's times like this that I 'm glad you are the Chairman. One, but certainly not the only, reason that we must continue this support for medical research at NIH is the truly awe-inspiring potential benefits of stem cellresearch. This Subcommittee has held a number of hearings on the issues sur-rounding stem cell research. At those hearings, I have had the opportunity to ex-press my support for this research. Now it is time to move forward. Dr. Kirschstein,I understand that the comment period has closed on the stem cell research guide-lines \u2014I expect that you will keep me updated on how you intend to encourage and support quality, ethically-sound research in this area over the coming months. I am also excited about the progress made on the Human Genome project. I see from Dr. Collins ' testimony that scientists will complete the human genome se- quence in 2003, two years ahead of the original schedule. I really believe that effortwill results in a number of scientific breakthroughs in over the next ten years. Thank you, Mr. Chairman \u2014I look forward from hearing from our witnesses. Senator H ARKIN . I do have several questions. I hope we have an- other round, because I am not going to get them all in in 5 min-utes, Mr. Chairman. Senator S PECTER . Sure. STEM CELL RESEARCH Senator H ARKIN . There are about three areas I want to cover. One is stem cells. I want to cover Francis Collins with the genomeresearch. And the other one is with the National Institute of DrugAbuse, NIDA, on methamphetamine. And maybe one other ques-tion on complementary and alternative medicine. Those are basi-cally the areas I want to cover. Let us start with stem cells first, Dr. Kirschstein. I understand that NIH has issued draft guidelines for the funding of stem cellresearch. And the comment period on those guidelines ended onFebruary 22. Can you give us some idea of when you will be finished reviewing those comments and be ready to issue a final regulation? And doyou think there will be any changes to the proposed guidelines? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Mr. Harkin, first of all, thank you for your very kind remarks.215 The comment period, as you said, did close on February 22. And the staff is working very hard now to analyze all the comments \u2014 there were a considerable number \u2014and to decide what needs to be changed about the guidelines. They will be revised. And we areworking on that at the present time. In addition, once the guidelines are published, we also want to have an oversight group in place to be able to review all the pro-posals related to the use of stem cells. And so what we propose is that we put out the final guidelines at the same time as we have such an oversight group in place. Andthen we would be ready to go. We would anticipate doing so some-time in the early summer. Senator H ARKIN . Well, I am a little \u2014I appreciate the time frame. Early summer, I hope that means \u2014when does summer start, in June? June 21. But I am a little concerned about what I thought I heard you say, and that is that there would be some revisions to the proposedguidelines. And that has raised my level of concern. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . No. The revision is based on the comments and what we think are in the comments that could clarify and refinewhat the guidelines will say. The basic aspects of the guidelineswill remain the same. STEM CELL RESEARCH AND DIABETES Senator H ARKIN . OK. I appreciate that. Then my concern has been alleviated. I understand that at the University of Alberta in Edmonton seven individuals with juvenile diabetes have remained free of in-sulin injections for close to a year after receiving transplants of in-sulin-producing cells. I use that only as an example, but how does NIH plan to cap- italize on this potential breakthrough? And what role might stemcells play in the future of this kind of research? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Senator Harkin, if I may, I would like to ask Dr. Spiegel, the new director of the National Institute of Diabetes,Digestive and Kidney Diseases, to answer that question. Senator H ARKIN . That would be great. Dr. S PIEGEL . Thank you, Dr. Kirschstein. The protocol you referred to, Mr. Harkin, the Edmonton Protocol, has indeed been successful for this period of 1 year. In collabora-tion with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ' Immune Tolerance Network, that protocol will be expanded to mul-tiple centers, which in turn hope to derive the islets that need tobe produced at the NCRR harvest centers. NIDDK has also fundedabout $3.5 million worth of new trials on other protocols for isletstransplants. As far as stem cells are concerned, it is clear that if this is, as we hope, successful, there will be a tremendous need for additionalsources of insulin-secreting beta cells. Recent work in mice, published in Nature, indicated that one can harvest such stem cells from the pancreas and that they can curediabetes. We will have a workshop of stem cell experts on April 10through 11, which will explore all the possible avenues.216 And we are optimistic that there will be real opportunities for breakthroughs that will bring these clinically exciting trials, aswell as stem cell technology, together. Senator H ARKIN . Can you elaborate a little bit more? This has been one year that they have. Is there any indication that there isany kind of rejection or that they may have to fall back on insulininjections? What can you enlighten me about the present state ofthat protocol? Dr. S PIEGEL . I would like to put it in historical perspective. Dr. Lacey at Washington University was a pioneer in this area andover 20 years ago made the first attempts at islet transplants inhumans. Unfortunately, only perhaps 1 out of 300-and-some-odd patients in the world remained insulin independent after treatment. Sothere were dismal failures up to now. This is why this is so prom-ising. And it relates both to the better methods of harvesting the islets from donor pancreases, as well as novel techniques which derivefrom basic immunology research. They are using a monoclonal anti-body that targets a particular T-cell receptor and a drug calledRapimycin. Now, unfortunately, this is still not what we want to achieve. We would like to achieve complete absence of immunosuppressivedrugs, be able to have the patient treated during the transplantand then need no further medication. And indeed, there are studiesboth in mice and in nonhuman primates indicating this can beachieved. Currently, these individuals in Edmonton have not had their medications removed. So it is too early to tell if they will be ableto achieve a state of immune tolerance. But we are very optimisticthat that could be the case. Senator S PECTER . Let us return to this in just a moment, because Senator Cochran has to chair another hearing. And we want tohear from him. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR THAD COCHRAN Senator C OCHRAN . Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to join you in welcoming Dr. Kirschstein and the directors ofthe NIH who are appearing here today. It is good to see Dr.Klausner and to thank him for his trip to my State. I appreciate what Dr. Kirschstein and the NIH do for our Na- tion's health. The NIH has excelled in the stimulation and support of medical research. Their efforts have involved both the basic sci-entific research needed to understand disease and treatment, andthe translational research needed to support clinical practice, andto reach the ultimate goal of improving the treatment of, andachieving the prevention of disease. PREPARED STATEMENT There are other comments that I have prepared as an opening statement and some questions, which I ask, Mr. Chairman, beprinted in the record and submitted for answering for the record.And I apologize for having to go to chair another meeting and notbeing able to stay for the full period of this hearing.217 Thank you all for what you do. Senator S PECTER . Well, Senator Cochran, thank you very much for joining us. We know you are chairing another hearing. Andyour full statement and questions will be in the record and sub-mitted for responses. Thank you. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR THAD COCHRAN Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Dr. Kirschstein and the directors of the NIH 's in- stitutes for appearing here today. It is good to see Dr. Klausner and thank him forhis trip to my state. I what all of you do for our nation 's health. The NIH has ex- celled in the stimulation and support of medical research. Their efforts have in-volved both the basic scientific research needed to understand disease and treat-ment, and the translational research needed to support clinical practice, and toreach the ultimate goal of improving the treatment of and achieving the preventionof disease. The NIH has invested in the future of our nation 's health by addressing areas of need including chronic diseases and health outcome disparities among minorities,those who live in rural communities and other under served populations. Some ofthese initiatives have taken place in Mississippi. The NIH continues to invest in theJackson Heart Study, one of most significant cardiovascular studies of the African-American population. I am also very interested the ongoing efforts of NIH to increase opportunity and expand funding for projects like the Jackson Heart Study, in states such as Mis-sissippi, that have not been traditional NIH research centers and that have lackedNIH research funding are also the areas with a high prevalence of chronic diseases. I applaud the efforts of NIH to address not only the issues of today, but also the issues of tomorrow. Only through foresight and planning can we avert the epidemicsof the future. For example, the NIH has been alert to problems such as infectiousdisease research and the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. NIH has also had the foresight to address diseases that are sometimes overlooked. One of those areas is Parkinson 's Disease, a disease sometimes overshadowed by other more high profile diseases. In fact, I am hosting a briefing next week to sup-port the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke strategic plan todevelop a cure for Parkinson 's. I appreciate your efforts in each of these areas. I look forward to assisting you as you continue your important work. Senator S PECTER . Senator Feinstein. Senator F EINSTEIN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to say welcome to all of you.Particularly for Dr. Klausner, you know this last year on the Na- tional Cancer Dialogue has been very interesting to me. And I havelearned a great deal. I have a statement, if I may, Mr. Chairman, to be entered into the record. Senator S PECTER . Without objection, it will be made a part of the record in full. Senator F EINSTEIN . Thanks very much. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing.The American people put a great deal of hope and faith in the National Institutes of Health. NIH is truly a symbol of our national strength and the world 's leading medical research institution. NIH has produced 93 Nobel Prize winners and I comefrom a state that has world-renowned research entities that work closely with NIH. I have been pleased to work with NIH and this subcommittee to increase NIH funding in recent years, including the 15 percent increase we were able to provideeach year for the past two years. It is a sad commentary that NIH can only fundaround 32 percent of grant applications. Fortunately, that ''success rate '' has gone up since 1994 when it was only 25 percent, but still, the many unfunded grants218 leaves a vast wealth of scientific knowledge unexplored and hundreds, if not thou- sands of diseases and disorders, uncured or untreated. The challenges facing our nation are huge.\u2014By 2010, the incidence of cancer will reach ''staggering proportions, '' with an in- crease of 29 percent in incidence and 25 percent in deaths, at a cost of over$200 billion per year. \u2014 AIDS is now the leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44. \u2014Rates of diabetes and asthma are rising. \u2014Seven to 10 percent of children are learning disabled. Forty thousand babies die each year from devastating diseases. \u2014Our aging population presents formidable challenges, from understanding over- whelming diseases like Alzheimers to helping people have quality of life as theyhave a longer life. I am sure the decision to fund one area means not funding another and that NIH decision-makers must feel pulled in every direction. CANCER CHALLENGES As a co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I have been working closely with the national cancer community for several years and would like today to raise someof the concerns that are brought to my attention. I hope everyone will understandthat these are not intended as criticism of NIH or any institute or individual, butare challenges for our nation as identified by experts. The Discovery to Delivery Disconnect .\u2014Dr. Harold Freeman, Chairman of the President 's Cancer Panel, on March 8 made a presentation in which he expressed his concerns about a disconnect between the fruits of research and routine medicalpractice. He explained that we have made great strides in understanding diseaseorigins, but said we must do better in incorporating research findings into routinepractice. Can we do better? If so, how? The National Cancer Institute is a research institution. It is not a HCFA or Medi- care or health care delivery agency. It was never designed to be a delivery systemfor health care. Even so, can 't we do better in connecting this disconnect? The Unequal Burden of Cancer .\u2014The Institute of Medicine last year issued a re- port on disparities in cancer care concluding, ''Despite scientific gains, not all seg- ments of the U.S. population have benefitted to the fullest extent from advances inthe understanding of cancer. '' In October, the New England Journal of Medicine re- ported on a study of 11,000 lung cancer patients which found that blacks are lesslikely than whites to get surgery for early stages of lung cancer. The study ruledout reasons like socioeconomic status, insurance, and access to care and implied thatthe reason could be a breakdown in the doctor-patient relationship. Unevenness of Cancer Care .\u2014The Institute of Medicine also reported last year that ''there is a wide gulf between what could be construed as the ideal and the re- ality '' of cancer care, that some patients do not get care that is proven to be effective and the problem is ''substantial. '' The study said that having health insurance im- proves access, but it does not guarantee good care. The Declining Investigator ''Pipeline. ''\u2014The number of physician-scientists in on- cology is diminishing at a time when knowledge and discovery are expanding rap-idly. Funding at NCI for investigator training was only 3.1 percent of NCI 's budget in 1999. The number of postdoctoral M.D. trainees in all fields funded by NIH over-all has declined 51 percent of 6 years according to a study in Science. This is exacer-bated by the growth in managed care plans that do not contract with academic med-ical centers where the bulk of research and training are conducted. ''This tragic phenomenon is jeopardizing the future of cancer research discovery and translation and the future of an America in which cancer is a treatable,beatable disease, '' says the National Coalition for Cancer Research. The Salary Cap .\u2014Since the early 1990s, Congress has placed a ''salary cap '' on extramural researchers, those scientists in laboratories, like the University of Cali-fornia. The cap is a top salary limit of $141,300, even though senior scientists onthe NIH Bethesda campus can earn up to $157,000. This cap has the effect of driv-ing talented researchers to the private sector. We should be trying to attract andretain talented researchers to our universities, not create incentives that drive themaway. Clinical Trials .\u2014Only two percent of cancer patients are enrolled in clinical trials and of those, only 25 percent are elderly, even though cancer is disproportionatelya disease of aging and the median age of cancer diagnosis is 68, according to theCancer March of 1998. Last year, this committee asked NIH to send us a reporton identifying barriers to participation in trials and recommendations for elimi-nating barriers. I hope you have good news for us today on that report.219 The American people have said they would contribute another $1.00 per week in taxes for medical research. The public is behind NIH. This is indeed encouragingand I pledge to help NIH meet the many medical challenges that face our society. I look forward to working with you to address these challenges to improve the health and quality of life of millions of Americans. BENCH TO BEDSIDE APPLICATION Senator F EINSTEIN . One of the things that I have become increas- ingly concerned about is the kind of disconnect that exists betweendiscovery and application from the laboratory to the bedside. Somesay it takes 5 years to get from a mouse to a human. Somebody you know well, Dr. Helene Brown of the UCLA Cancer Center, points out that the pap smear was ready for widespreaduse in 1940, but was not really used until 1960. 20,000 women 's lives a year were unnecessarily claimed over the 20 years of thisdelay. My first question to any who care to answer is: How can we shorten this disconnect? How can we get things from the laboratoryto the patient more quickly? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . I think Dr. Klausner will start. Dr. K LAUSNER . Thank you. First of all, Senator Feinstein, I want to thank you for your lead- ership in the bringing together of the disparate components of thecancer community. You have been very helpful. Senator F EINSTEIN . It has been interesting. Dr. K LAUSNER . I think \u2014while I can comment about some NCI programs, I think one of the characteristic changes of the last fewyears has been an acceleration of translation of basic research intothe clinic. Now the speed with which that happens varies tremen-dously, depending upon what it is you are trying to translate. For example, the discovery of a genetic alteration that pre- disposes an individual to a particular disease, for example cancer,can translate rapidly into a useful and useable clinical test. In my own work with a tumor suppressor gene for predisposing an individual to kidney cancer, it took about a year from discoveryfor it to be widely used in clinics to help predict predisposition andto help families make decisions about surveillance and what to doabout this particular predisposition syndrome. For the development of new therapies, it often takes a long time. But I think many of the programs that have been developed withthe new funding over the last few years are actually being devel-oped to speed that transition. Let me give you an example. We established a program about a year and a half ago called RAID for Rapid Access to InterventionalDevelopment. It is sort of a virtual national drug development sys-tem that reaches out to academic laboratories and funds new prom-ising agents to move, we hope, within 12 months out of the labora-tory into phase one clinical trials. And this is really very rapid. We have now a little over a year 's experience with the program. Thirty-two novel agents have been funded. Four of them have actu-ally already made it out of the laboratory, basic laboratories, intoclinical trials, each costing less than about $1 million per drug. It is these sorts of programs that allow us to move things much more rapidly than we had before. And I think there are many otherexamples that all of us can give.220 But I think it really is a characteristic of the new technologies and new programs we are all developing that are aimed specificallyat speeding that transition. STATE OF CANCER CARE Senator F EINSTEIN . Second question \u2014and I thank you for that. And I think you yourself pointed out the amazing extension of lifethat has been achieved through the pediatric model with cancer,where a child with cancer can in fact really be assured throughoutthe Nation of state-of-the-art cancer care. The same is not true foran adult. And what we have found is that the state of cancer care through- out the Nation is extraordinarily erratic. The need for every cancerpatient to have a quarterback physician, for example, I think pref-erably an oncologist, somebody who is able to go through the op-tions with them, see that for their case they have the best possibleoptions, there is no real state-of-the-art care for the adult cancerpatient. What is the institute doing to try to bring that about? And how might we be helpful in that regard? Dr. K LAUSNER . Yes. I see the red light is on. Do I have time to answer this? Senator S PECTER . Yes, Dr. Klausner. Dr. K LAUSNER . Thank you. Well, Senator, you are right. I think pediatric oncology, again, is one of the real success stories of NIH, of actually linking researchto practice. Sixty-five percent of children in this country who are diagnosed with cancer, regardless of their economic status or ethnicity orrace, are treated on NCI-funded clinical trials. And 90-odd percentare treated on NCI-developed protocols. When I say NCI, I mean the protocols are not developed by the institute, but by our fundedinvestigators. This is as opposed to 2 to 3 percent of adults beingtreated on NCI-funded clinical trials. We believe that part of the reason there has been such progress in cure rates for childhood leukemia and childhood cancers, evenwithout the development of major new drug advances, is due to im-proving protocols. One of the things that we have been doing to try to expand this to the adult is to revamp our clinical trial system, to turn it intoa truly national system with a single web-based informative struc-ture that allows any physician to access any of the 1,500 openadult clinical trials that we have in the country. This is new andis just coming on line this summer with a new national clinicaltrials organizational unit. But there is a lot that we need to do to try to open this. Funding is limited but with recent increased funding, there has been a sig-nificant increase in accrual just this past year of adult patients toclinical trials. What does that mean? One example, in a recent adjuvant breast cancer trial, it was predicted to take 38 months just to finish theaccrual. It took 14 months. That means we can ask more questionsmore quickly. It is a direct reflection of the funding.221 There are other issues, and that is whether patients have access to clinical trials; the issue of whether, for the clinical care associ-ated with clinical trials, patients can obtain reimbursement. Senator F EINSTEIN . Can I just quickly \u2014\u2014 Dr. K LAUSNER . Yes. Senator F EINSTEIN . Are you saying then that the only way to as- sure that every cancer patient in the United States has state-of-the-art care is by access to clinical trials? Dr. K LAUSNER . No. I am sorry. Senator S PECTER . Dr. Klausner, you may answer that, but please do so briefly. Dr. K LAUSNER . I do not think that is the only way, but I do think we need to expand the clinical trials to generate more answersmore quickly. And I think there is a variety of ways that we can make sure that the results of the clinical trials and the protocols that are gen-erated, the expert protocols by which patients are treated on clin-ical trials, are more disseminated, whether it was within or with-out a clinical trial. Senator F EINSTEIN . OK. [The information follows:] STEM CELLRESEARCH As an introduction to the answers from the individual Institute and Center Direc- tors, I would state that the potential scientific and medical benefits that may resultfrom research using human pluripotent stem cells, funding and oversight of humanpluripotent stem cell research by the Federal Government has become increasinglyimportant. The participation of government in this research will help ensure thatany research utilizing human pluripotent stem cells is conducted within the federalregulations and very importantly, that the results will be accessible to the public.If pluripotent stem cells are available to researchers, we expect that scientists willbe able to pursue important research in the areas described below. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE Since stem cells have the ability to divide without limit and give rise to many spe- cialized cells in an organism, there are several reasons why may be important tocancer research and to reducing the cancer burden. First, pluripotent stem cells maybe used to treat the tissue toxicity brought on by cancer therapy. Bone marrow andperipheral blood multipotent stem cells (which are more committed stem cells) areused already to restore patients ' hematopoietic and immune systems after high dose chemotherapy. Pluripotent stem cells may have greater potential for returning thecomplete repertoire of immune response to patients undergoing bone marrow trans-plantation, thus contributing to the development of other treatments such as im-mune/vaccine therapy. Other tissues damaged by cancer therapy also may benefitby replenishing their stem cell pools, e.g., injection of pluripotent stem cells into theheart may permanently reverse cardiomyopathy caused by certain chemotherapeutic agents; injection of pluripotent stem cells that have been differentiated into neuralcells may restore brain function after cancer treatment. A second reason why stem cells may be important to cancer research is based on the finding that cancer cells may have certain stem cell properties, specifically, theability to renew themselves. The isolation and characterization of stem cells and indepth study of their molecular and cellular biology may help scientists understandwhy cancer cells survive despite very aggressive treatments. Once the cancer cell 's ability to renew itself is understood, scientists can develop strategies for circum-venting this property. A third and final reason for studying stem cells lies in the field of gene therapy, by which a gene that provides a missing or necessary protein is introduced into anorgan for a therapeutic effect. One of the most difficult problems in gene therapystudies has been the loss of expression (or insufficient expression) following intro-duction of the gene into more differentiated cells.222 Introduction of the gene into stem cells to achieve sufficient long term expression would be a major advance. In addition, the stem cell is clearly a more versatile tar-get cell for gene therapy, since it can be manipulated to become theoretically anytissue. A single gene transfer into a pluripotent stem cell could enable scientists togenerate stem cells for blood, skin, liver, or even brain targets. Applications to can-cer might include engineering replacement cells that are resistant tochemotherapeutic assault or that express antibodies against cancer targets. NATIONAL HEART , LUNG , AND BLOOD INSTITUTE Research using human pluripotent stem cells represents an important opportunity to understand numerous processes in human biology and provides enormous poten-tial for designing new therapies and screening candidate drugs for various diseases.Establishment of human pluripotent stem cell lines for the characterization of thebiological properties and markers of stem cells will allow us to identify various stemcell populations and develop models/assays to predict successful replacement of tis-sue in disease or traumatic injury settings. The identification of factors that controlthese important processes holds great promise to ultimately treat numerous dis-eases that result in human suffering. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH The results from using pluripotential stem cells are enormously important to- wards developing innovative solutions to complex human diseases such as Parkin-son's disease and a number of chronic pain syndromes. The capacity for pluripotential stem cells to differentiate into many different cell types is remarkableand has opened scientific inquiry into a number of approaches to regenerate dam-aged neural and muscular tissues. In addition, stem cell biology in general hasopened new approaches for a number of therapeutic challenges such as soft andhard tissue regeneration. For example, mesenchymal stem cells found in bone mar-row are being used to treat human bone diseases such as McCune-Albright syn-drome here at the NIH. These benefits are but a superficial glance at the possibilities for both pluripotential as well as totipotential stem cell biology. The scientific foundationsare being established and we need critical support to rapidly advance our basic science of stem cell biology into preclinical and clinical trials to address the signifi-cant suffering of so many American people. Stem cell therapies could profoundly re-duce the burden of many dental and craniofacial diseases and disorders such as cleftlip and cleft palate, oral and pharyngeal cancer, and a number of chronic facial painsyndromes. In addition, pluripotential and totipotential stem cell research will alsoproduce specialized cells such as cartilage and salivary cells, which can be used asreplacement for tissues damaged by disease or injury. Examples include the treat-ment of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs), the replacement of skeletal ele-ments lacking or damaged in diseases such as fibrous dysplasia of bone, the use ofcells grown in special natural or synthetic scaffolding materials, and the replace-ment of salivary cells damaged by autoimmune diseases (Sjo \u00a8gren 's Syndrome) or ra- diation for head and neck cancer. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES Human embryonic stem cells hold great promise for advances in health care be- cause they can give rise to many different types of specialized cells that may be usedto replace or repair damaged tissues and organs and for other therapeutic purposes.They can also be used to enhance the development of new medications to slow orarrest disease processes, and to aid fundamental research that can provide impor-tant insights into developmental processes important to the understanding, treat-ment and ultimate prevention of disease. These ''pluripotent '' cells have the unique capability of limitless division and self-renewal, and thus can be maintained indefi-nitely in cell culture. Human embryonic stem cells offer the potential for treating a number of chronic diseases that are within the NIDDK research mission. For example: Type 1 Diabetes. \u2014There is an intense effort under way to understand the genetic rules by which an undifferentiated cell becomes a beta cell of the islet of the pan-creas, which is capable of secreting insulin. Human embryonic pluripotent stem cellsoffer great hope for providing an unlimited supply of insulin-producing cells fortransplantation once the rules of differentiation are known. Liver Diseases. \u2014Attempts at cellular therapy to replace diseased liver tissue are under way. In this case, a cell would need to differentiate along the lines of a func-tional liver cell. Again, a similar set of rules are necessary for this to happen, but223 again the plasticity of the human pluripotent stem cell would form an excellent base for this to occur. Kidney and Bladder Diseases. \u2014Various forms of kidney cells or potential bladder cells also offer the potential to differentiate into highly important tissue specificcells. At the present time, there are a number of studies underway in an attemptto grow bladder cells that could be used to reconstruct a human bladder. Developmental Biology. \u2014There are other examples in addition to diabetes, liver failure, kidney failure, and urologic diseases in which human pluripotent stem cellsmay have a major therapeutic role. It would also be important to try and under-stand the genetic rules of development so that these important cells may be appliedto important therapeutic uses. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES Transplantation .\u2014Research on embryonic stem cells could lead to cures for dis- eases that require treatment through transplantation, including autoimmune dis-eases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosus, and type-1 diabetes. The most feasible example in the short term is to treat type-1 diabetes by trans- planting pancreatic islet cells or beta cells produced from autologous embryonicstem cells \u2014that is embryonic stem cells that are removed from an individual, dif- ferentiated ex vivo to become functioning islets or beta cells, and then transplantedback into the same individual. Although there are questions about our ability to identify stem cells, obtain them in sufficient numbers from older children or adults,and produce differentiated cells, tissues or organs from such stem cells, this tech-nique holds great promise to cure disease. Autologous transplants would obviate theneed for immunosuppressive agents in transplantation, reduce the risks of transmit-ting infectious agents within transplanted materials, and eliminate the risks of post-transplant infection due to global immuno suppression. Moreover, such embryonicstem cells might be used to create a myriad of transplantable cells, tissues, and or-gans. This would address problems ranging from the supply of donor organs to thedifficulty of finding acceptable matches between donors and recipients. Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases. \u2014Embryonic stem cells might be used to treat virtually all primary immunodeficiencies. There are more than 70 differentforms of primary (congenital and inherited) deficiencies of the immune system,which are characterized by an unusual susceptibility to infection and are sometimesassociated with anemia, arthritis, malabsorption and diarrhea, and certain malig-nancies. Almost all of these diseases are rare, and can involve considerable pain andsuffering, numerous hospitalizations, high medical costs, and even death. Becausethese diseases are genetic, gene replacement is an important area of investigationin the search for an effective treatment. Transplanting stem cells that have beenreconstituted with a normal gene might result in developing healthy cells of thetypes affected by the missing or damaged genetic material in the immunodeficiencydisease. Based on research with animals, there is reason to believe that using em-bryonic stem cells as a mechanism to replace damaged or missing genes will haveproliferative advantages over currently available alternatives, such as peripheralblood or bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells. Other hypothetical advan-tages include greater susceptibility to genetic transduction. Ultimately, the hope isfor greater success in transplantation, long-term survival and reconstitution of nor-mal cellular functions. HIV/AIDS. \u2014Research on pluripotent embryonic stem cell transplants could make restoration of immune function a viable option for treating HIV disease. Such trans-plants could regenerate all the components of the immune system that have beendamaged by HIV infection. This includes repairing HIV-induced damage done to thecells and tissues that support immune system development, which would be a re-quired prerequisite for T-cell repopulation. While there are many questions to be an-swered, experiments in animal models point to significant advantages with the useof these cells. Primarily, the embryonic stem cells are easily transduced with newgenetic material, such as anti-HIV genes, so that the daughter cells are resistantto HIV infection. Thus, this combination of gene therapy and stem cell researchcould result in the immune reconstitution of AIDS patients with cells that are re-sistant to HIV. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE The logic arguing for NIH funding of embryonic stem cell research is straight- forward from the perspective of nervous system disorders. Put simply: (1) Stem cellshave enormous potential for treating disorders of the nervous system. (2) Researchon embryonic cells is necessary to realize these possibilities.224 To elaborate: 1. Stem cells have enormous potential for treating neurological disorders. The wide range of possibilities arises because these versatile cells can be used in severaldifferent ways. Plausible applications of neural stem cells include replacing lostnerve cells, replacing glial (supporting) cells, restoring complex nervous tissue, sup-plying cell sustaining chemicals, delivering substances widely throughout the brain,serving in tests for drug screening, and advancing fundamental studies of the brainand brain development. Although much research is needed before human trials canbe safely attempted, animal experiments have already begun to demonstrate thefeasibility of stem cell strategies for Parkinson 's disease, spinal cord injury, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and enzyme deficiency disorderssuch as Tay-Sachs. Stem cell based strategies have also been proposed for severalother neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy and brain tumors. 2. Embryonic stem cells are necessary to realize these possibilities. Although stem cells are present in adult brains, the adult stem cells may not have the versatilityof their embryonic counterparts. There is experimental data showing that embryonicstem cells can produce not only many types of neural cells, but also muscle, blood,bone, and other tissue. There is strong evidence that embryonic cells can survivewhen transplanted and can migrate widely in the adult brain. Embryonic stem cellshave the potential to divide for indefinite periods in culture and offer the possibilityof a renewable source of replacement cells and tissue, but stem cells in the adultbrain are characterized by limited availability and accessibility. Therefore, researchon all types of stem cells must be done to compare their properties and find thosemost suitable for each of the several different potential therapeutic applications. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES Studies of embryonic stem cells would speed important medical advances. For ex- ample, NIGMS has supported research devoted to the development of ''artificial skin. '' Such a biomaterial would enjoy wide application in the field of burn therapy. Initial studies, begun in the early 1980s, has led to the development of a model forcultivating skin cells from burn patients. The method, which is being tested in pa-tients today, consists of combining a biopolymer sponge made of collagen with actualskin cells from burn patients. Conceivably, human pluripotent stem cells could alsobe used as a source of ''skin'' to build such a graft, especially for severely burned patients with limiting amounts of remaining intact skin. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The fundamental question in biology is how a single fertilized egg develops into a complex adult organism with many different specialized cell types performing spe-cific functions. This development follows a program directed by precisely timed turn-ing on and off of many genes. Learning how this process works is basic to the mis-sion of NICHD in promoting the birth of healthy offspring through research onhuman reproduction and development. Since pluripotent stem cells can develop intomany different cell types, the study of how pluripotent stem cells can develop intomany cell types may provide new knowledge of how fertilized eggs develop into orga-nisms. Also pluripotent stem cell research will allow scientists to, among otherthings, direct the development of these stem cells along a certain path to becomeliver, blood, brain, or any type of cells which then can be used in transplantationand for other purposes. Within NICHD 's area of interest, these cells could be used to replace organs or tissues that are defective as a consequence of birth defects. Forexample, one such condition is biliary atresia, in which part of the liver does notdevelop correctly. Human embryonic stem cells could potentially be directed to formliver tissue or to replace the damaged organ and save the life of the affected infant. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE Research into the treatment of retinal degenerations has demonstrated some promising results by transplanting retinal cells and tissues in an effort to ''treat '' animal models of retinal degeneration. However, the results have been mixed andmany questions remain. The immunologic issues governing transplant survival arecomplex and only partially understood. Possible strategies for overcoming theseproblems are suggested from ongoing investigations of the development and matura-tion of the normal retina. Use of pluripotent stem cells could provide an additionalavenue of research to overcome the immunological or other potential problems thatmay be encountered. There is also a significant clinical need for improved techniques to promote con- junctival and corneal healing during disease or after injury. Conventional surgeryor standard corneal transplantation procedures are not consistently successful in225 treating persistent corneal ulcers, chemical or thermal injury, and other diseases that damage or scar the cornea. Recent results involving transplantation of corneal''stem '' cells from the limbus region have shown some promise, but many practical and technical problems are presented by this approach. Transplantation procedureswith pluripotent stem cells could provide an additional avenue of research for facili-tating epithelialization of the ocular surface, reducing inflammation,vascularization, and scarring. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES Human pluripotent stem cell research offers powerful new research approaches for clarifying the complex association of environmental agents with human diseaseprocesses. It also makes possible a powerful new means of conducting detailed in-vestigations of the underlying mechanisms of the effects of environmental chemicalsor mixtures of chemicals. The use of human pluripotent stem cell cultures may allowthe identification of the specific early cell types at greatest risk of adverse effectsfrom exposure to such developmental toxicants as lead, mercury, and poly-chlorinated biphenyls, as well as the mechanism of the toxic effect(s) and the tem-poral nature of future adverse effects in the subsequent cells and tissues establishedfrom these stem cells. There are often subtle effects of toxic exposures on the devel-oping embryonic and fetal development tissue systems, yet these systems are re-sponsible for maintaining strong post-natal health. For example, the human embryoand fetus may be very susceptible to long-terms impairments of immune or nervous system functions from the in utero effects of toxicant exposure. Parkinson 's disease, according to most recent findings, has a strong component re- lated to environmental exposure component for one form of the disease. The natureof the agents and the timing of the exposure remain unknown at present. The useof human pluripotent stem cell cultures will permit screening for the subtle effectsof candidate environmental toxicants and toxicant mixtures on specific cell types inthe developmental stages of the cell lineage comprising the nervous system cells andtissue associated with the brain region compromised by the disease. Such explo-rations may yield powerful insight into the biological mechanism(s) underlyinghuman susceptibility to the epigenetic form of this disease with onset after age 50,as well as the genetic-based ''early '' onset form of the disease. It is possible that the opportunities afforded by human pluripotent stem cell re- search will lead to molecular markers or surrogate or combinations of both that canbe utilized for population-based studies of gene-environment interaction in diseaseetiology. By using the toxicity screening, by human pluripotent stem cell coupledwith DNA micro-array technology and gene expression profiling, it may be possible,within a decade, to construct complex data matrices of gene expression that con-stitute for each possibly toxic chemical a ''signature '' that could provide information by relating that chemical to others of known toxicity. Human pluripotent stem cellresearch offers great promise for use in testing the beneficial and toxic effects ofbiologicals, chemicals and drugs. Such studies will lead to fewer, less-costly, better-designed and more specific diagnostic procedures as well as more effective systemictherapies, not to mention the contribution of enhanced understanding to the devel-opment of strategies for prevention of disease. NATIONAL AGING INSTITUTE Human pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells hold enormous potential for cell re- placement or tissue repair therapy in many degenerative diseases of aging. For dis-orders affecting the nervous system, such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord and brain injury, transplantation ofneural cell types derived from human ES cells offers the potential of replacing cellslost in these conditions and of recovery of function. Human ES cells could providea model for studying fundamental molecular and cellular processes important in theunderstanding of aging and age-related diseases. However, before the full medicalpotential of ES cells can be realized, much research needs to be done on the basicbiology of human ES cells. Pluripotential and self-renewal capacity of human ES cells .\u2014The potential use of ES cells in human medicine hinges on the possibility that ES cells can be grownin large numbers and that they can be induced to form all human cell types. Factorscontrolling the self-renewing ability of human ES cells must be explored and com-pared to self-renewal properties of fetal and adult stem cells. Factors that controlthe pluripotent nature of ES cells, that is, their ability to form various cell typeswhen grown in culture or when transplanted into human tissue must be studied.The role of telomerase and other gene-regulating proteins in self-renewal, cell fatedetermination, and senescence could be examined.226 ES cells for transplantation and tissue repair .\u2014Human ES cells could be used in tissue regeneration therapy in, for example, age-related neurological, cardiovascular,musculoskeletal, and immune system problems. Work in animal models of humannervous system diseases, such as demyelinating disorders and spinal cord injury,has provided evidence that mouse stem cells can survive, differentiate, and givesome degree of functional recovery following transplantation to the affected regionof the nervous system. The ability to use human ES cells in research would allowvalidation of such a cell replacement and repair strategy in animal models of humandiseases. This could lead to potential transplantation of human ES cells into thebrains of Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease patients to replace lost or dysfunc- tional cells in the affected brain regions. ES cells also could be genetically modified to express certain proteins, such as neuronal growth factors, and then transplantedinto affected brain regions in which locations they could provide local delivery of thecritical therapeutic factor(s). ES cells could be used to effect bone and cartilage re-pair in osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, to reconstitute the immune response in age-related or genetic disorders, and to promote muscle regeneration in age-related pro-gressive muscle wasting & strength decline. The ability of human ES cells to gen-erate an immune response following transplantation could be assessed and com-pared to fetal or adult stem cells to see if they could be used to reduce the problemof rejection following cell therapy. The ability to use human ES cells in research would allow intensive studies to be performed to understand factors leading to optimum therapeutic benefit, includ-ing determining the best type of cells (embryonic, fetal, or adult stem cells) fortransplantation and what happens when cells are transplanted into hosts of dif-ferent ages or into hosts with different or multiple diseases. A better understandingof the fundamental, biological properties of human ES cells could lead to their suc-cessful use in cell transplantation and tissue regeneration therapies in age-relateddisorders. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES Generation of replacement cells and tissue to treat diseases Because stem cells constitute a self-renewing population of cells, they can be cul- tured to generate greater numbers of bone, cartilage, muscle and skin cells thancould be obtained from a tissue sample. Equally important, if a self-renewing popu-lation of new stem cells can be established in a transplant recipient, it could effectlong-term correction of many diseases and degenerative conditions in which bone,cartilage, muscle and skin cells are deficient in numbers or defective in function,such as in osteogenesis imperfecta and various chondrodysplasias. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS Pluripotent stem cells research has tremendous potential for developing thera- peutic strategies for regenerating selected populations of cells the degeneration orloss of which causes debilitating disease. Several clear examples include degenera-tion of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas which causes Type 1 diabetesmellitus, and degeneration of a subset of neurons in the brain which results in Par-kinson 's Disease. By age 70, it is estimated that as many as one third of all Americans have signifi- cant hearing impairment that compromises human communication using spokenlanguage. Many of these individuals also have problems with balance, which leadsto falls and limits their mobility. The cause of this loss of hearing and balance ismost often degeneration or loss of hair cells, which are the specialized cells in theinner ear that detect sound and provide sensory input needed for balance. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH Human embryonic stem cells are a critical resource for studies of biological and disease processes, and for the creation of disease models. Human stem cells providea model to study the factors that regulate differentiation, migration, and survivalof neurons and glia in the brain. Because developmental factors are implicated inthe pathophysiology of mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism, etc), it is im-portant to understand the factors regulating critical developmental events that con-trol stem cell fate in the central nervous system. Stem cells hold tremendous prom-ise for the discovery and development of novel therapeutic targets such as growthfactors and other signaling molecules. Stem cells also represent the most promisingsource of cells for use in transplantation therapy. Ultimately, stem cell researchmay provide important insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of mentaldisorders.227 NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE Stem cells can be a valuable resource to drug abuse researchers, particularly those investigating the effects that drugs of abuse have on development. Stem cellscan be potentially used to replace cells damaged by neurotoxic drugs. Using stemcells can also allow us to better determine the more subtle effects of drugs on thedeveloping embryonic and fetal development tissue systems. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM The value of pluripotent stem cell research would be in elucidating mechanisms of cellular differentiation. With this knowledge, scientists would have the potentialto selectively differentiate cells into various tissues. Alcohol is a major source of damage to organs, such as the liver and brain, that may or may not regain function with abstinence from drinking. Development ofmedications that accelerate recovery in organs damaged by alcohol would be a majorbreakthrough. Such an advance would lessen human suffering and the economicburden associated with alcohol-induced organ damage. For cases of irreversibleorgan damage, stem cell research could be used to facilitate generation of new organtissue. The following examples demonstrate the potential utility of this type of re-search to the alcohol field: Reversal of cognitive deficits in alcoholics: Treatment of memory problems as a result of long-term drinking can be problematic because patients have difficulty re-membering instructions from therapists. Although in less severe cases recovery ispossible after 3 -5 years of abstinence, initial treatment is less effective, and patients are more likely to relapse. In the case of Korsakoff 's syndrome, deficits can require lifetime institutionalization of patients. Transplantation of stem cells using appro-priate growth factors may reverse the neurochemical and behavioral deficits inducedby chronic ethanol administration. This approach might ultimately reduce the costsof long-term care. Organ transplantation: Alcoholic liver disease ranks second as the cause of end- stage liver disease necessitating liver transplantation. Given the scarcity of organsfor transplantation, in vitro stimulation of pluripotent stem cells into liver cells andother specialized cells offers the extraordinary possibility of replacement cells andtissues for treatment. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) cognitive deficits: Pluripotent stem cells would pro- vide investigators with a tool to study how alcohol disrupts cellular differentiationat various stages of embryonic development. Findings from this research would con-tribute to the design of potential interventions for FAS. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH The NINR does not perform research involving embryos or stem cells. However, nursing research will benefit from the technological advances resulting from suchresearch. When embryo or stem cell clinical applications involve patient care, nurs-ing research studies will contribute to the science base for health care professionals,especially nurses. NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES 1. Potential for stem cell cure of Type 1 Diabetes versus the present insulin injec- tion treatment. 2. Potential cures for Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's Diseases through embryonic stem cells. NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE The Division of Intramural Research at the National Human Genome Research Institute is using the tools produced by the Human Genome Project, supported bythe Institute 's extramural research program, to study the fundamental mechanisms of development and the contributions of genetic factors to disease. NHGRI investiga-tors have identified the following as potentially promising areas of study involvingpluripotent stem cells: Gene Expression. \u2014The differentiation potential of pluripotent stem cells make them important candidates for studies of alterations in gene expression profiles.Being able to examine the genes that are turned on and off during the differentia-tion process of these cells, using newly developed microarray technology, could sup-ply very useful information about normal and abnormal cell development. This in-formation could have promising application to a whole host of disease areas. Parkinson 's Disease (PD). \u2014PD is caused by degeneration of neurons in the region of the brain, the substantia nigra, leading to severe abnormalities in movement. The228 cause is largely unknown, although in a few rare families with early onset disease, mutations in the gene for alpha synuclein are known to be responsible. As withother neurodegenerative disorders, replacement of damaged nerve cells with stemcells is one avenue of possible therapy. Current experiments using fetal cells for re-placement have provided very mixed results, especially for the long term. One pos-sible explanation for the less than complete replacement is that the cells beingtransplanted are too far along in path of development and differentiation to be ableto take up residence in the substantia nigra, make all the correct connections, andreplace the damaged cells. Using even less differentiated cells, such as embryonicstem cells, is a possible alternative. Gene Therapy. \u2014Almost any genetic disease for which cell and tissue transplan- tation protocols exist could potentially benefit from the application of embryonicstem cells in gene therapy. For example, patients with genetic disorders of the im-mune system might benefit greatly from studies involving gene transfer using spe-cially derived pluripotent stem cells. Studies involving these cells also may be usefulin immune reconstitution or in engineering immunologic resistance by HIV infectedindividuals. Blood Disorders/Sickle Cell Disease. \u2014The epsilon globin gene is expressed only in embryonic red blood cells. This gene recently has been shown to block the sicklingof red blood cells by hemoglobin. Research involving embryonic stem cells could helpanswer questions about how to turn on the epsilon globin gene in adult blood cells and thereby halt the disease process. Stem cell research may also help producetransplantable cells that would not contain the sickle cell mutation. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein. Coming back to the stem cell issue, because that is going to be the subject of major floor debate on legislation which we have in-troduced to eliminate the restriction on NIH doing funding on em-bryos, there has been substantial resistence to eliminating that re-striction on the, I think, misguided ground that we are dealingwith potential human life, when in fact these are discarded humanembryos. It is going to be a real battle, though. And I would liketo explore it for a moment or two. I know Senator Harkin is going to go back to Dr. Spiegel about the potential for juvenile diabetes. But what substance is there to the argument that there are al- ternatives, such as umbilical cords or other avenues of approach toget adequate numbers of stem cells for research? Who is the best person to answer that, Dr. Kirschstein?Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . I think many of my colleagues could, maybe Dr. Fischbach, Dr. Spiegel \u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . Dr. Fischbach, we will start with you, since my red light will be on momentarily, too. Dr. F ISCHBACH . I will be brief. There are many sources of stem cells. And I am optimistic about stem cells from adult animals, butI think stem cells from embryos will also be extremely important.And I would be reluctant to rule out any source. The devastating illnesses that are going to be treated by these stem cells demand that we explore every possibility. Senator S PECTER . Well, Dr. Fischbach, beyond being unwilling to eliminate any source, that really does not directly answer the ques-tion as to whether there would be an adequate supply of stem cellsother than from human embryos. What is it about the embryo which requires its availability for stem cell research to get the maximum benefit, to \u2014\u2014 Dr. F ISCHBACH . At the present time, embryonic stem cells can di- vide and grow outside the body for an unlimited period of time. Soby geometric multiplication, they can provide enormous stores ofcells that can be used medically.229 It is a matter of research in the future to try and transform stem cells from adults, because adult stem cells at the present time donot have that capability of unlimited growth and expansion formedical use. Senator S PECTER . I would request that everyone submit to us a written response as to the utility of eliminating that funding limi-tation. We are going to have a knock-down, drag-out floor battle inthe Senate. We put into our appropriations bill last year the elimination of that prohibition in order to bring the matter to a head. But weknew that we could not get the appropriation bill through withouta filibuster if that remained for floor action. So we removed it withan agreement with the majority leader to bring up a free-standingbill this year. And I have talked to Senator Lott, and he is prepared to do it shortly. But we will need all the evidence we can get as to whythat prohibition ought to be eliminated. YOUTH VIOLENCE Dr. Hyman, I am interested to know what progress has been made on our allocation of almost $900 million to school violence.We took that up, as you know, and you attended one of threelengthy sessions where we brought people in from various dis-ciplines to try to treat school violence \u2014as Dr. Koop said in 1982 as surgeon general, that it is a national health problem. And youhave a very leading role in it. Could you give the subcommittee an update as to what has been done in furtherance of your work and, perhaps to the extent youknow, by the other people we met with where we had that verysubstantial funding allocation? Dr. H YMAN . I will be brief, and I will give you a complete answer for the record. But I will answer in two regards. First, in regardto the research that has been initiated at NIH, including NIMH,and then in some of the cooperation across government agencies,which I think has actually been almost unique in my experience,in terms of research at NIMH, we have been focused on two areas. One is interventions before somebody goes down the wrong road. We have recognized that children with either mood disorders or at-tention deficit hyperactivity disorders that are not optimally treat-ed are at much higher risk for subsequent violent behavior and in-carceration. And we have completed several clinical trials and are initiating new clinical trials in areas to help us understand the best andsafest ways to intervene early for these children. For children who are already engaged in violent behavior, we have also initiated research on optimal ways of diverting them offthis path. And one \u2014just to be very brief, one very important insight, al- though it sounds almost like common sense, is that the final com-mon pathway for a lot of children into either violent or criminal ca-reers has to do with aggregation of antisocial peer groups. And yetit is the practice in the United States to literally create graduateschools for delinquency by having group detentions, alternative230 schools, and incarcerating young children often with hardened criminals. There are interesting data and new clinical trials looking at something called therapeutic foster care in which foster parents aresupported by professionals. And one of the linchpins of this inter-vention is to make sure that these youngsters do not associate withother antisocial peers. And we have evaluations from some initialtrials. And, of course, I do not have answers for you yet, because, based on new funding, we have just initiated some new replication trials. Just to give you a flavor of the cooperation, we have been cooper- ating with SAMSA, especially the Center for Mental Health Serv-ices, also with the Departments of Education and Justice. We havehad several meetings. The Safe Schools/Healthy Schools Program has representation from multiple agencies and I think has some really superb dem-onstrations. It is too early to evaluate, but NIMH is actually sup-porting sort of a research evaluation to make sure that these col-laborations actually do some good that we can quantify and dem-onstrate. Senator S PECTER . OK. Thank you, Dr. Hyman. We will look for a more complete response in writing. [The information follows:] YOUTH VIOLENCE Youth violence is a complex problem that requires complex solutions. NIMH has long supported and conducted research to generate information about risk factors,experiences, and processes that are related to the occurrence, during childhood andadolescence, of aggressive, antisocial, and violent behavior, and associated mentalhealth problems. Broad lessons drawn from this research underscore the importanceof a nurturing social environment in childhood, good early education and success inacademic areas; the prominent influence of peers, whether positive or negative, onadolescent development; and the potential risks of policies that endorse or requireintervention programs that house or otherwise group troubled adolescents. Thisoverview highlights what is known about risk factors for the development of anti-social and problem behavior, and describes various early prevention and interven-tion strategies. Risk Factors. \u2014Tragic events like the shootings at Columbine High School are not typical of youth violence. Most adolescent homicides are committed in inner citiesand outside of school. They most frequently involve an interpersonal dispute and asingle victim. On average, six or seven youths are murdered in this country eachday. Most of these are inner-city minority youths. Such acts of violence are tragicand contribute to a climate of fear in schools and communities. Many studies indi-cate that a single factor or a single defining situation does not cause child and ado-lescent antisocial behavior. Rather, multiple factors contribute to and shape anti-social behavior over the course of development. Some factors relate to characteristicswithin the child, but many others relate to factors within the social environment(e.g., family, peers, school, neighborhood, and community contexts) that enable,shape, and maintain aggression, antisocial behavior, and related behavior problems. NIMH-supported research on risk for aggressive, antisocial and violent behavior encompasses multiple aspects and stages of life, beginning with interactions in thefamily. Weak within-family bonding, ineffective parenting (poor monitoring, ineffec-tive, excessively harsh, or inconsistent discipline, inadequate supervision), exposureto violence in the home, and a climate that supports aggression and violence putchildren at risk for being violent later in life. At particular risk for violence are chil-dren who are exposed to the contributors listed above and who have mental dis-orders such as depression and anxiety and problem behaviors such as early conductand attention problems, and lower cognitive and verbal abilities. Outside of thehome, a major factor contributing to youth violence is peer influence. In the earlyschool years, a good deal of mild aggression and violence is related to peer rejectionand competition for status and attention. More serious behavior problems and vio-231 lence are associated with smaller numbers of youths who are failing academically and who band together, often with other youth rejected by prosocial peers. Success-ful early adjustment at home increases the likelihood that children will overcomesuch individual challenges and not engage in behaviors that place them on a trajec-tory leading to violence. However, exposure to violent or aggressive behavior withina family or peer group may influence a child in that direction. Longitudinal research has begun to identify broad categories of young people who progress to adolescent antisocial behavior, the multiple pathways through whichsuch behavior develops and persists, and the multiple factors that shape this risk.Two specific life course trajectories, called life course persistent, which is viewed asa form of psychopathology, and adolescence limited, which is identified only in selectsocial situations \u2014offer a useful distinction both as a way of thinking about develop- mental knowledge and as a tool for targeting the right interventions for antisocialyouth. Life course persistent individuals begin antisocial behavior early in childhood and continue into adulthood, after their adolescence limited counterparts stop. Lifecourse persistent behavior has been correlated with neurological deficits and patho-logical behaviors, (e.g., impulsivity) which are exacerbated when they are combinedwith stressful home situations. In one study of 13 year olds, individual differences \u2014 such as deficits in sensory, perceptual, and cognitive abilities, including the use oflanguage \u2014were shown to predict participation in crime five years later. One study found, for example, that boys with poorer neuropsychological functioning, especiallyverbal functioning at age 13, were more likely to have committed crimes at age 18than were their counterparts with better neuropsychological functioning at age 13. Gender Differences .\u2014From about 4 years of age on, boys are more likely than girls to engage in both aggressive and nonaggressive antisocial behavior. Much remainsto be learned about the causes of gender differences in antisocial behavior, but ex-perts have suggested that it might be necessary to define antisocial behavior some-what differently for boys and girls. Research has shown, for example, that girls aremore likely to demonstrate social aggression by damaging peer relationships ratherthan by boys ' overt aggression that inflicts harm through physical damage or the threat of such damage. NIMH currently is funding research on the antecedents andconsequences of aggression for girls and boys as an essential step toward developingempirically-based interventions for aggressive children of both sexes. Antisocial Behavior Co-Occurring with Child Psychopathology. \u2014There is strong evidence for the co-occurrence of two or more syndromes or disorders among chil-dren with behavioral and emotional problems. An obviously angry adolescent hasother conditions such as anxiety disorders and depression (as seen in the quiet with-drawn young person) more often than would occur by chance. Research in this areaindicates that very young children with conduct problems and anxiety disorders ordepression display more serious aggression than youths with only conduct problems. Although some available data suggest that conduct problems often precede problemsof depression, the sequencing of these concerns is not entirely clear for youth.Whether depression precipitates acting out, whether impairments and predisposi-tions for acting out lead to depression, or whether there are underlying causal fac-tors that are responsible for the joint display of such problems are unresolved ques-tions. It is very common for youth with conduct problems to also display symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most commonly diagnosed be-havioral disorder of childhood. The diagnosis is made by the presence of persistentage-inappropriate inattention and impulsivity, often coexisting with hyperactivity.This co-occurrence is often associated with an early onset of aggression and impair-ment in personal, interpersonal, and family functioning. Furthermore, academicunderachievement is common in youth with early onset conduct problems, ADHD,and adolescents who display delinquent behavior. Individual Liability and Genetic Factors. \u2014Although understanding of the nature of genetic influences on antisocial behavior is incomplete, research on differences inthe magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on different kinds of conductproblems will contribute to elucidating the developmental origins of antisocial be-havior. Twin and adoption studies indicate that child and adolescent antisocial be-havior is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, suggesting that ge-netic factors directly influence cognitive and temperamental predispositions to anti-social behavior. These predisposing child factors and socializing environments, inturn, influence antisocial behavior. Research suggests that for some youth withearly onset behavior problems, genetic factors strongly influence temperamental pre-disposition, particularly oppositional temperament, which can affect experiencesnegatively. When antisocial behavior emerges later in childhood or adolescence, itis suspected that genetic factors contribute less, and such youths tend to engage in232 delinquent behavior primarily because of peer influences and lapses in parenting. The nature of the child 's social environment regulates the degree to which heritable early predisposition results in later antisocial behavior. Highly adaptive parentingis likely to help children who may have a predisposition to antisocial behavior. Suc-cess in school and good verbal ability tend to protect against the development ofantisocial behavior, pointing to the importance of academic achievement. Parent and Family Factors. \u2014Research has demonstrated that youths who engage in high levels of antisocial behavior are much more likely than other youths to havea biological parent who also engages in antisocial behavior. This association is be-lieved to reflect both the genetic transmission of predisposing temperament and themaladaptive parenting of antisocial parents. The importance of some aspects of par-enting varies at different ages. The impact of inadequate parental supervision, forexample, tends to be more pronounced in late childhood and adolescence than inearly childhood. Evidence from many studies indicates that parental use of physicalpunishment may play a direct role in the development of antisocial behavior in theirchildren. Other researchers have observed that parents often do not define anti-social behavior as something that should be discouraged, including such acts asyouths bullying or hitting other children or engaging in ''minor '' delinquent acts such as shoplifting. Research examining the mental health outcomes of child abuse and neglect has demonstrated that childhood victimization places children at increased risk for de-linquency, adult criminality, and violent criminal behavior. Findings from early re-search on trauma suggest that traumatic stress can result in failure of systems es-sential to a person 's management of stress response, arousal, memory, and personal identity that can affect functioning long after acute exposure to the trauma hasended. One might expect that the consequences of trauma can be even more pro-found and long lasting when they influence the physiology, behavior, and mental lifeof a developing child or adolescent. Peer Influences .\u2014Antisocial children with earlier ages of onset tend to make friends with children similar to themselves. Consequently, they reinforce one an-other 's antisocial behavior. Children who display age-inappropriate levels of impulsivity and hyperactivity (core symptoms of ADHD) are often rejected and thusare more likely to associate with other rejected and/or delinquent peers. The influ-ence of delinquent peers on later onset antisocial behavior appears to be quitestrong. Association with antisocial peers has been shown to be related to the lateremergence of new antisocial behavior during adolescence among youths who had notexhibited behavior problems as children. Socioeconomic Factors. \u2014An inverse relationship of family income and parental education with antisocial behavior has been found in many population-based stud-ies. Across gender and ethnicity, much of the inverse relationship between familyincome and antisocial behavior is accounted for by less parental monitoring at lower levels of socioeconomic status. Studying the impact of communities and neighborhoods on children, researchers have examined three major features: (1) structural and demographic features, (2) ex-posure to situations or events, and (3) community-level processes and forms of socialcontrol. In terms of structural and demographic features, research on the extent to which neighborhoods are characterized by deteriorating housing, overcrowding, greaterpopulation density, and greater numbers of female-headed households consistentlyshows strong correlations with neighborhood crime rates and violence. By living in deteriorating neighborhoods with higher crime rates, children and youth are more likely to be exposed to and witness robberies, assaults, and murders.Experiencing their neighborhood as dangerous, young people are at increased riskfor becoming anxious, depressed, defiant, and/or aggressive. Children who have seenor been the victim of violence are more likely to join gangs and report carryingweapons to school. A newer line of research has begun to examine how community-level processes and forms of social control may be important factors related to youth delinquency.Studies which have examined the extent to which members of the community sharecollective willingness to intervene in youth misbehavior have shown these forms ofcollective social control to correlate with decreased rates of delinquency and problembehaviors. Prevention and Intervention. \u2014NIMH-supported investigators have developed and tested several effective programs and strategies to prevent youth violence at dif-ferent stages of childhood, including programs for pre-school children, which are notdiscussed in this report. In light of the Subcommittee 's interest in inter-agency col- laborations, however, it is noteworthy that the Administration on Children, Youthand Families (ACYF) and the NIMH have awarded several research grants as the233 core component of a new young children 's mental health research initiative designed to develop and test applications of theory-based research or state-of-the-art tech-niques for the prevention, identification and/or treatment of children 's mental health disorders within a Head Start context. Among these are projects to develop screen-ing tools for identifying behavior problems in preschool children, to test the effec-tiveness of research-based classroom interventions for very young children with seri-ous disruptive behavior problems, and to assess the mental health needs of this vul-nerable population. School-Age Children. \u2014Research has found that between 70 and 80 percent of chil- dren with diagnosable mental disorders who receive services are served within theschool system, primarily by school psychologists and guidance counselors. TheNIMH has supported many projects designed to develop, establish, and improveschool-based mental health service delivery systems. These projects range frombroad programs intended to enhance the social and problem solving skills of all stu-dents, to highly specific programs designed to treat children already showing symp-toms of mental health problems. Programs also range from those that intervene atmultiple levels, including the child, parents, peers, and teachers, to those that focussolely on the child. For example, research is developing techniques for teachers tomanage disruptive students. The Families and Schools Together (FAST) Track Program is a multi-faceted, multi-year program designed for aggressive children in kindergarten, starting at age6. A four-site study in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington,FAST Track involves working with the child, the family in their home, and schoolsystem, including teachers. Preschool children at high risk were identified at 55 dif-ferent schools. These children were randomly assigned for intervention or no inter-vention. The children initially enrolled in the study are now young adolescents. Anevaluation of FAST Track found that by the third grade, students who took partin the program showed less oppositional and aggressive behavior and were less like-ly to require special education services than students who did not take part. The Linking the Interests of Families and Teachers (LIFT) Program is a 10-week intervention created for children and families who are at risk for the developmentof conduct problems due to residence in neighborhoods characterized by high ratesof juvenile delinquency. The LIFT Program is a multi-component intervention thatincludes parent training, social skills training, a playground behavioral program,and regular communication between teachers and parents. Following program par-ticipation, students engaged in significantly fewer aggressive behaviors on the play-ground, parents demonstrated fewer negative behaviors during family problem-solv-ing activities, and teachers reported improved student social behavior and peerinteractions. Three years following the intervention, LIFT program students wereless likely than their non-LIFT counterparts to engage in consistent alcohol use, tohave troublesome friends, to have been arrested for the first time, or to demonstrate inattentive, impulsive, overactive, and disruptive behaviors in the classroom. Research-based programs also have been initiated to enhance the skills and knowledge of all children in order to decrease their risk of future emotional and be-havioral problems. NIMH has sponsored the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strate-gies (PATHS) Curriculum, based in Washington State, which teaches children aboutself-control, understanding emotions, and problem solving. The PATHS curriculumhas been evaluated using students in both regular education and special educationclassrooms. Students who received the PATHS curriculum demonstrated betterknowledge of emotions than children who did not receive the curriculum. This emo-tional knowledge is thought to underlie the development of necessary social skillssuch as friendship development and maintenance, anger management, conflict reso-lution, and appropriate problem solving. The research highlighted above is, for the most part, sponsored by NIMH. In addi- tion, numerous components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) along withother Federal agencies have been active in responding to the Subcommittee 's ex- pressed interest in research concerned with developing and evaluating the effective-ness and sustainability of programs aimed at prevention, early recognition, andintervention for depression and youth suicide in school and community settings. On October 28 and 29, 1999, a meeting of investigators with extensive and recog- nized expertise in youth violence research was held at the National Institutes ofHealth Neuroscience Center in Bethesda. This meeting was organized in responseto a request from former NIH Director Dr. Harold Varmus to convene a trans-NIHexpert panel on youth violence intervention research. It was co-sponsored by the Of-fice of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR), the NIMH, the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Instituteon Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), and theNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The Expert Panel ob-234 served that much research has been and continues to be devoted to identifying the multiple risk factors that contribute to antisocial behavior as well as the mecha-nisms by which they operate. The Panel noted that several, often co-morbid, youthbehavior problems (aggression and violence, high risk sexual behavior, and drugabuse) share common risk factors in their development. They pointed out that anumber of these shared risk factors reliably predict behavioral problems and can besuccessfully changed through interventions. The Panel also observed that manyother factors have been identified as important in understanding risk for behaviorproblems but have not been the target of focused interventions. The meeting partici-pants identified future research needs that are informing research activities of theInstitutes. In January, 2000, NIMH joined the OBSSR and several other NIH/IC 's to co-spon- sor a new RFA (OD 00 -005) on developing and testing new interventions to prevent and/or reduce youth violence. In excess of 150 letters signaling intent to respond tothe April 14, 2000 application due date have been received. NIMH and the Center for Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (CMHS, SAMHSA) are issuing a joint program an-nouncement (PA) to encourage research grant applications on services delivered tochildren, adolescents and their families through the CMHS 's Comprehensive Com- munity Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program initiative.Conducting the proposed research at one of the Children 's Services Program sites is a prerequisite for funding under this PA. This PA encourages studies of the effec-tiveness of treatments or services delivered at these sites, the nature and impactof routine clinical practice, and factors related to successful implementation of treat-ments or services, including interventions targeting violent behavior and relatedproblems. On March 30, NIMH staff met with members of the Working Group on Youth Vio- lence Research, a component of the White House Council on Youth Violence. Mem-bers of the Working Group include representatives from the Departments of Healthand Human Services, Justice, Labor, Education, and other Federal entities. TheWorking Group is refining an inventory of federal activities addressing youth vio-lence; to make information on violence prevention and other interventions availableto families, teachers, administrators and others involved in designing and imple-menting programs; and to develop a coordinated federal research agenda on youthviolence. Staff of NIMH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are working closely to coordinate new CDC and NIMH efforts to develop new interven-tions and to implement effective prevention and treatment programs. This coordina-tion has enabled NIMH and CDC to cross-reference and link research announce-ments issued by each agency, which already is enhancing the efficient use of federal research resources in this area of science. Finally, NIMH, CDC, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad- ministration (SAMHSA) are collaborating in a major effort to develop a SurgeonGeneral 's Report on the topic of youth violence. The report, planned for release early in fiscal year 2001, will examine advances in research regarding the occurrence andprevention of violence and interventions for those who engage in violent behavior.In order to raise public awareness about the critical issues surrounding youth vio-lence, the report will provide useful information to help parents, schools and com-munities by identifying potentially effective strategies for ameliorating the risk ofviolence among youth. In addition, attention will be given to identifying approachesto intervention that may be contributing to problems rather than reducing them.This report will be an effective and highly credible means of educating policy mak-ers and the public about the interaction of mental disorders and youth violence. Senator S PECTER . Senator Harkin. TREATMENT FOR JUVENILE DIABETES Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to get back to Dr. Spiegel one more time on juvenile diabetes and stemcells. Again, enlighten me again on what role stem cells could play in the further progress of what has happened at the University of Al-berta. And then give me some idea of maybe some time frames thatwe are looking at.235 Just from my reading, my non-scientific reading, of it, it seems that this may be one of the earliest breakthroughs if, in fact, thedata that I see from Alberta is correct, in terms of using stem cellsto\u2014and this is where my scientific expertise lacks \u2014using the stem cells to regenerate the kind of cells that we need to replace the in-sulin-deficient cells in those who are suffering from juvenile diabe-tes. I think I am within the ballpark of scientific terminology there. Dr. S PIEGEL . Let me try to be concise. To be clear, in the Edmon- ton protocol, stem cells have not been used. Senator H ARKIN . I understand that. Dr. S PIEGEL . So they are using harvested inlets containing insu- lin-secreting cells from donor pancreas. Senator H ARKIN . Yes, sir. Dr. S PIEGEL . What we are both enthusiastic and cautiously opti- mistic about is that we hope this will be successful, because if itis, it represents a long-sought cure for Type I diabetes, juvenile dia-betes. But it will then create an enormous demand and need for sources of insulin-secreting cells, which cannot possibly be supplied at cur-rent donor rates. And that is why stem cells are so absolutely criti-cally important. Because research into stem cells, both the pluripotent type of em- bryonic stem cells that Dr. Fischbach alluded to, as well as onesthat are further along, such as stem cells from the part of the em-bryo that would ultimately lead to both liver and pancreas, under-standing those developments are critical to be able to provide asource for these kinds of transplantation experiments. And one final point: Basic stem cell research could also be impor- tant in teaching us ways to intervene in individuals with Type Idiabetes to get regeneration of their existing stem cells. And thisis potentially an important modality of treatment as well, whichwould be an alternative or complement to transplantation. Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that, Dr. Spiegel. Could you \u2014I hate to ask for more paperwork. But with regard to this area andthe answer you just gave, if you could reduce that to writing forme and just get that to me, I sure would appreciate it. Dr. S PIEGEL . I would be pleased to. [The information follows:] STEM CELLRESEARCH AND DIABETES Type 1 diabetes is a disease for which stem cell research holds great promise. Re- search on islet cell transplantation and stem-cell biology offers compelling opportu-nities for the development of new, innovative approaches for treating and ultimatelycuring this disease. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the inability of the body toproduce insulin, a hormone necessary for glucose metabolism. It arises when thebody 's immune system attacks and destroys its own insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of the pancreas. The result of this ''autoimmune '' disease process is high levels of blood glucose, which are difficult to control with insulin injections. More-over, although treatment with insulin sustains the patient 's life, it does not prevent the devastating complications of the disease. These include kidney failure, blind-ness, amputation, heart attack and stroke. Clinical trials have shown that thesecomplications can be prevented or significantly delayed by maintaining blood glu- cose levels as close to normal as possible. However, achievement of such intenseblood glucose control requires multiple daily injections of insulin or use of an insulinpump \u2014an extremely difficult regimen to follow, especially for children and teen- agers, and one that always poses a risk of dangerously low blood sugars. To address these problems, researchers have pursued alternative approaches to restoring insulin-producing capacity \u2014including research to develop an artificial pan-236 creas, research on whole pancreas transplantation, and studies of islet cell trans- plantation. Formidable bioengineering problems attend development of an artificialpancreas, and while researchers are working diligently to overcome them, a timeframe for success cannot be predicted. Whole pancreas transplantation, while suc-cessful in some patients, is an extremely difficult surgery. It requires lifelong treat-ment with immunosuppressive drugs that can have toxic side effects. Moreover,whole pancreas transplantation does not have as high a rate of graft survival as kid-ney transplantation. This surgery is typically performed only in adults, often in con-junction with a needed kidney transplant for which immunosuppressive drugs wouldalready be required. Islet cell transplantation has several potential advantages. For example, insulin production could be restored with islets alone, which would be a much simpler pro-cedure than pancreatic transplantation. Ideally, islet cell transplantation could beachieved with one or two infusions of cells on an outpatient basis without the needfor chronic immunosuppressive drugs. Until very recently, serious technical prob-lems have been a major impediment to rapid progress in islet transplantation re-search. The two key challenges have been: (1) to keep the body 's immune defense system from rejecting the transplanted islets, and/or causing recurrence of auto-immune destruction of islets, and (2) to ensure that there is a sufficient supply ofislet cells for transplantation. To date, only about five percent of people with diabe-tes who have received transplanted islets along with immunosuppressive drugs havebeen able to stay off insulin longer than one year. Recent scientific developmentsoffer the potential to overcome these obstacles and have propelled researchers tofocus more intense efforts on islet cell transplantation. This therapy is now viewedas a highly promising means of curing type 1 diabetes, especially for children andyoung adults whose disease has not yet progressed to the point of debilitating com-plications. The renewed promise of islet cell transplantation derives from two complementary research opportunities that could overcome the challenges that have stymiedprogress in this field. The first opportunity is the development of new methods formodulating the immune system to both preserve residual insulin-producing capacityand to keep the body from rejecting transplanted islet cells. The second opportunityis the prospect that stem cell research could ensure the needed supply of islet cellsfor transplantation. Together, these opportunities offer unprecedented hope for cur-ing type 1 diabetes. They are also highly consistent with major recommendationsof the Strategic Plan of the congressionally directed Diabetes Research WorkingGroup. The first new opportunity, the development of novel immune-modulating methods, is the focus of multiple research initiatives across the NIH, including NIDDK,NIAID and NCRR. Scientists are making progress in finding ways to both halt theattack of the immune system on its own tissue and to prevent the body 's rejection of transplanted organs and tissues \u2014without the lifelong need for immunosuppression. Following promising preliminary results in experimental ani-mals, clinical investigators are pursuing studies of novel biologic agents that offerthe prospect of modulating the immune system in such a manner that transplantedorgans and tissue are indefinitely accepted by human recipients. Initial clinicalstudies applying immune modulation therapy are being performed in patients re-ceiving a kidney transplant for end-stage renal disease. Later this year, researchersplan to transplant insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells into patients with selectedforms of type 1 diabetes. Of particular promise are studies currently under way by a team of researchers at the Unversity of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. These researchers have developedand are following a revolutionary protocol for islet cell transplantation in patientswith type 1 diabetes. This protocol involves treatment with an antibody to acytokine receptor; rapamyacin; and a low dose immunosuppressant. It is particu-larly noteworthy that this protocol did not use glucocorticoid steroids as an immuno-suppressive agent. In addition to having well-known side effects, such as growth re-tardation and increased risk of osteoporosis, these steroids are also toxic to islets.The researchers expect to report on their results in a scientific journal in the verynear future. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDF) provided sup-port for the initial research in Edmonton. Now, plans are under development to rep-licate this approach, with support from the NIAID, NIDDK and the JDF, at severaltransplant centers that harvest their own islets. To the extent that islet transplantation therapy proves successful, there will be a great need for more islet cells. Currently, the NIH is working to perfect methodsto increase the yield of these cells from pancreatic tissue; however, the ultimate so-lution will be to obtain them from other sources, such as stem cells. In this regard,237 it is vitally important to pursue simultaneous research on two fronts of stem cell biology: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells offer the greatest promise of providing a limitless source of islet cells for treating and curing type 1 diabetes. Embryonic stem cells are called''pluripotent, '' because they have the ability to develop into most of the specialized cells or tissues in the human body. These stem cells can be derived from embryosthat were intended for in vitro fertilization, were not used, and are donated for re- search purposes. Because embryonic stem cells mark the earliest stages of humandevelopment, they have not yet differentiated into specific types of organs and tis-sues. Thus, the possibility exists that these cells could be made to differentiate intospecialized tissue needed for transplantation therapy, such as islet cells. Becauseembryonic stem cells have the unique property of being capable of limitless divisionand self-renewal, they can be maintained indefinitely in tissue culture. Thus, theirpotential benefits for research and medicine are enormous. Another potential source of islet cells for transplantation are stem cells found in the tissues of adults. Although these cells do not have the same capabilities as em-bryonic stem cells, they could prove useful in islet cell transplantation. Adult stemcells undergo asymmetric division, with some becoming stem cells capable of replen-ishing the tissue in which they are located, while others are capable of specializationinto different tissue. Thus, adult stem cells are at an intermediate point in the dif-ferentiation process \u2014beyond the embryonic stage, but not irrevocably committed to a final cell or tissue type. If researchers were able to identify and isolate pancreaticstem cells from adult tissue, it might be possible to direct these cells to differentiateinto islet cells. This possibility could come to fruition as more is learned about thegenes regulating cellular development and differentiation. The ability to use embryonic and adult stem cells as a means of providing islets for transplantation therapy in type 1 diabetes will be critically dependent upon afundamental understanding of the developmental pathways that lead to the forma-tion of pancreatic islets. A workshop on ''Stem Cells and Pancreatic Development '' held at NIH provided evidence of impressive progress in identifying a cascade ofgenes responsible for differentiation of cells from precursors in the embryonicforegut to pancreatic islet and specifically beta cells. Scientists at this workshop alsoreported on progress in identification, growth, and transplantation of hematopoietic,neural, muscle, liver, and pancreatic stem cells. Major recommendations for furtherresearch to permit application of stem cell technology to treatment of type 1 diabe-tes included: 1. Identification of molecular 'signatures ' of stem cells and progenitors in the en- docrine pancreas. Identifying all the genes expressed in the mouse and human pan-creas throughout development is a goal of a major new NIDDK initiative on the''Functional Genomics of the Endocrine Pancreas. '' It is conceivable that some of the genes may regulate cellular differentiation and thus could be used to direct stem cells down the specialization pathway to become islet cells; 2. Generation of monoclonal antibodies to proteins expressed on the surface of islet beta cells and islet cell precursors to use in identification and isolation of pan-creatic stem cells. 3. Identification of growth conditions that permit the proliferation and differentia- tion of lineage-specific stem cells both inside and outside the body; 4. Exploration of the potential use of embryonic stem cells, and tissue-specific stem cells, in the formation of pancreatic islets; and 5. Use of animal models to examine the role of stem cells in the regeneration of the endocrine pancreas. Applying basic knowledge obtained from research in developmental and stem cell biology will enable the production of progenitor stem cells and the rational designof cellular therapies for human diseases such as diabetes. It is essential to under-score that studies of stem cells and the genes that regulate their development couldbe important as ways to intervene in type 1 diabetes, even beyond their use in isletcell transplantation. For example, a more precise understanding of stem cell biologycould lead to methods to activate stem cells and to regenerate beta cells of the pan-creas. Coupling immune modulation treatment to halt further autoimmune destruc-tion of the islets with treatments to activate stem cells to regenerate beta cellswould offer a powerful approach to prevention and treatment of patients at risk fordevelopment of type 1 diabetes. Thus, researchers have attained a very encouraging benchmark with respect to developing new clinical approaches to type 1 diabetes. They are currently pursuinga two-pronged approach involving both immune tolerance and stem cell biology toovercome previous impediments to successful islet cell transplantation. Inducing im-mune tolerance can halt or reduce the autoimmune attack on the insulin-producingcells of patients and help them retain some insulin reserve. In essence, this ap-238 proach provides a ''shield '' to block the autoimmune attack and protect the residual insulin-producing cells from further destruction. The second prong of therapy is islettransplantation-based on novel methods of immunomodulation to prevent graft re-jection, coupled with research on stem cell biology to provide a limitless source ofislets for transplantation. HUMAN GENOME PROJECT Senator H ARKIN . Dr. Collins, on the human genome project, could you again enlighten me, and perhaps the press who is here and thepublic, there has been this big debate about Celera and you andthis race to the finish and their patenting the gene and all that. A lot of people have asked me, well, wait, if you, the human ge- nome project, is mapping and sequencing the human gene, and itis going to be here in another 1 12years or 2 \u2014\u2014 Dr. C OLLINS . We expect to have the finished sequence in 2003, but a working draft will be done in the next 2 or 3 months. Senator H ARKIN . OK. So 2003. And that is going to be available to the public? Dr. C OLLINS . Yes. Senator H ARKIN . All the knowledge, everything, all the mapping, all the sequencing you have done on the human genome. Dr. C OLLINS . Every 24 hours. Senator H ARKIN . All day long. So if a private company has al- ready done that, and they have tried \u2014why would a researcher then feel it necessary to go to a private company to get that kind of in-formation, when they can go to NIH and get that information? Sowhy do I care if Celera does whatever they are doing? As long asit is done in NIH, why should I care? I mean, it would be availableto researchers all over. What is the problem? Dr. C OLLINS . Well, Senator, I appreciate the question, and I ap- preciate this subcommittee 's support of the Human Genome Project over the last 10 years. You had the vision of this project even be-fore some of the rest of the scientific community had caught on.That vision is clearly paying off. We are at a very exhilarating time. Just yesterday we announced that we have crossed the 2 billion base pair mark. Senator H ARKIN . Wait a minute. I was just at the 1 billion base\u2014\u2014 Dr. C OLLINS . Well, there you go. That is right. We appreciated your attending the ceremony in November to celebrate 1 billion. And yesterday we got to 2 billion.It was T, by the way. The second billion bases were capped off bya T. And since the genome is only 3 billion, you can see that this working draft is coming along very quickly. It will require thecourse over the next 2 or 3 years to close the gaps and deal withthe ambiguities that still remain in this draft version. But formany scientific applications, this will be enormously useful. And itis useful to anybody with an Internet connection. I think the parallel that I might try to draw for you is one that is perhaps familiar to people within these halls, and that is theThomas System for keeping track of what is going on with regardsto congressional legislation and other hearing transcripts and soon.239 There is this system, which citizens can go to if they are seeking information about what is happening in the U.S. Congress. And itis available for free to anybody who needs to find it out. There are other more elaborate systems, of course, that you can pay to subscribe to, such as Lexus Nexus or Congressional Quar-terly Search Service, which for the sophisticated user who has thewherewithal to pay for them, are also useful. We think of ourselves as the Thomas System for the human ge- nome project, where the basic information, the raw fundamentalsequence of the genome, and some basic information about what itmeans, which our colleagues at the National Library of Medicineare putting together, is available to anybody in any country, wheth-er in the private sector, the public sector, wherever. As long as theyhave an Internet contact, they can find out what we know rightnow, as of today. But there will undoubtedly be uses of the genome sequence that require a sophisticated level of annotation, of melding together alot of additional information in order to try to add value to thatbasic information. We see that as a golden opportunity for the pri-vate sector to set up, hopefully not one, but many different com-peting databases that interested subscribers can check out and de- cide if they think those are worth their while to pay for. I think that is the solution to what has been a sort of tumultuous enterprise here, that we have the Thomas System, but then wehave these other available, highly annotated versions that peoplewho want to use them can subscribe to, if they find that that meetstheir needs. Senator S PECTER . Let me come back to you, Senator Harkin. Sen- ator Feinstein had some more questions. Senator Feinstein. AIDS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT Senator F EINSTEIN . Thank very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask a question, if I might, about AIDS. The Presi- dent's budget includes a 12-percent increase in 2001 for AIDS vac- cine research. I was wondering if you could describe NIH 's plan for developing the vaccine and, given this increase, if you could pos-sibly be specific as to when a vaccine might be available. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Senator Feinstein, I am going to ask Dr. Nathanson, the Director of the Office of AIDS Research, and Dr.Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infec-tious Diseases, to share their response to that question. Senator F EINSTEIN . Thank you very much. Dr. N ATHANSON . Yes. So let us talk first about the way we are going about developing a vaccine, which I think was your firstquestion. And the second was when we would expect to reach thatgoal. We have a series of sequential approaches which start off with some basic laboratory work on the virus, its proteins and its genes,and then move into animal experiments. And we are particularlyusing a rhesus monkey model of AIDS with a simian virus, simianimmunodeficiency virus, very similar to human. And that can berapidly used to improve the speed of this translation, to test con-cepts much more quickly than we can do in humans.240 And then we move into a further translational effort where we start first with phase one trials, which are safety trials on a smallscale in humans, and then phase two, immunogenicity trials andextended safety trials, and phase three, efficacy trials. And we are expanding at all levels and basically pursuing a number of concepts about how to make an effective and safe vac-cine in parallel because of the urgent need. We have made considerable progress with some of those concepts in animals. And at the present point in humans, there is a phasetwo trial that is an immunogenicity trial of a potential vaccine. Itinvolves what is called a prime to start the immune response anda boost of an additional protein. And the results of that phase twotrial will determine whether that is going to be advanced to aphase three trial. And I think Dr. Fauci might like to comment about that and maybe add something to my comments. Senator F EINSTEIN . As to when we might \u2014\u2014 Dr. N ATHANSON . Well, as to when we will get to the potential phase three trial, this particular product could start within abouta year, if we decide to move forward. It is a product the efficacyof which is somewhat marginal. And therefore, there is some de-bate within the scientific community. In fact, my council happens to be meeting today. And last night we did debate that somewhat. There are different views. And Ithink Dr. Fauci might like to enlarge on that. Dr. F AUCI . The question really is twofold. When will we engage in a trial that will ask the question if a vaccine is effective? Andthen a much broader question that is much more difficult to an-swer is: When will we have an effective vaccine? Because one of the things we need to appreciate is, particularly with HIV, in contradistinction to other vaccine studies for other mi-crobes, it is highly unlikely that the first vaccine trial that we dowill be a home run, where we will have a highly effective vaccine. The situation is a little bit different with HIV/AIDS. When we deal with most of the vaccines that we deal with, namely for child-hood diseases, we will not accept anything less than a 90 or so per-cent effectiveness, because we want to make sure that virtuallyeach and every one of the children that we vaccinate will be freeof getting infected with the organism in question. With HIV/AIDS, we will probably have step-wise gradation of rel- atively more effective vaccines where the first one that is availablemight be in a range of effectiveness that would be unacceptable, forexample, if it were a polio vaccine or a rubella vaccine. And thosekinds of successes would probably go a long way to interrupting thekinetics of the epidemic, particularly in developing countries. For example, if you have a 35- to 45-percent efficacy of vaccine that would be unacceptable for a vaccine that we would use for achildhood disease, whereas that might, if given to populations witha very accelerated rate of infection, might interrupt the kinetics ofthe epidemic to the point that we would have a major positive im-pact. So it is really a complicated question and a complicated answer. We will probably within the next year or so be going into largertrials to ask a question, ''Is this at least partially effective? ''241 But as Dr. Nathanson mentioned, while we are doing that, we will be building up a pipeline of candidates that might in 4, 5, 6,or 7 years from now be much better than the candidates that weare dealing with now. Senator F EINSTEIN . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Senator S PECTER . Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Kohl.Senator K OHL. Thank you, Senator Specter. EPILEPSY RESEARCH Dr. Fischbach, I am pleased that today NINDS is sponsoring a conference on epilepsy. I am hopeful that the discussions at theconference will lead to a clearer strategy for research into this dis-ease. With that goal in mind, I have two questions. Report language last year discussed curing epilepsy, not just finding new treatments for it. What is NINDS doing differently tochange its focus from finding new treatments to finding a cure tostop epilepsy? Dr. F ISCHBACH . Thank you, Mr. Kohl. There is a wonderful con- ference which is beginning this morning and continuing for 2 days,titled ''Curing Epilepsy, '' because the problem is that all of the drugs currently on the market merely reduce symptoms. More thana third of the patients in this country remain burdened with sei-zures at one time or another. There is no single therapy that com-pletely eliminates them. We have expanded our ADD Program, our Anti-epilepsy Drug Development Program, looking for new medications with novel tar-gets, new ways that drugs may interfere with the epileptic processthat have not been explored before. We have developed methods for new modalities of therapies, such as brain stimulation, by stimulating outside the brain and evenwith electrodes placed inside of the brain, in an attempt to disruptand cure epilepsy, defined as complete freedom from seizures andcomplete absence of side effects. So those are just two of the waysthat we have approached it. A third and extremely promising strategy is to make use of re- sources now emerging from the genomic efforts to understand themutant genes underlying more than 50 percent of the cases of epi-lepsy, which should lead to new and better diagnostic and thera-peutic approaches. Senator K OHL. What is NINDS 's strategy for focusing on the pop- ulation with intractable epilepsy? Dr. F ISCHBACH . This is the most difficult of all. And I simply would say that the three approaches I just mentioned \u2014new targets for medicines, electrical stimulation to manipulate circuits in thebrain, and more molecular genetic approaches will be beneficial tothose patients. That is our hope. ALZHEIMER 'S RESEARCH Senator K OHL. Thank you. Dr. Hodes, it is my understanding that some research has shown that Alzheimer 's disease begins to destroy the brain cells of its vic- tims 10 to 20 years before outward symptoms appear. Do we cur-242 rently have the tools to diagnose Alzheimer 's disease in its earliest stages? And if not, what research is being done to develop that ca-pability? Dr. H ODES . Senator, you are correct in that a number of studies have shown that a combination of parameters, including imaging,have been able to identify individuals who are at high risk of devel-oping Alzheimer 's disease a decade or two later. More recent studies, including some to be published this week, have taken a step further in refining these imaging techniques inparticular, and have been extremely good at predicting which indi-viduals are likely, over the course of a 3- to 5-year follow-up, to de-velop Alzheimer 's disease. This has not yet reached the stage of practicality as an interven- tion per se, but has an enormous impact in terms of identifying in-dividuals at high risk. The importance of identifying individuals ofhigh risk is particularly tied to current studies to test an interven-tion designed to prevent progression of disease. So by identifying a population likely, if no intervention is used, to develop Alzheimer 's, we have an opportunity to carry out the critical studies now beginning, to see if we can interfere with thatprocess. JUVENILE DIABETES Senator K OHL. Thank you. Last summer, 9-year-old Lenisha Pat- terson of Germantown, WI, testified before this subcommittee onwhat it is like to live with juvenile diabetes. I also have a short statement, which I would submit for the record and a statement from 14-year-old, Rachel Malz of Wisconsin,describing how diabetes has affected every day of her life. Both ofthese children have asked the subcommittee to promise to remem-ber them and all the children who live with juvenile diabetes. I amone of 55 Senators who are trying to do just that. [The statements follow:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERBKOHL Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I 'd like to welcome you, Dr. Kirschstein, and all of your colleagues who have agreed to appear before the Subcommittee today. As we all know, over the past several years, Congress has provided unprec- endented funding increases for the NIH. I commend Chairman Specter and SenatorHarkin for their leadership in ensuring that NIH has the resources it needs toachieve one of our nation 's most important goals: curing disease and alleviating human suffering. It is both our hope and also our expectation, that this strong investment will re- sult in new treatments and cures for diseases. Not only will this improve the qualityof life of all Americans, it will reduce the need for expensive treatments in the fu-ture by keeping our nation 's health care costs down. I strongly support biomedical research and agree that Congress should continue to provide the funds necessary to make this a reality. However, in addition to pro-viding the dollars, Congress also has the responsibility to ensure that these fundsare spent wisely. We have provided these increases as part of a balanced budget \u2014 but we must not forget that we have accomplished this by making some toughchoices between other health and education programs. It is critical that these trade-offs can be justified by ensuring that research targets our nation 's most pressing health needs. Again, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support of NIH. I look forward to the question period, when we will have a chance to explore these priorities and resultsin more detail.243 PREPARED STATEMENT OF RACHEL MALZ, MADISON , WI Good morning. My name is Rachel Malz and I am from Madison, WI. I am four- teen years old and I was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes when I was only 21months old. I do not remember even one day when diabetes was not a part of mylife. My diabetes has been very difficult to control. I was placed on an insulin pumpwhen I was ten to help control all the ups and downs. However, at the age of twelve,my kidney tests showed some problems, so my doctor started me on an Ace \u2014Inhib- itor medication. Studies have shown these drugs may help keep my kidneys work-ing. As you can see, I am doing all I can to stay as healthy as possible until a cureis found. I need all of you in that room today to do your part and work togetherso it will happen soon. Thanks to you and to Senator Kohl for the opportunity toshare my story. Senator K OHL. Earlier this year we sent a letter asking you to fund more research into this area. I was pleased to learn that NIHis planning to implement the scientific recommendations of the Di-abetes Research Working Group. However, it is my understanding that doing so would cost $827 million in fiscal year 2000, while NIH projects to spend only $525million. I would appreciate knowing from you how NIH will be able to implement these recommendations, given the fact that the re-sources are presently lacking. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . NIH strongly endorses the scientific rec- ommendations of the Diabetes Research Working Group. And Dr.Spiegel and I have had many conversations about this. Within the constraints of the President 's proposal for fiscal year 2001, which was a 5.6-percent increase overall, we provided to theDiabetes Institute a 5.9-percent increase. We will work hard withthe funds that are available and funds that are given to us, to dothe best and most important research possible. I think you heard from Dr. Spiegel how he is deeply involved in some of the studies on juvenile diabetes. He and I both understandthe problems of that disease and feel deeply for those children. AndI would like to ask him to expand on the discussion. Senator K OHL. Thank you. Dr. S PIEGEL . Thank you, Dr. Kirschstein. And, Senator Kohl, I appreciate the opportunity. It brings me back to the chairman 's question. The Diabetes Research Working Group suggests that NIDDK, for example, in 2001 should increaseits spending by $387 million. And within the budget constraints ofthe President 's budget, we expect to increase from $313 million to $338 million. So you see that that falls very substantially short. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are some extraordinary oppor- tunities, specifically in genetics, genomics and in clinical trials forType I, Type II diabetes and obesity, all significant problems. So we are going to do the best that we can within the constraints of the budget, but it is clear that there are extraordinary opportu-nities which we would seize upon, if there were additional re-sources. Senator K OHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Senator Kohl. NCI'S BUDGET Let us try a round to see how this works on the questions that I have posed. We will start with you, Dr. Klausner. You and I have244 talked about this on a number of occasions. Question one: What is the total funding for your institute? Dr. K LAUSNER . The proposed total funding \u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . No. What is the current total funding for your institute? Dr. K LAUSNER . $3.32 billion. Senator S PECTER . And what percent of grants do you award? Dr. K LAUSNER . The success rate for grants will be 30 to 31 per- cent this year. Senator S PECTER . And what is the total number of applications you have? Dr. K LAUSNER . The total number of applications we have had this year is a little less than 4,000. Senator S PECTER . And what percentage would you like to grant, or do you think are meritorious? Dr. K LAUSNER . I think what we would shoot for is about 40 per- cent. Senator S PECTER . And what would the total funding be necessary to make the grants that you would like to make? Dr. K LAUSNER . In order to achieve that level of funding and \u2014and I think this is important \u2014at the same \u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . You do not have to repeat the question. We would just like the answer, because I would like to go around theroom. Dr. K LAUSNER . OK. We would require about a 20-percent funding increase for the Institute to achieve the above success rate. Senator S PECTER . OK. Would you see if you could sharpen that up a little for me on all those questions? Dr. K LAUSNER . Yes. Senator S PECTER . I know we are catching you sort of off guard here. NHLBI 'S BUDGET Dr. Lenfant, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, what is your total funding? Dr. L ENFANT . It is \u2014including the AIDS component $2.025 bil- lion. Senator S PECTER . And how many grants have you made, are you making? Dr. L ENFANT . In this year, it will be 1,050. Senator S PECTER . And what percentage is that of the applica- tions? Dr. L ENFANT . It is 27 percent. Senator S PECTER . And what percent grants would you like to make, if you had adequate funding? Dr. L ENFANT . I will be consistent, and I will say 35 percent is really what we should support. Senator S PECTER . And what kind of budget would you need to do that? Dr. L ENFANT . That would require an increase of approximately 16 percent.245 NIDCR 'S BUDGET Senator S PECTER . Dr. Slavkin, dental, what is your total fund- ing? Dr. S LAVKIN . Our current funding for fiscal year 2000 is $269 million, including the AIDS budget. Senator S PECTER . And how many grants have you made? Dr. S LAVKIN . We project making 157 competing awards this year. In the year that closed, our total was 131. And we anticipate nextyear it will be 127. Senator S PECTER . And what percent of the applications will you be making grants to at the higher figure? Dr. S LAVKIN . We will struggle to meet a success rate of 19 per- cent for fiscal year 2001. And so our \u2014\u2014 Senator S PECTER . And what percent would you like to make? Dr. S LAVKIN . Well, we have been hoping to reach at least a 33- percent success rate. Senator S PECTER . And what total funding would that require? Dr. S LAVKIN . For us, that would require an additional $41 mil- lion in funds for the competing research project grant line. NIND 'S BUDGET Senator S PECTER . Dr. Fischbach, what is your total funding? ISCHBACH . $1.03 billion. Senator S PECTER . And how many grants have you awarded? Dr. F ISCHBACH . 2,000. Senator S PECTER . And what percentage is that to the number of applications? Dr. F ISCHBACH . It is 35. We are close to 35 percent. Senator S PECTER . And what percent would you like to award? Dr. F ISCHBACH . 40 percent. Senator S PECTER . And how much more money would that take? Dr. F ISCHBACH . That would require approximately a 20-percent increase above the $1.03 billion. POSSIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS Senator S PECTER . What do you think you could accomplish with that extra money, Dr. Fischbach? Dr. F ISCHBACH . I think we would do a significant amount more in neuro-degenerative disorders \u2014ALS, Huntington 's disease, Par- kinson 's disease, and Alzheimer 's disease especially. We would fund more consortial arrangements for sharing of resources. Senator S PECTER . We heard that as to Parkinson 's, the answer may be as close as 5 to 7 years. Would you confirm that? Dr. F ISCHBACH . That is the hope, and I am optimistic about that. Senator S PECTER . How about Alzheimer 's? Dr. F ISCHBACH . That is an also extremely promising area of re- search, as I am sure Dr. Hodes would expand on. But with new dis-coveries about enzymes responsible for amyloid deposition, there isrenewed hope for new therapeutic targets. Senator S PECTER . Could you give us a projection on time, if you got the extra money? Dr. F ISCHBACH . On Alzheimer 's disease, I think it is difficult to project that. That is such a complex disorder involving so many dif-246 ferent systems within the brain that I would hope that even pro- longing useful cognitive life by 1 or 2 years in the next 10 wouldbe an extreme advance. Senator S PECTER . Well, would you all write down the questions and provide \u2014I am going to observe the time signals \u2014the total funding each of your units gets, the number of grants you are ableto award with that amount of funding, what percent the awardsare from the total number of applications, what percent you wouldlike to award, and what that would cost? [The information follows:] INSTITUTE /CENTERS BUDGETS The following table summarizes the total funding levels requested for each insti- tute and center (IC) in the fiscal year 2001 President 's Budget request. It also pro- vides the number of new and competing research project grants (RPG) that each ICfunds and the success rate or percent of RPG applications each IC could fund withinthe fiscal year 2001 President 's Budget request. The table also summarizes the success rates by IC associated with funding all new and competing RPGs in fiscal year 2001 at the professional judgment (PJ) level,as well as total costs associated with funding at the PJ level. Professional judgmentbudgets, which reflect each IC 's best judgment of scientific opportunities available, are formulated by each IC without consideration of competing pressures or budg-etary constraints or Administration priorities. NIH believes that each IC 's PJ budg- et represents the IC 's judgment of scientifically meritorious research. As I have noted, the RPG success rate varies among ICs. This variation reflects the difficulty of predicting total numbers of applications as well as the importanceof many other mechanisms in funding each IC 's best judgment of scientific opportu- nities available for support in fiscal year 2001.

May not add due to rounding. Senator S PECTER . I am glad that Senator Stevens, the chairman of the full committee has \u2014Senator, if I may have Senator Stevens ' attention. He came in just at the point where we were inquiring of this dis- tinguished group of scientists what funding they would like tomake awards on the meritorious grants. And that is a good placefor the chairman of the full committee to come in. We do not have the answers, but I will provide them to you, Sen- ator Stevens. And I will also give you the floor at this time. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TED STEVENS Senator S TEVENS . Well, thank you very much. And I am sorry to just barge in. We have a whole series of subcommittees meetingtoday, and I do like to stop in on each one and thank the peopleinvolved for their participation. I do think that we have a very tight budget this year. But I also think \u2014and I have been making speeches throughout the country on the conclusion I have reached, really. And that is that this group, NIH, represents an investment in the future that, from a strictly conservative point of view, we oughtto increase the investment now to assure that you are \u2014that we are capable of dealing with the vast problems that will come to ourcountry when the baby-boomer generation retires. If we have the same degree of diseases in their generation as exist in my generation, there is going to be a skyrocketing cost thatthe budget just cannot absorb. Though we are on the verge of so many breakthroughs, I think the number one and most important investment we can make thisyear\u2014and I am chairman of the Defense Subcommittee \u2014is not in defense, but is in accelerating the research and bringing about thedevelopments and perfecting the application of some of the break-throughs we already have. And I am \u2014once again, Mr. Chairman, I am still ready to do bat- tle. We are going to continue to be on the course that we are on,and that is: We are going to try to continue our process that will,within 5 years, double the amount of money that is available forresearch in NIH.248 Now, that is the commitment you made and, I think, we all made when we voted on that resolution. I take this resolution very seri-ously. Having said that, though, I do think that we have to find some way to really make certain that this money is really going to re-search and not necessarily to bricks and mortar. I am a little slowabout the bricks and mortar side of the budget. I think the most important thing we can do now is accelerate this research and put it in the hands of our most competent people,and make sure that we get, to the maximum extent possible, thebreakthroughs we need so we can reduce those future costs. Thatis the investment that I think we should make. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.Senator S PECTER . See how good Senator Stevens ' timing is? He came in at just the right moment. That is a pretty good commit-ment from the chairman. Senator S TEVENS . Thank you. Senator S PECTER . Thank you for that, Senator Stevens. Senator Harkin. GENE SEQUENCING Senator H ARKIN . That is a good commitment. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Collins, I just want to wrap up this issue on the genome. I read the statement put out by Prime Minister Blair and PresidentClinton, statements made at the following press conference by youand Dr. Lane. I just want to make it clear. Since I have been involved in this from the beginning, I just want to make it clear again where Ithink we ought to be headed in this. And I want to make it clearto the press that is here, too. That raw fundamental data on the sequencing of the human gene or any parts thereof should never be patentable. If a privatesector company wants to get patents, I believe that company shouldtake that raw available data, conduct experiments like they wouldfor any other drug, and if experiments prove that it has applicationthat a certain piece of gene would produce a disease-related pro-tein, for example, and they can prove that through experimen-tation, and valid experimentations, then I have no problem with apatent at that point. But it is my belief that we have put a lot of public money into this globally, and that this raw data ought to be available to anyresearcher anywhere free of charge. And if companies want to seek to try to influence the Patent Of- fice, well, we have something to say about that here legislatively,too. The Patent Office is a creature of the U.S. Congress. I knowthat they have had their comment period closed on March 22. AndI am hopeful that they will be issuing guidelines along that path-way. But I have been quite upset, quite frankly, at some of the private companies who have indicated by filing thousands of patent re-quests, thousands of them, and they have not conducted one experi-ment, and they have tried to get a patent on those. I think that249 is not in the public interest. And I believe that \u2014I do not think that those patents ought to be issued. So I just wanted to state for the record where I hope this is head- ed. If you have any further comments, I would welcome it. If not,you do not have to make a comment. Dr. C OLLINS . Senator, I think you have expressed the issue very clearly. NIH has taken a position on the patenting issue, which isquite close to yours, namely that sequence information in the ab-sence of any functional data about what that particular gene doesought not to be the subject of \u2014\u2014 Senator H ARKIN . Functional data means data based upon ade- quate experimentation. Dr. C OLLINS . That is right. Whereas a circumstance where such data does exist and is compelling, that puts this sort of a gene pat-ent application in the same category as other types of patent appli-cations and ought to be seriously considered. METHAMPHETAMINE Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that. I said I had a couple of other questions here, but I may have to ask for those in writing. One hadto do with methamphetamine because of the big problem in theMidwest. Methamphetamine, not only can we cut the supply, butthe demand is a problem. And we find that this is a very addictivedrug. I just wanted to ask Mr. Millstein what the Institute is doing on research on meth and possible treatment options. I have looked atthis quite a bit, and it just seems like we are not getting very far.But maybe you have some knowledge that I do not know about. Mr. M ILLSTEIN . Thank you, Senator Harkin. As you are well aware because you personally were involved in the town meetingthat NIDA sponsored in 1998 in Des Moines \u2014\u2014 Senator H ARKIN . Right. Mr. M ILLSTEIN [continuing]. We used that as the kickoff for the methamphetamine initiative. Our community epidemiology workgroup, which is an early alert system, had shown tremendous in-creases in use in rural areas, including Iowa. We had that kickoff specifically in Des Moines with your involve- ment, with the Governor 's involvement and State health depart- ment, to talk about what we know, about public education, preven-tion and treatment. Since that time, we have made methamphetamine research sup- plements. We have already found out more about methamphet-amine and violence, methamphetamine and heart disease, meth-amphetamine and brain damage. Because methamphetamine is a stimulant, we were able to pick up on some of the clinical trials that we have been conducting forcocaine in methamphetamine-using individuals, and currently areconducting clinical trials on five different potential medications, Ty-rosine, Fluoxitine, Asertraline, Desipramine, and Isridapine. We are really hopeful that because we were able to move quickly, that soon we will have some kind of answers and be able to usethat knowledge to apply to treatment populations, as well as inprevention.250 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that, because it seems that \u2014well, my time is up. Just one last thing I would ask Dr. Kirschstein \u2014Dr. Klausner, I wanted to talk to you about some things. But there is a list I have here from NIH talking about the total number of dollars spent in complementary and alternative medi-cine, not just in NCAM but in all of the institutes. It totals about$160.7 million estimate for fiscal year 2000; NCI, $38.4 million;and others. I would like to have a little bit further breakdown about what that all is for, what is happening in these areas, and how these dif-ferent offices are correlating with NCAM on this type of research.I will not bore you, but just if you could give it to me. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . We would be pleased to provide that. [The information follows:] FUNDING FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Each NIH Institute and Center (IC) has designated a liaison for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to provide scientific input to, and facilitate coordi-nation with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine(NCCAM). NCCAM established the Trans-Agency CAM Coordinating Committee,which serves as a forum for facilitating research collaboration and coordination, notonly across the NIH, but across other major Federal health research entities as well.The committee met on May 20, 1999; November 16, 1999; and April 6, 2000. Mem- bership of the committee includes: \u2014the NIH IC CAM liaisons; \u2014representatives of several OD Offices [Office of AIDS Research (OAR), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR), Office of Dietary Supple-ments (ODS), Office of Rare Diseases (ORD), Office of Research on MinorityHealth (ORMH), and Office of Research on Women 's Health (ORWH)]; and \u2014liaisons from a number of other Federal Agencies [Agency for Healthcare Re- search and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Services Adminis-tration (HRSA), Indian Health Service (IHS), Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA), U.S. Department of Education (ED), U.S. Department of Defense(DOD), U.S. Department of Veterans ' Administration (VA), and the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy]. Prior to the establishment of NCCAM, the ICs collaborated with the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) on a number of activities, which included adminis-tration of OAM-supported research projects. Below, each of the ICs have providedexamples of their current research collaborations with NCCAM and descriptions oftheir own CAM research portfolios. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE NCI's research portfolio includes diverse activities performed in many venues in- cluding: Comprehensive Cancer Centers, clinical trials performed by the CooperativeGroup and Community Clinical Oncology Programs and research projects performedby scientists at a variety of other academic institutions and corporations. Followingare examples of research activities supported by NCI in complementary and alter-native medicine: Examples of CAM Clinical Trials 1. Phase III randomized trial of patients with prostate cancer to study the effect of a diet low in fat and high in soy, fruits, vegetables, green tea, vitamin E and fiberon prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. 2. Phase II trial of patients with prostate cancer to study the effects of dietary soy on biomarkers of prostate cancer. 3. Phase I and II trials using formulations of the active components from green tea. Patient accrual began in December, 1999.251 Examples of CAM Grants supported by NCI 1. Dietary Tomato Products and Experimental Prostate Cancer 2. Cohort Study of Dietary Supplements and Cancer Risk3. Inhibition of Prostate Cancer Cell Growth by Vitamin D4. Feasibility of Physioacoustic Therapy in Cancer Care5. Mechanisms of Dietary Modulation of Melanoma Invasion6. Menopausal Symptom Relief for Women with Breast Cancer CAM Practice Assessment Program 1. Best Case Series Program \u2014solicits and reviews case report data of complemen- tary and alternative medicine therapies that are felt by their practitioners to be ef-fective cancer therapies, and presents case series to the Cancer Advisory Panel forComplementary and Alternative Medicine. 2. Practice Outcomes Monitoring and Evaluation (POMES) projects \u2014a process used to follow-up on promising Best Case Series reviews. In the pilot project, wewill evaluate outcomes at the P Banerji Homeopathic Research Foundation clinicsin Calcutta, India using contract support to monitor new lung cancer patients andobtain documentation and follow-up of 30 -50 new lung cancer patients for 12 -18 months. CAM Citation Database .\u2014A project to explore the feasibility of augmenting the cancer component of the existing NCCAM CAM Citation Index versus establishingan independent NCI controlled cancer CAM research database. This database willbecome a resource for NIH and extramural investigators interested in CAM re-search and will include articles and abstracts from many databases includingMedline or Web of Science. The database will serve as a resource for NIH and extra-mural investigators interested in CAM research. The Director of NCI 's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) meets with the Director of the NCCAM every two weeks to discuss ongo-ing and new collaborative projects. Also several other projects funded by the NCI(e.g. the OCCAM Website, the Practice Outcomes Monitoring and Evaluation Sys-tem project in Calcutta India, the NCI 's Best Case Series Program) are discussed at these meetings. The Cancer Advisory Panel for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAPCAM) was jointly constructed by the NCCAM and the NCI to (1) review andevaluate summaries of evidence for CAM cancer claims submitted by practitioners,(2) make recommendations to the NCCAM on whether and how these evaluationsshould be followed up, and (3) be available to observe and provide advice about stud-ies supported by the NCCAM and NCI, and about communication of the results ofthose studies. The Panel 's membership is drawn from a broad range of experts from the conventional and CAM cancer research and practice communities. The organiza-tion meeting for the CAPCAM was held November 1998. The panel was subse-quently chartered and is authorized to meet at least twice a year. The first meetingof the chartered panel was held July 1999. For fiscal year 2000, one CAPCAM meet-ing was held in December 1999 and a second one is scheduled for late summer,2000. NATIONAL HEART , LUNG , AND BLOOD INSTITUTE NHLBI has had a long standing interest in complementary and alternative medi- cine for heart, lung and blood diseases and has been collaborating with the Office and now the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine since itsinception. Because of the elevation of NCCAM to the Center status, most researchgrants initially funded by NCCAM and managed by NHLBI, have been reassignedto NCCAM. Currently, NHLBI has a few primary applications, but has secondaryassignment on most new applications related to heart, lung and blood diseases. Inaddition to grant support, NHLBI has been involved in the following joint activities: 1. NHLBI is a co-sponsoring Institute for a PA ''Acupuncture Clinical Trial Pilot Grants '', issued by NCCAM in 1998. Several grants have been funded by NCCAM. 2. A workshop on the ''Complementary & Alternative Medicine in Cardiovascular, Lung and Blood Research '', jointly sponsored by NHLBI and NCCAM, is scheduled for June 12 -13, 2000, to be held in Bethesda. 3. NHLBI and NCCAM jointly sponsor an RFA to encourage studies to assess the efficacy of CAM, including acupuncture, herbal remedies, homeopathy and magne-sium supplement, in allergic disease and asthma. 4. NHLBI cosponsors an RFA on the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study with NCCAM and plans to provide funding in fiscal year 2000.252 5. NHLBI continues to serve on a Trans-NIH Coordinating Committee on Com- plementary & Alternative Medicine. This group reviewed planned activities, helpedto prioritize initiatives, and offered other possible scientific directions to consider. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH In fiscal year 1999, NIDCR funded a variety of research classified as ''Complemen- tary and Alternative Medicine ''. The majority of this funding was associated with research projects that addressed treatment of pain associated withtemporomandibular joint disorders. NIDCR has worked with NCCAM to help develop their research portfolio. For ex- ample, Institute staff participated with NCCAM in the development of the Requestfor Applications for CAM Centers, which stimulated the project P50 AT/DE00076(White/Kaiser Research Foundation-Craniofacial Complementary and AlternativeMedicine Center). In addition, NIDCR staff vigorously encouraged oral health re-searchers to prepare CAM Center proposals, through contacting investigators, sug-gesting potential collaborations, and disseminating information on the CAM CenterRFA at scientific meetings and in newsletters. Similarly, NIDCR staff identified opportunities to stimulate acupuncture research within pain research activities being conducted at the University of Maryland,where several physicians and neurophysiologists originally trained in China wereinitiating their scientific careers under the mentorship of a world-recognizedneurophysiologist-dentist. The resulting project, funded by NCCAM, used a dental(third molar extraction) pain model to compare patients ' post-operative pain relief after being given standard analgesics, sham acupuncture, or real acupuncture. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES The NIDDK is supporting research on several alternative or complementary medi- cine strategies and has interest in their efficacy and safety and in understandingtheir mechanisms of action and interaction. Work on biofeedback is supported.There is close collaboration with the NIH National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine (NCCAM). Some specific examples include: (1) Herbal Therapy for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): The NIDDK and the NCCAM are jointly funding a clinical trial on the efficacy of saw palmetto, over the period of August1999 through July 2002; (2) Placebo Effect : A trans-NIH workshop initiated by NIDDK, and jointly with the NCCAM, is planned for November 20 -21, 2000. The purpose of this workshop is to develop a research agenda for placebo studies, andprepare background papers summarizing the current status; (3) Herbal Therapy for Liver Disease : The NIDDK and NCCAM will co-sponsor a Request for Applications (RFA) that would develop a standardized preparation of milk thistle for clinicalstudies of liver disease. In addition, the NIDDK held a workshop on ''Complemen- tary and Alternative Medicine in Chronic Liver Disease, ''on August 22 -24, 1999, with support from the NCCAM and the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). (4)Chromium and Vanadium in Diabetes : In November 1999 the NIDDK co-sponsored a meeting with the ODS on ''Diabetes and Chromium: Formulating a Research Agenda. '' The workshop concluded that trials to assess efficacy and studies to define cellular mechanisms are needed. In 1992 the NIDDK issued an RFA to solicit re-search on vanadium; several laboratories are investigating its effect on glucose me-tabolism. (5) Botanical Research Centers : The Nutrition Branch of NIDDK has indi- cated interest in participating in a Request for Applications for Botanical ResearchCenters. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE NINDS funds 3 research grants in the area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research. These include a clinical trial on vitamin intervention for stroke prevention and two grants on the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy. Brief summaries of these grants follow:Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention .\u2014This is a multi-center double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether the administration of amultivitamin with high dose folic acid, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin, togetherwith best medical management and risk factor modification, can reduce the inci-dence of recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a firstnondisabling stroke who also have elevated homocyst(e)ine levels. This is based onevidence that homocyst(e)ine is a risk factor for atherothrombotic disease (and maybe involved in the disease etiology), and that elevated homocyst(e)ine levels can bereduced by vitamin supplementation. Such an intervention has the potential to bean inexpensive and safer alternative for preventing recurrent stroke and MI, ascompared to current warfarin or ticlopidine therapy.253 Efficacy of the Ketogenic Diet \u2014A Blinded Study .\u2014This is a blinded placebo-con- trolled study of the high-fat-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet to treat children withLennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a refractory form of epilespy characterized by atonic-myoclonic seizures. Preliminary evidence suggests that the ketogenic diet is highlyeffective in reducing seizure frequency. The study will test both the initial efficacyof the diet (after 5 days) and whether seizure reduction can be maintained over alonger period of time (after 6 months on the diet). Ketogenic Diet and Brain Amino Acid Metabolism .\u2014This study is investigating the mode of action of the ketogenic diet in a rat model. The hypothesis is that theketone bodies produced as part of the diet reduce the rate of transamination of glu-tamate to aspartate. This has the effect of reducing brain concentrations of aspartate, which is excitatory, while increasing brain concentrations of GABA,which is inhibitory. This is being studied in rat pups being fed the ketogenic diet.In addition, the efficacy of the ketogenic diet to reduce seizures in a rat model ofepilepsy is also being studied. NINDS is a member of the newly formed trans-NIH CAM Coordinating Com- mittee, which meets regularly to identify opportunities for trans-Institute collabora-tion on activities and initiatives related to CAM. In addition, NINDS staff haveworked closely in the past with NCCAM staff on several joint initiatives, includinga Request for Applications (RFA) for Centers for Mind/Body Interactions andHealth, and another RFA for Centers for Complementary and Alternative MedicineResearch. An NINDS staff liaison also regularly attends study section (i.e., peer re-view) meetings of neurology related CAM grants. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES The NIAID supports complementary and alternative research efforts in areas that coincide with its own research priorities. The Institute expects to spend $8 millionin this area in fiscal year 2000, and the following research examples reflect NIAID 's interest in pursing research advances in its own targeted areas of research, withthe help of complementary and alternative medicine. \u2014The NIAID is supporting research on Siberian Ginseng at the University of Iowa. Investigators are examining the use of Siberian Ginseng for the treatmentof chronic fatigue syndrome, and evaluating whether subjects with idiopathicchronic fatigue will respond to Siberian Ginseng, a widely recommended herbfor the treatment of fatigue. \u2014The NIAID is supporting research at the University of Cincinnati to determine the impact of dietary supplements on kidney graft survival and incidence andseverity of post-transplant adverse events. To date, this pilot study has enrolled20 patients and has shown a 77 percent reduction in the number of recipientshaving an acute rejection, leading to a 50 percent reduction in the number ofbiopsies for renal dysfunction. In addition, a significant reduction in the numberof post-transplant infectious complications was also observed. \u2014An international workshop, The Importance of Omega -3 Fatty Acids in the At- tenuation of Immune-Mediated Diseases , will be co-sponsored by the NIAID, the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and the National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine, and will be held in fiscal year 2000. The primary goalof this workshop is to establish research plans for definitive, mechanisms-based,preclinical studies and clinical trials to elucidate the mechanisms wherebyomega -3 fatty acids attenuate immune-mediated diseases. Fish and other ma- rine life are rich sources of a special class of polyunsaturated fatty acids knownas the omega -3 or n -3 fatty acids. Reports suggest that dietary omega -3 fatty acids may have potent anti-inflammatory activities in inflammatory disorderssuch as transplant rejection, autoimmune and allergic diseases. The workshopwill include investigators from the United States and other countries, who willparticipate in the discussions to review the current knowledge and clinical trialresults. Further discussions will focus on setting research priorities and formu-lating research plans to accelerate focused studies in this area. The workshopproceedings will be published, and proposed initiatives for new preclinical stud-ies and clinical trials will be developed for funding consideration by NIH Insti-tutes and Centers. \u2014The NIAID is providing funds to the University of California, Davis, to develop the Asthma-Alternative Medicine Center. The Center will serve as a U.S. andinternational resource to assist alternative medicine practitioners and research-ers in identifying potential treatments and for developing protocols to evaluatethe efficacy of unconventional medical practices using nutrition, ethnomedicine,and immunopharmacology for the treatment of asthma. The Center will includestudies on: the effect of vitamin C on pulmonary function and quality of life on254 patients with mild asthma; oral immunotherapy of grass pollen allergy using wheatgrass juice; and the influence of botanical and glandular extracts oncytokine biosynthesis and cytotoxicity. It is customary for staff at the NIAID to interact with staff at the NCCAM on complementary and alternative medicine disciplines. For example, the NIAID pro-gram staff will consult with the NCCAM program staff about grant applications thatcut across both the Institute and the Center. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) spon- sors a variety of research projects to study complementary and alternative medicine(CAM). These span the life cycle, and include studies to: investigate the use of yogato improve the pulmonary function in asthmatic women during pregnancy; evaluatethe use of supportive birth companions and soft infant carriers to foster parentingskills and maternal/infant attachment; and test the hypothesis that muscle strengthimprovement in the elderly depends more on mental effort than training intensity.The latter has implications in rehabilitation of stroke victims. Other studies focuson pain management. One such study evaluates cognitive-behavioral treatments forpain reduction (relaxation training, parent education, stress management and ther-mal biofeedback) in children with recurrent migraines or abdominal pain. Anotherlooks at the effects of manual therapies combined with specific exercises to treatchronic back pain. A third studies the effects of antioxidants (Vitamins C and E)on the pathogenesis of endometriosis, a disorder that inflicts pain and may causeinfertility in women. The NICHD has a representative on the NCCAM Trans-Agency Coordinating Committee, who attends NCCAM 's regular meetings, participates in discussions of joint initiatives, strategic planning and collaborative workshops. In addition, theNICHD staff administers several large center grants in collaboration with NCCAMto evaluate the effectiveness of CAM therapies, for conditions within the mission ofthe NICHD, and teach research methods and provide clinical research training andmentoring programs to clinicians who employ CAM. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE In fiscal year 1999 NEI-supported complementary and alternative medicine re- search that was principally focused on the role of nutrition and dietary supplementson prevention and treatment of progressive blinding eye diseases such as maculardegeneration and cataract. Specifically, researchers are investigating the role gluta-thione, an antioxidant, has for protecting the retinal pigment epithelium fromoxidative stress. This research may advance our understanding of the pathogenesisof Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) and provide information for the de-velopment of treatments for ARMD. Researchers supported by the NEI are also con-ducting an epidemiological study to evaluate the relationship between nutritionalfactors and ARMD in the United States, and the results of this research will be use-ful for the development of future clinical trials on nutritional intervention of thisblinding disease. The NEI also supported research on the biochemistry and pharma-cology of macular carotenoids. This research will investigate the biochemical proc-esses responsible for the specific deposition of lutein and zeazanthin in the maculawith special emphasis on the search for potential carotenoid-binding proteins. Theresults of this study will provide new insights on the uptake of lutein andzeazanthin into the macula, and may lead to the development of therapies that takeadvantage of these uptake systems to retard or prevent blindness resulting frommacular and other retinal degenerative diseases. The NEI also funded research onthe use of antioxidant supplements on the prevention of cataract progression. Addi- tionally, the NEI reports to NCCAM on studies of the impact of dietary supplementson vision and visual disorders. NEI staff participate in NCCAM workshops. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has several ob- jectives regarding complementary and alternative medicine: \u2014Assess toxicity of common herbal preparations, particularly their ability to cause reproductive, neurological and immunological toxicity \u2014Assess the health consequence of long-term, chronic use of herbal preparations. \u2014Define herb/herb and herb/drug interactions, particularly in sensitive sub- populations. \u2014Identify the molecular basis of herbal efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, the NIEHS, in conjunction with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), will design and initiate studies to identify and characterize possible adverse255 health effects that may be associated with prolonged use or higher doses of some of the most popular medicinal herbs, including aloe vera, NIEHS sponsored a workshop called International Workshop to Evaluate Re- search Needs on the Use and Safety of Medicinal Herbs with the NTP; NIH 's Office of Dietary Supplements and its Office of Research on Women 's Health; the Depart- ment of Health and Human Services ' Office of Disease Prevention and Health Pro- motion; the Food and Drug Administration 's Office of Special Nutrition; and the So- ciety for the Advancement of Women 's Health Research. Currently, medicinal herbs are not subject to testing requirements for effective- ness or safety. This workshop succeeded in bringing together an international panelof experts to discuss necessary research to address public health concerns relatedto their use. In follow-up to this workshop, the NIEHS and NTP are working withNCCAM, the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, FDA, the academic community,and others to further define and implement research that addresses deficiencies inour knowledge about herbal medicines and their potential toxicities. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING In fiscal year 1999, NIA funded a variety of areas related to complementary and alternative medicine including: investigations of the effects of culture and ethnicityon health care practices and treatment choices for diseases such as cancer and HIV infection; the use of phytoestrogens instead of estrogen replacement therapy for theprevention of menopausal symptoms and bone loss; the use of vitamin E to preventatherosclerosis, cognitive decline in women, and infection; the effects of religion onhealth; and the use of tai chi to prevent falls. The Director, NCCAM has met with the Director, NIA, individually, and with NIA senior scientific program staff at a special meeting to discuss areas of potential sci-entific collaboration. An NIA staff person serves as an official NIA liaison toNCCAM to work on collaborative activities including the development of a con-ference on the placebo effect. Other specific areas of collaboration that are beingpursued in fiscal year 2000 include the addition of a set of questions on the use ofcomplementary and alternative medicine to the NIA Health and Retirement Survey;an ongoing program announcement on medication use by the elderly; and a random-ized, controlled trial of ginkgo biloba in preventing Alzheimer 's disease. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES There is substantial interest on the part of the American public in alternative therapies, particularly for people with chronic diseases of bones, muscles, joints andskin. For example, scientists have reported that green tea products show anti-in-flammatory activity in mouse models. Rheumatoid arthritis is an example of an in-flammatory condition affecting joints, resulting in pain and, over time, destructionof joints. Results of recent research suggest that identification of common dietarysubstances, such as green tea products, capable of affording protection or modu-lating the onset and severity of arthritis, may be used in the future to treat or pre-vent rheumatoid arthritis. Another promising area of alternative medicine beingpursued by NIAMS-funded scientists is an evaluation of the effects of acupunctureon carpal tunnel syndrome. NIAMS has enjoyed substantial collaboration with NCCAM since the inception of the OAM at NIH in 1992. For example, NIAMS co-funded with OAM three of theoriginal Centers on Alternative Medicine \u2014the Center of Alternative Medicine for Pain Research and Evaluation at the University of Maryland, the Center to AssessAlternative Therapy for Chronic Illness at Beth Israel Hospital, and the Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine Research Center at Stanford University. Inaddition, the NIAMS and OAM jointly established the Chiropractic Consortium atthe Palmer College of Chiropractic in Iowa. Furthermore, we have teamed with ourcolleagues in alternative medicine to fund several conferences in this area, includingthe NIH Consensus Development Conference on Acupuncture in November 1997,and the NIH Pain Consortium symposium ''New Directions in Pain Research '' in No- vember 1997. Finally, the NCCAM and NIAMS have jointly issued a number of so-licitations to stimulate research in alternative medicine. These include an RFA onAcupuncture Treatment for Osteoarthritis; and very recently, a solicitation and con-tract award to study the efficacy of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in osteo-arthritis. This is a significant area of interest and concern for the American public,and the NIAMS and NCCAM staff have launched a study to provide a solid sci-entific basis in determining the value of these widely-used compounds in peoplewith osteoarthritis.256 NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS The NIDCD is currently supporting one research project involving alternative and complementary approaches to communication and sensory disorders. The long termgoals of this study are to understand the epidemiology of otitis media (OM) andhearing loss among Native Americans from birth to age two and to define the rel-ative importance of known and new risk factors in this population. Native Ameri-cans have a high prevalence of chronic otitis media, but prospective studies of OMamong infants and young children, of this group are sparse. The risk factors understudy include both environmental factors such as smoking by parents as well as ge-netic factors that may be specific to Native Americans. Questionnaires are one mechanisms used in the study to collect information. The questionnaires ask if pregnant mothers are taking ''traditional '' Native American medicines. Such medicines include: sage, tea from medicine man, swamp tea; sweetgrass; tea; andraspberry leaf tea. Mothers are also asked whether their children have been givenany ''traditional '' Native American medicines, but the specific types are not asked for in the questionnaire. The answers on the questionnaire will eventually be used to determine if there is any correlation between the frequency of otitis media andthe use of ''traditional '' Native American medicines. Approximately 5 percent of the project is devoted to the determination of possible effects of Native American tradi-tional medicines. The NIDCD is currently planning a workshop with the National Center of Com- plementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) for fiscal year 2001 to explore theuse of T 'ai Chi (TC) and other alternative therapeutic modalities (e.g., Chi Kung, yoga, dance therapy) in the treatment of balance disorders. The collaboration ofother Institutes, including the National Center of Medical Rehabilitation Research(NCMRR) of NICHD and the NIA has also been sought. There are reports in theliterature suggesting that TC is effective in maintaining or improving balance in un-stable individuals and in improving falls in the elderly. This workshop will explorethe promise of such approaches as efficacious and low-cost alternatives to conven-tional physical rehabilitation and sensory substitution programs, the latter oftenedtermed, ''vestibular rehabilitation. '' It will shed light on a long-standing question in the balance rehabilitation field: Should balance be trained as an isolated functionor within the context of ''acts of daily living. '' The NIDCD has a representative serving on the Trans-agency Complementary and Alternative Medicine Coordinating Committee (TCAMCC). NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) supports research that explores the potential usefulness of complementary and alternative medicine approaches tothe treatment of mental disorders and to mental and behavioral aspects of other se-rious illnesses. In fiscal year 1999, NIMH CAM research included: CAM approaches to treatment of depression Saint John 's Wort (SJW), or hypericum, a popular naturotherapy for depression in Germany, is being widely used in the UnitedStates. Previous controlled trialshave indicated SJW does reduce symptoms of depression in adults, although defini-tive data on its efficacy are lacking and there are no scientific reports of the effec-tiveness, safety, and tolerability of SJW in children or adolescents. NIMH is collabo-rating with the NCCAM in the conduct of a three-arm, placebo-controlled, clinicalefficacy study of a standardized extract of hypericum in major depression. This trialis designed to test the acute efficacy and safety of hypericum compared to placebo.In another pilot study, NIMH-supported researchers are exploring the benefits ofSJW as a possible non-pharmaceutical treatment for depression in youths ages 6 - 16. Exposure to light appears to offer promise for the treatment of winter depression (Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD), although the mechanism of the effect or theoptimal scheduling of light exposure with respect to an individual 's circadian phase has not been determined. NIMH-supported researchers are studying the mecha-nisms and timing of light therapy for best results. Other investigators funded byNIMH are determining if therapeutic sleep deprivation (TSD) can accelerate the re-sponse of depressed geriatric patients to an antidepressant (paroxetine). In otherwork, investigators are examining the relationship of exercise to depression in ageneral population, and the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for people with mild-to-moderate depressive disorder.257 CAM approaches to other mental and medical disorders For mental disorders other than depression, NIMH-supported researchers are as- sessing the efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) fortreatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the efficacy of hypnosis asan adjunct to traditional forms of psychotherapy. NIMH-supported ethnographic re-search aims to understand the therapeutic change processes in three forms of reli-gious healing in Navajo society. For serious medical disorders, researchers are ex-ploring the ability of peer support to enhance adherence to treatment for HIV/AIDSand the ability of cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) to reduce acutestress responses in HIV-positive individuals, focusing on low socioeconomic statusminority and substance-abusing individuals. Additional research evaluates the bene- fits of psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions to cancer patients both forpre-surgical stress reduction for men undergoing surgical treatment of prostate can-cer and on survival for women recovering from metastatic breast cancer. NIMH collaborates closely and actively with NCCAM on those CAM studies of in- terest to the Center, such as the Saint John 's Wort clinical trial. For more explor- atory CAM studies focused on limited-scope aspects of mental health research, com-munication with NCCAM is encouraged by NIMH at all times. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that it spent $0.4 million on com- plementary and alternative medicine grants in fiscal year 1999. NIDA plans to en-courage more research on this important and often cross-cutting topic area. NIDAis interested in determining the efficacy of treatments for substance abuse, includ-ing those that take on a more ''complementary or alternative '' approach to treating the complex problem of addiction. Currently NIDA has two research grants thatfocus on alternative therapies, specifically the role that acupuncture plays in treat-ing addiction. One of NIDA 's grantees is looking at the role that auricular acupunc- ture can play in reducing cocaine use among HIV-positive patients in methadone-maintenance programs. The other grant is researching the role that electro-acupunc-ture can play in alleviating pain. NIDA has had a relationship with the staff from the former NIH Office of Alter- native Medicine for several years. In fact, NIDA was one of the co-sponsors for theNIH Consensus Development Conference on Acupuncture that was held in Novem-ber 1997. NIDA staff continues to collaborate with NCCAM staff in a variety of for-mal and informal ways including through NIDA representation on the NCCAMTrans-agency CAM Coordinating Committee. NIDA is also collaborating with theNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the Of-fice of Dietary Supplements (ODS) to sponsor a meeting later this summer to exam-ine intervention modalities (chemo and alternative) in drug abuse and HIV/AIDS. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) funds a number of research studies in the area of complementary or alternative medicine. Two studies are co-funded with NCCAM. One addresses the use of melatonin for sleep disorders in pa-tients with Parkinson 's disease. The other study addresses whether the setting of a breast cancer support group for African-American women can trigger self-tran-scendence to enhance quality of life. Other studies supported by NINR include a model of wellness circles for Native American Indian families to promote prevention of disease; the effects of relaxationtherapy on the immune system and quality of life of caregivers of patients with Alz-heimer 's disease; the effects of relaxation and music on postoperative pain; the bene- fits of acupuncture, massage therapy, vitamins, herbs and nutritional supplements,in addition to traditional care, on those at the end of life; and the effects of cancerpain interventions that include guided imagery, attention diversion, and relaxation. NINR research initiatives for fiscal year 2001 include self-management strategies and end-of-life palliative care. Future CAM areas of interest could involve evalua-tion of mind-body interventions for patients with chronic illness or who are at theend of life stage. In addition to collaborations with NCCAM on research projects, NINR serves on the NCCAM Trans-Agency CAM Coordinating Committee, which meets three timesa year to discuss initiatives and projects of mutual interest. NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES The NCRR creates, develops, and provides a comprehensive range of human, ani- mal, technological, and other resources to enable biomedical research advances. The258 NCRR serves as a ''catalyst for discovery '' for NIH-supported investigators by sup- porting resources in four areas: Biomedical Technology, Clinical Research, Compara-tive Medicine, and Research Infrastructure. Three of these areas currently supportresearch resources that enable multidisciplinary collaborations and discoveries inmany areas of health relating to CAM. Clinical Research The Clinical Research area, through its national network of 77 General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs), supports CAM related clinical investigations such asbiofeedback in advanced heart failure (Ohio State University); effects of melatoninin human sleep behavior (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); and, soybeandiets and breast cancer prevention in women (University of Texas at Galveston).Other studies include the use of hypnosis as an adjunct to periodontal therapy, acu-puncture for the treatment of HIV associated diarrhea and the effect of therapeuticback massage on the immune function of cancer patients. The GCRC Program encourages funded investigators from NCCAM supported Centers such as the CAM Centers at the University of Michigan and the AddictionsCenter at Minneapolis to utilize the resources of the GCRCs. Many other NCCAMfunded investigators are co-located with, or nearby, GCRCs such as the GCRCs atthe University of Virginia, University of Washington Seattle, Brigham Women 's Hospital, University of California San Diego, and the University of Indiana, just toname a few. Biomedical Technology The Biomedical Technology area of NCRR supports state of the art technologies and methodologies that create, develop, and provide a wide range of complex techno-logical capabilities. Examples are studies of acupuncture in humans using magneticresonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at the Uni-versity of Pennsylvania and the characteristics of antioxidant compounds from nat-ural products at Michigan State University. NCCAM currently supports an Intra-mural fellow (Dr. Joannie Shen) to study the effects of acupuncture for the treat-ment of alcoholism using functional MRI. This topic, or others similar to it, couldpotentially be supported by the regional imaging centers funded by BiomedicalTechnology and the GCRC Program. Dr. Shen is now performing her studies at theNIH Clinical Center. Research Infrastructure The Research Infrastructure area, through its Research Centers in Minority Insti- tutions (RCMI) Program, supports research at the University of Hawaii in the useof energy healing in very low birth-weight infants as well as the use of distant heal-ing in breast and prostate cancer patients receiving radiation. The University of Ha-waii, as well as some other RCMI institutions, such as Drew and the University ofPuerto Rico have been applicants to NCCAM for a variety of grants including Cen-ter support. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER FIC's longstanding Biodiversity and AIDS programs support complementary and alternative medicine in the form of research on herbal therapies utilized by indige-nous peoples in several nations, including Nigeria, Mexico, Chile, and Laos. Herbalmedicines used for a variety of indications relevant to infectious diseases, cancer,pain, and Alzheimer 's disease are explored for efficacy and safety in laboratory stud- ies in developing countries and in the United States, including those of industrialpharmaceutical partners. Given that CAM is used extensively abroad as well as in the United States, the FIC Director (who also serves as the NIH Associate Director for International Re- search) and the Director of NCCAM have discussed on several occasions commoninterests and the possibility of future joint initiatives examining the internationalrole and resources available for study of CAM. In addition, FIC staff work to facili-tate international dialogue between NCCAM and foreign counterparts, includingthose in China. Also, the FIC program director for Biodiversity works with the staffof NCCAM to ensure that relevant information is shared among interested groups. Senator H ARKIN . Thanks. Senator S PECTER . On the questions which I have asked, I would like two additional answers in writing. One is what you have beenable to accomplish with the increases in funding over the last 3259 years, which for the total number of institutes, aggregate more than $5 billion. Of course, it breaks down to different figures. I would like to have the increase actually for each of the insti- tutes over the 3 years, what you have been able to accomplish withthat extra, and what you would look forward to accomplishing ifyou got your wishes on the funding to have the total number ofgrants that you would like to see. [The information follows:] PAST AND FUTURE ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following table reflects each institute and center budget increases over the last three years, to include fiscal years 1998 -2001. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING BY INSTITUTE AND CENTER [In thousands of dollars] InstituteFiscal year 1998 1999 2000 2001 Actual Change Actual Change Estimate Change Estimate Change In response to the second part of your question, listed below are descriptions of Institutes and Centers current accomplishments and what could be accomplishedwith with additional resources. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE The National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts, coordinates and funds cancer re- search, and provides vision and leadership for the cancer research community bothin the United States and abroad. Accomplishments The incidence and death rates for all cancers combined declined between 1990 and 1996, reversing an almost 20-year trend of increasing cancer cases and deaths inthe U.S.260 To date, we have catalogued approximately 70,000 genes that are expressed in the development of cancers; of these, about 30,000 are previously unknown genes. Scientists uncovered evidence, using the new science of cancer genomics, that dif- fuse large B-cell lymphoma is actually two distinct diseases. This has important im-plications for their treatment. Tamoxifen, a drug long used to treat breast cancer, led to a 49 percent reduction in the incidence of primary breast cancer during the treatment period in women athigh risk for the disease. Last year, NCI supported over 1,500 clinical trials in prevention and treatment, covering virtually all human cancers. The results of clinical trials over the past twoyears have set new standards for regimens to treat childhood cancers, leukemia,myeloma, breast cancer, and others. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Priority for new resources would be given to developing cancer prevention inter- ventions for children under 10 years of age, when they are most receptive to paren-tal and adult influences. Opportunities for prevention of cancer include tobacco use,sun exposure, and diet and nutrition. Additional funding will greatly enhance NCI plans to increase the number of clin- ical trials and the number of patients who enroll in trials. NCI's Tumor Gene Index will catalog the genetic characteristics of tumors at each stage of growth. NCI also hopes to change the system of tumor classification froma visual to a molecular basis. Today, NCI can support approximately only the top 30 percent of grants in the research project grant pool. More support for all types of investigator-initiated re-search remains a fundamental need. Additional resources are needed to expand NCI 's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to enhance coverage of rural whites and blacks, non-Mexican Hispanics and Native Americans. New initiatives are aimed at training scientists that cross disciplinary boundaries to meet the complex challenge of cancer, at training physicians in the skills of clin-ical research, and at attracting increased numbers of minority students and young scientists into all aspects of cancer research. NATIONAL HEART , LUNG , AND BLOOD INSTITUTE Accomplishments A newly developed procedure called cardiac magnetic resonance imaging will allow cardiologists in hospital emergency rooms to make faster and more accurateassessments that could mean the difference between life and death when a personcomes into the hospital with symptoms of a heart attack. Recently, the first totally implantable, mechanical heart-assist device was success- fully placed in a patient who was no longer eligible to receive an organ transplantdue to the advanced stage of his heart disease. A recent study showed the benefits of teaching children early about eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of physical exercise. Three years afterward, childrenin the study continued to eat healthier food and get more exercise than their peers.The researchers concluded that giving the children occasional, positive reinforce-ment will help them maintain their healthy lifestyles throughout junior high, highschool, and beyond. A recent technological leap in blood testing called Nucleic Acid Testing, or NAT, screens donated blood to detect the presence of genes for the hepatitis and AIDSviruses. NAT detects even minute levels of virus, making the safest blood supplyever even safer. A breakthrough in ventilator management offers both better survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and substantial monetary savingsdue to faster recovery and less time spent in costly intensive care units. Two new ways have been found to determine who is at high risk for sudden car- diac death (SCD), which kills 300,000 Americans annually, often striking withoutwarning in young, seemingly healthy people. The screening techniques can easily beincorporated into routine physical exams. Once a person is found to be at risk forSCD, appropriate preventive therapy can be prescribed. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Three phase I clinical trials are in progress to test the safety of using gene ther- apy to treat hemophilia, which affects 20,000 Americans. A new treatment can stimulate the development and growth of new blood vessels for the heart. This treatment may one day eliminate the need for the more invasive,261 risky, and costly angioplasty and bypass procedures currently used to treat heart disease. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial aims to gain a better understanding of how to reduce risks of heart attack and stroke inpatients with type 2 diabetes. The goal is to find the most effective ways to nor-malize blood sugar and improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels, thereby help-ing diabetics enjoy longer, healthier lives. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) seeks to im- prove and promote craniofacial, oral, and dental health through research. Accomplishments A recent NIDCR-sponsored study has revealed a mutation in the PAX9 gene that results in the absence of molar teeth. This discovery brings scientists a step closerto understanding human tooth development. New studies sponsored by the NIDCR showed that the hormone estrogen can re- verse problems associated with wound healing in the elderly. New studies have found mutations in the cathepsin C gene that cause Papillon- Lefe`vre syndrome, a genetic disorder that typically affects both the skin and teeth. In some cases, all primary teeth are lost by age 4 and all permanent teeth are lostby age 14. This research suggests possible future therapies. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds What Could Be Accomplished With Additional FundsNIDCR recently issued a Re- quest for Applications for Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Health Disparitiesfor fiscal year 2001 funding. The centers will support research to investigate dental,oral, and craniofacial health disparities and design interventions to reduce them. Scientists have already identified a large number of genes associated with craniofacial-oral-dental diseases and disorders. NIDCR is poised to pursue the nextphase of genetic research, which deals with the complex gene-gene and gene-envi-ronment interactions that control craniofacial development. NIDCR is exploring the suggested link between periodontal disease and the birth of preterm, low birth weight babies. It is also evaluating the benefits of periodontaldisease treatment in women at high risk for delivering prematurely. NIDCR will support statewide models of oral cancer prevention and early detec- tion, and collect the knowledge and opinions of health care professionals and thepublic about the disease. NIDCR will support statewide models of oral cancer pre-vention and early detection, and collect the knowledge and opinions of the publicand health care professionals about the disease. In the future, testing saliva may be a simple way of obtaining medical diagnostic information. NIDCR scientists are investigating new ways to analyze saliva and in-corporate saliva testing into trials and other clinical settings. The NIDCR biomimetics program aims to mimic biological processes to repair body parts and help fight infectious diseases and inherited disorders. It will promotenew research into restoring oral, dental, and craniofacial structures, and into molec-ular technologies to deliver drugs and genes to combat infectious diseases, cancers,and craniofacial disorders. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES Accomplishments Replacement of insulin-producing beta cells through regeneration or transplan- tation could offer lifelong treatment for type 1 diabetes. Recent studies in animalsdemonstrated a drug that led to long-term acceptance of these cell transplants,opening the possibility of new treatments for type 1 diabetes in humans. Genetic studies of type 2 diabetes have found single gene mutations that cause rare forms of the disease in the young. An NIDDK intramural scientist has recently discovered gene ''insulators '', which allow genes to be expressed without interference from surrounding genetic material.This discovery is of particular importance to the biotechnology industry. An obese child with a congenital leptin deficiency was treated successfully with leptin therapy, resulting in decreased appetite, increased physical activity, and sig-nificant weight loss. Scientists reported a treatment in an animal model of Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) that prevents cyst formation and dramatically enhances survival. This newfinding has clear implications for treating human PKD, the fourth leading cause ofend-stage renal disease.262 Scientists successfully demonstrated a genetically-engineered treatment called infliximab for Crohn 's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. What Could Be Accomplished in the Future with Additional Funds NIDDK is co-sponsoring a number of initiatives to develop new transplantation strategies to treat type 1 diabetes and improve the success of liver and kidney trans-plantation. NIDDK will support research to understand the differences in type 2 diabetes and obesity among racial and ethnic groups, with a view toward developing interven-tions. Rates of hepatitis C infection are two to three times higher in African Americans than in Caucasians, and the response rate among African Americans to interferontherapy is far less than among Caucasians. NIDDK plans to expand research to ad-dress the causes of this ''resistant pattern ''. NIDDK will encourage research into cell and tissue development, and into the use of stem cells to combat disease. NIDDK will expand its research on autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabe- tes, autoimmune renal disease, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune thyroid disease,and inflammatory bowel disease. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to re- duce the burden of neurological disorders through research. Accomplishments Scientists identified a gene that causes narcolepsy in dogs, one of the few species besides humans susceptible to narcolepsy. This discovery may make it possible todesign a drug to treat the condition. Scientists showed that reducing corticosteroid hormone levels in aged rats re- stored the rate of nerve cell growth in the brain 's hippocampus region to nearly the same level as in young animals. This work suggests new avenues for preventingmemory loss in aging. A study into the factors that influence the likelihood that an aneurysm will burst will allow some patients to avoid possibly dangerous surgical intervention. Scientists have found a chemical signal that helps brain cells tolerate ischemia, a loss of adequate blood supply to the brain that causes strokes. This chemical,ceramide, presents a new strategy to reduce the damage caused by stroke. Scientists gained new insights into a structure called the M channel, revealing the cause of one form of epilepsy. This finding opens the door for developing new epi-lepsy treatments. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds A National Neuroscience Center will bring basic research findings to clinical ap- plication by promoting collaboration, communication, and shared resources. NINDS is developing initiatives to exploit new understanding of the nerve cell cir- cuits in the spinal cord and of the cellular mechanisms that promote spinal regen-eration. Tests must be developed to detect prions, which cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, in the blood supply. Therapies using neural stem cells have shown tremendous promise in animal models of such human diseases as Tay-Sachs, Parkinson 's, and spinal cord injury. Efforts to reduce health disparities will focus on HIV/AIDS and on preventing and treating stroke in minority populations. Supporting Specialized Centers for Neuro-science Programs at minority institutions will be vital in this endeavor. A multi-institute study of cognitive and emotional health over the life span will improve our ability to identify people who may benefit from early intervention orpreventive measures to improve brain function and delay or prevent disease. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports re- search to develop better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent infectious, immunologicand allergic diseases. Accomplishments A single oral dose of the relatively inexpensive ($4) drug nevirapine given to an HIV-infected woman at the onset of labor and another to her baby within three daysof birth can reduce the transmission rate by half compared with AZT.263 NIAID is spearheading a $144 million initiative to develop new ways of control- ling the human immune system to improve the success of organ transplants and de-velop treatments for autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. NIAID-supported investigators created, for the first time, live, replicating influ- enza A virus starting with its genetic blueprint. This research has far-ranging impli-cations for understanding the way flu strains mutate and spread. Scientists found that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can help adult patients infected with HIV rally and produce new immune cells. An NIAID-led effort produced the first high-resolution genetic map of Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite. The genome sequence of Chlamydia trachomatis has been completed. This bac- terium can cause blindness, genital tract infections, infant pneumonia, and otherdiseases. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Research into preventing and controlling the global spread of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, influenza, and hepatitis are all in need of expansion. Future studies will focus on whole-genome approaches to emerging pathogen re- search, including large-scale sequencing, bio-informatics, and functional genomics. Mounting evidence suggests that infectious agents may be the underlying causes of chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, au-tism, and chronic lung diseases. New studies will focus on identifying the infectiousagents involved in these diseases. Increases in training funds would ensure that a sufficient number of talented in- vestigators from diverse backgrounds enter immunology and infectious diseases re-search. There are unprecedented opportunities to expand vaccine discovery and develop- ment in a variety of areas within the next five years. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) supports basic bio- medical research that is not targeted to specific diseases. Accomplishments New work explained how one of the B vitamins called folic acid lowers levels of homocysteine \u2014a risk factor for heart attacks and strokes \u2014by converting it to a harmless molecule the body needs to fuel essential chemical reactions. Scientists discovered structural details of a protein that helps regulate heart rhythm. The work may shed light on long QT syndrome, a genetic heart condition. Scientists gained new insight into how a molecule called a copper chaperone deliv- ers copper to an enzyme that is defective in some cases of Lou Gehrig 's disease. The work may offer insight into how to block this delivery in people with the disease. Test tube experiments revealed an enzyme that may reverse the damage seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer 's disease. The enzyme untangled ''tau'' protein clumps, which are associated with memory loss and dementia. The discovery of molecular signals that prompt embryonic cells to become liver cells suggests ways to rebuild damaged organs or tissues, or make new ones fromscratch. Scientists determined the three-dimensional structure of ribosomes, the cellular factories that manufacture all of the proteins required for life. Many antibiotic drugstarget bacterial ribosomes, so this work may help scientists in antibiotic develop-ment. Scientists hunted down the molecule that triggers the body 's response to painful heat. The discovery should help researchers find ways to treat pain. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds NIGMS has launched two new initiatives to support pharmacogenetics, the study of individual differences in drug responses based on genetic variation. NIGMS initiated a program to support structural genomics, which will develop new, faster techniques to determine protein structures from their gene sequences. NIGMS has initiated a new program to train the next generation of scientists to develop computational approaches and associated databases for biology. NIGMS supports genomic studies of animals that include mice and zebrafish.NIGMS seeks to expand programs to increase the participation of under-rep- resented minorities in the biomedical sciences.264 NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) fosters re- search on reproduction, development, and behavior to maintain the health of chil-dren and adults. Accomplishments NICHD-funded investigators discovered the gene responsible for Rett syndrome, a heartbreaking disease that robs healthy infant girls of their language, mentalabilities, and ability to walk. Children born to mothers with hypothyroidism during pregnancy scored lower on IQ tests than children born to healthy mothers. When mothers were treated for thecondition, their children scored almost the same. For certain types of infertility, induced ovulation combined with artificial intra- uterine insemination is more successful and less expensive than many other infer-tility treatments. Computer imaging of the brain showed that estrogen, commonly prescribed to treat the symptoms of menopause, may also boost memory in postmenopausalwomen. High doses of vitamin A reduced chronic lung disease in extremely low birth weight infants. Researchers discovered that the absence of a protein called CC10 in premature infants placed the infants at risk for lung disease. Efforts are underway to manufac-ture the protein for further testing. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds The rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) among African Americans is still more than twice that of whites. NICHD is intensifying the campaign to stressthe importance of placing infants to sleep on their backs. NICHD-funded researchers will explore how children learn and how best to help them when they have learning difficulties. Research initiatives will also focus onovercoming reading disabilities, improving mathematics skills, and on how Spanish-speaking children best learn English. An NICHD initiative seeks to improve therapies for childhood trauma victims.An NICHD initiative will investigate the causes of childhood violence.NICHD will launch an array of initiatives focusing on early human development. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE The National Eye Institute (NEI) supports research, training, and other programs to address diseases of the eye and disorders of vision. Accomplishments A new drug called PKC 412 may be important in preventing vision loss in humans from diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration. Scientists detected estrogen receptors in eye tissue from young women, but not from men or postmenopausal women, that may account for gender-based differencesin some eye diseases and may offer a therapeutic target for the treatment of dryeye syndromes. Scientists have recently found that animals with induced detached retinas experi- enced less damage when given oxygen treatment. Further research in this area maylead to a new approach to minimizing retinal damage in humans with retinal de-tachment. Scientists have shown a connection between the molecule nitric oxide (NO) and damage to retinal nerve cells in the eye. Research is now being aimed at exploitingthis knowledge to develop a new class of neuroprotective glaucoma drugs. NEI recently launched studies to determine the extent of eye disease among Latinos and a clinical trial to determine whether low intensity laser treatment canprevent the advanced complications of age-related macular degeneration, the lead-ing cause of severe vision loss in those over 65. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Nerve cells in the retina can now be purified and grown in the laboratory. This provides an opportunity to study the mechanisms of cell survival and injury re-sponse. A number of promising approaches \u2014using growth factors, transplantation, and molecular and genetic technologies \u2014aim to prevent or slow down degenerative eye diseases.265 Identifying and sequencing genes in the visual system will lead to a better under- standing of the molecular and genetic bases for visual disorders and diseases, andwill ultimately lead to improved treatment or prevention. The NEI will continue to fund the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), a clinical trial of medications designed to prevent vision loss from glaucoma. Be-cause glaucoma is the number one cause of blindness in African Americans, a highpercentage of African Americans are participating in this study. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES Accomplishments NIEHS found that some fatty acids may prevent heart attacks, strokes: Using mouse models and cultured human cells from the lining of the arteries, NIEHS-sup-ported scientists have shown that some naturally occurring fatty acid compoundscalled epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and their metabolites suppress inflamma-tion, a critical step in the development of atherosclerosis. This work offers a newtherapeutic approach for preventing the arterial build-up that leads to heart attacksand strokes. Liver carcinogen blocked: An NIEHS study in China strongly suggests that ad- ministration of oltipraz would help reduce the risk of subsequent liver cancers inhigh risk populations exposed to aflatoxin and represents an importantchemoprevention regimen in the avoidance of an environmentally-induced cancer. Learning how cells respond to stress, infection, injury: In times of stress, such as an infection or injury, the body 's cells often respond with an inflammation. This phenomenon can lead to heart disease, autoimmunity, asthma, arthritis, neuronaldegradation, and cancer. In a series of cutting-edge studies, NIEHS researchershave followed the molecular events which occur inside the cell \u2014discovering molec- ular targets for potential treatments for these major human diseases. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds The Sister Study Can Clarify Causes of Breast Cancer: NIEHS seeks to speed a study of the unaffected sisters of breast cancer cases . . . using questionnaires anda blood and urine samples to clarify the joint effects of environmental and geneticfactors in the etiology of breast cancer . . . such factors as hormonally active envi-ronmental agents, growth factors, environmental contaminants of general publicconcern such as pesticides and solvents, as well as the role of with genes involvedin their metabolic activation. With CDC, NIEHS has developed the capacity tomeasure biological markers for 70 new hormonally active agents, which can be usedto analyze the samples. Children 's Environmental Health Centers to Focus on Learning, Behavior: Fol- lowing an initial emphasis on asthma and other respiratory diseases, NIEHS wouldplan a new phase that will concentrate on two other key areas in pediatric environ-mental health: learning and behavior, and growth and development. New researchopportunities include the investigation of environmental effects on such outcomes asattention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Biomarkers for Safety: NIEHS can make important contributions, in collaboration with the NIH Office of Science Policy and Planning, in developing biomarkers fordrug safety, and thus advancing not only drug safety but timely drug development. Comparative Mouse Genomics Center (Expansion of the Environmental Genome Project): NIEHS would support development of trans-NIH Comparative MouseGenomics Centers resource centers that produce transgenic and knockout micewhich will have variants of human environmental responsive genes found in thegeneral human population, such as the genes controlling the metabolism of toxi-cants, for DNA repair pathways, for the cell cycle control system, for cell death andfor the cell signaling or communication. The Centers ' research will be used by the scientific community to learn the importance of these human variations, in order tobetter predict health risks and to develop environmental policies to protect the mostsusceptible of us. What is learned will advance not only the protection of peoplefrom environmental factors but from viruses, nutritional shortcomings, drug side-ef-fects, and physical and chemical stresses. Linking Exposure to Human Disease: Using new computer imaging and computa- tional advances, coupled with sensitive tools of analytic chemistry and gene expres-sion/function, NIEHS proposes to dramatically enhance exposure assessment and itsuse to prevent human disease. In cooperation with CDC and EPA, NIEHS seeks toaddress issues of children 's health, of low-dose chemical exposure risks, of environ- ment-related health disparities, and of gene/environment interactions, as well as toprioritize chemicals for safety study by the NTP, and finally, with other agencies,266 to evaluate of the effectiveness of regulatory decisions and get the most bang from the buck. Advanced Research Cooperation in Environmental Health: NIEHS recently devel- oped a new program called Advanced Research Cooperation in EnvironmentalHealth (ARCH), to link historically black colleges and universities in research part-nerships with research intensive academic institution \u2014thus expanding the Nation 's base of scientists. NIEHS proposes to expand ARCH to include Hispanic serving in-stitutions and tribal colleges and thereby establish groups of investigators at theseinstitutions who can successfully compete for other NIEHS and other NIH grants. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING The National Institute on Aging (NIA) leads a scientific effort to uncover the mechanisms of the aging process and to extend the healthy, active years of life forall Americans. Accomplishments NIA has launched a nationwide treatment study to assess the effectiveness of Vi- tamin E and donepezil (Aricept) in preventing Alzheimer 's disease. Other clinical studies will look at using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to treatAlzheimer 's disease. Studies of the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were able to predict the development of Alzheimer 's disease (AD) within a three-year period, raising the hope of developing treatments to stop brain changes before clinical deterioration be-gins. Physical activity was found to increase nerve cell growth and survival in the re- gion of the mouse brain involved in learning and memory. This study suggests thatbehavior modification might help alleviate the age-related decline in brain function. Transgenic mice without the ability to rebuild telomeres, the structures at the tips of chromosomes that become progressively shorter with age, had a shortenedlife span. When older, they also had an increased number of spontaneous cancers. In a long-term study of more than 6500 middle-aged men, low blood pressure, low blood sugar levels, and avoiding cigarette smoking and obesity were shown to pre-dict healthy aging. The study also found that healthy habits or therapeutic interven-tions can have beneficial health effects when begun later in life. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Studies will help determine the genetic and environmental factors that allow cen- tenarians to live to such an old age. Understanding the genetic, molecular and bio-chemical basis of aging will help us to combat aging problems and age-related dis-ease. NIA will lead the trans-NIH Alzheimer 's Disease Prevention Initiative to make a concerted assault on this disease 's development and progression. Potential causes of disparities in adult health across race, gender, and socio- economic status will be studied in order to reduce health inequalities. Carefully designed national studies will examine the prevalence of elder abuse and the risk factors for elder abuse. More research is needed into stem cells, which hold enormous potential for ther- apy in many degenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer 's disease, Parkin- son's disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, mascula-skeletal disorders, immune sys- tem dysfunction, and diabetes. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES Accomplishments Improved hormone replacement therapy for older women at risk for osteoporosis includes lower doses of estrogen and progesterone, in combination with calcium andvitamin D. Researchers reported on a transcription factor that is required to establish the barrier function of the skin. These findings provide insights into how the skin per-forms its critical environmental protective function. Researchers have successfully used the antibiotic gentamicin to restore the func- tion of the gene that encodes for the protein dystrophin in mouse models ofDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Gene therapy to treat limb girdle muscular dystrophy in animals made muscles five fold less likely to be damaged during forceful contractions than untreated mus-cles.267 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an advanced new method of imaging capa- ble of detecting small structural changes in tissues during the earliest stages of dis-ease. Researchers found that people who did more than 4 hours of heavy physical activ- ity per day were 7 times more likely (13 times, if obese) to develop knee osteo-arthritis than people who did no heavy physical activity. Walking and light physicalactivities did not increase the risk. An international research team showed that the obesity gene leptin, which helps maintain body weight, also plays a role in controlling bone density by telling thebrain to slow down the rate of bone formation. This study suggests a new strategyto increase bone density and treat or prevent osteoporosis. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds A public-private partnership is being explored to identify biomarkers, biological warning signs, for osteoarthritis that would allow earlier intervention therapies. A recent workshop identified research opportunities into treatment approaches for osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease that typically strikes young children whose bonesare very brittle and vulnerable to many fractures. NIAMS is planning an initiative with NHLBI to explore promising research into the roles of vascular calcification and bone cell regulation in osteoporosis. Members of the NIAMS intramural research program are designing an outreach program targeted toward minority communities. NIAMS is enthusiastically participating in the new NIH K23 and K24 initiatives to stimulate careers in clinical research. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports and conducts research into diseases and disorders of human communica-tion. Accomplishments A study of twins and triplets revealed a possible genetic component to prolonged and recurrent episodes of middle ear infections. Once the genes are identified, doc-tors may be able to recognize which children and siblings are at risk and improvetreatment. An investigational vaccine that targets bacteria causing middle ear infections was shown to be safe and to provide protection against infection in animals, which maylead to use in humans. Scientists have located more than 50 genes that can cause hearing impairment. Ten have been cloned and the nature of the problems causing the hearing loss dis-covered. With the ability to predict who is at increased risk, better strategies canbe developed to minimize or delay hearing loss. More than 10,000 children have received cochlear implants, a prosthesis that con- verts sound into electrical impulses that can be interpreted much like sound. Sci-entists found that children with cochlear implants had better language skills thanchildren who used hearing aids. A large study of children who stutter showed a strong genetic component to the condition. NIDCD has begun a study to identify the genes that predispose an indi-vidual to stutter. Dramatic findings this year demonstrated that individual odor receptors are not dedicated to specific odors. An odor is distinguished by the unique combination ofreceptors that respond to it. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds NIDCD hopes to identify with precision the early, sensitive periods for developing speech and language skills. More research is needed to identify the molecular pathways that may lead to re- generation of auditory hair cells, a possible strategy for reversing hearing loss. A working group will examine studies of the molecular mechanisms of middle ear infections in the hope of developing novel therapies. Based on promising recent research advances, NIDCD will aggressively continue its investigations into the hereditary basis of hearing impairment. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to diminish the burden of mental illness through research.268 Accomplishments A White House Conference on Mental Health, the release of the first-ever Surgeon General 's Report on Mental Health and the Surgeon General 's Call to Action on Sui- cide Prevention this past year were all made possible by advances in science. Thereis no longer doubt that mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolardisorder and anxiety disorders are disorders of the brain, and that they arediagnosable and treatable. The largest and longest study ever of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) found that methylphenidate (Ritalin) was safe and effective, par-ticularly when coupled with intensive behavioral treatments. Scientists showed that primate brains make new cells for the brain region in- volved in higher cognitive function. This research gives new hope for the repair ofbrain injuries. NIMH has initiated large-scale clinical trials to learn the best treatments for bipo- lar disorder, depression in adolescents, depression that is unresponsive to initialtreatment, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer 's disease. NIMH research has found that many people have seen their doctors the month, day, or even hours before they commit suicide, and that many suffer from depres-sion. This knowledge raises the hope that one day the majority of these deaths maybe prevented. NIMH research has shown that many risk factors for violence occur early in a child 's life, including child abuse and neglect. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Ongoing clinical trials in neuroscience, behavioral science, genetics, and clinical investigation will provide solid information about the best treatments for manymental illnesses including schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder. Several new clinical trials will focus on children 's mental disorders. Research on school safety to be initiated this year will improve our understanding of the social and emotional factors involved in violent behavior by children. NIMH is using a broad array of scientific approaches to examine the patterns of use of psychotropic drugs in young children. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) conducts and supports over 85 per- cent of the world 's research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. Accomplishments NIDA launched the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which will include not only a wide array of research centers but also some250 community-based treatment programs. NIDA-supported research has demonstrated a potentially powerful new treatment approach for heroin addiction known as Bup-Nx. FDA approval is expected soon. Scientists are finding that abuse of some drugs such as methamphetamine and MDMA, or ecstasy, can cause long-lasting damage to the brain. Using neuroimaging techniques, scientists have discovered that the amount of dopamine D2 receptors an individual has may predict whether they will find a drugpleasant. In animal tests, a new compound, DIPP-NH2 , was found to be three times more potent at reducing pain than morphine and did not show signs of physical depend-ence. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds NIDA would increase its research portfolio investigating the link between drug abuse and various diseases that predominantly affect minority populations. NIDA has launched an initiative to understand the role of genetic and environ- mental factors in addiction, but it has only been able to fund half of the excellentproposals received. Given the increasing use of ''club drugs '' such as ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, and oth- ers, NIDA will increase its efforts to develop effective new treatments. Little is known about the short- and long-term effects of chronic drug abuse on the body. NIDA hopes to increase its efforts to understand these consequences, espe-cially as drug-using populations continue to age. NIDA would launch a Neurobiology of Development Initiative to determine the ef- fects of drugs on brain development at all ages, especially those prenatally exposed. State-of-the-art technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanners enable scientists to pose a whole new series of questions and pro-269 vide analyses at an even more sophisticated level. Expanding access to and refining these costly technologies is a high priority for NIDA. NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is playing a key role in validating unconventional approaches to health care by sup-porting rigorous scientific research. Accomplishments NCCAM supports the largest, most definitive Phase III clinical trials ever under- taken for a range of unconventional therapies, including studies of: \u2014Ginkgo biloba to prevent dementia (with NIA). \u2014acupuncture for osteoarthritis pain (with NIAMS). \u2014glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for osteoarthritis (with NIAMS). \u2014shark cartilage for lung cancer treatment (with NCI). \u2014saw palmetto extract for enlargement of the prostate (with NIDDK). \u2014St. John 's Wort for treatment of depression (with NIMH). Five new Specialty Research Center bring the number of research centers sup- ported by NCCAM to 11. The new centers focus on aging and women 's health, ar- thritis, craniofacial disorders, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular disease inAfrican Americans. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds The Clinical Research Curriculum Award (CRCA) would support instruction in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) clinical research. NCCAM plans tomake awards that help incorporate CAM information into medical and allied healthschool curricula. NCCAM has formed a search committee to recruit a recognized authority in clin- ical research to develop an intramural research program. NCCAM intramural re-search will be primarily clinical in focus. NCCAM would like to support studies examining the use of:\u2014echinacea to treat upper respiratory infections and ear infections. \u2014massage to speed the development of preterm infants. \u2014feverfew as a treatment for migraine. \u2014valerian root for the treatment of insomnia. \u2014milk thistle extract to treat Hepatitis C and other liver diseases. NCCAM hopes to support studies of indigenous health systems, exploring prom- ising traditional therapies for their potential applicability in the U.S. Examples in-clude Native American medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM Approximately 14 million American adults are dependent on alcohol or abuse it. The direct and indirect costs to the nation are almost $185 billion annually. Accomplishments NIAAA-supported scientists found that the brains of human alcoholics produced less of a crucial nervous-system protein, myelin, than those of non-alcoholics. Thisnew finding will help scientists to pinpoint gene activity that results in damage toalcoholics ' brains. NIAAA 's Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) has found the likely chromosomal locations of several genes involved in alcoholism. NIAAA-supported studies showed that the new medication nalmefene is at least as successful in preventing relapse among recovering alcoholics as naltrexone, therecently FDA-approved drug of choice. Nalmefene may have advantages overnaltrexone, including less liver toxicity. A Finnish company plans to seek FDA ap-proval. NIAAA-supported researchers have found that people who drank heavily during early and middle adolescence score significantly lower on neuropsychological tests.Heavy drinking in the young may inflict unique and potentially lasting damage. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds NIAAA proposes to establish an Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA) that would incorporate the efforts and findings from various scientific dis-ciplines. Microarray technology, a recently developed genetics technique, will give alcohol researchers a clearer picture of the changes in the brain caused by chronic alcoholexposure and reveal potential therapeutic targets.270 At least nine promising medications for alcoholism treatment await further test- ing, but require a faster mechanism for moving from the laboratory to clinical trial. NIAAA could conduct the first national, representative sample of drinking among adolescents and college-age youth. This study is crucial to estimate treatment needs. Research is needed to identify the biological, genetic, and sociocultural factors that contribute to increased risk of fetal alcohol syndrome in some minority popu-lations. Recovery rates among alcoholics need to be improved. Clinical trials that identify biological factors influencing recovery will enable scientists to work toward this goal. Researchers could better address the public health threat from hepatitis C by in- vestigating how alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C interact to cause unexpect-edly high damage. NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES The National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) provides the critical research tools and infrastructure necessary for scientists to conduct top-notch health-relatedresearch. Accomplishments Scientists used powerful high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrom- eters to identify the crucial parts of the prion protein that can change and causedegenerative brain conditions such as mad cow disease, scrapie in sheep and goats,and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru in humans. Postmenopausal women with hip fracture were found to show signs of vitamin D deficiency, which can be prevented with proper nutrition and vitamin supplements. Researchers uncovered the three-dimensional structure of the cell 's tiny protein factories known as ribosomes in unprecedented detail using high-energy x-rays. Scientists have found that most babies with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a rare and sometimes fatal syndrome marked by a lack of immune systemcells, can survive if given a bone marrow transplant from a family member within14 weeks of birth. By evaluating monkeys with a specially made contact lens over one eye, scientists discovered that visual development in one eye could be significantly altered by modi-fying vision in the other. These findings may point to new avenues for treating andpreventing visual problems in infants and young children. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds Improved imaging systems are needed to investigate the cause, progression and treatment of brain pathologies. NCRR proposes to establish informatics centers that will facilitate research in areas such as genomics that generate very large data sets requiring high-end com-putation. NCRR proposes to establish state-of-the-art resource centers for analyzing gene expression, which will in turn facilitate defining gene function. NCRR proposes to increase support for synchrotron facilities, which produce the world 's most brilliant x-rays and are crucial to structural biology and drug design studies. NCRR proposes to help alleviate health disparities among racial and ethnic mi- norities by establishing several Comprehensive Centers on Health Disparities at mi-nority medical schools. The centers will focus on cancer screening and management,cardiovascular disease, and stroke. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) supports clinical and basic re- search to establish a scientific basis for the care of individuals. Accomplishments The transitional care model, with follow-up in the home by advanced practice nurses, was shown to improve the health of older adults with common medical andsurgical problems at a 48 percent savings to the healthcare system. Widespread useof this model could improve the quality of patient care and save significanthealthcare dollars. NINR has tested the effectiveness of a 6-week arthritis self-management course in Spanish to help Hispanics control this widespread, painful condition. Fourmonths after the course was completed, participants showed notable improvementsin their arthritis and better overall health. Very low birthweight infants require procedures that are probably painful to them. To avoid the use of drugs and their possible side effects, investigators tested271 three non-medication interventions in an effort to ease pain in these tiny babies. Pacifiers with sucrose or sterile water were found to significantly reduce pain. Researchers have found that a carefully designed educational program for teens who select to use the insulin infusion pump rather than multiple insulin injectionsenables them to achieve excellent control of their diabetes. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds More funds would allow an intensive focus on research for improving end-of-life symptom management of pain, nausea, and weight loss. Increased resources would focus on helping minorities, who have a high rate of diabetes, manage their condition effectively. A new initiative would support in-depth research on promising self-management strategies for patients with such chronic illnesses as diabetes, arthritis, and conges-tive heart failure. Research would be undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of a wide range of telehealth interventions, especially in rural and other underserved areas. NINR would support multidisciplinary clinical trials to improve adherence to treatment, help patients make decisions about therapy, and manage the symptomsof chronic illness. NINR would broaden the training opportunities for nurse researchers in the field of genetics, including an expansion of the new Summer Genetics Institute. NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) aims to characterize the genomes of human and selected model organisms through complete mappingand sequencing of their DNA. Accomplishments Human Genome Project scientists have deciphered 2.25 billion of the 3 billion chemical units of human DNA. Planners expect to complete a working draft of 90percent of the genome by this spring and to finish the human sequence by 2003. NHGRI-supported scientists deciphered an entire human chromosome, Chro- mosome 22, for the first time. The public database GenBank has accumulated over 3.8 billion base pairs of DNA sequence. Scientists find this information invaluable \u2014there are approximately 5 million searches of the GenBank data daily. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds The roles of human genes are often discovered by comparing their DNA sequences to that of other organisms. Publication of the complete sequence of the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster is expected in early 2000. Having the genome sequencesof other organisms will be critical for improving the speed and accuracy of under-standing gene function and disease. A catalogue of the places in the genome where the DNA sequence differs among individuals will help in the effort to discern the genetic factors associated with manycommon diseases. Alterations in our genes are responsible for an estimated 3,000to 4,000 hereditary diseases, including Huntington 's disease, cystic fibrosis, and polycystic kidney disease. Genetic factors also interact with lifestyle and environ-mental factors like diet and cigarette smoking to influence the development of manycommon illnesses. In the future, an individual might be screened for hereditary pre-dispositions to diseases and counseled on steps to prevent these diseases or delaytheir onset. Supporting the fundamental research needed to develop new sequencing tech- nology will continue to be important, even after the reference human genome se-quence is finished. Faster and cheaper sequencing machines are vital to the identi-fication of sequence variations associated with disease, to understanding gene func-tion, and to the incorporation of new genetic technologies into patient care. In the future, an individual may be able to take a credit card size DNA ''chip'' containing his or her personal DNA profile, along with a drug prescription, to apharmacy, where the medication will be tailored to the individual 's genes. The re- sult will be fewer side effects and more effective treatment. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER The Fogarty International Center (FIC) supports research and research training to address global health challenges.272 Accomplishments Fogarty collaborators in Uganda have helped show that single doses of the anti- retroviral drug nevirapine prevent mother-to-infant transmission of HIV, and aremore effective and much cheaper than AZT. FIC-supported researchers have developed a new technique to more easily identify the virus that causes dengue fever, a reemerging infectious disease in the devel-oping world. FIC has developed a collaborative program to combat tuberculosis (TB) with NIAID, CDC and USAID. Early results show progress with two drugs: prednisoneand isoniazid. An FIC-supported health survey shows that people exposed to unprocessed cook- ing fuels in their homes are at a substantially increased risk of having active tuber-culosis. FIC supports an International Training in Medical Informatics Program to train people from the developing world to apply state-of-the-art information and commu-nication technologies to research and health surveillance activities. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds FIC would establish an international research and training program to address tobacco prevention and control as well as research capacity in developing countries. FIC would develop a cadre of mental health experts in low- and middle-income nations by promoting programs to provide researchers with relevant scientific train-ing. Efforts would be devoted to train scientists in molecular biology and molecular ep- idemiology techniques of relevance to developing countries. FIC would expand its clinical research and training programs to support profes- sionals from developing nations. Clinical trials of drugs and vaccines of mutual ben-efit to the United States and host countries will form a major part of this activity. FIC would establish a program designed to reduce malnutrition and to support research to prevent and treat diseases through nutritional intervention. FIC would establish a program designed to strengthen epidemiology research and clinical trials capacity to evaluate candidate vaccines for parasitic, bacterial, andviral disease in low- and middle-income nations. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world 's largest medical library, uses computer and communication technologies to improve the organization and use ofbiomedical information. Accomplishments ClinicalTrials.gov, a new database developed by NLM, has just been made public. It is an easy-to-use system that provides the public with information on more than4,000 federal and private scientific studies involving human subjects. MEDLINEplus, the Web-based consumer-oriented health information service, is now delivering more than a million documents each month. The service links usersto extensive data about 350 diseases and conditions, and most recently to the NIHClinicalTrials.gov database. NLM made awards to fund 49 electronic health information ''outreach '' projects in 34 states that will increase Internet access in a variety of community-based set-tings. Another new information resource developed by NLM is ''PubMed Central, '' the just-released Web-based repository that provides barrier-free access to primary re-ports in the life sciences. What Could Be Accomplished With Additional Funds ClinicalTrials.gov plans to expand to include studies not funded by the Federal Government. With additional support, PubMed Central eventually will contain peer-reviewed reports from journals and reports that have been screened but not formallypeer reviewed. NLM is planning to provide access to extensive information about prescription drugs as the next major improvement to MEDLINEplus. Additional resources would be needed to expand the current outreach campaign through public libraries and other community organizations. Additional support will allow NLM to augment the medical informatics training programs at its 12 centers and to make training awards to new institutions. NLM is supporting the development of the Next Generation Internet. Additional funds will support a projected Phase III.273 NLM 's National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) collects, analyzes, and distributes molecular biology data related to genomic analysis. NCBI managesthe GenBank database. These sophisticated information tools and resources must beimproved, expanded, and made even more widely available. Senator S PECTER . We have given you a fair amount of work to do, but we are going to have a lot of work to do on this end in try-ing to get this funding. This will be the third round and I think our concluding round. I will call now for the final question. Senator Feinstein. BUDGET INCREASES Senator F EINSTEIN . Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I was wondering if you could tell me how the various institutes apply an increase in budget across the board. And what I mean bythis, in the past 2 years, there has been a 15-percent increase. Butapparently these increases are not applied equally across theboard, for example, in lupus or diabetes. Could you tell me howthis figure gets applied across the board, or if it does? Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . It gets applied based on a number of factors that the institute directors use to make decisions. Each institutehas a mission statement and has developed a strategic plan to re- late to all the diseases, dysfunctions, organ systems that are underthe purview of that institute. In addition, the institutes seek advice very, very broadly from the statutorily mandated advisory councils, as well as other reviewgroups of experts in the various fields. And over that large assem-blage of advice and over a period of time and in discussion withtheir colleagues and with the Director of NIH, Dr. Varmus over thepast years, final decisions are made as to what might be possibleto do in a particular field. Certain scientific areas, certain diseases are more ready for a great expansion in funds to move them forward than are others.Others need nurturing in a different way, small workshops or largeconferences, to prepare the field to be able to do more research.And then the institutes make decisions as to what types of alloca-tions go to each area. The decisions also include how burdensome the disease can be, the quality of life with the disease, whether it affects one popu-lation, a majority population, a minority population, whether it af-fects women versus men. And all those factors are taken into con-sideration along with the scientific judgments of all these out-standing directors, to make the final decisions. And I would offer my colleagues, any one who might wish to, to add to the answer. Senator F EINSTEIN . Could I just follow up on that? Are you say- ing effectively that money goes based on how ready the sciencecommunity is to advance the ball up the field, or are you sayingthe money goes based on the presence of viable projects? Your an-swer was unclear in this area. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . The answer is that it is both, and many other factors, as well. There is not one way, I do not think, that any in-stitute or any entity decides, ''I shall spend, '' or ''We shall spend ' X' amount on a particular disease. ''274 It is indeed projects that are ongoing that can be expanded be- cause new developments have occurred. There may be an emer-gency situation. Recently, for example, over the last several years, as tuberculosis reemerged as a disease that had not been of as much significancein the previous years, it was felt that it was an emergency of sucha nature that a considerable amount of money had to be put intoit. So there are varying reasons to do this. And each institute direc- tor uses the best expertise from the community, from outstandingscientists, from the advisory and advocacy groups, and then comesto the best decisions possible. Senator F EINSTEIN . Thank you very much, Doctor. Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein. Well, we very much appreciate you all coming in today. As I have said in the past, we are reluctant to interrupt your research tohave you come to these hearings, but it is a very impressive group.And we will be working hard to provide the funding which will en-able you to continue to serve America and the world. CANCER GROUP LETTERS That concludes the hearing.Senator F EINSTEIN . Mr. Chairman, before you adjourn, I have some letters from major cancer groups that deserve a response.May I ask that they be submitted for response? Senator S PECTER . They will be made a part of the record for re- sponse. Senator F EINSTEIN . Thank you very much. [The information follows:] LETTER FROM MARIN BREAST CANCER WATCH MARIN BREAST CANCER WATCH , San Rafael, CA, February 22, 2000. DEARSENATOR FEINSTEIN : I am very appreciative of your continuing efforts on be- half of the breast cancer stamp. As I told you in our phone conversation, we lovethe stamp and feel it has helped heighten awareness of the epidemic. However, wedo want to know exactly where the money is going, and if it is not going into re-searching the causes, we would like to know why not. Donna Shalala said in her letter to you that the Insight Awards program received 400 applications, with 20 percent related to environmental causes of breast cancer.How much money would it cost to fund all 80 applications related to environmentalcauses? We would also like to know who is on the panel of scientists and who are the pa- tient/advocate representatives? Who is on the presidentially appointed NationalCancer Advisory Board? How can we influence the awards decision? To whom canMarin Breast Cancer Watch members write? Call? E-mail? Shalala 's letter says ''Environmental factors have long been suspected as playing a causal role in breast cancer, and both NCI and the National Institute of Environ-mental Health Sciences already support many studies specifically addressing therole of the environment in breast cancer. '' We are unaware of these studies. How can we get more information on them? I, personally, am delighted to have you as an ally in this struggle to stop the epi- demic of breast cancer. I believe, with all of us working together it will happen. Sincerely, F RACINE LEVIEN , Founder/Executive Director.275 LETTER FROM THEBREAST CANER FUND THEBREAST CANCER FUND, San Francisco, CA, March 7, 2000. Re Request to redirect Breast Cancer Stamp Funds to NIEHS. Senator D IANNE FEINSTEIN , Washington, DC. Attn: Glenda Booth DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN : As you know, The Breast Cancer Fund (TBCF) is very concerned about the dearth of funding for research that investigates linkages be-tween environmental factors and breast cancer. I am therefore writing to requestthat you consider redirecting the funds raised by the Breast Cancer Stamp to theNIEHS in the re-authorization bill scheduled for this summer. In Secretary Donna Shalala 's letter to you dated February 14, 2000, she stated that of the 400 grant applications for breast cancer stamp revenues, 20 percent arerelated to environmental causes of breast cancer, ''an area of major concern to many breast cancer advocates. '' The 20 percent number is low and most likely will result in less than 20 percent of the awards. However, an even greater problem exists withthe definition of environmental factors. Advocates use environmental research to mean studies about the effect of chemi- cals and radiation on the development of breast cancer, while Federal agencies likethe NCI include in the concept diet, exercise, genetics, alcohol use, pharmaceuticalsand hormones, as well as chemicals and radiation. With this expanded definition,NCI always appears to be doing more than it actually is with regard to researchinto the effect of environmental toxins, including pesticides, industrial chemicalsand pollutants, and radiation. TBCF has done extensive oversight to determine how much funding from two other important allocations for ''environmental research '' actually went to studies into the connections between breast cancer and environmental toxins. We report asfollows: (1) 1997 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET The first incident occurred in 1997, in the Emergency Supplemental Budget to which Representative Nancy Pelosi added a $15 million appropriation to studybreast cancer and environmental toxins in areas of high breast cancer incidence.TBCF worked closely with Congresswoman Pelosi to draft the appropriation lan-guage and waited patiently to learn about the allocation of these funds. No actionor reporting from the NIH was forthcoming, until, finally, in 1998, TBCF filed aFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) to find out whether all the groups named in the legislation were consulted and what the disposition of the funding was. TBCF has compiled a chronology of events that the FOIA disclosed, which we are enclosing with this letter. As you will see, first, $3 million was allocated for air pol-lution research, and the remaining $12 million appears to have ended up in threeRFAs. However, it is difficult to determine exactly what funds were related to theoriginal appropriation, as the addition of all funding amounted to $8.25 million outof the original $12 million allocation. As a follow-up, Representative Pelosi wrote a letter Dr. Harold Varmus at the NIH (12/99) requesting clarification on the RFAs and their relationship to the studyof environmental toxins and breast cancer risk factors in the high incidence areasenumerated in the legislation. No reply has come as yet. (2) NCI EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH ON BREAST CANCER AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS For several years, TBCF and other advocates wrote to Dr. Varmus requesting that the NIEHS budget be doubled since the mandate of that agency is to investigatethe connections between environmental factors and disease. In the initial cor-respondence with Dr. Varmus, we were told that there were 40 extramural projectsin 1997 -98 that related to ''Breast Cancer and the Environment. '' Once again, our analysis reveals that Dr. Varmus and the NCI were including topics like exerciseand diet in their interpretation of ''environment. '' Of the 40 cited projects, TBCF looked for those related to environmental chemi- cals, radiation and EMFs. Our use of the term ''environmental factors '' was done in the most generous way. For example, we included as environmental research thecreation of the New York Cancer Registry which is necessary for any future studyof environmental factors. With numbers rounded to the nearest thousand, our anal-ysis revealed the following results: Total funding for all projects: $11,967,000276 Total environmental projects: 12 Total funding for environmental projects: $4,228,000 or 35 percent of total funding. It should also be noted that the funding for environmental research cited by Dr. Varmus represents a pittance of the total NIH budget of $15.6 billion and that theNIEHS budget was $382 million or 2.4 percent of the NIH budget for the periodin question. As a next step, TBCF plans to obtain a detailed description of total intramural breast cancer research funding at NCI for the 1997 -98 period to determine what percentage of those funds went to research on breast cancer and environmental fac-tors, as we define them. We hope you will consider the two incidents describedabove as you consider whether we will actually get research into the environmentalcauses of breast cancer by allowing the NCI to continue using the Breast CancerStamp funds as described by Secretary Shalala. As you know, The Breast Cancer Fund has been and will continue to be a major supporter of the Breast Cancer Stamp. Not only is the funding raised by the stampvital, but it gives the public a welcome opportunity to contribute to much neededresearch into a disease about which we are all concerned. We believe that the stamprevenues can have an even greater impact, however, if they are specifically directedto research into the causes of the disease. Identifying environmental toxins that arecontributing to the disease and that can be reduced or eliminated would give us thefirst step toward real prevention. Thank you for considering this request, and please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of further assistance in this matter. Sincerely, A NDREA R. M ARTIN , Founder and Executive Director. Enclosure. CHRONOLOGY OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT(FOIA) R EQUEST REGARDING $15 MILLION EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION FOR BREAST CANCER AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS RESEARCH (By the Breast Cancer Fund) Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi inserted a section in the FY 1997 Emergency Sup- plemental Budget that called for a special $15 million appropriation, as follows: ''. . . for the purpose of supporting multicenter research studies on environmental risk factors associated with breast cancer and factors related to regional variationsin breast cancer incidence and mortality. The Committee understands that theremay be a significant link between toxics and other chemical substances present inthe environment and the high rate of breast cancer among women in certain areasof the country. '' Several States were listed, including California, where high breast cancer inci- dence and mortality has been recorded. In line 12, Chapter 7, language was in-cluded mandating ''consultation '' with other agencies in the distribution of the funds: ''These funds will be made available on a competitive basis and through mecha- nisms determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Directors of the Na-tional Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute ofEnvironmental Health Sciences, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women 's Health. '' The Breast Cancer Fund (TBCF) has a copy of a letter from Secretary Shalala to Senator Tom Harkin (12/19/97) which explained that the Emergency Supple-mental Budget bill had passed and of the $15 million appropriated, $3 million wasto be spent on air pollution studies that related to cancer and respiratory diseases.This proposal was puzzling since the funds were slated for breast cancer studies. One year after this emergency budget bill was law (Public Law 105 -18), no infor- mation or requests for proposals had come forth from the National Institute ofHealth. TBCF has taken the following steps to determine the disposition of the $12million and which agencies.were consulted in the disposition. 10/14/98. \u2014TBCF sent a FOIA to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Secretary Shalala requesting written proof that all the groups listed in theconsultation mandate had been involved.277 1Document Summary: The $12 million allocation was spread over a four-year period which would have resulted in a maximum of $3 million per year. However, $0.5 million of these fundswas taken away to do occupational research and another $0.25 million was applied to some riskexposure work, neither of which allocations appears to relate directly to breast cancer and envi-ronmental toxins. In addition, funds were allocated to the NCI/NIEHS ''Exposure Assessment in Cancer Epidemiology '' amounting to $2.5 million a year for 3 years. The total funds to be awarded amounts to $8.25 million out of a $12 million allocation.10/21/98. \u2014A postcard was received by TBCF from the DHHS with a note that consideration of our request was underway and that all future contact should referto case number 99 -54W. 10/29/98. \u2014A postcard was also received by TBCF from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that consideration of our request was underway andin the future to refer to case number 99 -151. 01/21/98. \u2014Rosario Cirrincione from the DHHS Office of Public Affairs, on behalf of the Executive Secretariat, sent 62 pages of records to TBCF in response to ourFOIA request. 03/31/98. \u2014Ioana Petrou, General Counsel and Board member sent Rosario Cirrincione a letter indicating that none of the 62 pages related to the dis-position of the $12 million in Public Law 105 -18. The request for appropriate records was repeated. 06/28/99. \u2014A letter was sent to TBCF from Beatriz Flores, FOI Clerk at the Public Health Service of DHHS, accompanied by a half inch of documentation 1which an- swered our consultation questions and some issues about how the requests for re-search proposals were drafted. The Flores cover letter stated clearly that CDC hadno records regarding this appropriation, which means CDC was not consulted. Noevidence was submitted that the Office of Women 's Health was consulted either. The additional documentation concerned the specifies of the Request for ProposalApplications (RFA) as follows: (1) Regional Variation in Breast Cancer Rates in the U.S. RFA: CA -98-017 Ap- plication Receipt Date: 8/25/98 (2) Interdisciplinary Studies in the Genetic Epidemiology of Cancer RFA: CA -98- 018 Application Receipt Date: 11/17/98 (3) Implementation of the National Occupational Research Agenda RFA: OH -99- 002 Application Receipt Date: 6/10/99 LETTER FROM BREAST CANCER ACTION BREAST CANCER ACTION , San Francisco, CA, March 10, 2000. Re Breast Cancer Stamp Re-authorization. Hon. D IANNE FEINSTEIN , U.S. Senate,Washington, DC. D EAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN : We write on behalf of the undersigned organizations and the thousands of people we represent to urge you to consider changing the lan-guage of the bill to re-authorize the breast cancer stamp. While we think this is a creative and important program, we strongly believe that the funds generated need to be spent in a way that might make a significant dif-ference in the breast cancer epidemic. That will not happen if the current structureof the stamp program is maintained. The 70 percent of stamp proceeds that are allo-cated to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should be directed by law to theNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). Leaving the alloca-tion of funds to the discretion of the NIH means more of the same kind of researchthat has done little to uncover the causes of breast cancer. We know that you share our concern about how the portion of the stamp funds that are directed to the National Institutes of Health are spent. Your office hasshared with us the letter dated February 14 in which Secretary Shalala respondsto your questions regarding expenditure of the funds. That letter reveals preciselywhy it is important to change the structure of the stamp program. Secretary Shalalastates that the stamp funds have been allocated by the NIH to the National CancerInstitute (NCI), which, in turn, has created a new awards program for the funds.The letter states that, of the 400 grant applications received, twenty percent relateto environmental causes of breast cancer. Notably, the letter does not indicate howmany of those grants the NCI expects to fund. And, based on the NCI report,''Charting the Course: Priorities for Breast Cancer Research, '' which is the impetus for the grant program, it is unlikely that many of those applications will be funded.278 However, an even greater problem is the definition of ''environmental factors. '' When advocates use this phrase. they mean chemicals and radiation, while the NIHand NCI mean diet, exercise, alcohol use, hormones, as well as chemicals and radi-ation. By using this expanded definition, the NCI always appears to be doing morethan it actually does with regard to research on ''the environment '' and cancer. As even a brief review of the ''Charting the Course '' report reveals, the NCI con- tinues to focus its attention primarily on the molecular biology of breast cancer and on so-called ''chemoprevention '' strategies. The work being done to identify what in the environment might be causing the increased incidence of breast and other can-cers is not being done at the NCI. If that work is being done at NIH, it is beingdone at the NIEHS. As you know, the funds generated by the stamp are small in the scheme of what is directed toward and needed to solve the breast cancer problem. In light of that,it is all the more important to make sure that the funds are spent in a way thatat least has a chance of addressing some aspect of true prevention. If we are everto truly solve the problem of breast cancer by preventing the disease, we will needto discover and eradicate the causes of the disease. We look forward to working with you to make the breast cancer stamp program as effective as it can possibly be, and we believe that this will occur by making theNIEHS the designated recipient of the stamp funds allocated to the NIH. We alsobelieve that the stamp will gain even more popular support when the public is madeaware that the funds will be directed into research on possible preventable causesof the disease. Thank you for attention to these concerns, and for all you do to address the con- cerns of the growing population of people touched by breast cancer. Sincerely, Barbara A. Brenner, Executive Director, Breast Cancer Action, and on be- half of Francine Levien, Executive Director, Marin Breast CancerWatch; Catherine Porter, Esq., Legal Services and Public Policy Coor-dinator, Women 's Cancer Resource Center; Andrea R. Martin, Found- er and Executive Director, The Breast Cancer Fund; Sharon Batt,Breast Cancer Action Montreal; Nora Cody, DES Action; JudyNorsigian, Boston Women 's Health Book Collective. CANCER GROUP LETTER The importance of lifestyle and other environmental exposures as contributing fac- tors of cancer is unquestionable. The pivotal role of the environment is reflected inthe substantial variation in cancer incidence around the world. Furthermore, epi-demiologic research has succeeded in identifying a wide range of cancer-causing ex-posures, including tobacco use, dietary components, sunlight, ionizing radiation, en-vironmental chemicals, infectious agents, obesity, exercise, hormones, and reproduc-tive factors. Indeed, the largest source of variability in cancer risk is due to behav-ior. Nevertheless, the causes of many cancers remain elusive. While better ap-proaches to measuring exposures will provide new insights, it is clear that the envi-ronment represents only part of the equation in determining who will get cancer. NCI, as the Nation 's leading institute in supporting and conducting cancer re- search, has placed a special focus on breast cancer research. NCI has a portfolio ofover 1400 individual NCI-funded projects having relevance to breast cancer. In fiscalyear 1999, NCI expended over $387 million in research related to breast cancer, andfor fiscal years 2000 and 2001, this figure is expected to be about $425 million and$450 million respectively. To support the full range of research activities necessary to conquer cancer, in- cluding breast cancer, NCI uses a complex and dynamic process to set our scientificand funding priorities. This process is driven by several principles: \u2014Strive for a balanced portfolio of research in behavior, epidemiology, control, eti- ology, prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, rehabilitation,and end of life issues; \u2014Link all pieces of the cancer research enterprise through translational research; \u2014Rely on our diverse constituencies \u2014including scientific, medical, advocacy and other public communities \u2014to help us identify new opportunities, gaps, and bar- riers to progress, create new programs, and improve existing ones. From a strategic level, we integrate priority setting into all of our strategic plan- ning activities. For breast cancer research planning, NCI established a Progress Re-view Group (PRG) in 1997 to assess the status of breast cancer research and to pro-vide recommendations on direction and priority to speed the progress. The BreastCancer PRG was composed of prominent members of the scientific, medical and ad-279 vocacy communities and their report, published in August 1998 and entitled, ''Charting the Course: Priorities for Breast Cancer Research, '' is the framework NCI uses to support a balanced portfolio of breast cancer research (http://wwwosp.nci.nih.gov/planning/prg/bprgtableofcontents.htm). From the research application level, we integrate priority setting into the funding of individual research applications based on scientific merit. NCI, like the rest ofNIH, uses scientific peer review panels to competitively determine the technical va-lidity, soundness and ranking of the individual grant applications. However, NCIhas increasingly used lay reviewers/consumer advocates in our scientific review pan-els to provide a consumer perspective. These consumer advocates actively partici-pate in discussions, present the patient perspective, and vote on the applications.During the last 18 months, consumers have participated in almost 60 reviews, in-cluding the panel currently reviewing the applications for the program announce-ment ''Insight Awards To Stamp Out Breast Cancer, '' the program that will use the funds contributed by consumers in support of the 1997 Stamp Out Breast CancerAct. The Insight Awards are a new initiative designed to support innovative pilot stud- ies that are likely to generate new understanding about breast cancer and to ad-vance underdeveloped areas of research as identified by the Breast Cancer PRG 's 1998 report. The focus of this initiative is to support innovative high risk/high pay-off research that would not be funded under normal circumstances. Over 400 appli-cations have been received and are being competitively reviewed by a peer reviewpanel for the available funds. The role of the peer review process is to judge thelikelihood that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the pursuitof the initiative 's goals. The applications are being judged solely on the basis of sci- entific merit, with attention given to a balanced research portfolio as articulated inthe Breast Cancer PRG 's report. To preserve the integrity of the peer review proc- ess, names of individuals participating on review panels must remain confidentialuntil the selection of awardees is made. Finally, in regard to the question on the status of the breast cancer research funds provided by the 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (PublicLaw 105 -18), I am submitting a letter sent to The Honorable Nancy Pelosi, dated 15 March 2000, along with the enclosures that describe the disposition of the fundsand the vital research it is supporting. LETTER FROM DR. RICHARD D. K LAUSNER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & H UMAN SERVICES , NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH , NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE , Bethesda, MD, March 15, 2000. Hon. N ANCY PELOSI , House of Representatives,Washington, DC. D EAR MS. PELOSI : Thank you for your letter of December 2, 1999, to the Director of the National Institutes of Health. It has been forwarded to the National CancerInstitute (NCI) for reply. Your letter addressed the disposition of the funds des-ignated for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of theSecretary, and subsequently to the NCI, in the 1997 Emergency Supplemental Ap-propriations Act (Public Law 105 -18, enclosed). I appreciate this opportunity to pro- vide for you descriptions of our activities relating to this appropriation and the vitalresearch it is supporting. The language contained in the Act directed the Secretary to use the funds appro- priated ''For expenses necessary to support high-priority health research '' and the Conference Report (105 -119, enclosed), which superseded the original Senate Re- port, provided the further direction that the Secretary consult with the Directors of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women 's Health to deter- mine the most appropriate mechanisms for distribution of the funds. The confereesstipulated that the funds should be competitively awarded and further requestedthat the Secretary consider dedicating the funds to cancer research, ''especially re- search investigating the environmental factors that may be associated with breastcancer in communities with high incidence of the disease, '' and asked for a report on the Secretary 's plan for allocating the funds. After designing a strategy to invest in the best opportunities for advancement, several initiatives were identified that reflected the vision of the conferees about thedisposition of these funds. Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutesof Health (NIH) sent a report (enclosed) to Congress describing the plan. The appro-280 priation was divided into two parts: NCI is coordinating the disposition of $12 mil- lion allotted for the study of the role of environmental factors in cancer; and Na-tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is coordinating the disposition of$3 million for the study of health effects of air pollution. Air pollution studies wereincluded in the research package at the request of the Secretary of the Departmentof Health and Human Services in response to the President 's call for more research on the health effects of air pollution exposure as part of his implementation planfor the Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA) revised regulation on air quality standards. To date two projects have been identified for funding. To administer the cancer research portion of the funds, the NCI, in collaboration with National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Insti-tute on Aging (NIA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)at CDC and the National Center for Environmental Research and Quality Assur-ance at EPA, prepared and issued Requests for Application (RFA) to solicit pro-posals from interested investigators. Proposals were reviewed and selected for fund-ing based on a rigorous evaluation of scientific merit. This peer review process isarduous, but necessary to ensure that money the Congress and the American peoplehave entrusted to us is used wisely. The initiatives envisioned in the plan and theirsubsequent implementation, including the funding allotted to each project, are out-lined in Table 1 (enclosed). The RFA entitled ''Regional Variation in Breast Cancer Rates in the United States '' launched 5 new projects in which investigative teams are using statistical and epidemiologic methods to investigate factors that may influence, contribute to,or account for the reported differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality ratesacross different geographic regions. Data on women residing in California, Con-necticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Wash-ington, Wisconsin, and Utah will be analyzed. An additional award supplementedan ongoing study in New York that is evaluating the effect of electromagnetic fieldradiation (EMF) on breast cancer risk. Five new grants were awarded under the RFA entitled ''Interdisciplinary Studies in the Genetic Epidemiology of Cancer ''. These projects, operated together as a con- sortium with three related NCI-funded projects, will be working to understand theway genes interact with environmental factors in cancer development. Althoughonly one of these projects addresses breast cancer specifically, each of them promisesto contribute knowledge about the impact of the relationship between genetic andenvironmental elements in cancer incidence and survival, an extremely importantarea of cancer research. Since research on environmental exposures alone cannotbring us all the information we need, we must also address the synergistic effectsof genes and environmental factors to understand how a normal cell becomes can-cerous. In response to the RFAs entitled ''Implementation of the National Occupational Research Agenda '' and ''Mechanistic-Based Cancer Risk Assessment Methods '' four new grants were awarded to develop and/or improve methods for assessing past en-vironmental and occupational exposures that could be associated with geographicpatterns for some cancers including breast cancer. Research of this type (called ex-posure assessment) is important in understanding breast cancer for two reasons:First, we must be able to link breast cancer development to a carcinogen exposurethat occurred years before the diagnosis; and second, we must be able to obtain en-vironmental data for assessing the role of gene-environment interactions in the eti-ology of breast cancer. In May 1999, NCI awarded a $4.87 million 5-year contract ($2 million from the fiscal year 1997 supplemental funds) to develop and implement the prototype geo-graphic information system for health (GIS -H) for breast cancer studies on Long Is- land. The GIS -H, the first of its type, will provide a new tool for researchers to in- vestigate relationships between breast cancer and the environment, and to estimateexposures to environmental contamination. The GIS -H data layers will include geo- graphic data for general mapping purposes and demographic data. Data on healthcare facilities, health care surveys, breast cancer, and the environment will also beincluded. The environmental data will include information on contaminated drink-ing water, sources of indoor and ambient air pollution, including emissions from air-craft; EMFs; pesticides and other toxic chemicals; hazardous and municipal waste;and radiation. The system will rely chiefly on existing databases obtained from Fed-eral, State, and local governments, as well as private sources, with emphasis placedon high-quality data. It is expected to be available for pilot studies in mid-2001. AWeb site is available where the public and researchers can follow the GIS -H's progress and obtain summary information about the databases: http://www.healthgisli.com.281 The important work supported by the Public Law 105 -18 funds is part of our con- tinuing commitment to a broad research agenda that promotes discovery of the waysthat environmental exposures to carcinogens lead to the development of cancer. Anew RFA will be issued this year to direct the remaining funds toward promisingstudies of this nature (see Table 1) and NCI sponsors many other projects in thisresearch area. In accordance with our own strategic plan and the intentions of theconferees, the funds are being used to capitalize on scientific opportunities that con-tinue to provide significant new information and that will advance our knowledgeof cancer processes. I hope this information is useful for you and your constituents. Please feel free to contact me if you have additional questions or concerns. Sincerely, R ICHARD D.

PUBLIC LAW105-18 CHAPTER 6 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND For expenses necessary to support high priority health research, $15,000,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, That the Secretary shall award suchfunds on a competitive basis. CONFERENCE REPORT 105-119 LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, EDUCATION AND RELATED AGENCIES OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND The conference agreement modifies language proposed by the Senate which would have appropriated $15,000,000 to the Public Health and Social Services EmergencyFund within the Office of the Secretary for competitively awarded research on theenvironmental links to breast cancer. The Senate language designated the fundingas an emergency appropriation. The House bill had no similar provision. The conferees agree that $15,000,000 is appropriated to support high priority bio- medical research. These funds will be made available on a competitive basis andthrough mechanisms to be determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Di- rectors of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women 's Health. The conferees request that the Secretary provide a report to both Committees on the research planand allocation methodology accompanying these additional funds by July 1, 1997.Among the priorities the conferees encourage the Secretary to consider is cancer re-search, especially research investigating the environmental factors that may be as-sociated with breast cancer in communities with high incidence of the disease. Theconferees have removed the emergency designation for these funds, offsetting thecost elsewhere within the bill. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & H UMAN SERVICES , PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE , NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH , Bethesda, MD, February 23, 1998. Hon. J OHN EDWARD PORTER , Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Wash-ington, DC. D EAR MR. PORTER : On December 19, 1997, in response to the Conference Report accompanying the Fiscal Year 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act282 (Public Law 105 -18), the Secretary of Health and Human Services submitted to you our research plan for using the $15 million appropriated in the Act for high-priorityhealth research. However, after further internal discussion, we have notified theSecretary and are now notifying you that we believe we can improve upon our origi-nal project design for the $12 million we intend to use to study gene-environmentinteractions in the cause of breast cancer in high-risk areas of the United States.Our updated research plan is enclosed. Please note that this revision still conformswith the legislative requirement that all of these funds be awarded on a competitivebasis. Instead of a single, multi-year, multi-center, case-control study as originally envi- sioned, we have determined it would be more appropriate to break out the funds into four types of projects, with most of these funds awarded in fiscal year 1998.The first project would be a contract for a Geographic Information System for theLong Island Breast Cancer Study to identify potential environmental risk factors forbreast cancer. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to issue a Request for Pro-posals for this contract in late winter or early spring of 1998 for award in fiscal year1998. The second and third projects would include research grants in the specificareas of ''Addressing Environmental Factors and Breast Cancer in High-Risk Areas '' and ''Interdisciplinary Collaborative Studies of Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions in Breast and Other Cancers. '' Requests for Applications (RFAs) for grants in these two areas are expected to be issued in the spring of 1998 and award-ed in fiscal year 1998. A third RFA for research grants on developing and testingaccurate exposure assessments for breast cancer epidemiology is still being devel-oped and will be advertised and awarded in fiscal year 1999. We expect to findmany different research grants with a multiplicity of study designs through each ofthese RFAs. Both NCI and the National Institute of Environmental Health Scienceswill contribute the expertise of their staffs to these projects, with NCI to have thelead responsibility for oversight of the project. The portion of the original research plan related to spending $3 million for re- search on the adverse health effects of exposure to air pollutants, such as groundlevel ozone and particulate matter, has not been revised in this update. Specific an-nouncements regarding the award of funds for this project are still under develop-ment. Thank you for your continuing strong support for medical research. Sincerely, H AROLD VARMUS , M.D., Director. Enclosure. A S TUDY OF GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION IN THE ETIOLOGY OF BREAST CANCER , INHIGH-RISKAREAS OF THE UNITED STATES [February 23, 1998] The special legislation (Fiscal Year 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act) directing research on the environmental causes of breast cancer provides a re-markable opportunity to better understand the determinants of that disease throughan innovative, interdisciplinary initiative that encompasses the expertise of the Na-tional Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Environmental HealthSciences (NIEHS). Decades of research have established that the causes of breastcancer may involve environmental factors and genetic elements that are also likelyto be highly interactive in producing the disease. However, the identification of thespecific exposures and array of genes involved has proven elusive. Recent profoundinnovations in assessment of exposure to environmental contamination and molec-ular genetic technology have raised the expectation that we now have the tools togain major new insights into potentially preventable causes of many diseases suchas cancer, and into breast cancer in particular. It is clear that the time is ripe forstudies focused on gene-environment interactions in the risk of breast cancer. Iden-tification of environmental influences on genetic effects should clarify the biologicmechanisms involved, and discovery of genes that modify such effects should helpidentify the specific environmental agents and host factors responsible for breastcancer. All of the studies funded through this initiative will be accomplished via extra- mural competitive research funding. These studies will expand the existing port-folios of both Institutes in environmental causes of breast cancer. Studies will befunded for a variety of scientific approaches, including the development and applica-tion of geographic information systems for the identification of potential environ-mental risk factors for breast cancer, the development and testing of accurate expo-283 sure assessment in breast cancer epidemiology, the study of environmental factors for breast cancer in high risk areas, as well as molecular and genetic epidemiologystudies of gene-environment interaction in breast cancer. A multiplicity of study de-signs is envisioned. Such a breadth of approaches will provide truly new and innova-tive opportunities not only to clarify genetic and environmental determinants thatare currently under suspicion as causative of cancer, but also to establish bio-speci-men resources within epidemiologic infrastructures which can be revisited to evalu-ate etiologic questions as they will arise in the future. The selection of meritoriousprojects through the peer review process will assure that the most scientifically ex-cellent programs, totaling $12M, will be selected, thus assuring that such studieswill provide an important, productive and efficient way to exploit our rapidly ex-panding scientific and biotechnology knowledge base to identify preventable causesof breast cancer. Investment in new approaches to studying gene-environment inter-actions as they relate to breast cancer, if successful, will provide a paradigm for newprograms of interdisciplinary studies into the origins of other cancers, as well asmany chronic diseases. Total project cost: $12 million A S TUDY OF THE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF AIRPOLLUTANTS , PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE [February 23, 1998] The Fiscal Year 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act also provides an opportunity to elucidate further the adverse heath effects of exposure to air pol-lutants and particulates and the role of such exposure in the causation of diseasessuch as asthma, lung cancer and respiratory distress syndrome. The National Heart,Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the National Institute of Environmental HealthSciences (NIEHS), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) all have portfolios of competitivelyawarded grants which study the underlying causes of asthma, emphysema,hyperresponsiveness of the airways and the premalignant and malignant changesin the cells of the lining of the airways. Building on this knowledge base, newawards will focus on the roles of a single exposure or multiple exposures to groundlevel ozone, of exposure to particulate matter, and the combination of such expo-sures along with other predisposing factors to respiratory problems. After a nationalcompetition and peer review of applications, awards will be made to the most sci-entifically meritorious applications and will place emphasis on new molecular diag-nostic and therapeutic techniques which clarify the influence of these environmentalpollutants on genetic factors and other biologic mechanisms which predispose thepopulation of this country, particularly the young, and the socio-economically dis-advantaged to diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, emphysema and other res-piratory distresses. These awards will maintain a separate identification so thatthey can be tracked to this initiative. Total Project Cost: $3 million to be shared by NCI, NHLBI, NIEHS, and NIAID dependent on the number and size of individual grant awards.

Thank you. Dr. K IRSCHSTEIN . Thank you. ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS Senator S PECTER . Thank you very much. There will be some ad- ditional questions which will be submitted for your response in therecord. [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but were submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the hear-ing:] QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER NIH DOUBLING : FUTURE IMPLICATIONS Question. What happens after doubling? What are NIH 's plans to maintain the ''doubled '' NIH after the 5th year \u2014how will we avoid large cuts in the number of new grants, and even the total number of grants, as NIH funding moves to a main-tenance level of some sort? Can you prepare some grant-funding scenarios for us sowe can see what the implications would be of maintaining NIH at biomedical infla-tion, as well as some higher levels, in the years beyond 2003? Answer. We recognize that Congress has stated its intention to double NIH 's budget by fiscal year 2003 and appreciate the support the Congress has providedin the past three years. For responsible management, we have begun to considerthe impact of similar increases in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 on NIH activities andbiomedical research in general, and to consider scenarios for support of research inthe years beyond fiscal year 2003. Any specific proposals for future NIH budgets,whether for overall budget requests or specific grant-funding, would be determinedthrough the normal Executive branch budget process that considers overall fiscalconstraints and competing priorities. Although at this time we cannot outline anyspecific proposals for NIH 's future activities, for the purposes of answering this question, below are some preliminary grant funding scenarios. For the purposes of answering this question, we have assumed increases of 15.2 percent in fiscal year 2001 over fiscal year 2000, and increases of 15.4 percent each285 in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003 that would complete a five-year doubling effort begun in fiscal year 1999. Using these assumptions, NIH estimates that by fiscal year 2003, we would fund nearly 12,000 competing RPGs, with average cost increases of 5 percent providedeach year for these awards. In answering this question, NIH assumed that ResearchCenters, Other Research, and Research and Development (R&D) Contracts wouldincrease by 16 and 18 percent in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003. NIH wouldmaintain full-time training positions (FTTPs) at a level of 16,446, with inflationaryincreases provided for stipends, tuition allowances, etc. NIH funding would need to continue to increase in real terms if the number of competing RPGs were to be maintained at the fiscal year 2003 level. For the threeyears following fiscal year 2003, if the NIH budget in total were maintained withincreases equal to the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index, currentlyestimated at approximately 3.6 percent, then the number of competing RPGs NIHcould fund would likely decrease by over 20 percent, or approximately 2,500 grants,from nearly 12,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 9,500 in fiscal year 2004. With the excep-tion of those mechanisms requiring payraises, other mechanisms would be held flat.In fiscal year 2005, numbers of grants would continue to decrease, dropping by overa thousand to 8,200. This would be nearly 3,800 and 32 percent fewer competingRPGs than in fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2006, numbers of competing RPGswould increase by 1,400 to 9,600, still well below the fiscal year 2003 level of 12,000competing RPGs. Alternatively, if NIH were to receive total increases ranging from 8 percent in fis- cal year 2004, to 10 percent in fiscal year 2005, and 7 percent in fiscal year 2006,we could maintain the number of competing awards at the fiscal year 2003 leveland avoid the increases and decreases described above. Inflationary average cost in-creases are assumed for RPGs and all other mechanisms. If, under a third scenario, NIH were to receive increases of approximately 10 per- cent, 11 percent, and 9 percent, respectively, between fiscal years 2004 -2006, the number of competing RPGs could be maintained at the fiscal year 2003 level ofnearly 12,000 and small increases above inflation would be provided in both com-peting RPGs and other research mechanisms. Average cost increases greater thaninflation for competing RPGs would recognize that future investigators will increas-ingly use scientific databases, sources of specialized animals and sophisticated in-strumentation to achieve scientific advances. NIH believes that sustained, stablesupport is vital to optimize the benefits of the long-term investment needed forprogress in biomedical research. More and more, we find that multidisciplinary teams are needed to solve big prob- lems in research. The laboratory of the future will almost assuredly be driven bycomputer applications and technologies. While recognizing the importance of RPGs,we see that other mechanisms offer unique opportunities to bring together multiple disciplines and centers to pursue research questions, and this scenario also providesmodest program growth for these other mechanisms. Under this approach, we havealso assumed continued expansion of clinical research programs in all mechanisms,including the Clinical Research Career Development programs, Clinical ResearchCenters, Cooperative Clinical Groups, and intramural clinical research in order tospeed medical breakthroughs at the bedside that will lead to improvements in treat-ments and interventions to decrease mortality and morbidity, and improve the qual-ity of life. In addition, we have assumed in the third scenario the same number ofFTTPs in our research training program as in fiscal year 2003, with inflationary in-creases for stipends. Modern facilities are required for molecular medicine and genetic research. Con- tinuing support of such infrastructure elements would also be a key component ofour overall strategy for sustaining capacity for world class medical research. Fur-thermore, it will be important for NIH to have sufficient capacity to manage re-search portfolios and to ensure appropriate stewardship of funds. Consequently,NIH's Research Management and Support activity and the Office of the Director would receive adequate increases to enable NIH to continue to assure the publicthat its trust is well founded. The fiscal year 2001 President 's Budget proposed a strategy of providing average cost increases of 2 percent over fiscal year 2000 for RPGs, to control the growth ofcontinuing commitments and support planned new and expanded initiatives. If NIHcontinues on the doubling path, then we can consider different approaches for man-aging funding increases in the best interest of scientific progress and long-termbudgetary discipline. The pace of new discoveries in the biomedical sciences is now occurring at a breathtaking rate. The explosion of new knowledge that has resulted from our explo-rations of the human genome and the biology of the cell is providing new opportuni-286 ties to further understand disease, as well as new and innovative ways of treating, diagnosing, and preventing illness. Untapped resources for developing and testingnew ideas \u2014in other words, unused capacity \u2014will remain available in the research enterprise in the future. The more new ideas that are explored and the more rapidthe effort, the sooner these findings will be available for translation into medicalpractice. NIH looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that NIH 's funding in- creases support the highest quality research in a fiscally manageable and respon-sible manner. STEM CELLS Question. When will you begin funding research grants involving embryonic stem cells provided they meet peer review? Answer. NIH will consider requests for new funds, supplemental funds or use of ongoing grant or intramural funds as soon as the NIH Guidelines are finalized andthere is an oversight process in place. Question. What do you think has been the negative impact on stem cell research from the year and half long delay we have had waiting for the NIH guidelines tobe put in place? Answer. As soon as it is possible to use federal funds for this research, more re- searchers will be able to participate and contribute to this new arena of biomedicalinvestigation. As more people are involved, it is conceivable that progress may pro- ceed more quickly. Question. Some have raised concerns about fetal tissue research and possible vio- lations of the law concerning profiting from the sale of fetal tissue research. Do NIHfunded scientists spend more than the appropriate funds charged for fetal tissue?Or do they pay a flat fee that simply covers the cost of processing and transportingthe tissue? Answer. All NIH funded researchers are required to follow the local, state and Federal laws governing fetal tissue research. There is a Federal law that prohibitsan individual or entity from profiting from sale of human fetal tissue. It also pro-hibits any individual or entity from knowingly acquiring fetal tissue from anotherentity for ''valuable consideration. '' According to this law, ''valuable consideration '' does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implanta-tion, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue. Vio-lation of this statute carries criminal penalties. There is no evidence that NIH fund-ed researchers spend more than appropriate charges. Appropriate charges for proc-essing and transportation of fetal tissue may or may not take the form of a ''flat fee.'' Question. How would stem cell research be impacted if fetal tissue research were restricted? Answer. If Federally funded researchers were no longer permitted to conduct re- search using fetal tissue, they would not be able to either derive human pluripotentstem cells from fetal tissue or conduct research using human pluripotent stem cellsderived from fetal tissue. GRANTS REVIEW PROCESS Question. This Subcommittee receives many complaints from advocacy groups that certain fields of research are underfunded because of the current structure of thegrant review system. What are you doing to address the concerns of researchers andadvocates in those underfunded fields? Answer. The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) conducts the review of approxi- mately three-fourths of the grant applications submitted to NIH, including almostall investigator-initiated applications. The study sections that review these applica-tions were established over a period of many years. Although the content of thescience reviewed in CSR 's study sections has evolved as the research enterprise de- veloped, there had never been a systematic assessment of whether the current studysections are appropriate for the review of today 's (and tomorrow 's) scientific opportu- nities in the health-related research areas. In 1998, CSR convened a distinguished panel (the Panel on Scientific Boundaries for Review) of scientific leaders from diverse fields of biomedicine to conduct anoverall assessment of the structure and functions of its peer review system, and topropose changes needed to better align the system with the current research land-scape and scientific opportunities. The Panel engaged in extensive outreach to thebroad research community so as to solicit input and encourage dialogue. The Phase1 recommendations were posted on the web for several months, and over 800 com-ments from professional societies and individual researchers were received and con-287 sidered. Numerous meetings and teleconference calls were held among Panel mem- bers, the director of CSR and her staff and concerned representatives from advocacygroups and professional societies. A revised Phase 1 report was presented and ac-cepted by the CSR Advisory Committee in January, 2000. The thrust of the pro-posed reorganization involves the distribution of research grant applications for re-view to a group of committees that form a cluster focused on a particular diseaseor organ systems, in order to stimulate the identification of the best scientific ap-proaches to such a unit. The second phase of the Panel 's activity has just begun and will define the bound- aries of the individual study sections that will populate the new clusters of reviewgroups. Again, this will be accomplished with extensive participation by the relevantresearch communities, which will ensure that new directions and newly-emergingscientific areas will be accommodated and that all types of research approaches willreceive a fair and appropriate review. An implementation plan for Phase 2 has beendeveloped and posted on the NIH website, and CSR is currently beginning work onthe first new cluster of study sections. In addition to the major re-structuring of CSR, individual Institutes have re- sponded to advocacy groups by (1) organizing workshops to identify potential re-search opportunities for the development or refinement of diagnoses, and therapiesand the further understanding of specific diseases, and (2) issuing specific requestsfor applications (RFAs) that address areas that are recognized to require stimula- tion. Responses to these RFAs are reviewed by special review committees convenedspecifically for that purpose by the funding Institutes. Question. Some institutes are taking steps to involve members of the public on certain scientific peer review panels. How are these efforts working out? What con-tributions can lay reviewers make to the process? Answer. The National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and In- fectious Diseases, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Insti-tute on Drug Abuse involve members of the public on their peer review panels. Adescription of their involvement follows: National Cancer Institute The NCI has increasingly involved consumers on Institute-based scientific peer re- view panels for grant applications and contracts proposing clinical trials of new can-cer treatments. NCI has expanded the involvement of members of the public to in-clude lay reviewers/consumers on all NCI scientific peer review panels for clinicaland population based research. This includes review panels for Cancer Centers, Co-operative Clinical Trials Groups, Specialized Programs of Research Excellence(SPOREs), clinically oriented Program Projects, and projects submitted in responseto Requests for Applications (RFAs). Most Cancer Center, Cooperative Group, andProgram Project applications require a site visit to the applicant institution priorto the formal review committee meeting, and consumers participate in the site visitas well as in the subsequent review committee for these applications. NCI reviewstaff worked with the NCI Office of Liaison Activities (OLA) and the NCI Director 's Consumer Liaison Group (DCLG) to develop criteria for selecting consumer review-ers. In response to input from consumers, NCI developed a Consumer 's Guide to Peer Review and a Consumer 's Cancer Dictionary for Peer Review to facilitate par- ticipation of lay members on review panels. Consumers have been used in almost60 reviews during the past 18 months. Consumers participate actively in discussions, present the patient perspective in discussion, and vote on the applications. Consumers provide an important additionalperspective on the proposed research in the following areas: factors that may affectstudy design; feasibility of plans for patient recruitment, retention and follow up ofsubjects; feasibility of protocols in regard to specific populations (e.g., complexity,compliance); clarity and patient acceptability of protocols; feasibility of protocols inthe context of total patient care; cultural and socioeconomic aspects of protocol im-plementation; outreach and special challenges (e.g., need for multi-cultural researchstaff, composition and role of the Community Advisory Board, etc); and ethicalissues, including human subject protection, adequacy of informed consent forms andinclusion of women, minorities, and children in clinical research. In addition, asthey review applications, they may consider whether the proposed research is appli-cable to cancer in terms of prevention, cause, detection, treatment, care, quality oflife, and/or other pertinent issues. Feedback to NCI from both consumers and sci-entific reviewers is obtained and indicates that the system is working very well. One striking effect of use of consumers in the peer review process has been its effects on applicants. There has been a noticeable increase in documented consumerinput in research proposals as evidenced by the participation of consumers in var-ious structural and advisory capacities within applicant organizations.288 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases The use of members of the public on NIAID review committees, where they can contribute essential insights to the overall evaluation, is a thoroughly consideredand well-precedented practice that NIAID considers to be an important componentof the responsible conduct of the peer review of patient oriented research. Publicmembers make important contributions and can bridge the communication andknowledge gap between scientists and the patient base they serve. The NIAID hasbeen actively involving members of the public on certain scientific peer review pan-els over the last ten years, and the following data summarize some of the experi-ences: \u2014Public members bring very unique multi-faceted perspectives of the disease/con- dition/subject to the review group resulting in better decisions. \u2014They have a very high interest in the research and the process of thorough eval- uation of applications to determine which have the best scientific merit. \u2014Their knowledge of certain diseases and the people affected by those diseases enables the public members to provide valuable input and expertise as review-ers and to raise important questions in several aspects of the research, for ex-ample, clarity of protocols, consent forms, and the feasibility of complicated pro-tocols for certain patients. \u2014Since at least 1991, the NIAID special review committees have included patient and lay representatives of the target populations for selected large clinical ef-forts including: the AIDS Clinical Trials Groups (ACTG), the Pediatric ACTG,the Women 's Interagency HIV Study, the Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study, and the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group. However, the NIAID does not includemembers of the public on committees in which patient recruitment and reten-tion is not an issue, for example, basic science initiatives. \u2014The NIAID believes that proposed research efforts, the overall success of which depends upon the successful recruitment and retention of patient populations,must be evaluated on the quality, appropriateness, and feasibility of the pro-posed plans for recruitment and retention. So important is this aspect of theplans that the review criteria specifically include recruitment, retention, and re-lated community outreach issues. \u2014As with selection of any reviewer, special care needs to be taken to select indi- viduals with the appropriate expertise. The NIAID also believes the review committees need to include all types of exper- tise relevant to making an informed assessment of the merit of the applications, andthat patients or members of the public provide insights regarding the quality, appro-priateness, and feasibility of plans for recruitment, retention, and community out-reach. This is viewed as one of the essential types of expertise that should bebrought to bear upon the overall judgement. Public members of the NIAID review committees have review assignments in which they are asked to comment on the recruitment, retention and outreach as-pects of the proposals. Their contributions are generally valued and appreciated byother (scientific) reviewers. They are full-scoring participants in the review meetingand constitute a small percentage of the voting members of any of these review com-mittees. Like all reviewers, the public members are asked to comment on aspects of the applications related to their personal expertise, and to score the applications onoverall merit as best they can, having listened to the discussion of all other review-ers. In our experience, the scores assigned by the public members have been re-markably consistent with scores assigned by other reviewers. In summary, the NIAID applauds the efforts of members of the public on peer review committees, and recognizes that additional members may contribute a per-spective that is perhaps sometimes difficult for a scientific specialist to appreciate. National Institute of Mental Health Public participant reviewers have successfully served for a year on the NIMH 's service and interventions review committees. Public reviewers included individualswho have suffered from mental disorders, family members of those suffering frommental disorders, policymakers in the mental health care arena, and mental healthcare providers. All committee members were asked for their assessment of how wellthe process worked. The most common feedback was that the inclusion of public re-viewers was useful and that the public reviewers had done an excellent job. Thepublic reviewers, many of whom experienced the committee process for the firsttime, were impressed with the efforts of the committee members and the seriousand objective nature of the deliberations. NIMH will continue to request feedbackfrom all reviewers to help inform and improve the process of public participationin its review meetings. Future plans are to help public reviewers focus on the review289 issues to which they can best contribute such as determining public health impor- tance and human protection issues, and to continue adding and training new publicreviewers to ensure a broad diversity of opinions and experiences. National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA is in the process of planning the recruitment and training of public con- sumers to act as reviewers for the treatment and services review panels. These pub-lic members will provide an important point of view, commenting on issues such asfeasibility of the research, practicality of the proposed intervention, and appropriate-ness of human subjects protections. NIH BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES Question. Dr. Fischbach and Dr. Hyman, the Budget requests funding for a new National Neurosicence Research Center, at a cost of $73.3 million. How will this ''in- tegrated neuroscience program '' enhance neuroscience research at the NIH? Will the broader research community benefit from this? Answer. The most significant feature of the integrated neuroscience program is that it will speed the translation of scientific discoveries into new, clinically usefulstrategies for disease prevention and treatment. Sustained interactions betweenbasic and clinical scientists are needed so that each group can be better informedabout the opportunities offered by the other. In the more typical academic model,basic neuroscientists are segregated in one or more preclinical departments, quiteremoved from colleagues in clinical departments of neurology, psychiatry, neuro-surgery, medicine, and anesthesiology. Input from the engineering, mathematicsand physical sciences is minimal. This new integrated neuroscience program has arare opportunity to set a high standard for the entire nation by ''putting the brain back together '' without regard to the artificial boundaries of Institute or medical school organization. Beyond the obvious medical disciplines, we will integrate bio-engineering, computational science and bioinformatics as more equal partners in re-search in the neurosciences. In so doing, we will support and enhance the patient-oriented research that will be conducted in the new Mark Hatfield Clinical ResearchCenter. Each of the Institutes that will participate in this program was created with a distinct patient population in mind, and they fund research that is of special inter-est to their different constituencies. However, they share many areas of neuro-science research. For example common mechanisms of nerve cell degeneration prob-ably underlie Alzheimer 's disease, vascular dementia, blindness, hearing loss, and stroke. Common alterations in the actions of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine,probably underlie thought disorders such as schizophrenia, movement disorderssuch as Parkinson 's disease, substance abuse problems including alcoholism, and the suffering due to chronic pain. Thus, the mission of each Institute would be bet-ter served by a coordinated effort on the NIH campus. We plan to bring together, under one roof, NIH scientists who are now isolated from one another simply because of outdated historical precedents. Research will beorganized, and resources allocated, according to scientific themes, not Institute iden-tity. We will also cooperate in filling gaps in our research programs by recruitingthe very best new scientists to the NIH campus. The broader research community will benefit in many ways. One of the most ex- citing elements of this plan is the opportunity to attract and train the most talentedyoung scientists, many of whom will return to the extramural community. We alsoenvision enhanced opportunities for intramural-extramural collaboration, both onspecific projects and through mechanisms that will allow the appointment of aca-demic scientists to short-term positions at NIH. In addition to bringing individuals and teams of scientists together, the program will provide unprecedented opportuni-ties for extramural scientists to take advantage of resources such as animal models,genetic tools, and state-of-the-art imaging devices. Perhaps most importantly, ourprogram will serve both as a model to reinforce similar efforts in the broader com-munity and as a template for developing strong neuroscience research programs ininstitutions that do not presently have them. Question. Is this $73 million the total cost of the entire project, or is there another phase to come later, and if so, how much is the total cost? Answer. The B&F request includes $47.3 million in fiscal year 2001 and requests advance appropriations of $26 million in fiscal year 2002 for the initial phase of con-struction to replace Building 35. In fiscal year 2000 the NIH plans to request a re-programming of $5 million from other B&F projects to fund the design/constructiondocuments for the initial phase of construction. We are considering a second phaseto the NNRC project. A decision on the scope and cost of any potential phase willbe made through the normal Executive branch budget formulation process.290 Question. What types of research will you be able to conduct in the new center that you are unable to do with your present facilities? Answer. As noted earlier, we believe the planned center will provide an optimal environment for translational research. However, its distinguishing feature will notbe research on specific topics so much as an innovative process and environment forconducting interdisciplinary, collaborative research without regard to organizationalboundaries. The importance of this can hardly be overstated in the context of whatmodern neuroscience is teaching us about the brain and its disorders. Question. Are other important activities needing B&F funds being put on hold in order to undertake this project? Answer. The fiscal year 2001 B&F request provides a level of funding to initiate or continue support for three of the highest priority projects of the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH): the National Neuroscience Research Center (NNRC), theCentral Vivarium, and the Modernization of Building 6. The remaining funds in therequest are sufficient to maintain continuity of essential and enabling projects insupport of the research facilities infrastructure of the NIH. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE Question. Dr. Klausner, shortly after you became NCI Director, you began a new research initiative called the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project to identify all of thegenes involved in cancer. Can you tell us whether that project has produced any re-sults? Answer. This project has been extremely successful, identifying tags for the vast number of human genes, annotating what types of cells and cancers express thosegenes, developing catalogues of chromosomal changes in cancer and discovering com-mon genetic variations that will help to explain why individuals are different intheir risk of getting cancer, their sensitivity to diet and the environment and theirresponses to therapy. CGAP has become one of the most widely used sources of in-formation and reagents in the research world (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ncicgap/). In the past three years, the CGAP Tumor Gene Index has discovered more than 40,000 previously unknown expressed human genes, representing about one-half ofall known human genes and has produced more than 900,000 DNA sequences.CGAP has discovered approximately 3,800 previously unknown genes expressed inthe breast, colon, lung, ovary, and prostate and has now extended this analysis toall major forms of cancer. These new genes are already the subject of follow-up stud-ies to assess their potential for defining molecular signatures for normal, precancer,and cancerous tissue. We expect that having these molecular signatures of cancer will afford new oppor- tunities to catalyze all areas of cancer research including cancer predisposition, de-velopment, prevention, detection, prognosis, and therapy. For example, CGAP dis-coveries may provide the platform for molecular signatures of the earliest stages ofcancer development, thereby facilitating prevention research. In the area of therapy, understanding the molecular nature of cancer will spur efforts to develop new drugs with improved effectiveness and reduced side effectsbecause the drug design will be based the precise molecular profiles of tumors andthe patients. In addition, identifying early molecular events in cancer will affordnew opportunities to therapeutically target earlier stages of cancer development.NCI is working actively to build a strong interface of CGAP with the basic and clin-ical research communities in academia and industry to assure that these new re-sources are effectively utilized. In addition, the NCI will continue to build additional infrastructure (data, tech- nology, informatics tools) to assure that maximal value is obtained from the CGAPproject. Toward that end, the NCI has implemented several CGAP inter-relatedcomponents designed to provide an information and technology infrastructure forthe biomedical research community. One of these components, the human tumorgene index (TGI), was fully implemented in May 1997 with the initial goal of identi-fying genes expressed during development of tumors in five major cancer sites \u2014 breast, colon, lung, ovary, and prostate. For breast cancer, the TGI has producedmore than 17,000 DNA sequences from 11 cDNA libraries derived from humanbreast tissue and tumors, resulting in the categorizing of about 5,700 genes ex-pressed in human breast cancer. Active efforts in the research community are being directed at assessing the po- tential value of these newly discovered genes as markers for cancer development.These projects include laboratory studies of how environmentally-induced genetic al-terations leading to altered function of a mutant protein contribute to the abnormalgrowth pattern which characterizes tumors. Epidemiologic studies too are focusingon the role of genetic variations possibly induced by environmental agents. Of par-291 ticular interest are studies of the enzymes which metabolize environmental agents or steroid hormones, and alterations in the genes which code for these enzymes. Question. What is NCI 's/NIH 's role in international cancer research? Please de- scribe for the committee what NCI 's role has been in the development of the historic All-Ireland Cancer Center. Answer. NCI, in cooperation with extramural institutions and the Fogarty Inter- national Center of the NIH, supports international health research through bilateralagreements, grants, and contracts. The Institute supports some 1,000 Visiting Sci-entists and Exchange Scientists. The work of outstanding scientists throughout theworld is supported through fellowships, cooperative projects, exchanges of personneland materials, and workshops. During fiscal year 1999, NCI obligated approxi-mately $45 million for foreign grants and contracts, the NIH Visiting Program, bi-lateral scientist exchanges, workshops, and international dissemination of cancer in-formation. NCI 's international effort, coordinated by the Office of International Af- fairs (OIA) within the Office of the NCI Director, works in conjunction with pro-grams within NCI 's divisions, at other NIH Institutes and the Fogarty International Center. The All Ireland \u2014National Cancer Institute Cancer Consortium The NCI has recently embarked on an international partnership with the devel- oping Cancer Programs on the Island of Ireland (Northern Ireland and the Republicof Ireland) in an attempt to improve the quality and range of cancer services avail- able for patients in Ireland. This Transatlantic Partnership, called the All Ireland-NCI Cancer Consortium seeks to strengthen cancer treatment, education and re-search programs as the cancer communities from both the Republic of Ireland andNorthern Ireland prepare to join in a unique agreement with the US National Can-cer Institute. I and several members of my staff had worked closely with Chief Med-ical Officers of both Irish governments and other key Ireland officials to develop thisconcept, and we were greatly facilitated in this endeavor by our Irish ex-colleaguesat the NCI. Cancer is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity on the Island of Ireland with Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland having one of the highest inci-dence and mortality rates for cancer in the Western World. Currently there are ap-proximately 28,000 new cases and approximately 11,000 deaths from cancer eachyear. Therefore, the development/improvement of services for cancer patients hasbeen a top priority for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Given theNCI's leadership in the cancer field, the leadership of Northern Ireland and the Re- public of Ireland felt it was timely to bring international expertise such as the NCIon board as partners in an effort to fuel the further development of cancer servicesin Ireland. The major components of the NCI Ireland Agreement include the fol-lowing: Education and exchange of scholars Education forms one of the major platforms of this Agreement through the sup- port of educational programs for Medical, Nursing and Scientific Staff. These pro-grams will include the exchange of scholars, including Ph.D., M.D., and nursing stu-dents. Particular emphasis will be given to the exchange of medical and nursingtrainees focused on clinical research. This will have an immediate clinical impactand will naturally extend the support that has already been given to the trainingof medical and scientific trainees from the Island of Ireland. Further exchangeswould include Ph.D. students, laboratory based M.D.s in training, clinical visitingprofessors and investigators from the US wishing to extend their studies in Ireland. Clinical Trials Another major area for partnership will be the enhancement of clinical trials in- frastructure and clinical trial development. Modernization of cancer care requiresplacing cancer delivery in the context of evidence based medicine. This requires avigorous and contemporary clinical trials infrastructure that will center around theclinical trials infrastructure already established at the Northern Ireland CancerCenter and also the Clinical Trials organization in the Republic of Ireland. The NCIhas already commissioned the development of a new Clinical Trials Information Sys-tem (CTIS) which seeks as its goal to implement international standards in institu-tionally based clinical trials processes and has already committed significant re-sources to its implementation. The outcome of this element of partnership will bethat clinical trials performed in these institutions will immediately be compatiblefor collation, analysis and presentation with studies performed in the United States.Moreover, this system will allow participating centers to immediately conform tointernational standards. This proposal therefore permits participating institutions in292 Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to quickly achieve data management standards, which will exceed that of many institutions. Teleconferencing Some teleconferencing capabilities and linkages are already established between both partners in Ireland and the NCI. The further investment in this infrastructurewill facilitate cooperative clinical trial development, education programs, patientservices development and exchange of clinical and scientific ideas. Communicationswill be essential to the success of this partnership. Tumor Registries Another area for major collaboration and partnership will be in the use of the Cancer Tumour Registries in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The monitoring of improvements in cancer care can only be a success with a reliabletumor registry that tracks population based cancer incidence and mortality. Theseregistries are now available in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,and both Governments recognize their importance. The NCI will assist both tumorregistries by developing a common data base that can assist in consultation,informatic tools and quality control. The consolidation of the Registries in both theNorth and South will improve the overall quality of data collection and provide in-formation on a genetically stable population. This will also act as a major tool formajor epidemiological investigations and development. Developments in Cancer Clinical Services The NCI Ireland partnership assists in the further development of cancer clinical services programs on the Island of Ireland. This includes the improvement andstandardization of Radiation Oncology practice and the development of a consoli-dated Radiation Oncology program for research. There are a limited number of radi-ation facilities on the Island of Ireland and there are significant needs in terms oflinking practice elements and the implement of uniform standards of practice. Theassistance in standardizing and driving the development of clinical services will alsoextend to elements of Medical and Surgical Oncology Practice as well as PalliativeCare. The development of Palliative Care Services is already at a very advancedstage on the Island of Ireland and is one that the National Cancer Institute willbenefit from in terms of its own developing programs. The NCI-All Ireland Cancer Conference The NCI-All Ireland Cancer Conference held in Belfast in October 1999 was an important event that highlighted the commencement of this special relationship.This Conference touched on clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, and political issuesthat are pertinent to the care of cancer patients. It highlighted important work byIrish, American and European Scientists coupled with input from well-known inter-national academic and biotechnology investigators from across the world. This inter-national expertise was asked to discuss their areas of expertise and comment onclinical and scientific programs that may help improve North and South interaction and Transatlantic collaboration. All NCI investigators were invited to participate inthis conference. Finally, the Conference punctuated the start of a very special interaction on the Island of Ireland focused on the overall development of cancer services for patientsand also signaled the start of an important partnership between the NCI and thepracticing cancer community in Ireland. Question. What process does NCI use to set priorities? How does this relate to the Bypass Budget initiatives? Answer. To support the full range of research activities necessary to conquer can- cer, NCI uses a complex and dynamic process to set our scientific and funding prior-ities. This process is driven by several principles. Support the full range of researchactivities necessary to conquer cancer: \u2014Strive for a balanced portfolio of research in behavior, epidemiology, control, prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, rehabilitation, andend of life issues; \u2014Give attention to the spectrum of distinct diseases we collectively refer to as cancer and the various populations that experience these diseases differently; \u2014Link all pieces of the cancer research enterprise through translational research; \u2014Rely on our diverse constituencies to help us identify new opportunities, gaps, and barriers to progress, create new programs, and improve existing ones. We integrate priority setting into all of our strategic planning activities. These ac- tivities include identifying high priority scientific opportunities, determining whatis needed to build and maintain our research infrastructure, and examining whatis being done and what needs to be done to tailor broadly applicable research to spe-293 cific cancers. All planning activities involve significant participation from our advi- sory groups and the advocacy community. Extraordinary Opportunities for Investment \u2014Identifying Extraordinary Scientific Opportunities ''Extraordinary Opportunities '' are areas where focused efforts and increased re- sources could produce dramatic progress toward reducing the burden of cancer. NCIidentifies and prioritizes, with formal input from cancer scientists, educators, advo-cates, and other cancer community leaders, opportunities that: \u2014Respond to important recent developments in knowledge and technology; \u2014Offer approaches that go beyond the size, scope, and funding of our current re- search activities; \u2014Can be implemented with specific, defined investments; \u2014Can be described in terms of achievable milestones, with clear consequences for investing; and \u2014Promise advances and progress against all cancers. NCI Challenges \u2014Building Critical Research Infrastructure NCI plans for and supports research through a variety of mechanisms, many of which provide funds tailored to specific research processes. As part of an ongoingprocess of review and revitalization, NCI has instituted a series of external reviewsto guide us in strengthening our major research support programs. In the past fewyears, we have completed in-depth reviews of several programs: Cancer Centers,Cancer Control, Clinical Trials, Cancer Prevention, and the Development Thera-peutics Program. We prioritize and plan to ensure a research infrastructure that: \u2014Provides the vision, creative environments, and diverse resources needed to in- crease the number of discoveries and advances in cancer research and the sci-entific community 's ability to apply these findings to prevent and treat the many forms of cancer; \u2014Promotes and rewards innovative thinking, cross-fertilization of ideas, and en- hanced collaborations among government, academia, and industry; and \u2014Develops and maintains the cadre of scientists required to undertake the cancer research challenges of the future. Tailoring to specific cancers NCI must apply new discoveries and advances to specific forms of cancer. The pri- mary mechanism for cancer site-specific research planning at the NCI is theProgress Review Group (PRG). Each Progress Review Group is composed of promi-nent members of the scientific, medical, and advocacy communities who know thestate of the science intimately and can provide a thoughtful, considered assessmentof our portfolio and recommend activities that will speed our progress. PRG rec-ommendations give the NCI a framework to determine whether or not existing ini-tiatives and programs are sufficient to aid the research community in addressingpriority areas. Where gaps are identified, NCI modifies its plans to address unmet needs and encourages the research community to undertake projects in key areasby clearly indicating where NCI 's priorities lie. Participation from advisory groups and the advocacy community NCI actively seeks out expert advice from a variety of advisory bodies both within and outside the Institute. Scientific experts and consumer advocates on the Presi-dentially appointed National Cancer Advisory Board advise NCI 's Director on issues related to the National Cancer Program. The Board of Scientific Counselors andBoard of Scientific Advisors provide advice to NCI leadership on the progress andfuture direction of NCI 's Intramural and Extramural Research Programs respec- tively. The NCI Executive Committee, which includes NCI Division directors andother key advisors to the Director, meets regularly to make major policy and oper-ating decisions. The Director 's Consumer Liaison Group (DCLG) serves as a primary forum for discussing issues and concerns and exchanging viewpoints important tothe broad development of NCI program and research priorities. The DCLG alsohelps develop and establish processes, mechanisms, and criteria for identifying ap-propriate consumer advocates to serve on NCI program and policy committees; andestablishes and maintains strong collaborations between NCI and the advocacy com-munity. The annual Bypass Budget request is a key tool that NCI uses to articulate the results of our on-going planning and prioritizing process. Due to new scientific dis-coveries, advances in technology, and the related changes in scientific thought, theBypass Budget request represents a snapshot, good for a relatively short time, ofwhere NCI 's planning and prioritizing process indicates we need to go to take ad- vantage of new scientific opportunities in cancer research. As a result, the Extraor-294 dinary Opportunities and NCI Challenge initiatives outlined in the fiscal year 2001 Bypass Budget request represents the focus of where NCI would put availablefunds. For example, with the $420.4 million increased funding NCI received for fis-cal year 2000, we seized the opportunity to implement many of the initiatives identi-fied in the Bypass Budget request. 83 percent of the funding increase, or $349.7 mil-lion of the $420.4 million increase, directly supported initiatives in the Bypass \u2014 $124.9 million supported Extraordinary Opportunities initiatives and $224.8 millionsupported NCI Challenges initiatives (see figure below). CLINTON /BLAIR JOINT STATEMENT Question. What was the significance of the joint statement issued by the President and Prime Minister Tony Blair? Was this statement intended to undermine researchefforts in the private sector? Answer. The President and Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed that it was impor- tant to take notice, at the the highest levels of their governments, of the progressthe two countries have made in human genomics and of the era of new opportunitiesunfolding before us. For that reason, they issued a joint statement of position tohelp ensure that human genomic discoveries are used as effectively as possible forthe advancement of human health throughout the world. The statement consistedof two equally important, complementary principles, designed to maximize scientificopportunities to understand the human genome, as well as medical and economicopportunities for the development of health care products. \u2014First, the statement reiterated the principle that raw fundamental sequence data from the human genome \u2014the ordering of the A 's, T's, C's, and G 's that make up DNA \u2014should be distributed as broadly as possible, in an unencumbered manner, for use by scientists around the world. This principlehas been a condition of funding by the Human Genome Project, which makesgenomic sequence data freely available over the Internet in a public databasecalled GenBank. New sequence data are deposited daily by Human GenomeProject participants. \u2014Second, the statement makes clear that intellectual property protection for gene-based inventions will play an important role in stimulating the develop- ment of health care products, which will in turn allow the public to realize the295 full medical benefits of the fundamental scientific discoveries. As a new genera- tion of medical discoveries begins to rely on gene-based technologies, it is essen-tial that we afford these technologies the kind of intellectual property protectionthat has enabled the development of every other wave of medical innovations. No. The complementary principles described in the statement are beneficial to both the private sector and the public. They reinforce the public-private partnershipthat has fueled the genomics and biotechnology enterprises, by enabling funda-mental biological discoveries as well as the entrepreneurship that can capitalize onthose discoveries and bring innovations to market. Key companies involved ingenomics were quick to issue statements endorsing the joint statement. HUMAN GENOME PROJECT Question. Why did talks breakdown between the public Human Genome Project negotiators and Celera Genomics? Do you see any way the public Human GenomeProject can maximize research dollars through collaborating with private sectorcompanies? Answer. Representatives of The Human Genome Project, Doctors Martin Bobrow, Francis Collins, Harold Varmus and Robert Waterston, met with representatives ofCelera Genomics Corporation on December 29, 1999, to discuss a possible collabora-tion to sequence the human genome. At that meeting Celera and Human GenomeProject (HGP) representatives presented quite divergent terms for such a collabora-tion. In a February 28, 2000, letter to Celera, HGP representatives summarized the December 29, 1999 discussion and described how specific terms for collaborationpresented by Celera would conflict with the underlying principles of the Human Ge-nome Project to make sequence data rapidly and freely available to all. On March7, 2000 Celera Genomics President, J. Craig Venter responded that Celera Genomicscontinues to be interested in pursuing good faith discussions toward collaboration.On March 9, Dr. Collins sent a letter to Celera indicating that he had received itsletter and would discuss possible next steps with the other HGP representatives. HUMAN GENOME Question. What are the likely developments in medicine over the next 10 years that will result from unraveling the human genome? Answer. The Human Genome Project will reveal all the human genes and many of the variations in DNA that make individuals unique and affect our susceptibilityto disease. Scientists will understand the genetic factors that influence the develop-ment of complex diseases \u2014like heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer 's disease, and cancer \u2014that are caused by several genes in interaction with each other and envi- ronmental influences. Detailed understanding of the molecular causes of disease willsuggest new treatments. In the next decade, predictive genetic tests will become available for a few dozen complex diseases. If you find you are at high risk for various ailments you will beable to adopt strategies (like changes in diet, lifestyle, medical surveillance, andtreatment with drug therapy) to reduce your risk of becoming ill. If you fall through that preventive medicine safety net and get sick anyway, new treatments will begin to be available. Some likely will be gene therapies. Others willbe drug therapies designed on the basis of an understanding of gene function. Thesetherapies will be more precisely tuned for the problem that you have and, becauseof early diagnosis, will be available at an earlier stage in the disease process. Thisnew generation of preventive and therapeutic interventions based upon your geneticinformation, which likely will come along first for cancer, will revolutionize medicineand improve our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat the diseases that afflict usand our families. While both parties are open to continued discussions about the terms of a possible collaboration, it remains unclear whether the specific terms that meet the distinctgoals of each of the two sectors are possible. Several productive public-private collaborations have marked the Human Genome Project during its short history. For example, several years ago, Merck & Company,Inc. decided to fund the generation of a public collection of human EST (ExpressedSequence Tag or gene snippet) sequences. More recently, on January 19, 1999 amemorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between Celera Genomics andthe Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project Group, a consortium of research groupsworking at the University of California at Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory, Baylor College of Medicine and Carnegie Institution of Washington. Thegroup is funded by the NIH, the Department of Energy and the Howard HughesMedical Institute. The MOU 's stated purpose was to produce a complete, annotated, and publicly accessible sequence of the Drosophila genome at a reduced cost and an296 accelerated pace. The DNA sequence of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster was published in Science on March 24, 2000. Presently, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is working with a consortium of groups to develop a plan to identify an estimated 700,000 sin-gle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (common areas in the human genome wherethe sequence varies by a single letter) over the next two years. The SNP Consortium(TSC) is a unique group of 10 pharmaceutical companies, IBM, Motorola and theWellcome Trust of the United Kingdom, in partnership with leading HGP academiccenters. Variant SNPs, that are identified, will be placed in the public domain forall to use. Many of the variants will be responsible for traits that distinguish oneperson from another. Others will be found to contribute to an individual 's risk of developing complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The NIHand TSC have been coordinating efforts since TSC 's inception. For example, efforts by both the NIH and TSC to discover SNPs are using DNA samples from the NIHSNPs resource so that data from the two efforts will be comparable. In addition, theSNP data generated from both projects are deposited in the public database, dbSNP.Finally, NIH and TSC investigators participate in joint scientific and technicalmeetings to share information and coordinate strategies. Each of these collaborations combine public and private resources to generate genomic information that is freely accessible, without restriction, to both public andprivate sector scientists. As a result, more information has been available to the sci-entific community more rapidly than expected. The NIH welcomes these opportuni-ties by which workable models for collaboration between the public and private sec-tors can be achieved. MOUSE GENOME Question. Why is it important to sequence the mouse genome if you already have the human genome? Answer. The human genome is a very complex structure that will take decades or even centuries to understand fully. One of the best tools for understanding it isto compare it with other genomes. For example, if a certain region in the mouse ge-nome is almost identical to the same region in the human genome, this is a cluethat the region codes for an important function. If the function of such a region ofthe mouse genome is known, it can be deduced that the function of the human re-gion is the same or is similar. Because we have been studying on mice for manyyears, we know a great deal about the biology of mice and mouse genes, an areathat is difficult to study in humans. As a result, the ability to compare mouse andhuman sequence is expected to provide a tremendous boost for understandinghuman genetics. For this reason, having the sequence of the mouse is critically im-portant. SEQUENCING OF THE HUMAN GENOME Question. A working draft is useful, but what are your plans for finishing the se- quence of the human genome to high accuracy? Answer. The Human Genome Project is committed to finishing the human se- quence to a level of high accuracy. This has been the goal from the beginning ofthe project and it has not changed. The current plan is for each group to finish thosesections that it has sequenced to the working draft status. An international workinggroup has been discussing the details of strategy for finishing the sequence over thelast few months and has come up with a plan that all have endorsed. The goal isto complete this by 2003, but it may well be possible to finish earlier. HUMAN GENOME Question. What plans does your institute have to encourage research on under- standing the genome, once the sequence is in hand? What role will computers playin this next phase? Answer. NHGRI has been supporting technology development for research on functional genomics for some time. Recently we have intensified our efforts by sup-porting two new initiatives. The first is the Mammalian Gene Collection in collabo-ration with the NCI. This project will assemble a catalogue of cloned and sequencedhuman genes and make them available to researchers. This collection will be a crit-ical tool for understanding the human genome. In addition, NHGRI will shortlyissue a request for applications for Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science. Thesecenters will focus on novel approaches to studying genomic questions. We expectthat they will become centers for technology development and computational biol-ogy, whereby new methodologies are created that assist scientists in understandingthe human genome sequence and how it functions.297 Databases, using computers, will store the information on DNA sequence, DNA variants, and a large amount of information on gene structure and function. Re-searchers will be able to access this information from their lab computers. Usingcomputers, they will be able to analyze the data to discover more about how geneswork, for example, by comparing human with mouse sequence to find genome re-gions important for gene regulation. They will also be able to use computers to makediscoveries by combining the genomic information with their own research results,such as mapping genes for diseases. CHILDREN AND DEPRESSION Question. Children and depression \u2014Dr. Hyman, you have often said that a de- pressed child is at quite a disadvantage in terms of ability to learn, form relation-ships, and develop overall in a healthy way. It is critical that each child in distresshave the best possible chance of being noticed and evaluated in a thorough, com-petent way. What effect might failure to do this have on the apparently increasingincidence of violence among children and adolescents? Answer. We can only speculate on this, as studies which would unravel the effects of untreated depression in children, for ethical reasons, have not been undertaken.We agree that children who are depressed can be identified, that valid assessmentapproaches are available, and that some treatments and preventive strategies, in-cluding school-based programs specifically for these children, have been rigorouslytested. A major problem is that too often these treatments and preventive ap-proaches are not available to children who need them. Instead unevaluated pro-grams are offered under the guise of providing a ''service. '' There have been several longitudinal studies of children with different patterns of risk, and these studies indicate that there is a cumulative and negative effect toignoring such risks. Children with certain patterns of risks may go on to exhibit se-rious behavior problems in adolescence. Many of these behavior problems can beavoided by early detection, careful assessment, and implementation of well-estab-lished intervention programs. Question. Suicide \u2014To what do you attribute rising suicide rates among young people? What can we do about this? Answer. In addition to a possible increase in the likelihood of reporting youth sui- cides, the rising youth suicide rates have been linked to increased substance useamong the nation 's youth. For example, an association between lower state drinking age and higher youth suicide rates has been shown. So far there are no proven prevention efforts shown to reduce youth suicide rates, and some school-based awareness programs have actually caused distress in vulner-able youth. NIMH and NIDA just released a program announcement encouragingresearchers to submit applications that test various approaches to preventing youthsuicidal behavior. Question. Dr. Hyman, can you tell us what you are doing to address the legal and ethical issues that may interfere with the need to do critical research on depressionand suicide? Should people who are (or who may be) suicidal be allowed to partici-pate? Answer. NIMH staff, and experts in (1) clinical research with suicidal patients, (2) bioethics, and (3) legal issues pertaining to liability risks with suicidal patientshave developed a draft document, Safety and Ethical Issues to Consider for Personsat High Risk for Suicidal Behavior in Intervention Trials. Its purpose is to proposeways to minimize risk and consider the ethical issues unique to conducting researchon suicidal behavior, in order to promote more research on effective interventionsto reduce suicidal behaviors. Currently, the draft is being circulated to OPRR staff,representatives from the National Advisory Mental Health Council, professional andlay advocacy communities, Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and Data Safety Moni-toring Boards (DSMB) members, and former research participants, for comment. As the draft was being developed, the audience in mind included researchers con- ducting clinical trials designed to reduce the rate of suicidal behaviors, and the IRBsand DSMBs that must review and monitor them. However, the document is also in-tended to be useful for researchers conducting any type of treatment trials aimedat reducing symptomatology in disorders known to carry a high risk for suicidal be-havior. The adequate incorporation of plans to increase safety, minimize risk, andconsider the ethical issues pertaining to individuals who may become suicidal intreatment trials, could allow more individuals who are at risk for becoming suicidalto participate in a greater number of treatment trials.298 NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE Question. Dr. Fischbach, your Institute recently undertook a major effort to produce a five-year research plan for Parkinson 's disease research. How can this kind of initiative advance the research into Parkinson 's disease and should this kind of process be duplicated for other disease research areas? Answer. The Parkinson 's disease research agenda proposes a comprehensive ap- proach \u2014understanding the disease, developing treatments, creating research capa- bilities, and enhancing the research process. We are optimistic that such an ap-proach will result in significant progress against Parkinson 's and other neurodegenerative disorders. It may prove to be a good model for many diseases.We were particularly pleased by the enthusiastic participation of leaders from theParkinson 's research community, from other fields that can contribute to the effort, and from the patient advocacy groups. NINDS embarked on a strategic planning process last year, and we continue to refine it in terms of next steps and procedures for implementation. The strategicplan is based on broad, cross-cutting themes (such as neurodegeneration), each oneof which touches on many disorders. The plan has already produced many initia-tives that address both basic neuroscience and specific disease problems. We planto complement this approach with additional plans focused on specific disorders, andbegan with Parkinson 's disease. Using a slightly different approach, we are collabo- rating with the National Cancer Institute to develop a plan for brain tumor re-search. We plan to proceed with other disease-specific plans at the rate of two orthree per year. Our view is that there are several useful models that can be employed (including the more traditional but highly effective approach of sponsoring workshops), depend-ing on specific disease issues and the state of the science. In general, however, wedo not favor the inclusion of funding proposals in long-range plans. We are con-cerned that a proliferation of such budget-oriented plans would decrease our abilityto take advantage of new, unexpected opportunities, both in terms of the specificdisease being reviewed and more broadly in other disease areas of interest. CONSENSUS CONFERENCE ON OSTEOPOROSIS Question. Dr. Katz, I understand that a Consensus Development Conference on Osteoporosis will be held at the NIH. What are the specific issues that this con-ference will examine? Answer. NIH held a Consensus Development Conference on Osteoporosis Preven- tion, Diagnosis, and Therapy on March 27 -29, 2000. The NIAMS was the primary organizer of this conference. Fellow sponsors included the NIH Office of Medical Ap-plications of Research, nine other NIH Institutes and Offices, and the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality. Well over 1,000 people attended presentationsduring the 3-day conference. Osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages. About 10 million people in the United States have osteoporosis, and an additional 18 million individuals areat increased risk for the disorder. The consensus panel was charged with addressing the following five questions: (1) What is osteoporosis and what are its consequences? (2) How do risks vary amongdifferent segments of the population? (3) What factors are involved in building andmaintaining skeletal health throughout life? (4) What is the optimal evaluation andtreatment of osteoporosis and fractures? (5) What are the directions for future re-search? In general, the panel found that nutrition, exercise, and medicines can play im- portant roles in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The panel noted thatmaintaining optimal bone health is a lifelong process that should begin in childhood.Bone mass attained during childhood is perhaps the most important determinantof life-long skeletal health. At all ages, physical activity and good nutrition, particu-larly adequate calcium and vitamin intakes, aid in developing and maintainingstrong bones. Exercise can also reduce the risk of falls, a major cause of fracturesin people with osteoporosis. While hormone replacement therapy remains a common treatment and prevention option; the panel suggested that more information is needed as to how estrogen re-duces the incidence of fractures. There are new medicines for preventing and treat-ing osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates and selective estrogen receptor modula-tors. New technologies have improved the detection of loss of bone mineral, a keypredictor of osteoporotic fracture, although the panel recognized that no standardexists for comparing different screening devices. The panel 's recommendations for future research included identifying and inter- vening in disorders that can impede the achievement of peak bone mass in children299 of ethnic diversity; improving diagnosis and treatment of secondary causes of osteoporosis, such as that resulting from the use of glucocorticoids (for example,prednisone); collecting data necessary to establish testing guidelines forosteoporosis; developing quality-of-life measurement tools that incorporate gender,age, and race/ethnicity; conducting randomized clinical trials of combination thera-pies to prevent or treat osteoporosis; and developing a paradigm for the manage-ment of fractures. SCREENING AND TREATING OSTEOPOROSIS Question. Do we have good screening mechanisms for osteoporosis? And once we diagnose an individual with osteoporosis are there adequate treatment protocols? Answer. Fortunately, research over the last decade has led to some very reliable methods for assessing bone mass/bone mineral density. Dual energy x-rayabsorptiometry (DXA) has been developed and used in some large studies that con-firm the association of low bone mineral density with high fracture risk. This tech-nology can assess the bone mineral density of two important sites of fracture in thebody \u2014the hip and the spine. The results of this test can be used to identify individ- uals at high risk of fracture who may profit from interventions designed to slowbone loss. There are several medications available to treat osteoporosis. Estrogen has the longest history in the prevention/treatment of osteoporosis. Two newer medicationscalled bisphosphonates are approved by the FDA for osteoporosis \u2014alendronate and risedronate. These medications are bone-specific and have been shown to reducefractures in clinical trials. Another approach to osteoporosis has been the develop-ment of Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). These drugs mimic thepositive effects of estrogen in the bone but have been modified to diminish some ofthe deleterious effects of estrogen on the breast and the uterus. Currently, there isone SERM that has been approved by the FDA for osteoporosis \u2014raloxifene. How- ever, this is an active area of research. NIH is sponsoring a workshop on SelectiveEstrogen Receptor Modulators April 26 -28, 2000, to develop a research agenda in this important area. OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA Question. I understand that in 1999 you supported a workshop on the develop- ment of new strategies for Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as brittle bone dis-eases. Can you summarize the outcome of that workshop? And please tell us howyour 2001 budget reflects these recommendations? Answer. In September of 1999 the NIAMS partnered with the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, the Children 's Brittle Bone Foundation, and the NIH Office of Rare Diseases to sponsor a meeting on Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). The goalwas to stimulate new clinical approaches to OI by calling attention to recent find-ings in several areas of basic biology and model systems. These areas include stemcell manipulation and gene therapy strategies, cell-matrix interactions, and the roleof growth factors and cytokines in bone turnover. The workshop also assessed recentadvances toward the ultimate goal of developing techniques for correcting the under-lying genetic defects in OI. In addition, recent observations suggest that the meta-bolic consequences of collagen defects, such as effects on the activities of osteoblastsand osteoclasts, play an important role in the pathogenesis of OI. Exploring thesenew findings could lead to therapeutic approaches, such as pharmacological inter-ventions, that could have an significant impact on the clinical management of OI.A number of research recommendations resulted from the workshop, and theNIAMS is currently assessing future research directions. The opportunities for basic research advances to move the field forward seem to be particularly promising. NIAMS is planning an initiative in fiscal year 2001 tocapitalize on the opportunity to better understand how the bone cells in patientswith osteogenesis imperfecta are programmed and can be re-programmed by thera-peutic intervention. OSTEOPOROSIS Question. With the aging of the population is osteoporosis becoming a problem for men, as well as women? And if so, do you recommend that men over 65 take advan-tage of bone density screening? Answer. Although American women are four times as likely to develop osteoporosis as men, an estimated one-third of hip fractures worldwide occur inmen. Studies have shown that men tend to develop osteoporosis about 10 years laterin life than women. This difference has been attributed to a higher peak bone massin men at maturity and to a more gradual reduction in sex steroid influence in300 aging men. The lifetime risk of older men for fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist is considerable, and the Institute is committed to providing a particular focus onosteoporosis in men, in addition to its extensive portfolio of research on osteoporosisin women. In fiscal year 1999, the NIAMS launched a major study of osteoporosisin men. This is a 7-year study that will enroll and then follow 5,700 men 65 yearsand older for an average of 4 to 5 years, and will determine the extent to whichthe risk of fracture in men is related to bone mass and structure, biochemistry, life-style, tendency to fall, and other factors. The study, which is supported in part bythe National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute, will also try todetermine if bone mass is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. As mentioned above, men tend to develop osteoporosis somewhat later than women. It is not clear that it would be advantageous to screen all men over 65.Rather physicians should be aware of some of the factors that place men at highrisk of an osteoporotic fracture such as previous low impact fractures, especiallyspine fractures that may be manifest by a loss of height, the use of certain drugslike prednisone, and the diagnosis of primary hyperthyroidism. In addition, low bodyweight and diseases that lead to malabsorption of food, or a family history of lowimpact fractures, may raise suspicion of low bone mass. MEDICARE AND OSTEOPOROSIS Question. Given the aging of our population, do you see the problems of treating bone diseases, which is paid for by the Medicare program, as one that will consume a large portion of the Medicare money in the next 20 years? Answer. The aging of the American population will certainly add to the number of individuals at risk of fractures. It is estimated that one out of two women willdevelop an osteoporotic fracture in her lifetime. Men have a lower risk but are in-creasingly living to an age when their fracture risk is also high. Serious efforts atthe prevention of bone loss need to be directed to reducing the number of individ-uals affected. Efforts directed at the young can be particularly important as the de-velopment of an adequate bone mass at maturity is important protection againstfractures later in life. These efforts need to be focused on increasing physical activ-ity, maintaining a healthy body weight and adequate calcium intake. The recentConsensus Development Conference on Osteoporosis estimated that only about 25percent of boys and 10 percent of girls ages 9 to 17 meet the calcium intake rec-ommendations of the Institute of Medicine. However, the seniors of the next few decades are already adults and there is a great deal that can be done to prevent bone loss in adults. In fact, some of the samepreventive measures that are effective in building bone mass in adolescence are ef-fective in maintaining bone mass later in life. Low physical activity in older popu-lations is a significant factor in bone loss but also affects the balance and coordina-tion that protect against falls. Active seniors have fewer falls and less serious ones.Calcium and vitamin D can also prevent bone loss, and their intake in senior adultsare seriously below the recommended levels. In some individuals at high risk of frac-ture, medications directed to slowing bone loss can be a cost-effective strategy. OSTEOPOROSIS Question. If the treatment of bone diseases is going to be a major expense to the Medicare program, do you think you and your fellow institute directors are investingenough money in bone research in order to improve the quality of life for our seniorsand to reduce the cost to Medicare? Answer. I am pleased to tell you that bone research is indeed a major priority for the NIH. A number of NIH components plus representatives from other agenciesparticipate in the Federal Working Group on Bone Diseases \u2014a collaboration that helps to coordinate research activities across the Federal government and providerecommendations for future research efforts. NIAMS supports bone research acrossthe full spectrum from basic studies on how bone is normally built up and how bonebreaks down in disease to clinical studies to improve our diagnostic and therapeuticabilities; and to prevention studies, especially those that target young people intheir prime years for building strong bones. We also support major clinical trialsthat are looking at the value of combining some of the available drugs for treatingosteoporosis, to determine the enhanced value that combinations of drugs may haveagainst osteoporosis. In addition, we have recently supported a Consensus Develop-ment Conference at the NIH on osteoporosis, and experts identified a number ofpromising avenues for the NIH to consider and pursue. Finally, in the area of infor-mation dissemination, the NIAMS and other ICs fund the NIH Osteoporosis and Re-lated Bone Diseases National Resource Center that provides comprehensive andtimely information to patients, their families, and their health care providers. While301 there are always opportunities for funding additional research, I believe that the NIH research efforts in bone \u2014those already underway as well as those planned for the future \u2014reflect the major priority we give to this area of research. MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Question. Why has NIAMS been unable to provide as many muscular dystrophy related single investigator grants as other institutes? Answer. The NIAMS, together with the National Institute of Neurological Dis- orders and Stroke (NINDS), considers research on the muscular dystrophies to bea priority area. We will continue to work with the extramural muscular dystrophyresearch community, as well as interested patient organizations, to stimulate andsupport promising studies in this area. In fiscal year 1999, the NIAMS investednearly $5.4 million in muscular dystrophy projects, an increase of over 40 percentfrom the previous fiscal year. A number of exciting studies with implications for our understanding of the mus- cular dystrophies have been supported by the NIAMS in recent years. One such in-vestigation used gene therapy to restore muscle function in a hamster model oflimb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). In another NIAMS-funded study, research-ers successfully used the common antibiotic gentamicin to restore the function of thegene that encodes for the protein dystrophin in mouse models of Duchenne musculardystrophy (DMD). In a third project, NIAMS-supported researchers used gene ther-apy in mice to give the body a boost in fighting the effects of aging on muscle, andto help repair the damage caused by injury and muscle-wasting disorders such asmuscular dystrophy. These projects underscore the potential of treating humanforms of LGMD, DMD and other muscular dystrophies with gene therapy ap-proaches. Another area of excitement relates to a new protocol developed with support from the NIAMS that makes it possible to obtain an almost unlimited number of a special class of adult stem cells from a small sample of bone marrow. These adult stem cellshave the ability to develop into cells of muscle, nerve, bone, cartilage and fat. Be-cause of their vast potential for differentiation, they may be excellent therapy vec-tors for a number of skeletal diseases, including muscular dystrophy. Next month, the NIAMS \u2014in partnership with the NINDS and the NIH Office of Rare Diseases \u2014will support two research meetings on muscular dystrophy. The first is an international scientific conference centered on clinical and molecular studiesof facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). The meeting will bring together research-ers who are already involved in FSHD projects, as well as scientists who are work-ing in related fields and may be able to contribute to progress on FSHD. The secondmeeting will focus on therapeutic approaches for DMD. This workshop is aimed ataddressing key questions in improving treatments for DMD, identifying areas ofneeded scientific knowledge, and the critical next steps to promote effective therapy.The NIH expects to build on the insights from these two meetings to develop newprogram initiatives related to the muscular dystrophies. Such initiatives would com-plement on-going efforts to stimulate research in this area, including the currentlyactive program announcement on the pathogenesis and therapies of the musculardystrophies. Question. Why is there no separate study section for muscle biology? Would a sep- arate study section enhance research and integrate efforts? Answer. The NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR), which conducts the peer re- view process, is currently involved in a comprehensive assessment of its study sec-tion structure, led by Dr. Bruce Alberts, the President of the National Academy ofSciences. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that CSR provides a rigorous,unbiased review system that facilitates the advance of all areas of biomedical re-search, including muscle biology. Indeed, muscle disease review issues are beingconsidered as part of the assessment. CSR will also be meeting with scientists atthe Duchenne muscular dystrophy workshop in May to discuss this and other re-view concerns. The outcome of these discussions will help guide future decisionsabout the review of muscle-related research grant applications. There is no simple answer to the question of whether a dedicated study section would enhance the success of muscular dystrophy research applications or otherwiseimprove coordination of muscle-related research. It is important to consider that theNIH receives a broad range of research applications on muscle functioning and dis-ease, and diverse areas of scientific expertise are required to review those applica-tions. Whether it is desirable \u2014or, indeed, even feasible \u2014to cluster all muscle re- search proposals into a single study section is one of the questions being exploredby the CSR assessment described above.302 MAGNETIC THERAPY Question. Has the use of magnets been proven scientifically? Answer. Todate, there have been only a few, rigorous, double-blinded, randomized trials investigating the efficacy of magnet therapy (e.g. Vallbona et al., 1997,Weintraub, 1998; Taylor et al, In press). Although the results of these trials suggestthat magnet therapy is more effective than placebo for pain management, a defini-tive statement on magnet therapy 's efficacy awaits completion of a large, multi-site randomized controlled trial. The research portfolio of the National Center for Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) includes rigorous studies of magnettherapy. Question. Are there any dangers in using magnets like sleeping on a magnetic pad or magnets in your shoes? I heard somewhere that they are not recommended forpeople with heart problems \u2014they cause problems with electrical currents. Answer. Static magnetic fields appear to be safe. In 1987, the World Health Orga- nization reported that ''the available evidence indicates the absence of any adverse effects on human health due to exposure to static magnetic fields up to two Tesla. '' Given that the typical static magnet used to treat disease produces a magnetic fieldof only a few thousands of a Tesla in strength, there is little intrinsic danger tousing magnet therapy. Supporting this contention, the few well-designed clinicaltrials investigating static magnets have not reported any severe adverse events as-sociated wit the intervention (e.g. Vallbona et al., 1997, Weintraub, 1998; Taylor etal, In press). Although no cause and effect was established, there has been one casereport of a person who developed a myeloma after sleeping on a magnetic mattressfor five years (Burns 1994). Concerning the use of static magnets by individualswith heart disease, there is conflict evidence whether low level electromagneticfields produce changes in heart rate (Cook et al., 1994; Korpinen and Partanen,1994) and blood pressure (Korpinen and Partanen, 1996). Until these issues are ad-dressed for static magnetic fields, caution might be suggested for individuals suf-fering from severe hypertension. Caution may also be advised for individuals withcardiac pacemakers or wearing cardiac infusion pumps. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR THAD COCHRAN INFECTIOUS DISEASE Question. The NIH has invested heavily in infectious disease research. We have done a good job of developing vaccines to combat many infectious diseases, includingHIV. However, one area that is of concern to me is that of drug resistance in infec-tious diseases. We now have bacteria that are becoming resistant to our last linesof antibiotic treatment. What is the NIH doing to insure appropriate use of antibiotics? What is the NIH doing to stimulate the development of new antibiotics to combat drug resistant bac-teria? Answer. The NIH co-chairs with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) an Interagency Task Forceon Antimicrobial Resistance. The initial public activities of this Task Force were an-nounced in the Federal Register, Vol. 64, No. 123, Monday, June 28, 1999. This wasin conjunction with a July 1999 public meeting organized by ten Federal agencies(the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, the Health Care Financing Administration, the HealthResources and Services Administration, the Agency for Health Care Research andQuality, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defense, the U.S.Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Veterans ' Affairs) to coordinate Federal programs relating to antimicrobial resistance. The purpose stated in thepreceding notice was ''To solicit input from invited consultants regarding items to be included in a Public Health Action Plan that, when published, will serve as ablueprint for activities of Federal agencies to combat antimicrobial resistance. ThePlan is being developed by a Task Force composed of Federal personnel from severalFederal agencies and departments, co-chaired by the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH. '' It should also be noted that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations report language forCDC mentions this existing Task Force and the recommendation that a report bedone within a year of enactment of the legislation \u2014the above mentioned Public Health Action Plan is in response to this report language. Accordingly, four focusareas were selected for grouping the discussions and outcome: Surveillance, Preven-tion and Control, Research, and Product Development. The issue of appropriate useof antimicrobials, including antibiotics, is within the purview of Prevention and Con-trol, and is addressed in the connotation of ''judicious use. '' The NIH is collaborating in the overall development of the Action Plan in the role of Co-Chair, and also plans303 to collaborate with the appropriate agencies coordinating any resulting actions relat- ing to judicious use of antimicrobials, principally the CDC and the FDA, for any ac-tion items that fall within the scope of the NIH mission. The NIH funds a diverse portfolio of grants and contracts to study antimicrobial resistance in major viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens. The NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) has a lead role in many of theseactivities, but numerous other Institutes and Centers at the NIH also support andparticipate in research related to antibiotic resistance. The NIH-funded projects include basic research on the disease-causing mecha- nisms of pathogens, host-pathogen interactions, and the molecular mechanisms re-sponsible for drug resistance, as well as applied research to develop and evaluatenew or improved products for disease diagnosis, intervention, and prevention. Nu-merous genome projects seek to identify new gene targets for the development ofdrugs and vaccines. Other NIH-sponsored activities with relevance to antimicrobialresistance include physician and researcher training and education. In addition, theNIAID supports a number of clinical trials networks with the capacity to assess newantimicrobials and vaccines with relevance to drug-resistant infections. Among theseare the AIDS Clinical Trials Groups, the Mycoses Study Group, the CollaborativeAntiviral Study Group, the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units, and the Tu-berculosis Research Unit. The NIAID supports contracts that screen for novel anti-tuberculosis drugs by testing in vitro and in animal models. The candidate drugsare selected for screening from submissions by academic and private sector re-searchers worldwide and from the National Cancer Institute 's (NCI) chemical repos- itory. With regard to other NIAID-specific projects, the Institute funds a diverse port- folio of grants examining antimicrobial resistance among the major nosocomial bac-terial pathogens, for example, multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus,enterococci, and Escherishia coli. Current research support is aimed at: \u2014Identifying new diagnostic techniques, novel therapeutics, and preventive meas- ures to minimize infection with resistant pathogens, prevent the acquisition ofresistance traits, and control the spread of resistance factors and resistantpathogens in hospital settings; \u2014Understanding the molecular biology and genetics of resistance gene acquisi- tion, maintenance, and transmission; \u2014Exploring novel approaches to combat resistance through passive or active im- munization; \u2014Identifying natural antimicrobial peptides that may prove useful as new classes of antibiotic-like drugs; and \u2014Through the use of molecular characterization, continuing efforts to determine the degree of spread of multi-resistant international clones of Streptococcuspneumoniae in the United States and the rest of the world. The NIAID is also creating a Bacteriology and Mycology Study Group to design and conduct multi-center clinical studies of interventions for serious fungal andhealthcare-associated resistant bacterial infections. Key aspects of the effort will beto: formulate and implement a scientific research agenda; establish a multi-centerclinical studies group; establish a clinical studies coordinating unit; provide leader-ship and organization of the study group; and conduct, complete, and report the re-sults of the clinical studies. This project will be funded in the spring of 2001. Finally, the NIAID recently released a Request for Applications (RFA), ''Challenge Grants: Joint Ventures in Biomedicine and Biotechnology. '' The purpose of this ini- tiative is to support research and development efforts whose outcomes could signifi-cantly reduce the impact of infectious diseases nationally and worldwide. The RFAwas issued in response to the fiscal year 2000 Public Health and Social ServicesEmergency Fund appropriation of $20,000,000 designated for ''NIH Challenge Grants and Partnerships. '' This new initiative is intended ''to promote joint ventures between the National Institutes of Health and the biotechnology, pharmaceutical,and medical device industries '' and involves a ''one-on-one matching of federal dol- lars by qualified organizations that are conducting R&D activities in biomedical re-search or biotechnology with commercializable potential or conducting research inpromising therapies. '' The NIAID has identified areas of high importance where it believes successful product research and development combined with existing infrastructures and fed-eral challenge grant funding could significantly impact a major health or medicalproblem. Bacterial drug resistance is an evident area of focus in this solicitation intwo specific areas: tuberculosis (TB), and emerging and resistant infections, includ-ing drug resistant staphylococci and enterococci. It is the intention of these challenge grants to encourage the private sector to de- velop new TB drugs, including: identification of potential new drug targets and304 novel classes of drugs (making use, where appropriate, of the Mycobacterium tuber- culosis genome sequence and high throughput approaches); preclinical developmentof novel classes of drugs and optimization of lead compounds; and clinical testingof potential new therapies. The NIAID also seeks to encourage the private sectorto increase its commitment to TB vaccine development through these challengegrants. In particular, it encourages the use of whole genome approaches for theidentification of promising protective antigens, and the development of both pre-ex-posure and post-infection candidate vaccines from pre-clinical through clinical test-ing. Similarly, through the challenge grants mechanism, the NIAID seeks to interest the private sector in pursuing preclinical and clinical studies of passive or active im-munization candidates to protect against resistant staphylococcal infection, first inthe most vulnerable populations such as severely-ill hospitalized patients and pa-tients facing major surgery and at risk for infection, and then also for potentiallybroader application to community situations. Novel therapies, such as bacteriophagetherapy, will be considered as candidates for study for enterococci. PARKINSON 'S DISEASE Question. The committee just received the Parkinson 's Disease Research Agenda from your office. Do you agree with the report that a cure for Parkinson 's is now a comprehensive goal if a comprehensive approach is pursued? Answer. A cure for Parkinson 's is a realistic goal, given what is known about the disease and the research tools now available to us. The research agenda proposesa comprehensive approach \u2014understanding the disease, developing treatments, cre- ating research capabilities, and enhancing the research process. We are optimisticthat such an approach will result in significant progress against Parkinson 's and other neurodegenerative disorders. Question. Is the NINDS sufficiently staffed to implement such a plan? Answer. The plan reflects our best professional judgment as to what could be ac- complished if funding were available to implement all aspects of the research agen-da, but without taking into account fiscal constraints or other competing prioritiesof NIH and the rest of the Federal government. In order to do this, more staff wouldbe required to develop the necessary initiatives and work collaboratively with theresearch and patient communities. DIABETES Question. One of NIH 's initiatives for 2001 deals with genetics research and ex- ploiting genomic discoveries. One area where genetics research could be essential isin the area of diabetes, especially juvenile diabetes. Do genomic discoveries show promise in the area of juvenile diabetes and is fund- ing sufficient to do this? Answer. Type 1 diabetes has a strong genetic determinant, in which more than one gene is believed to play a role. These genes make some individuals more suscep-tible to developing diabetes than others. In addition, genetic factors may cause someindividuals with diabetes to be more prone to developing the serious and life-threat-ening complications associated with type 1 diabetes. Knowledge of the genetic de-fects underlying diabetes will be critical not only for identifying individuals at riskfor diabetes and its complications, but also for identifying targets for effective treat-ment and prevention. The NIDDK is attempting to provide cutting-edge genetics and genomics resources to our investigators. We have already begun to move in this direction, with a bio-technology initiative on microarray technology that will be useful to diabetes re-searchers and other NIDDK investigators, and with a major effort planned for a Di-abetes Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP) to locate and analyze the function of genesin all the various types of tissue relevant to diabetes. Start up of the DGAP initia-tive is currently slated for fiscal year 2001. The NIDDK envisions DGAP as a trans-NIH effort involving several Institutes with a research interest in diabetes and its complications. This project would collectgenomic information on the spectrum of genes expressed in all tissues relevant todiabetes and its complications. It would build upon an ongoing NIDDK initiative onthe functional genomics of the developing pancreas. While our ongoing effort sup-ports the production and sequencing of complementary DNA libraries based on mul-tiple stages of pancreatic development, the DGAP would be much broader. Objec-tives would be to obtain full length cDNAs from tissues relevant to diabetes; to dis-cover novel genes in tissues affected by diabetes; to conduct expression profiling todetermine patterns of gene expression in disease; and to perform functional305 phenotyping of expressed products in tissues affected by diabetes. More importantly, this initiative \u2014if undertaken at a full-scale level \u2014would allow for the cataloging of all information obtained in a diabetes relational database with automated data min-ing and query support. This database would be developed and offered as a resourcefor all diabetes investigators and could be used in the development of new assays,identification of potential therapeutic agents, and points of departure for new stud-ies into diabetes and its complications. Information obtained through an initiativesuch as this has the potential to further our understanding of the causes and mech-anisms of diabetes, to identify targets for effective treatment and prevention, andto serve as a springboard for the development of future investigator-initiated, hy-pothesis-driven research. The degree to which we can undertake all components ofthis initiative and the timeline for implementation will be dependent on resourceavailability. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH Question. In several recent Mental Health Advisory Council reports you have rec- ommended improving the relevance of prevention research into early interventions,clinical research to actual practice, and of behavioral research to serious mental ill-nesses. Could you please discuss some of the difficulties you 've encountered in your efforts to change the institute 's course toward the greatest public health needs? Where does NIMH stand relative to other NIH institutes on the rate of grants sub-mitted and funded? Is the relative quality of the science in the grant submissionsand proposals received NIMH rising or declining? Answer. Mental disorders and suicide together account for over 15 percent of the burden of disease in established market economies such as the United States. Themission of the National Institute of Mental Health is to reduce the burden of mentaldisorders. NIMH also takes the lead in understanding the impact of behavior onHIV transmission and pathogenesis, and in developing effective behavior preventiveinterventions in areas such as violence. These collectively constitute an enormousarea of responsibility. Over the past several years, NIMH has systematically exam-ined its overall research portfolio and conducted even more in-depth reviews of se-lected programs, areas of science, and disorders, all with the objective of refocusingprograms to bring the best science to bear on areas of greatest disease burden: de-pression; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and child-hood autism, to name a few. In particular we have tried to ensure that knowledgegained is relevant to the full range of patients: from children to the aged; bothsexes; all genders, races, ethnic groups; and to individuals with co-occurring condi-tions. This refocusing process has encountered significant challenges. One has beenthe need for extensive reorganization of programs within the Institute 's intramural and extramural research programs. On the intramural side, certain laboratories andclinical units have been phased down or terminated in order to permit new growthand initiatives. Extramural staff and program realignments have been even moreextensive and, often, difficult. It also has been quite challenging to shift the direc-tion of the larger extramural community \u2014for example, to motivate basic behavioral researchers to examine and revise many time-tested research paradigms in order tomake research more relevant to clinical questions, or to encourage investigators totake a potentially risky step outside a given area of expertise into uncharted areassuch as translational research. Although we have encountered some resistance anddoubts about the need for change, these efforts are paying off. Since we rejoined the NIH in 1993, the ratio between competing research project grant applications submitted and awards funded, or success rates, has been consist-ently lower by 3 -5 percent from the aggregated average for all NIH Institutes and Centers. The functional consequence of this differential for scientists is that an ap-plication for funding to the NIMH had a 16 percent lower chance of success thanfor NIH in the aggregate. This was also true for the most recent 1999 fiscal year when the success rate for NIMH was 27 percent in comparison to the aggregate NIHsuccess rate of 32 percent. Most NIMH applications are reviewed in committeeswith applications from several different NIH Institutes, and NIMH applicationshave been consistently judged somewhat better than average by those committees. Although precise data is not available, it is my opinion that since joining NIH, NIMH science is stronger than it has ever been. The science has been kept sharpby strong competition within NIH review committees and the new seriousness of sci-entific review within the intramural research program. As indicated in the para-306 graph above, NIMH scientists have performed well in review comparisons with sci- entists of other institutes. RESEARCH ON CHILDREN 'S MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS Question. As I understand it, research on children 's mental disorders at NIMH still lags behind so much other research, with few treatments available that workfor obsessive-compulsive disorder (which often begins in childhood) and bipolar dis-order (which increasingly is seen as beginning in childhood and adolescence). Whatis NIMH 's plan for strengthening this research and assuring the development of more effective treatments for children? Answer. NIMH is actively planning a series of projects. A new program announce- ment is being crafted that will focus specifically on children with serious mental ill-nesses, including obsessive-compulsive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders,schizophrenia, among others. The object of the announcement is to encourage abroad range of studies on the onset, course, risk processes, and treatments for seri-ous mental illnesses in children and associated disabling impairments. In addition,next week NIMH is hosting a meeting to identify key research gaps in identificationand treatments for children with bipolar illnesses, with the aim to further advancestudies in these areas. Also, NIMH is currently supporting seven Research Unitsof Pediatric Psychopharmacology, several of which focus on bipolar illnesses in chil-dren. RESEARCH ON MINORITY MENTAL HEALTH Question. The landmark 1998 Schizophrenia PORT study, found that the gap be- tween science and accessible treatment has never been wider. Moreover, this lackof ''translation '' was at its worst in the African American community, leading to sig- nificant health disparities. African Americans with schizophrenia were more likelyto experience overmedication with anti-psychotic medications, increased side-effects,and under-treatment of depression to a higher degree than other racial/ethnicgroups. What is NIMH doing to improve the translation of scientific advances intoreal world treatment, in general, and especially in the African American commu-nity? Answer. Since the completion of the Schizophrenia PORT study, NIMH has fund- ed additional studies to look, in depth, into reasons for the disparities in treatment.One study is designed to determine if adherence to treatment recommendations willlead to improved outcomes and whether minority status has an impact on whattreatments are provided. In addition, the NIMH has issued a report, BridgingScience and Service, that calls for more research on improving the delivery of treat-ments in community populations, especially those who are traditionally under-served. NIMH also recently launched four new major clinical treatment studies thatwill provide data on how to treat some of the most severe mental illnesses in real-world settings. These studies are required to include minority populations so the re-sults will be relevant to them. Currently, the NIMH Committee on Health Disparities is drafting a document de- lineating the specific research priorities for the next 5 years. The report will focuson what the state of disparities is; why they exist and approaches to remedy thesituation. In addition, the National Advisory Mental Health Council just issued anew report, Translating Behavioral Science into Action, which calls for research thattakes into account the importance of individual, sociocultural, and organizationalfactors on the differences in help seeking, treatment, and outcomes from treatment. In the past, studies of treatment in schizophrenia tended to be small scale, indus- try sponsored, and focused on safety and short term efficacy. The data gatheredwere useful in obtaining regulatory (FDA) approval, but provided little guidance forpractitioners on how best to treat patients in the community. Moreover, for a num-ber of reasons, African Americans tended to be underrepresented in these treatmenttrials. The net result was that clinicians had to base many treatment decisions, par-ticularly in minority patients, on prior experience, opinion, and their own experi-ences, rather than objective data. To remedy this situation, NIMH recently initiateda multie-year, multi-site, multi-million dollar project to study new antipsychoticdrugs in people with schizophrenia (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Ef-fectiveness, CATIE). One of the project 's highest priorities is to include a represent- ative sampling of patients with adequate representation of minorities and not belimited to middle class or upper class patients. There will be considerable outreachefforts to African Americans with schizophrenia, including recruitment of study sitesin African American communities. Important characteristics of the trial are that allsubjects participating in the trial will receive state-of-the-art care, and clinicians in-volved in the trial will be guided on best clinical practice and will have world-class307 experts available for consultation. While the number of patients treated in this trial will represent an insignificant fraction of the totality of people with schizophrenia,NIMH anticipates that the experience with patients and clinicians in African Amer-ican communities gained through CATIE will greatly facilitate subsequent trans-lation of CATIE 's findings into that community as well as aid in dissemination of optimal clinical practices to mental health professionals providing care to AfricanAmerican people with schizophrenia. NIMH RESEARCH AGENDA Question. A recent National Advisory Mental Health Council report notes that the behavioral science portfolio at NIMH has not been well-focussed on the areas ofgreatest public health need and makes a number of recommendations to improvethe relevance of this portfolio. Could you discuss some of the factors which contrib-uted to this lack of attention to many of our serious mental illnesses, what youthink behavioral research can contribute, and how you can redirect existing re-search resources to develop more relevant behavioral research? Answer. Until recently, NIMH has focused relatively little organized effort to bridge basic behavioral science and severe mental illness. In part this has reflectedthe Institute 's encouragement of investigator-initiated research, which, in turn, re- flects academic traditions within psychiatry and psychology that often place a high-er value on basic research than on clinically oriented (or applied) research. In addi-tion, clinical and basic behavioral scientists have traditionally operated in separateacademic departments unfamiliar with the language, concepts and problems of eachother 's disciplines. Because clinical populations have not been accessible to basic re- searchers, they have often focused on normal or less ill populations. Academic incen-tive systems and the segmentation of funding and outlets for publication have notpromoted cross-disciplinary studies. Training programs in basic behavioral scienceoften discourage exposure to clinical problems and clinical settings so that behav-ioral scientists may be unaware of basic research issues and opportunities posed byresearch on mental illness. Finally, when NIMH has attempted to encourage targeted research that can bridge between basic behavioral research and severe mental illness, relatively fewresearchers have responded. This lack of interest in certain types of behaviorallyoriented translational research indicates the necessity for more specific targeted ef-forts to stimulate interest in these areas. Basic behavioral science will contribute to understanding and solving otherwise intractable public health problems related to serious mental illness in a number ofareas: Understanding Symptoms of Illness The symptoms of serious mental illness involve attention, abstract thinking, social interaction, motivation, and emotion. Behavioral science should offer new ways ofassessing these behavioral processes that will: (1) help link them to underlyingneurobiologic processes; (2) allow their evaluation as indicators of risk prior to thedevelopment of full-blown illness; and (3) facilitate the objective assessment of re-sponse to targeted treatment interventions. Encouraging Behavior Change Theory-driven behavior-change interventions are highly successful in HIV/AIDS, yet remarkably, behavioral theory has rarely focused on health behaviors related toserious mental illness. More than half of all schizophrenia relapses can be attrib-uted to lack of adherence with treatment recommendations. The application of the-ory-based behavior-change principles to the problem of adherence should result ineffective approaches to substantially reduce morbidity in schizophrenia and other se- rious mental illness. Improving Treatments Learning theory should guide new treatment development for mental illness as well as treatment dissemination. Despite advances in psychopharmacology, patientswith serious mental illness must learn ways of adapting to deficits and disabilities;learning theory should inform the development of new cognitive-behavioral interven-tions for skills training and illness self-management. At the same time, because re-search advances are very slow to influence everyday care, we need a better under-standing of physician and provider behavior as related to the diffusion of innova-tions.308 Encouraging Help-Seeking Evidence indicates that delay in seeking treatment contributes to morbidity at the onset of serious mental illnesses including major depression, bipolar disorder andschizophrenia. Behavioral science should contribute to our understanding of the psy-chological and social processes, including the influence of social norms and stigma,that impede timely symptom recognition and help-seeking for serious mental illness. Helping Families Cope with Mental Illness Mental illness in a child or spouse can have a profound effect on family relation- ships, which in turn influence both the ill individual and other family members. Re-lationship research should explicate the adaptive responses of families that influ-ence treatment outcome for the ill family member, including adherence to treatmentrecommendations. At the same time, better ways of characterizing and alleviatingthe family burden created by serious mental illness must be developed. The pres-ence and severity of symptoms alone cannot account for the disabilities associatedwith mental illnesses. Behavioral science should contribute to a better under-standing of the multidimensional nature of social, vocational and instrumental func-tioning to refine the choice of rehabilitation interventions. It should also aid in iden-tifying the different treatment needs of individuals who are grouped within a singlediagnostic category. Understanding the Inheritance of Mental Disorders Evidence indicates that defining mental disorders in terms of behavioral dimen- sions rather than specific diagnoses may more closely approximate inheritedphenotypes. Behavioral science may aid in finer characterization and measurementof these behavioral phenotypes to facilitate the linkage of behavioral diseases to spe-cific sets of risk genes. ''Translating Behavioral Science into Action, '' the report of the National Advisory Mental Health Council 's Behavioral Science Workgroup, provides a wealth of spe- cific recommendations for redirecting existing research resources. Measures com-menced or soon to begin include: \u2014A Request for Applications (RFA) with set-aside funds that focuses on basic be- havioral processes in mental illness is under development to jump start cross-disciplinary collaborations between basic behavioral researchers and clinical in-vestigators. \u2014Simultaneously, a new Program Announcement (PA) will outline a trajectory of research support to include both developing and mature translational researchcenters to provide an infrastructure for new research, speed the translation offindings, and encourage interaction across basic, clinical and services research.These efforts will signal a serious and ongoing commitment on the part ofNIMH to apply behavioral science methods to the problems of mental illness. \u2014An ancillary study PA encourages behavioral scientists to access the patient populations and infrastructure developed as part of the NIMH clinical trial ini-tiatives. \u2014Workshops bringing together behavioral and clinical scientists have been initi- ated in the areas of (1) adherence in serious mental illness; (2) informed consentand clinical research; (3) research ethics; and (4) integrating behavioral sciencewith public health. \u2014Staff have worked with current behavioral scientist grantees to encourage redi- rection into areas more closely dealing with mental disorders. \u2014Training activities are being examined to identify ways to overcome barriers to cross-disciplinary training experiences that are required to facilitatetranslational research. SCHIZOPHRENIA Question. Given the many changes underway at NIMH in terms of the funding of clinical research and the clinical research centers, how are you moving to assurethat the research base studying schizophrenia is strengthened and expanded? Answer. NIMH is strengthening and expanding its research base with regard to schizophrenia in the following ways: (1) initiating a large, sustained effort in thearea of clinical trials of typical and atypical antipsychotics for treatment of schizo-phrenia, and supporting Centers and other grants addressing a large number ofschizophrenia treatment issues; (2) bolstering our program for the Silvio O. ConteCenters for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders in the area of schizophrenia (2Centers to date); (3) undertaking major, innovative new efforts to investigate geneticcontributions to schizophrenia; these efforts include a centralized, internationalrespository for genetic samples and for services to genetics investigators; (4) fundinga large number of R01-type grants focused on the neurobiology of schizophrenia,309 using methods such as brain imaging, electrophysiology, electromagneto- encephalography, etc.; (5) funding an extensive portfolio of basic neuroscience re-search relevant to schizophrenia and other mental disorders, (6) initiating new epi-demiological and other efforts to understand non-genetic risk factors for schizo-phrenia and to characterize, in more insightful ways, the very early stages of thedisorder; (7) continuing to support a large intramural research program targetinga number of aspects of schizophrenia. ADVOCATES ON COMITTEES Question. NIMH was a leader in asking members of the general public \u2014often con- sumers with severe mental illnesses or their family members \u2014to serve on scientific peer review committees looking at treatment research. As you know, there was agood deal of skepticism about the wisdom of including non-scientists on the commit-tees. Could you provide us with your assessment of how that innovative project hasturned out? Answer. Public participant reviewers have successfully served for a year on the NIMH 's service and interventions review committees. Public reviewers included in- dividuals who have suffered from mental disorders, family members of those suf-fering from mental disorders, mental health care policymakers, and mental healthcare providers. All committee members were asked for their assessment of how wellthe process worked. The most common feedback was that the inclusion of public re-viewers was useful and that the public reviewers had done an excellent job. Thepublic reviewers, many of whom experienced the committee process for the firsttime, were impressed with the efforts of the committee members and the seriousand objective nature of the deliberations. NIMH will continue to request feedbackfrom all reviewers to help inform and improve the process of public participationin its review meetings. Future plans are to help public reviewers focus on the reviewissues about which they can best contribute such as determining public health im-portance and human protection issues, and to continue adding and training newpublic reviewers to ensure a broad diversity of opinions and experiences. HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTION Question. NIMH has been dealing with ethical issues in research on mental ill- nesses for a number of years and has instituted a new Mental Health AdvisoryCouncil review process to examine human subjects protections before grant ap-proval. Has this new review process been useful? Is it helpful to have non-scientistson the review panel? Answer. The NIMH Human Subject Research Council Workgroup has been in ex- istence for a year and will meet next on May 3, 2000. It has helped assure that ap-plications considered for funding meet the highest scientific and ethical standards,and that proper protections for human research volunteers are in place. Havingbioethicists and consumers on this group has been particularly useful in consideringresearch risks, benefits, alternatives, and informed consent issues. CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS Question. NIAAA 's strategic plan hardly mentions the problem of co-occurring dis- orders. What plans does NIAAA have to address co-occurring disorders \u2014and in par- ticular, is the institute sponsoring any research to help establish the most effectivetreatment approaches when alcoholism and a mental disorder occur together? Answer. The strategic plan of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco- holism (NIAAA) is a blueprint of the Institute 's major goals and objectives and the strategies for achieving them. Many elements of this plan were developed with inputfrom the National Advisory Council, with significant input from scientists in alcohol-related areas as well as other research areas. The plan also reflects advice from a broad spectrum of sources \u2014researchers, health care providers, over 250 liaison or- ganizations, policymakers, people recovering from alcoholism and their families, andothers. It is a ''live'' document that the Institute will be updating periodically. While researchers interested in the causes of disease will differ on whether studying thepatient with co-occurring disease is a promising research strategy, the NIAAA is ad-dressing the issue of co-occurring disorders throughout the strategic plan and theresearch portfolio. Alcohol 's effects on the human body are ubiquitous,both physically and psycho- logically. For example, chronic alcohol use is associated with a range of diseases,from liver damage to depression. In terms of psychological comorbidity, the chal-lenge for alcohol investigators is to determine whether specific diseases occur re-gardless of alcoholism, are the result of alcoholism, or contribute to the developmentof alcoholism. Numerous studies in this regard are underway. For example, topics310 of studies on depression range from delivery of services for depressed substance abusers to observing the outcome of treating depressed alcoholics for depressionalone, alcoholism alone, or both conditions. The Institute 's research on co-occurring psychiatric disorders also includes studies of alcoholics with post-traumatic stresssyndrome and bipolar disorder and clinical trials of alcoholics with social phobia anddepression. Neuroscience contributes vital information to studies of treatment for al-coholism and co-occurring disorders, since they identify the biological mechanismsthat underlie these conditions. The NIAAA conducts numerous neuroscience studieson mental health, from research on alcoholism and schizophrenia to research on de-velopment of alcohol use and abuse in adolescents with attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder. TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR DUALLY DIAGNOSED INDIVIDUALS Question. Drug abuse and psychiatric disorders frequently occur together and these ''dually-diagnosed '' individuals pose special treatment problems. I understand that NIDA 's ambitious Clinical Trials Network will address this issue. Could you please review for us what the existing research says about the most effective treat-ment approaches for these dually-diagnosed individuals and discuss why these ap-proaches have generally not been adopted by the drug abuse and mental healthtreatment communities? Answer. Data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study showed that 53 percent of individuals with substance use disorders met criteria for one or moremental disorder, and that about one-third of individuals who have a mental disorderalso experience alcohol and other drug abuse disorders in their life. In the NationalComorbidity Study, 47 percent of individuals with a past year substance use dis-order diagnosis had a comorbid mental disorder. Affective, anxiety, personality andpsychotic disorders were most commonly comorbid with substance abuse or addic-tion disorders. Among treatment-seeking substance abusers and addicts, psychiatric comorbidity has been found to be commonplace. In a recent study in Baltimore, psychiatric co-morbidity was detected in 47 percent of heroin addicts one month after stabilizationon methadone. Antisocial personality disorder (25 percent) and major depression (16percent) were the most common diagnoses. Psychiatric comorbidity was associatedwith increased severity of drug use and severity of associated social problems. Inother studies increased psychiatric symptoms have been associated with increasedHIV risk behaviors. Clinical studies have shown that people who have comorbid mental and addictive disorders tend to have poorer treatment outcomes, to relapse more frequently, andare less responsive to psychiatric medications during continued use. Furthermore,studies have demonstrated that treatment of a comorbid mental disorder with ap-propriate psychiatric and drug addiction medications and psychotherapy and drugaddiction counseling is important to the effective treatment of the addictive disorderand results in better outcomes and reduced relapse rates. Several studies have now shown that integrated treatment programs, which com- bine mental health and substance abuse interventions, offer much greater promisethan the totally separate programmatic approaches found in many communities. Inaddition to a comprehensive integration of services, successful programs include as-sessment, assertive case management, motivational interventions for patients whodo not recognize the need for substance abuse treatment, behavioral interventionsfor those who are trying to attain or maintain abstinence, family interventions,housing, rehabilitation, and pharmacotherapy. Since the late 1980 's new models of treatment for the dually diagnosed \u2014with a primary aim of integrating services \u2014\u2014have been evolving. This integration is ac- complished through the use of multidisciplinary teams that include both mentalhealth and substance abuse professionals who are cross-trained. However, despitethe encouraging research findings regarding the effectiveness of integrated treat-ment for this population, implementation continues to be slow because of problemsrelated to the organization and financing of programs. Organizational guidelineshave been developed for dual diagnosis programs, but few large systems have suc-cessfully integrated services. It appears that more research needs to be done on the organization and financing of integrated treatment programs (health services research). In addition, many ofthe basic components of integrated treatment (family psychoeducation; motivationalinterventions; behavioral treatments for substance abuse; integratingpharmacotherapies, etc.) are still being developed and refined. Research is neededto address the effectiveness of the appropriate combination of these components.311 Of course, another major barrier to successful implementation of this integrated approach is the lack of cross-training for health substance abuse and mental healthprofessionals. In summary, research has informed us that it is important to diagnose both sub- stance abuse and mental disorders when they are comorbid and provide fully effec-tive treatments for both disorders. Several studies have demonstrated the signifi-cant benefits of integrated substance abuse and psychiatric services in the sametreatment setting rather than separate and parallel treatment. Benefits included in-creased engagement and retention in treatment, decreased addiction severity anddecreased psychiatric symptomatology. For the most psychiatrically severe patients,these integrated interventions must include Assertive Community Outreach, which fosters continuous engagement and re-engagement in treatment, provides crisisintervention and other community-based services, and supports medication compli-ance and attendance at both psychiatric and drug treatment services. Research iscontinuing on the refinement of the components of treatment services and their ef-fectiveness in combination therapy. NIDA 's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) will also serve as a potential vehicle for treating dually diagnosed patients. Since the CTNwill be testing efficacious therapies in real life settings with diverse patient popu-lations, dually-diagnosed patients will be included in some treatment protocols withappropriate analyses of these patients conducted to improve the treatment strategyeven more. Additionally, the CTN will develop protocols to test therapies specificallytargeted to co-morbid patients. For example, this may include using antidepressantsas an adjunct to behavior therapies for depressed drug addicts. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE Question. What is the status of the NIH 's report on autoimmune disease research? What is the timing on submission of that report? Answer. The Report of the NIH Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee summarizes recent basic and clinical research programs supported by NIH and non-Federal organizations, highlighting coordination and collaborative activities in tenthematic areas; recent and ongoing activities of the NIH Autoimmune Diseases Co-ordinating Committee; and emerging opportunities to improve treatment and de-velop preventive approaches for autoimmune diseases. Twenty-two NIH Institutes,Centers, and Offices; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention; the Veterans ' Administration; and ten private organi- zations with an interest in autoimmune diseases are represented on the Committee.The research programs supported by these groups comprise a broad range of basic,pre-clinical, and clinical endeavors addressing many different diseases, organ sys-tems, and aspects of autoimmune disease. The Committee will submit the report to the Office of the Director, NIH, for clear- ance and hopes to release the report in the very near future. Question. What is the total amount that NIH is spending for research on all auto- immune diseases? Answer. The NIH spent $393.2 million on autoimmune disease research in fiscal year 1999, and expects to spend $434.6 million in fiscal year 2000, and $456.9 mil-lion in fiscal year 2001. Question. What are some research initiatives NIH is funding to develop better treatments for these diseases? Answer. Autoimmune diseases are immune-mediated disorders in which the im- mune system attacks the body 's own tissues. Treatment of these diseases depends largely on immunosuppressive agents that have many side effects, for example,steroids and cytotoxic therapies. However, more specific and less toxic immunetherapies have shown efficacy in animal studies. As highlighted below, the NIAID,in collaboration with many other federal and private organizations, has developednew programs to assist in moving these promising therapies to clinical practice. Immune Tolerance .\u2014The induction of immune tolerance is a major therapeutic goal for the treatment of many immune-mediated diseases, as it will eliminate orreduce the life-long dependence of many patients on costly and toxic immuno-suppressive drugs. Tolerance induction strategies seek to modify or block deleteriousimmune responses, such as those responses that cause the body to attack its ownorgans and tissues in autoimmune disorders, or the immune responses that resultin the rejection of transplanted organs, tissues, and cells. A number of promisingreagents for the induction of immune tolerance are being developed and can nowbe tested in clinical trials. In September 1998, the NIAID published a long-term plan, now available on the web (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/immune/bookcover.htm) to accelerate re-312 search on immune tolerance, particularly in the clinical setting. In September 1999, the NIAID, with co-sponsorship of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestiveand Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International(JDFI), established one of the major research programs emanating from this plan,the Immune Tolerance Network (http://paramount.bsd.uchicago.edu/frameset.html).Leading investigators from more than 40 institutions in the U.S., Canada, WesternEurope, and Australia are participating in the design and evaluation of clinicaltrials of tolerance induction therapies for autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergicdiseases, kidney transplantation, and islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes. Inthe six months since the inception of this major clinical research program, the Net-work has initiated the development of clinical trials for a variety of immune-medi-ated disorders, including islet transplantation for systemic lupus erythematosus,and multiple sclerosis. The Network is also implementing a study to assess the im-mune status of kidney transplant recipients who have voluntarily discontinued im-munosuppressive therapy yet maintained a functioning transplant over long periodsof time. Network-supported scientists are also designing studies of several ap-proaches to measure the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance in humansin conjunction with these clinical trials. Examples include the use of new biotech-nologies, such as the complementary ''gene chip '' microarray technology, which will profile changes in gene expression associated with tolerance induction therapies,and the ELISPOTR assay that will enable scientists to analyze the expression ofimmunomodulatory proteins during treatment with tolerogenic therapies. In orderto stimulate new insights that will lead to wider application of tolerogenic ap-proaches, all Network-supported clinical trials will include studies of the underlyingmechanisms of immune regulation as an integral part of the protocols. The NIDDK, with the NIAID and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), is cosponsoring a clinical trial to test the ability ofsubcutaneous or oral insulin by inducing immune tolerance to prevent or delay thedevelopment of type 1 diabetes in relatives of patients with the disease who are atrisk for development of the disease in the next five years. The JDFI and the Amer-ican Diabetes Association are also sponsoring this multi-center, nationwide trial. The program, Human Islet Transplantation into Humans, will support clinical studies using new methods to induce immune tolerance, to prevent reoccurrence ofthe autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the islet, and to prevent transplant re-jection. The NIDDK, the NIAID, and the JDFI support this program. Immune Modulation .\u2014Traditional immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapies used to treat autoimmune diseases have many serious side effects, including a de-creased ability to fight infection, tissue and bone fragility, and malignancy. In con-trast, immunomodulatory approaches seek to modify immune injurious responseswithout the need for global immunosuppression. Examples include recently ap-proved drugs that target the tumor necrosis factor, an important mediator of inflam- mation in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. This targeted ap-proach appears to be more potent and less toxic than the use of cytotoxic agentsor cortocosteroids in treating these disorders. In fiscal year 1999, the NIAID, with co-sponsorship of the NIDDK, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and the Of-fice of Research on Women 's Health (ORWH) of the National Institutes of Health, established the Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence to design and conduct pilotclinical trials of the safety and potential efficacy of new strategies for immune mod-ulation in multiple autoimmune diseases. Three clinical trials of promising ap-proaches are under development: prevention of kidney damage in systemic lupuserythematosus through interruption of a specific immune pathway, the complementpathway; induction of remissions in systemic lupus erythematosus through removalof a specific immune cell, the B cell; and prevention of the development ofautoantibodies in children at risk for type 1 diabetes through the use of insulin.These Centers will also conduct pilot clinical trials of tolerance induction strategiesand provide important safety and efficacy data for further evaluation by the Im-mune Tolerance Network. Another new research program will focus, in part, on the development of novel treatments for the many rare immune-mediated diseases, some of which affect lessthan 200,000 people. NIH support in this area is particularly important due to lim-ited industrial interest in diseases with a small market potential. A fiscal year 2000NIAID research initiative, Clinical Trials and Clinical Markers of Immune SystemDiseases, will support the testing of new therapeutic approaches for certain rare im-mune-mediated disorders, including primary immunodeficiency diseases and auto-immune diseases. Under this initiative, the development of new biological markersand surrogate endpoints to measure disease risk, activity, stage, and therapeutic re-313 sponse will be encouraged. The availability of specific and easily measured biological markers will facilitate the design and evaluation of new therapeutic strategies. In fiscal year 1998, the NIAID initiated a program called the Hyperaccelerated Award/Mechanisms in Immunomodulation Trials to support investigator-initiatedresearch applications for mechanistic studies to be conducted in conjunction withclinical trials for immune-mediated diseases. The applications focus on utilization ofpatient samples to define: mechanisms of disease pathogenesis; immunologicalmechanisms underlying the clinical intervention; and surrogate/biomarkers markersof disease activity and therapeutic effect. The ''parent '' or ''core'' clinical trial must have independent financial support, either from industry, private foundations, or afederal agency. This program, cosponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA),NIAMS, NIDDK, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the Na-tional Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the ORWH, hasbeen highly successful. In the 18 months since its inception, the NIH has received29 applications and funded eight projects in autoimmune diseases, allergy and asth-ma, and transplantation in collaboration with six industry partners. Through anumber of steps to expedite peer review and award, applications are acceptedmonthly and awards are made within 13 weeks of receipt. In fiscal year 2000, the NIDDK, the NIAID, and the NICHD will begin a new pro- gram, New Strategies for the Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes, supporting clinicalstudies to test new approaches to treat type 1 diabetes, including studies ofimmunomodulation. Other Therapeutic Approaches \u2014Another approach to the treatment of immune- mediated diseases involves ''replacing '' the immune system through transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells. In many cases, the patient 's own stem cells are used to ensure that the transplanted cells do not react against the body 's own tissues. Stem cell transplantation is currently being used for the treatment of several auto-immune diseases, and anecdotal reports suggest that this approach holds promisefor inducing remission or decreasing disease severity. However, well-controlled clin-ical trials of efficacy have not yet been conducted. Therefore, in fiscal year 1999, theNIAID implemented a research initiative, Stem Cell Transplantation for Auto-immune Diseases, to design and conduct rigorous clinical trials of the safety and ef-ficacy of this new therapeutic strategy. In fiscal year 1999, the research initiative, Pilot Clinical Trials on Innovative Therapies for Rheumatic and Skin Diseases, was implemented under the leadershipof the NIAMS to develop innovative therapies for the treatment of rheumatic andskin diseases. Awards were made for research on Wegener 's granulomatosis, rheu- matoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus fiscal year 1999, the NHLBI began an investigator-initiated clinical trial of Cyclophosphamide in the treatment of the pulmonary fibrosis associated with sys- temic sclerosis. In systemic sclerosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is frequent (80percent) and is now the leading cause of death. The mortality rate of patients withimpaired pulmonary function is 40 -45 percent within 10 years of onset. Uncon- trolled studies suggest that cyclophosphamide may stabilize or improve lung func-tion in systemic sclerosis patients. The study is a five-year, 13-center, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, controlled, phase III clinical trial of oralcyclophosphamide versus placebo to assess the efficacy of cyclophosphamide in stabi-lizing or improving the course of pulmonary disease in scleroderma. NIAMS alsocontributes to the support of this study. In fiscal year 2000, the NIDDK with the NIAID and the JDFI will sponsor new Diabetes Centers of Excellence to support basic research into the pathogenesis oftype 1 diabetes and to develop new therapeutic approaches to this autoimmune dis-ease. Question. How does NIH intend to increase coordination of research on the family of autoimmune diseases? Answer. In fiscal year 1998, both the Senate and the House Appropriations Com- mittee Reports addressed the importance of coordination of NIH-supported researchactivities relating to autoimmune diseases. The NIH recognized the need for coordi-nation and collaboration in this area and in fiscal year 1998 established the Auto-immune Diseases Coordinating Committee under the direction of the NIAID. Twen-ty-two NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,the Veterans Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, andprivate organizations that sponsor research in this area are represented on theCommittee. Some of the private organizations include the Juvenile Diabetes Foun-dation International, the Arthritis Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Soci-ety, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Foundation, the Sjogren 's Foundation, and the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association.314 Since its initial meeting in June 1998, the Committee has collected and analyzed information on current research activities and funding levels and established multi-Institute collaborative working groups in areas of common interest and relevance tomultiple autoimmune diseases. In addition, the Committee 's efforts have facilitated a variety of other activities to further enhance coordination of research and increasepartnerships between public and private organizations. Examples include: \u2014Extensive collaboration among many NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices in planning and cosponsoring several new research initiatives in fiscal year 1999; \u2014Establishment of public-private research partnerships between the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the Arthritis Foundation, and theCrohn 's and Colitis Foundation of America; \u2014Cosponsorship of workshops and scientific symposia by the NIH, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the Arthritis Foundation, and the Crohn 's and Colitis Foundation of America; \u2014Participation of NIH staff in scientific planning activities of non-Federal organi- zations, such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Alliance for LupusResearch, and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International. The Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee was instrumental in the de- velopment, coordination, and implementation of several new initiatives in fiscal year1999. The guiding principles of this planning process included an emphasis on:cross-disciplinary research addressing multiple autoimmune diseases; support for amechanism-based approach, encompassing fundamental investigations of diseasepathogenesis and clinical trials involving new diagnostic and therapeutic ap-proaches; and selected research programs focusing on specific diseases, new tech-nologies, and/or extraordinary scientific opportunities. Several new trans-NIH initiatives emerged from this process, and nine previously planned activities in later stages of development received increased support. Sup-port was provided for the following initiatives, the majority of which involved jointsponsorship by multiple NIH components: \u2014New Imaging Technologies in Autoimmune Diseases \u2014Environment/Infection/Gene Interaction in Autoimmune Diseases \u2014Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence \u2014Multiple Autoimmune Disease Genetics Consortium \u2014Target Organ Damage in Autoimmune Disease \u2014Stem Cell Transplantation for Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases \u2014Immune Tolerance Network \u2014Non-human Primate Transplantation Tolerance Cooperative Study Group \u2014Human Immunology Centers of Excellence \u2014Clinical Trials and Clinical Markers for Immunologic Diseases \u2014Rat Autoimmune Disease Genetic Resource \u2014Rat Autoimmune Model Repository \u2014Pilot Trials on Innovative Therapies for Rheumatic and Skin Diseases Immune Disease Trials \u2014Rheumatic Diseases Registries In November 1999, the Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee estab- lished Collaborative Working Groups to encourage NIH, other federal agencies, andprivate organizations to prospectively develop jointly sponsored initiatives in areasof overlapping interest. Several initiatives are likely to be published in the comingyear from this collaborative process. The major challenges facing autoimmune diseases research today are the: develop- ment of a mechanism-based, conceptual understanding of autoimmune disease;translation of this knowledge into new, broadly applicable strategies for treatmentand prevention of multiple diseases; and development of sensitive tools for early anddefinitive diagnosis, disease staging, and identification of at-risk individuals.Through the collaborative programs outlined above, NIH-supported scientists arevigorously pursuing these goals. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR HERBKOHL EPILEPSY Question. Dr. Fischbach, I am very pleased that today NINDS is sponsoring a con- ference on curing epilepsy. I am hopeful that the discussions at the conference willlead to a clearer strategy for research into this debilitating disease. With that goalin mind, I have several questions:315 \u2014Report language last year discussed curing epilepsy, not just finding new treat- ments for it. What is NINDS doing differently to change its focus from findingnew treatments to finding a cure to stop epilepsy dead in its tracks? \u2014What is NINDS 's strategy for focusing on the population with intractable epi- lepsy? Answer. Our approach to curing epilepsy is reflected in the title of a major, White House-initiated conference we sponsored last month \u2014''Curing Epilepsy: Focus on the Future. '' In light of recent science advances, and with the enthusiastic support of the research and patient communities, we are defining ''cure'' as the prevention of epilepsy before it occurs in people at risk, and the total elimination of seizureswithout treatment side effects in those who develop the disease. Our approach is threefold. We want to pursue innovative approaches to medical treatment, includingthe identification of new targets for drugs and new methods such as high through-put screening to identify useful medicines. We want to improve existing surgicaltreatments and develop new ones aimed at modifying the circuitry of the brain andtake advantage of new methods such as various types of stimulation to prevent orinterrupt the destructive cascade of seizure activity. And we want to harness thepower of genomic information to understand how the mutant genes responsible formany forms of epilepsy lead to disease so that we can identify ways to prevent orreverse that process. ''Intractable epilepsy '' is a term that we hope will become obsolete as our research strategies bear additional fruit. The approach I have just outlined for epilepsy ingeneral is really the same we hope to apply to those for whom existing treatmentshave failed \u2014better drugs, more effective surgery, and application of what we al- ready know and expect to learn about the role of genes in epilepsy. ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE Question. It is my understanding that some research has shown that Alzheimer 's Disease begins to destroy the brain cells of its victims 10 to 20 years before outwardsymptoms appear. Do we currently have the tools to diagnose Alzheimer 's Disease in its earliest stages and, if not, what research is being done to develop that capa-bility? Answer. Alzheimer 's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nerv- ous system where neuropathological changes may begin several decades before thedisease is recognized clinically. Therefore, the most cost-effective therapies will pre-vent the onset of AD before it ever manifests itself clinically. These preventativetherapies can only be developed if we can understand and predict the initial stagesand events in the brain that lead to the development of AD. Targeting early pathological processes necessitates development of biochemical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and genetic markers that are sufficiently sensitiveand accurate to identify at-risk individuals along the spectrum from normal agingthrough mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (a condition characterized by memory def-icit without dementia) to AD. Most recently, diagnostic research has focused on peo-ple with MCI. These people are at increased risk of developing AD since 15 -20 per- cent annually convert to AD versus 1 -2 percent in the general population over the age of 65. A number of ongoing imaging studies are evaluating persons who exhibitearly pre-clinical or clinical signs of AD and comparing their neuroimaging and bio-chemical measures to those of older individuals who are not cognitively impaired inan attempt to identify the earliest biochemical and imaging markers that distin-guish AD from normal age-related changes. Current neuroimaging studies are assessing whether it is possible to measure as- pects of brain function and/or structure to identify individuals who are at-risk forAD before they develop the symptoms of the disease. Structural and functional im-aging have been shown to be useful in identifying diagnostic markers of AD; how-ever, in the past, most imaging studies have been cross-sectional and designed todemonstrate differences between older controls and patients who were already de-mented. Recently published research has conducted magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) studies in longitudinally followed individuals diagnosed with MCI who wereat increased risk of AD. The studies measured two areas of the temporal lobe of thebrain, the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, because these brain structuresplay a central role in memory function and are the sites of the earliest pathologyin AD. The studies found that in older individuals with MCI, hippocampal andentorhinal cortex atrophy were predictive of an increased risk of subsequent conver-sion to AD; that is, the smaller the brain volumes, the greater the risk. The implica-tion of these studies is that it may be possible to identify people who are beginningto develop the brain structural changes associated with the disease prior to the clin-ical diagnosis of AD.316 Recognition and characterization of brain changes prior to the clinical symptoms or diagnosis of AD has important implications for improving the timing and effec-tiveness of interventions. If diagnostic procedures can be developed to detect earlychanges in the brain, it may be possible to develop treatments that will stop theneuropathological and biochemical lesions of AD before clinical deterioration begins. Improved diagnosis of AD could also improve the design of drug trials. Focusing drug trials on persons at highest risk for disease is more efficient and less costly,and, among highest risk persons with minimal or no clinical symptoms, has theadded benefit of testing the effectiveness of preventing progression of symptoms toa clinical diagnosis of AD. Finally, earlier and more accurate diagnosis provides pa-tients and families important information allowing them to better plan for future care needs and management of their personal affairs. DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Question. As you know, 1 in 3,500 boys worldwide will be stricken with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the most common fatal childhood genetic disease. There is notreatment. Each day, two boys in the United States die from this disease. Afterhearing the stories of these boys, I am very concerned about the lack of researchbeing done at NIH on Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy \u2014as well as on neuromuscular disorders generally. The dystrophin gene was discovered throughNINDS-sponsored research in 1987; yet no new treatments have emerged. In 1999,less than 1 percent of NIH funds were spent on over 40 different forms of neuro-muscular disorders. It is my understanding that there are currently only 17 active research grants for muscular dystrophy research. Do you believe that is sufficient? What is NIAMSdoing to encourage and fund more research grants in this area? Answer. The NIAMS, together with the National Institute of Neurological Dis- orders and Stroke (NINDS), considers research on the muscular dystrophies to bea priority area. We will continue to work with the extramural muscular dystrophyresearch community, as well as interested patient organizations, to stimulate andsupport promising studies in this area. In fiscal year 1999, the NIAMS investednearly $5.4 million in muscular dystrophy projects, an increase of over 40 percentfrom the previous fiscal year. A number of exciting studies with implications for our understanding of the mus- cular dystrophies have been supported by the NIAMS in recent years. One such in-vestigation used gene therapy to restore muscle function in a hamster model oflimb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). In another NIAMS-funded study, research-ers successfully used the common antibiotic gentamicin to restore the function of thegene that encodes for the protein dystrophin in mouse models of Duchenne musculardystrophy (DMD). In a third project, NIAMS-supported researchers used gene ther-apy in mice to give the body a boost in fighting the effects of aging on muscle, andto help repair the damage caused by injury and muscle-wasting disorders such asmuscular dystrophy. These projects underscore the potential of treating humanforms of LGMD, DMD and other muscular dystrophies with gene therapy ap-proaches. Another area of excitement relates to a new protocol developed with support from the NIAMS that makes it possible to obtain an almost unlimited number of a specialclass of adult stem cells from a small sample of bone marrow. These adult stem cellshave the ability to develop into cells of muscle, nerve, bone, cartilage and fat. Be-cause of their vast potential for differentiation, they may be excellent therapy vec-tors for a number of skeletal diseases, including muscular dystrophy. Next month, the NIAMS \u2014in partnership with the NINDS and the NIH Office of Rare Diseases \u2014will support two research meetings on muscular dystrophy. The first is an international scientific conference centered on clinical and molecular studiesof facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). The meeting will bring together research-ers who are already involved in FSHD projects, as well as scientists who are work-ing in related fields and may be able to contribute to progress on FSHD. The secondmeeting will focus on therapeutic approaches for DMD. This workshop is aimed ataddressing key questions in improving treatments for DMD, identifying areas ofneeded scientific knowledge, and critical next steps to promote effective therapy.The NIH expects to build on the insights from these two meetings to develop newprogram initiatives related to the muscular dystrophies. Such initiatives would com-plement on-going efforts to stimulate research in this area, including the currentlyactive program announcement on the pathogenesis and therapies of the musculardystrophies. Question. What, if any, coordinated strategy exists between NIAMS and NINDS to focus research on Duchenne and integrate scientific discoveries from related re-317 search? Would a consensus conference on Duchenne/Becker Dystrophies be ficial in creating that focus? Answer. and NINDS share the lead for Duchenne/Becker muscular dys- trophy research. NIAMS brings to this role a perspective as the lead institute forbasic studies of muscle biology and most muscle diseases. NINDS leads in the studyof the many neurological disorders that affect neuromuscular control. Since the dis-covery of the muscular dystrophies, neurologists have played a major role in diag-nosis and care of children and in research on these disorders. Interactions amongmedical professionals from several disciplines are increasingly important in studyingand treating the muscular dystrophies, and the involvement of several componentsof NIH in muscular dystrophy research reflects this. Some have expressed concern that no single component of NIH is responsible for all muscular dystrophy research. The division of responsibilities for muscular dys-trophy research among components of NIH reflects the biological complexities of thedisease, and there are substantial benefits from bringing a coordinated approachfrom multiple perspectives focused on muscular dystrophy. This issue in general isan important one for NIH. Biology does not abide by administrative divisions. Mostdisorders, including the muscular dystrophies, affect many aspects of physiology,benefit from a wide range of fundamental biological research, and require that weexplore diverse strategies for treatment. It is therefore essential to bring to bear ex-pertise and resources from all parts of NIH, as appropriate. The need for coordina-tion is very real, and we must be vigilant. For muscular dystrophy, NIAMS andNINDS together take the lead and have initiated joint solicitations, scientific work-shops and other activities, involving other components of NIH. As noted earlier, the NIAMS and NINDS are presently partnering with the NIH Office of Rare Diseases to sponsor a workshop on therapeutic approaches for DMD.A number of scientific questions will be explored at this meeting with the goal ofmoving currently studied therapies toward human trials. Institute staff haveworked closely with the DMD research community, as well as patient advocates, todevelop the agenda for this workshop. At present, an NIH consensus conference onDMD may be premature \u2014as the primary goal of such conferences is to develop a report evaluating state-of-the-art scientific information on a given biomedical tech-nology with the purpose of resolving a particular controversial issue in clinical prac-tice. However, it is our expectation that the meeting we are sponsoring this springon DMD will provide an important focus for new approaches to this disorder, andwill serve as the basis for future programmatic efforts. Question. Concerns have been raised that there is no separate study section for muscle biology within any of the institutes of NIH. Why is this the case? Do youbelieve the NIH is properly organized to evaluate and coordinate muscle biology-re-lated research \u2014specifically related to Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy? Answer. The NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR), which conducts the peer re- view process, is currently involved in a comprehensive assessment of its study sec-tion structure, led by Dr. Bruce Alberts, the President of the National Academy ofSciences. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that CSR provides a rigorous,unbiased review system that facilitates the advance of all areas of biomedical re-search, including muscle biology. Indeed, muscle disease review issues are beingconsidered as part of the assessment. CSR will also be meeting with scientists atthe Duchenne muscular dystrophy workshop in May to discuss this and other re-view concerns. The outcome of these discussions will help guide future decisionsabout the review of muscle-related research grant applications. There is no simple answer to the question of whether a dedicated study section would enhance the success of muscular dystrophy research applications or otherwiseimprove coordination of muscle-related research. It is important to consider that theNIH receives a broad range of research applications on muscle functioning and dis-ease, and diverse areas of scientific expertise are required to review those applica-tions. Whether it is desirable \u2014or, indeed, even feasible \u2014to cluster all muscle re- search proposals into a single study section is one of the questions being exploredby the CSR assessment described above. DIABETES RESEARCH Question. Over 175,000 adults in Wisconsin were diagnosed with diabetes in 1996. In addition to the physical and life-threatening complications diabetes sufferers face,the costs of diabetes in Wisconsin total nearly $2.3 billion annually. I realize that funds for trans-NIH diabetes research are estimated to increase by 15.7 percent in fiscal year 2000, with a 14.7 percent increase for NIH overall. Inrecent years, NIH has recommended to Congress allocations among institutes thatgenerally spread the funding increase evenly among Institutes.318 Do you think that across-the-board allocations adequately fund all new scientific opportunities equally? How does this across-the-board approach square with the as-sertion by NIH that allocations should be made on the basis of scientific oppor-tunity, the greatest need, and the greatest potential for breakthroughs? Answer. NIH recommendations to Congress regarding allocations to the Institutes and Centers (ICs) vary each year to reflect many factors and consultations. The NIHsolicits advice from a large number of individuals and groups, including the mem-bers of the scientific community, patient advocacy groups, Congress, the Administra-tion, and NIH staff. Each IC convenes meetings of its national advisory council orboard to review a broad range of policies and sponsors many workshops and con-ferences to gather opinions on specific areas of science. The efforts of the ICs to seekexternal advice are further augmented by those of the NIH Director through meet-ings of the Advisory Committee to the Director and the Council of Public Represent-atives. Also, last year, for the first time, the NIH held a Budget Retreat to develop its research priorities and to establish areas of research emphasis in preparation of thePresident 's 2001 budget. Retreat participants included ten external advisors in addi- tion to the NIH and IC leadership. As reflected in the fiscal year 2001 budget re-quest, proposed increases by IC range from 10.8 percent for the Fogarty Inter-national Center to 3.3 percent for the National Institute on Nursing Research. The final fiscal year 2000 appropriation, incorporating NIH recommendations, also provided a range of funding levels across the NIH. Increases ranged from 36.6percent for the newly-established National Center for Alternative Medicine, to 14.4percent for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,with other ICs receiving an increase in the range of 12 -13 percent. By any measure, the amount the NIDDK received in fiscal year 2000 was substantial and unprece-dented and will allow a major commitment of resources to new diabetes initiatives.We will increase our diabetes research efforts by over 17 percent \u2014more than two percentage points over the fiscal year 2000 increase provided to the NIDDK as awhole. This increase will permit new and significantly expanded research on type1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes complications. Some examples include: expandedsupport for studies of islet transplantation in humans, including support of six newresearch projects and the establishment of an islet transplant registry; increasedsupport of the type 2 diabetes genetic linkage consortium; identifying and character-izing the genes involved in pancreatic endocrine development and function; fundingof two new Diabetes Centers; novel approaches to imagingfunctional islet beta cells; understanding and combating the increase of type 2 dia-betes in children, especially from minority groups; approaches to diabetic foot com-plications \u2014a major cause of amputations particularly affecting minority popu- lations; studies of the cause and treatment of diabetic neurologic complications; and,together with the NHLBI, support of two major clinical trials relating to cardio- vascular complications of diabetes. Question. Can you tell us how you plan to allocate the increases you have been receiving as a result of Congress ' commitment to doubling NIH spending overall? For example, what will be the breakdown of expenditures applied to existing pro-grams and research projects, compared to money provided to exciting new researchinitiatives identified by the Diabetes Research Working Group (DRWG)? Answer. Over 70 percent of our approximate $150 million increase over fiscal year 1999 will be used to meet commitments for non-competing continuations in fiscalyear 2000. Much of the remaining fiscal year 2000 increase will be directed towardcongressional emphases in diabetes and prostate disease. We are making a majorcommitment of resources to new diabetes initiatives, by increasing our diabetes re-search efforts by over 17 percent \u2014more than two percentage points over the 15 per- cent increase provided to the NIDDK as a whole. The increase provided to NIDDK in fiscal year 2000 will permit new and signifi- cantly expanded research on type 1 and type 2 diabetes and on diabetes complica-tions. Some examples include: expanded support for studies of islet transplantationin humans, including support of six new research projects and the establishment ofan islet transplant registry; increased support of the type 2 diabetes genetic linkageconsortium; identifying and characterizing the genes involved in pancreatic endo-crine development and function; funding of two new Diabetes Endocrinology Re-search Centers; novel approaches to imaging functional islet beta cells; under-standing and combating the increase of type 2 diabetes in children, especially fromminority groups; approaches to diabetic foot complications \u2014a major cause of ampu- tations particularly affecting minority populations; studies of the cause and treat-ment of diabetic neurologic complications; and, together with the NHLBI, supportof two major clinical trials relating to cardiovascular complications of diabetes.319 Question. What amount of funds would it take for the NIDDK to fully implement its share of the recommendations of the DRWG? Can you find the money to meetthe DRWG recommendations in the context of a doubling of the overall NIH budgetif NIDDK is generally increased by the same percent as the overall NIH increaseeach year, give or take a percent? Answer. The DRWG Strategic Plan made both scientific and funding recommenda- tions for fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2004 for each Institute and Center ofthe NIH, as well as for the NIH as a whole. For the NIDDK specifically, the DRWGrecommended that diabetes research funding reach $501.1 million in fiscal year2000; $654.8 million in fiscal year 2001; and continue to rise to $989.7 million infiscal year 2004. For the entire NIH, the DRWG recommended that diabetes re-search funding reach $827 million in fiscal year 2000; $1.074 billion in fiscal year2001; and continue to rise to $1.6 billion by fiscal year 2004. Diabetes research is receiving significant funding increases across the NIH \u2014ris- ing from a funding level of $457.6 million in fiscal year 1999, to an estimated $525.1million in fiscal year 2000 and an estimated $561 million for fiscal year 2001. How-ever, the NIDDK cannot fully implement all of the recommendations of the DRWG,even in the context of a doubling of the NIH budget, assuming that its percentagefunding increase generally matches the overall percentage increase for the NIHproper. In fiscal year 2000, for example, even if the NIDDK had been able to applythe entirety of its funding increase of $150 million to diabetes research, it wouldstill have fallen substantially short of the target funding level of $501.1 million setfor it by the DRWG. The five-year funding trajectory recommended by the DRWG for NIDDK and NIH diabetes research, respectively, would represent an increase in excess of 3.5 timesfiscal year 1999 funding levels. Thus, even if its budget doubled in five years, itwould not be possible for the NIDDK to implement all of the DRWG recommenda- tions in the time frame specified without seriously harming research programs onother diseases of national concern that are within the NIDDK 's research responsibil- ities\u2014and the DRWG itself recommended against the diversion of funds from other programs. Question. Can you give us your opinion of the DRWG report? To what extent do you agree that it provides a serious outline for the direction in which our diabetesresearch portfolio ought to go? Answer. The Diabetes Research Working Group (DRWG) Strategic Plan serves as an important guidepost which the NIH is using to help frame its diabetes researchagenda. The Strategic Plan represents a year-long deliberative planning process con-ducted by twelve eminent scientific leaders in diabetes research and four lay rep-resentatives, including representatives from both the Juvenile Diabetes FoundationInternational and the American Diabetes Association. The DRWG also solicited ad-vice from many ad hoc scientific experts and public commentary. The WorkingGroup evaluated all aspects of diabetes health issues, as well as the state-of-the-science, in an effort to develop a comprehensive plan. Thus, the recommendationsof the DRWG Strategic Plan reflect the consensus of many talented scientists andconcerned patients about the most promising avenues we can pursue to achievegreater understanding and more effective treatments for diabetes and to realizemeans to prevent and cure both forms of the disease and its complications. The NIHhas already undertaken many new initiatives related to the extraordinary opportu-nities and special needs identified by the DRWG and will continue to use the DRWGStrategic Plan as a scientific framework for additional new initiatives in the yearsahead, along with advice from our National Advisory Council and emerging sci-entific leads from conferences, workshops and other sources of external advice. MULTIPLE MYELOMA Question. As you well know, this committee and our colleagues in the House both addressed research for multiple myeloma in our respective reports last year. I espe-cially want to thank the chairman of this committee, Senator Specter for his leader-ship on this issue. It is my understanding that you decided to include multiple myeloma in next month 's scheduled Progress Review Group (PRG) for leukemia and lymphoma. Will this, in your opinion, fulfill the intent of the report language requesting a consensusconference or scientific workshop on multiple myeloma? Do you think the PRG willfundamentally change the NCI 's multiple myeloma research program? Answer. The Leukemia, Lymphoma and Myeloma (LLM) PRG will be an excellent way to address the report language requesting a consensus conference/scientificworkshop on multiple myeloma. It will undoubtedly have an impact on the direction320 of NCI 's myeloma research program. There are nevertheless some issues that need explanation: The PRG process may be a more useful approach for scientific planning than ei- ther a consensus conference or a scientific workshop. Like a consensus conference,a PRG identifies a set of recommendations upon which all group members agree.However, a PRG goes well beyond a consensus conference by identifying researchneeds and opportunities that experts in the field agree are the most important. PRGparticipants do this by reviewing many research needs and opportunities and thenprioritizing them. Consequently, a PRG also goes well beyond a scientific workshop,which also can involve a large number of participants but rarely results in a listof research priorities and recommendations. In order that each of the three cancers receives sufficient attention during the PRG process, NCI has named three co-chairs, one for each cancer type. This ar-rangement will provide leadership for each cancer being reviewed by the PRG. Inaddition, NCI is committed to sufficient advocate participation throughout the PRGprocess. Clinical and scientific experts, however, will often have interests in morethan one of these diseases, and therefore it makes sense to combine these cancerswithin one PRG .NCI is confidant that a combined PRG will have a great impacton the direction of the Institute 's myeloma research program, since prior PRGs have resulted in substantial adjustments to the Institute 's breast cancer and prostate cancer programs. It is likely that there will be some recommendations/actions thatserve all three groups of cancers as well as some recommendations/actions thatserve the unique needs of each disease and community. The Leukemia, Lymphoma, Myeloma PRG is already well underway. The PRG leadership team will meet in June 2000 to select the PRG membership and to beginplanning the PRG 's agenda. Question. Although multiple myeloma is a hematological cancer \u2014according to NCI SEER data, it is the second fastest growing hematologic cancer in the UnitedStates \u2014it's most obvious effects are in the bone destruction caused by the plasma tumors. Are there any plans to increase collaboration between NCI and NIAMS onthe issue of bone disease and multiple myeloma? Answer. NCI is currently collaborating with NIAMS in a multi-center epidemio- logic study, entitled ''Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MR.OS). '' A major goal of this study is to assess the relationships among risk factors of osteoporotic fractures andprostate cancer in older men (>65 years old). A total of 5,700 men will be recruitedin six diverse geographical areas and will be followed for seven years. MR. OS willprovide a unique perspective on prostate cancer occurrence influenced by the skel-etal, hormonal, and lifestyle determinants associated with osteoporosis. Findingscould provide avenues for additional research leading to preventive strategies forprostate cancer. Another NCI-NIAMS collaboration involving studies of bone disease is the long- term support of the ''Rochester Epidemiology Project '' at the Mayo Foundation. Data have been collected during the past 34 years on the population of Rochester andOlmsted Counties, Minnesota, and several studies within the Project have publishedresults on bone fractures associated with chronic disease and osteoporosis in the el-derly. Investigators have also reported the incidence and trends in rates of multiplemyeloma in Olmsted County during 1978 through 1990. As scientific advances and new technologies increase research capabilities to ex- plore associations between bone disease and multiple myeloma, the NCI and NIAMSlook forward to collaborating in this endeavor. Question. Does the NCI have any plans, or would it consider, establishing a work- ing relationship with the CDC to develop more comprehensive epidemiological andoccupational health statistics to support myeloma research activities? Answer. NCI investigators currently collaborate with several investigators at the CDC on epidemiologic and surveillance studies of multiple myeloma and otherhematopoietic malignancies. One study with CDC 's National Center for Environ- mental Health, includes multiple myeloma and collects biological specimens neededto analyze occupational and environmental exposures in the general population. Inanother study, NCI investigators found a relationship between risk of multiplemyeloma and exposure to solvents among workers at a U.S. Air Force base. NCIsupports the continuation and expansion of collaborative activities with the CDC toexplore and develop new methods and approaches to better understand the originsof multiple myeloma and the reasons for the unusually high rates in certain popu-lations such as African-Americans. NCI and the CDC have recently established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for implementing an enhanced and more coordinated national cancer surveil-lance effort. NCI and CDC share a vision for a federally integrated comprehensivenational cancer surveillance system. This system will build upon and strengthen the321 existing infrastructure, improve the availability of high quality data used to meas- ure the nation 's cancer burden, and advance the capacity for surveillance research. The scope of this coordinated cancer surveillance system includes coverage of the en-tire U.S. population using high quality data to measure cancer risk and health be-haviors, incidence, treatment, morbidity, mortality, and other outcomes. As leadersand catalysts in federal cancer control activities, NCI and CDC enter into thisagreement to enhance cancer surveillance at national, state and regional levels. Thisincludes developing ways of looking at each cancer site nationally. Geographic Infor-mation Systems (GIS) methodologies will enable researchers to link environmentalexposures with unusually high occurrences of cancer on a geographic basis. TheSEER registry and the CDC Cancer Surveillance System, especially working in col-laboration, can help identify new hypotheses for causal studies in multiple myeloma. In addition, the NCI coordinates and supports many epidemiological studies con- ducted intramurally and extramurally, on multiple myeloma and otherlymphoproliferative diseases. Intramural investigators are collaborating with inves-tigators participating in the SEER program in a large case-control study of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma to which a multiple myeloma component has recently been added. Under analysis is a multi-centered case-control study of multiple myelomain blacks and whites in the United States. It is designed to identify the risk factorsfor this tumor. A new study linking total population registries, cancer registries, andhospitalizations for auto-immune diseases is in the planning phase in an effort toclarify the risk of familial occurrences of multiple myeloma and other hematopoieticmalignancies. Also, analyses of existing case-control data are being conducted asnovel occupational, geographic, and environmental hypotheses arise. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR BARBARA A. M IKULSKI WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT OF NIH 'SO E O Question. What is Acting NIH Director Dr. Ruth Kirschstein personally doing to address concerns about the workplace environment of the NIH Office of Equal Op-portunity (OEO) and the OEO Director 's treatment of OEO employees? Answer. Dr. Kirschstein has been deeply concerned and personally involved in the issues related to the workplace environment of the NIH Office of Equal Opportunity(OEO). She has discussed these issues with all the persons involved and after suchdiscussions did not appear to improve matters, she assigned the NIH Ombudsmanthe task of resolving the issue. The Ombudsman with the services of a mediator,experienced in this area, developed a process of a series of meetings, some sepa-rately with individual or groups of employees, at which they have had the oppor-tunity to raise specific concerns privately and some separately with the Director,OEO. In addition, the two mediators have held joint meetings between the employ-ees and the Director, OEO, at which views were exchanged. It has become clear thatthe issues of which you are aware, raised by some OEO employees do not representthose of all OEO employees. Nevertheless, it is clear that the issues are real andmust be and are being settled. A good deal of progress has been made. The Director, OEO has been responsive to the concerns raised by the employees, and has undertaken certain necessarysteps to address the most pressing matters. In addition, the NIH has resolved thespecific concerns of two OEO employees, and has entered into agreements withthem that fully satisfy their concerns. Other actions are in progress and we are opti-mistic that a satisfactory outcome will result. MINORITY REPRESENTATION Question. Please specify what specific steps NIH is taking to address the following items, providing specific timetables for actions that NIH will take to: \u2014ensure that NIH has sufficient representation at all levels of African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos/Hispanics, Asian Pacific Americans and how NIH In-stitute and Center Directors will be held accountable for meeting establishedgoals (OEO) \u2014retain African Americans at NIH (OEO) \u2014improve the tenure rate of African American scientists at NIH (OIR) Answer. While no Federal agency can legally assure that its actions will result in complete representation of all minority groups based on their availability in thework force, including persons with disabilities, many proactive steps are underwayby the NIH to achieve a diverse organization. Under the auspices of the NIH Affirm-ative Action Planning Program (AAP), each Institute and Center (IC) has the flexi-bility to set annual hiring goals. Based on an annual analysis of underrepresenta-322 tion that is conducted of the various occupational series, goals are then established, based upon projections of anticipated hiring need. Individually tailored recruitmentstrategies, necessary to address the specific underrepresented EEO groups withinits organization, are targeted for each vacancy. At the end of each fiscal year, theICs report their accomplishments. IC recruitment strategies vary, according to the targeted audience and the vacan- cies under consideration. They may include the use of: Career Opportunity TrainingAgreements, the Student Temporary Employment Program, advertising of vacancieson the Internet, exhibits at conferences such as those of the Association of AmericanIndian Physicians (AAIP), the American Council on Education, the American IndianScience and Engineering Society (AISES), the National Hispanic Medical Associa-tion, the Student National Medical Association, the Hispanic Association of Collegesand Universities (HACU), and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Na-tive Americans (SACNAS). Additional recruitment activities are held at other pro-fessional meetings as well, including those of the Mexican-American Engineers andScientists (MAES), the Association of Minority Health Professions Symposium(AMHPS) on Careers in Biomedical Professions, the League of United Latin Amer-ican Citizens, the National Council of LaRaza, and the National Black Nurses Asso-ciation. Additionally, EEO Officers attend local career fairs at George WashingtonUniversity, Morgan State University, University of Maryland-Baltimore Campus,and Bowie State University. Responsibilities for Equal Employment Opportunity Programs are included as an integral part of managerial performance elements to establish accountability. TheOEO guidance to IC Directors on specific areas for inclusion in their annual accom-plishment reports, as required for SES managers, serves to maintain consistencyacross IC lines. All SES managers have a separate element which is reviewed bytheir respective IC Director. All IC Directors ' annual accomplishments and accom- panying proposed ratings are reviewed by a subgroup of the NIH Performance Re-view Board. The Director, OEO, is a voting member of that group. Additionally, theNIH requires a performance appraisal covering EEO Program accomplishments forsupervisors and managers through the use of either the stand alone critical EEOperformance element or an overall supervisory or management element that incor-porates EEO responsibilities. An EEO Program element is also part of the annualCommissioned Corps performance review mechanism and is one of 18 critical ele-ments that comprise an officer 's annual rating. In June 1999, the NIH established a Corporate Recruitment Task Force designed to develop global trans-NIH recruitment strategies including those needed to ad-dress barriers to minority representation in the NIH work force. Its members in-clude IC EEO and Personnel Officers as well as Office of Equal Opportunity(OEO)staff members. Common goals include the development of a unified corporate ap-proach to recruitment and related issues such as relocation matters, recruitment techniques, and targeted occupations common to all or most ICs. Implementation ofthe Task Force 's objectives is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2001. The recruitment of minority and women scientists is extremely competitive both within the Federal government and private enterprise. NIH continues to use the payflexibility provisions of Title 42 and Title 38 to attract candidates to the NIH cam-pus. Additionally, the NIH AIDS Research, Clinical Research, and General ResearchLoan Repayment Programs are used as recruitment incentives for minority andwomen scientists. The NIH Undergraduate Scholarship Program offers competitivescholarships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are committed to ca-reers in biomedical research. In 1999, 10 scholarships were awarded to AfricanAmerican (1), non-minority (4), Asian/Pacific Islander (1), and Hispanic (4) students. To foster an environment that attracts and retains minority employees, the OEO sponsors Workforce Diversity Initiative (WDI) activities. These activities promoteequal opportunity goals, engender respect for the similarities and differences thatemployees bring to the workplace and assist managers and supervisors in learninghow to capitalize on those similarities and differences while promoting quality, fair-ness and efficiency. For example, the OEO sponsored an educational project entitledthe ''NIH Diversity Book Bridge Project. '' This project took a fresh approach of using literature as a tool to discuss diversity issues. Guidance is regularly provided to theIC Diversity Catalysts to supplement the Catalysts Implementation Manual whichwas designed to identify specific duties for the newly appointed Catalysts in the ICs.The OEO staff provided a second document, ''Guidelines for OEO Diversity Program Managers '' (DPMs), for the OEO staff in their role as consultants to the ICs in the implementation of the WDI. Sharing the guidelines on DPM roles with the ICs wasmeant to reinforce the value of developing long term strategies and processes to pro-mote the WDI throughout the NIH. In November of 1999, Vice President Gore 's Spe- cial Diversity Task Force recognized the NIH diversity process as a best practice,323 referencing in particular, the unique appointing of Diversity Catalysts in each of the ICs. Some of the ICs have incorporated the Quality of Work Life Plans into theirdiversity initiatives as a method of creating a healthy work environment for employ-ees. The NIH is also deeply involved in several ongoing Departmental Minority Initia- tives. For example, the employment aspects of the Departmental Hispanic Agendafor Action and other minority initiatives related to annual recruitment activities areaddressed. During fiscal year 1999, there was a significant increase in the numberof HACU interns as compared to the participation rate of 10 during the previousfiscal year. Total participation during fiscal year 1999 numbered 21: 7 during theSpring Semester and 14 during the Summer. There were 7 students enrolled in theWashington Internship for Native American Students (WINS) Program, and 10 Afri-can American interns from the National Association for Equal Opportunity in High-er Education (NAFEO) Program. Data shows that NIH needs to continue its efforts to address the retention of Afri- can Americans, particularly African American males in the scientific occupations.Several years ago, an exit interview program was established and a questionnairewas administered to all employees leaving the Agency. Based on the low responserate to the questionnaire, however, the program was discontinued. Lacking the abil-ity to clearly identify a pattern of the reasons employees left the NIH, other actionshave been taken to try to improve the NIH work climate as much as possible. Forexample, the Center for Cooperative Resolution has been shown as an effective al-ternative to the traditional methods of conflict management. Headed by an Ombuds-man, the Center regularly evaluates new approaches to conflict resolution and en-courages employees to develop new and more effective ways to deal with issues theyface in the workplace. The Center has addressed more than 400 cases with a resolu-tion rate of better than 80 percent. The Center offers a variety of alternative disputeresolution processes, including facilitation, mediation, shuttle diplomacy, and sys-tems change. Within the past year, the Center has begun other initiatives such asthe implementation of a seminar series on conflict for executives, utilization of PeerPanels, as well as preparation of preliminary plans for partnering agreements forscientific collaborations. More and more employees are becoming informed of theavailability of the Center from briefings, publicity, and its reputation for efficiency,confidentiality, and neutrality. At the same time, the Federal discrimination com-plaint processing mechanism is communicated to all employees who may wish toutilize its provisions in seeking redress of employment related concerns. As reflected above, the objectives of the NIH AAP have served to identify and re- cruit minority members, women, and persons with disabilities into the work force.Once recruited, additional initiatives mentioned above, such as the WDI, have beentaken to create and maintain a healthy work environment for employees. Tenure at the NIH is granted to outstanding scientists who have made major con- tributions to biomedical research and includes both salary support and commitmentof research resources subject to rigorous review every fouryears. Tenure differs frompermanent appointment in a civil service position since it includes research supportas well as salary. Tenure policy and procedures at NIH were completely revampedin 1993 with additional modifications made in 1996. A major intent of the new ten-ure policy was to provide equality of access and opportunity for all individuals quali-fied for tenure-track positions. Tenure-track positions are the principal point ofentry for investigators to achieve tenure at the NIH. The specifics of the policy andprocedures may be viewed at the following websites: The Tenure-Track Program at http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/irp-policy/ tenure-track.htm Tenure in the NIH Intramural Research Program \u2014Modifications to Policy at http://www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/irp-policy/tenure.htm Search Process for Tenure and Tenure-Track Investigators at http:// www1.od.nih.gov/oir/sourcebook/irp-policy/search.htm All tenure-track positions are advertised nationally using an advertisement that must be approved by the Deputy Director for Intramural Research (DDIR). A SearchCommittee must be established for every tenure-track position that becomes avail-able. The composition of the Search Committee must also be approved by the DDIRand each committee must have as voting members a scientist who is an under-rep-resented minority, a woman scientist and a scientist selected by the DDIR to serveas his representative. Despite these efforts to attract and recruit to NIH under-represented minority sci- entists, from January 1999 through March 2000, NIH hired a total of 34 tenure-track investigators, of whom 1 (2.9 percent) is African American. From January1999 through March 2000, 34 total investigators successfully achieved tenure, of324 whom 2 (5.9 percent) are African Americans. This number represents 100 percent of African American candidates considered for tenure. To increase the pool of qualified candidates for tenure-track and tenured positions at the NIH, the NIH intramural program continues to increase efforts to attractunder-represented minorities into research training programs early in their bio-medical research careers, to provide training in biomedical research and to acquainttrainees with the career opportunities available at NIH. It is expected that researchtraining opportunities such as the Summer Internship Program for high school, col-lege and graduate students (http://www.training.nih.gov/student/internship/intern-ship.asp), the Undergraduate Scholarship Program (UGSP) for undergraduate stu-dents from a disadvantaged background (http://ugsp.info.nih.gov/), the Post-baccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award for students that have obtainedtheir Bachelor 's degree and fully intend to pursue doctoral degrees in the biomedical sciences (http://www.training.nih.gov/student/Pre-IRTA/previewpostbac.asp), and thenewly created NIH Academy for postbaccalaureates interested in domestic healthdisparities (http://www.training.nih.gov/student/Pre-IRTA/irtamanualpostbacAcademy.asp) will help increase the pipeline of under-representedminorities who can successfully compete for tenure-track and tenure positions at theNIH. CONCLUSION OF HEARINGS Senator S PECTER . Thank you all very much for being here, that concludes our hearing. The subcommittee will stand in recess sub-ject to the call of the Chair. [Whereupon, at 10:53 a.m., Thursday, March 30, the hearings were concluded, and the subcommittee was recessed, to reconvenesubject to the call of the Chair.](325)DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, ANDRELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FORFISCAL YEAR 2001 U.S. S ENATE , SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS , Washington, DC. NONDEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES [CLERK 'S NOTE .\u2014The subcommittee was unable to hold hearings on nondepartmental witnesses. The statements and letters of thosesubmitting written testimony are as follows:] DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES GENERAL HEALTHCARE PREPARED STATEMENT OF PERSONS UNITED LIMITING SUBSTANDARDS & E RRORS IN HEALTHCARE OF COLORADO Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to submit written testimony to request funding for public education tohelp reduce Medical Errors. As a consumer advocate, I feel that it is imperative tobudget funding for public education, consumer Hotlines and an Federal agency thatwill oversee all state medical boards and create national standards of care that willbe communicated to the consumer. It is ludicrous to believe that the many problemsin the present system will be remedied anytime soon. Therefore, the consumer mustknow exactly what their responsibility is as an informed and savvy patient to reducethe incidence of medical errors. I lost my mother in February of 1995 under similar circumstances to those that Debra Malone lost her father, Dr. Karl Shipman. A combination of inexperiencedand overworked hospital nurses, an inept and arrogant physician, misdiagnosis andmedication errors caused my mother to suffer a myocardial infarction as an inpa-tient. She was in a coma for seven weeks before she died. Had she presented at anemergency room with the same symptoms that were ignored on the floor, emergencyprotocol would have taken the necessary tests to determine what was going on andmay have saved her life. I found it nearly impossible to get any answers, and wasappalled to learn that what my mother experienced was common. Nothing was re-ported by anyone but myself and by my own perseverance. I did not sue, had I goneforward with a civil suit, Colorado tort reform laws would have limited any awardor settlement to less than the cost of pursuing the case. I filed complaints with themedical and nursing boards. Both agencies initially dismissed my complaints. Thenursing board dismissed the original complaints at a lunch. Several local nurses as-sisted me in preparing the original complaints. After the luncheon dismissal, I spokewith the nursing board administrator. She indicated that if one of the nurses whohelped me write the complaints would simply write her a letter and sign it, shewould reopen the complaints process. I asked the nurses to do this, they all refused.Having become an advocate and networking with other states advocacy groups, Ifound two out of state nurses with impeccable credentials willing to review therecords. I did not know either of them, but they were both sympathetic to the causeand reviewed the records for free. Paying for the review would have hurt the credi-bility with the regulatory agency. Both nurse 's letters said precisely what the local326 nurses told me to include in the original complaints. The administrator did keep her word, an investigation was opened that resulted in disciplinary action for two of thethree nurses I filed complaints on. It is disturbing that the outcome was based onthe two out of state letters, not my original complaints. The medical board told methat they would reevaluate the physician complaint if I had a physician review therecords. Unfortunately, I could not find one anywhere in the United States willingto do this for free. Peer review should be reporting these things to the regulatory agencies, they are not. The regulatory agencies investigate nearly 100 percent of all peer review com-plaints filed. Sadly, the regulatory agencies dismiss the majority of all consumercomplaints, without checking their validity. This is not due to lazy medical boards,it is another facet of the present ailing system of healthcare delivery. In our society, most of us see our doctors as family. We seem to have a parent child like relationship with them. We hear stories of medical errors or problems, yetwe feel that our own private physician has our care under total control and nothinglike that could ever happen to us. We regard our doctor as a child regards a parent,the all knowing, all seeing omnipotent super hero who protects us from all adver-sity. Most medical errors that occur are far from the control of our private doctors.When we are exposed to the adversities, we become confused and angry. Thepresent system as it now exists does not allow our personal physicians to commu-nicate the entire story to us. We then lose faith, hope and trust, we search for an-swers and find none. It is then, and only then, that we seek out legal counsel,searching for answers, truth and justice. I cannot imagine how difficult it must befor our personal physicians to know that something went wrong, yet not be able tocomfort us, nor have a place to report the incident without fearing the consequencesof doing so. What agony it must be for our doctors. These physicians, like us, arevictims of a severely impaired system that must change. Medicine is not an exact science, yet we expect perfection, when we don 't get per- fection, we expect compensation. How puzzling it is that less than 2 percent of allvictims of medical errors seek legal counsel, yet the fear of lawsuits barricades vol-untary reporting of errors in medical care. Those who work inside of medicine arebound by this code of silence. The present system has the consumer under a falsesense of security. The public must be told the absolute truth, yes, some will do with-out surgical procedures that they would have had not knowing the full risks. Thepublic must be told when they are being treated by doctors in training, and thatthe risks of this lack of experience may be harmful to them. Yes, some will refrain.The public must be told at once when an error occurs, most victims would walkaway with this simple explanation. But, it does not work that way. The threat oflitigation prevents medical boards from doing their jobs effectively because they fearthat their hard work will become free discovery for less then 2 percent of all inci-dents. It is a vicious cycle that leads to nowhere. Imagine how plaintiffs feel years after the incident when their own attorney tells them to accept a modest out of court settlement, and sign a document prohibitingthem from discussing the case indefinitely. Imagine how consumers feel when theyread the release that they must sign that states that the defendants admit no guilt.These settlements are reported to the NPDB, but what good does it do for the peaceof mind of the plaintiff? What good does it now do for future victims of the sameincident when nothing is admitted? Both the medical profession and the consumers are programmed to believe a lie, we have been sold a bill of goods that simply is not true. It is a no win situationfor everyone involved. In Colorado, there have been only 63 plaintiff verdicts inmedical malpractice cases in our courts in seventeen years. The odds of going totrial and winning are not in the favor of the plaintiff. Why?, because, when all issaid and done, and the truth is finally forced, it is usually in favor of the provider,because, ''Medicine is not an exact science, there will be adverse outcomes, and when a physician uses due care, diligence and does make a mistake, he or she isnot accountable for it in civil court ''. Now, if this simple truth were told from the beginning, think of how much grief, anguish and suffering could be avoided, on allsides. That is what is wrong with the present system. It does not work, and as longas we allow this sham to go on, we are doing a grave injustice to society. One member of our organization who lost her child because of poor medical care found out there was a previous board action against the doctor involved for usingpoor judgment in another death of a child. This physician was grossly overworked,seeing too many patients per day. She had taken her child to see this doctor severaltimes a week before he died. At one point she took him to an emergency room andthe other doctors ''did not want to get involved ''. The doctor in question also missed important signs of trouble with several other patients. However, this physician alsodid a great deal of good for other patients. Our town, and our organization were327 heavily spilt over the Medical Board 's decision to suspend his license. This doctor was a victim too, a victim of a savage system that, even though local peer reviewknew of adverse outcomes that were preventable, they were silent and did not re-port them to the medical board, nor did anyone help this doctor with his patientload. The controversy and rumors surrounding this doctor was that he truly lovedthe children he was treating, he and his partner were the only ones in town whowanted to provide care for Medicaid children, other doctors sent Medicaid childrento him. The local medical community made no effort to bring in other doctors inter-ested in Medicaid reimbursements. Knowing that this doctor would be up all nightat local hospitals with families of sick children, the local medical community didnothing when this doctor would barely have time to shave before returning to hisoffice the following morning to see other children. How can someone deprived ofsleep use good judgment? Yet, when the medical board suspended this man 's license based on evidence that they had gathered from many consumer complaints, themedical community remained silent, some other doctors rallied around this doctorand encouraged him to not take responsibility for his mistakes. They allowed thisto go on for so long and finally when the state attempted to intercede, the local med-ical community closed ranks, cried sour grapes, got political and told the state tostay out of local affairs. This made it very difficult for the board, the nurses andconsumers who were brave enough to act. The doctor and the board came to anagreement where he will retire early, and of course, have a clean record. How willthis effect future care by this provider in another state? Why is it that only 2 percent of all consumers affected by medical errors seek legal counsel? Could it be that the rest of us tirelessly go from one attorney to an-other with our tales of grief but none seem interested in our cases? Not because wewere attempting to file frivolous lawsuits but because the attorneys know the usualoutcome of a trial. They know the high percentage of verdicts are found for the de-fendant, not the plaintiff. They know most settlements would barely cover courtcosts and fees, expert testimony etc.. The reason for this needless heartache forthose who believe that they have already been violated or betrayed by medicine isthis code of silence, the lack of an honest explanation when something goes terriblywrong. The time has come for the secrets of medicine to be shared with the con-sumer, in easy to understand language. All too often the elusive ''standard of care '' for a particular malady is virtually untouchable by the consumer until the case getsto trial in civil court. At that time ''expert witnesses '' explain to the non medical people of the jury what happened to the patient in plain terms. These explanationsare why most doctors are found not guilty of medical malpractice in our nationscourts. Only at this time are the errors or mistakes made public, yet most con-sumers know little about researching court documents. These errors again go unre-ported, instead of being addressed, usually get lost in the shuffle. Admitting theerror from the beginning would have avoided the costly ordeal for both the plaintiff and the defendant. If there were a National Patient Safety Board, designed much like the National Transportation Safety board, Federal standards would then be in place and any de-viation from such standards would be addressed and dealt with for the sake of pub-lic safety. Medical errors are at an all time high, people from all walks of life are affected. Things have gotten so out of control that medical errors resulting in preventabledeaths now even touch the lives of physicians themselves. Inefficient health care de-livery has become a way of life and must no longer be tolerated. Many providersask how have things gotten this bad? In every other consumer related industry,there are standard safety guidelines, this is not true in medicine. It appears thatif there are no real standards to follow, no consequences due to lackadaisical behav-ior, and no rewards for creating accountability and dealing with problems, whystrive for excellence? We must then depend on pure conscience of the brave insiderswho blow the whistle risking all, or others who learn through personal loss thatthings must change. Unfortunately, it is unrealistic to believe that this very smallinside minority can police this huge and affluent industry. Most of us are under a false blanket of security that civil justice and government agencies are our protectors. Nothing could be further from the truth. Colorado re-cently made it illegal for a physician to lie to the medical board in his confidentialresponse to a complaint. Civil justice no longer exists, instead the remnants of whatonce may have once been civil justice, have been replaced by a great theatrical andcostly fiasco that sucks everything from both sides of the case at hand. The medicalindustry does not own up freely to mistakes nor does it do anything to correct them,thus leaving the American people with the shadows of a long gone system of honor,truth and justice. Voluntary reporting of medical errors already exists, it has for along time. Voluntary reporting of errors was the reason the National Practitioners328 Data Bank was created. Why then did the IOM study reveal such startling results? Why do we want to reinvent the wheel? We must have mandatory reporting andpublic education to seek excellence. Public education is the only way to help consumers be better patients and take more responsibility for our own healthcare. As is being pursued in other areas, theremust be a national media campaign to educate consumers on taking more responsi-bility and not being so dependent on the healthcare system to take care of them.As early as in middle school, public education programs must begin, teaching indi-viduals responsible receivership of healthcare. Monthly meetings for senior citizenscould be taught in public places by volunteer health care providers. Consumerswould be encouraged to learn from information already available on the illness ordisease that they have been diagnosed with. All would be encouraged to ask ques-tions. Hotlines would be established for questions and answers. All information oncredentials will be available and providers would encourage consumers to use theseresources. Public Service announcements on television would provide consumerswith a toll free number and web site information for many rich resources alreadyavailable for those of us of seek them out. All informed consent forms would begiven to all scheduled surgical candidates a minimum of one week before surgeryfor review to insure the consumer knows exactly what they are signing. There wouldbe a consumer advocate employed by the hospital or out patient facility to explainthe consent form to anyone having questions. Consumers must do their part to in-sure safety in medicine. Providers must allow consumers to do this without offense. Consumers must be taught how to better communicate with all providers. They must know more than they presently do about their own bodies, conditions, and ill-nesses. Consumers must know how to recognize an error in the making and per-sonal physicians must be permitted to advocate for their patients when the patientis in a hospital situation. Consumers who are elderly or mentally impaired musthave someone else available to advocate for them at all times. Excellence in medi-cine will come about only after crossing into a new frontier where physicians andconsumers work together as a real team. Thank you for allowing me to submit written testimony. I am available to testify before the committee if need be. I can supply you with additional documents andinformation upon request. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION On behalf of its 300,000 physician and medical student members, the American Medical Association (AMA) would like to share three of its most pressing concernswith the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget proposal submitted to Congress on February 7, 2000. We hope that you will take our concerns into account and lookforward to working with you as the Committee begins the appropriations processfor the fiscal year 2001 budget. USER FEES Through its budget proposal, the Administration has once again proposed user fees for physicians who submit claims on behalf of their patients. As background,several years ago, Congress enacted legislation requiring that physicians treatingMedicare patients submit these claims to the Medicare program on behalf of theirpatients. Congress has repeatedly rejected the Administration 's attempts to shift Medicare program costs onto physicians through user fees. These user fees are noth-ing but a tax on the physician/provider community, and we urge you to again rejectthem once again. First, the budget proposal would also tax physicians $1 for each paper claim sub- mission. The Administration admitted last year that this would have impacted 21percent of all Part B Medicare claims and 4 percent of Part A Medicare claims ata cost of $495 million over five years. This would be an extraordinary cost for physi-cians to bear simply because their offices have not been linked to an electronic net-work. This tax is especially unwarranted since many physicians may feel more com-fortable submitting hard copies of claims to their carriers given the negative experi-ences that some physicians have had with their carriers and the issues surroundingconfidentiality of patient records. Second, the budget proposal would penalize physicians for resubmitting claims even when payment was seriously overdue or when the contractor had rejected theclaim for trivial or inappropriate reasons. The AMA strongly objects to requiring aphysician to pay to resubmit claims to the Medicare program. The AMA believes that physicians are already bearing an extremely heavy regu- latory burden, which increases exponentially as the Health Care Financing Admin-329 istration (HCFA) issues each new Medicare billing requirement. Physicians should not have to bear the additional cost of administering the Medicare program throughnew and unjustified user fees. PHYSICIAN EDUCATION EFFORTS Several weeks ago, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released the latest version of the Chief Financial Officer(CFO) audit. The audit and its resulting rhetoric refocused attention on billing andalleged fraudulent activities in the Medicare program. However, by OIG 's own ad- mission, auditors have not been able to separate inadvertent billing errors fromfraud. The CFO audit includes all types of improper payments including inadvertentbilling errors, which may involve subjective decisions open to honest disagreement.According to the OIG 's own spokesperson, ''We don 't know how much Medicare fraud there is. '' (Washington Times, 3/11/00) The AMA has been asking since the inception of the audit for details regarding types of billing problems uncovered re-lated to specialty, geographic region, and particular coding issues so that we couldeducate our members on the issues uncovered. The AMA has never been able to ob-tain such information. We urge the federal government and the Congress to stop using such a broad- brush approach and to start being more precise with its language and its responsesto these numbers. Since the advent of the first CFO audit, Congress and the Admin-istration have emphasized enforcement as the way to eliminate inadvertent billing errors from the Medicare program. The AMA urges policymakers to begin to focuson prevention and to start implementing effective and innovative education pro-grams for physicians. Physicians want to comply with Medicare billing regulations,and the AMA believes that federal resources should be devoted to supporting exten-sive education efforts for physicians. The AMA has advocated to implement systematic reforms in situations when a carrier identifies a widespread billing problem in a physician community. The AMAhas asked HCFA to require the carriers to work with the appropriate medical stateand specialty societies to educate physicians about a billing problem and to helpthem understand how to address it in the future. We would also like to see HCFAimplement education efforts for individual physicians when the carrier identifiesthat a physician has a billing problem. Physicians overwhelmingly agree that physi-cian-specific education in the field is not occurring. The AMA believes that HCFA 's current education efforts present overly general directions that fail to aid individual physicians in learning specific Medicare codingand billing requirements. The AMA strongly urges the Appropriations Committee tospecify that HCFA and its carriers will conduct general physician education andprovide education specific to coding and billing procedures that are encountered dur-ing pre and post payment audits. The AMA also believes that the Committee shouldrequire HCFA to use the billing errors identified in the most recent CFO audit tocarry out billing and coding education efforts. The Administration has proposed in its fiscal year 2001 budget to allocate $15.8 million in funding for Provider Education and Training out of a total Medicare con-tractor budget of $1.3 billion. The funding level for provider education and trainingin fiscal year 2000 was also $15.8 million. This funding level, which represents ap-proximately one percent of the carriers ' budget, is woefully inadequate to ensure that physicians and health care providers learn about new changes to Medicare lawsand billing and coding requirements. The AMA urges the Committee to significantlyincrease funding for physician/provider education to ensure that fewer widespreadand physician specific billing errors occur and that the relationship between HCFAand physicians becomes less adversarial. TOLL FREE LINES The Administration has eliminated funding for two types of toll-free lines during the past several years. The first type of toll-free lines allowed physicians to calltheir local carrier for answers to billing and coding questions regarding Medicareclaims submissions. This ''penny-wise pound-foolish '' approach to the Medicare con- tractor budget process eliminated a ready source of information and advice that phy-sicians depended upon when billing the Medicare program. The AMA is pleased thatthe Administrator has now indicated that she intends to restore that capability, andwe urge the Committee to ensure that this funding is continued for fiscal year 2001. The second type of toll-free lines were used by physicians who submitted elec- tronic claims to their Medicare carriers. Instead of proposing to tax physicians fornot submitting electronic claims, the AMA believes that HCFA should provide prop-er incentives for those physicians who employ this preferred method of claims sub-330 mission. As such, the AMA requests that the Appropriations Committee instruct HCFA to reinstitute these toll-free lines to encourage electronic claim submissions. OVERWHELMING REGULATORY BURDENS FOR PHYSICIANS The AMA believes that the Congress should recognize that Medicare regulations are complicated, burdensome and are in need of simplification. Princeton ProfessorUwe Reinhardt described the situation in a January 21, 2000, Wall Street Journaleditorial, stating that Medicare ''regulations have become just too complicated to un- derstand. '' There are more than 100,000 pages of Medicare rules and guidances with which a physician must comply \u2014more than the Internal Revenue Code. Further- more, Medicare billing frequently involves understandable differences of opinion inclinical judgments or the level of service provided. Much of Medicare billing is sub-jective and honest people can, and do, disagree. In fact, a 1995 OIG report foundthat even carriers had difficulty selecting codes. HCFA has also acknowledged that Medicare is complex. However, the AMA be- lieves that the agency 's commitment to reducing administrative burdens is question- able. More than a year ago, HCFA assembled an internal committee named thePhysicians Regulatory Initiative Team (PRIT) to review the multitude of rules, regu-lations and instructions with which physicians must comply in order to treat Medi-care patients. Ultimately, PRIT was to make recommendations about how tostreamline existing regulations. More than a year and a half has passed, and PRIThas still not finished its work. The AMA has had some positive discussions with HCFA regarding physician edu- cation. However, Congress has not dedicated sufficient resources to education, andthe AMA remains concerned that education for physicians will not be a priority. Forinstance, in recent years, the federal government has been holding physicians to azero tolerance for errors standard, while not even providing a mechanism to answerphysicians ' questions. There have been numerous discussions during MedPAC meet- ings regarding Medicare 's complexity, and the AMA was heartened that Congress has asked MedPAC to study the issues surrounding Medicare regulatory reform.Regulatory reform in the Medicare program is long overdue. OIG/CARRIER ACTIVITY When there is true fraud, the AMA supports federal efforts to prosecute such acts. However, the AMA implores the Congress to distinguish between inadvertent billingerrors and fraudulent activity. In addition, we urge Congress to consider a proactiveapproach to ensure compliance by simplifying regulations and significantly increas-ing funding for physician and provider education. Placing OIG agents in carriers ' offices would only further compound the problems faced by the nations ' physicians. Carriers already understand the message coming from Washington and are working diligently to recoup Medicare program money.Spending federal funds to check the checkers does not add up, but rather, wouldserve only to construct additional bureaucracies. These funds should be directed to-wards HCFA 's efforts to simplify the Medicare program and towards carriers for di- rect physician education. We stand ready to assist your Committee during the appropriations process and look forward to working with you on these and other issues. Thank you for the op-portunity to submit this testimony. PREPARED STATEMENT OF SANTA ROSAMEMORIAL HOSPITAL Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the hearing record regarding the proposed Northern Cali-fornia Telemedicine Network. This network will consist of a hub located at SantaRosa Memorial Hospital in Santa Rosa, California and will serve over 11 hospitals,health centers and clinics in Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino, and Humbolt counties. Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital is moving aggressively to build a permanent tele- medicine infrastructure to expand health care services, as well as education andprevention programs into these currently underserved areas. The core of this initia-tive will be located at the Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital Emergency Departmentthat will serve as the ''hub,'' for this regional telemedicine network, providing access to primary, specialty and trauma care services. The Northern California Telemedicine Network will work with other institutions to develop twelve ''spoke '' sites throughout northern California during the initial years of the project including: \u2014St. Joseph 's Hospital, Eureka, California331 \u2014Redwood Memorial Hospital, California \u2014Mendocino Coast District Hospital \u2014Petaluma Valley Hospital \u2014Rohnert Park Healthcare Center \u2014Redwood Coast Medical Services \u2014Anderson Valley Health Clinic \u2014Mendocino Coast Clinics \u2014Potter valley Community Health Center \u2014Long Valley Health and Dental Center \u2014Mendocino Community Health Clinic The growth of this network will enable a telemedicine program to achieve max- imum cost effectiveness by serving multiple spoke sites from a single hub. In addi-tion, it is anticipated that the spoke sites will develop some synergies as a resultof their telemedicine technology that will allow them to communicate more effec-tively with each other and, importantly, with the communities most urgently inneed of those services through the use of telemedicine technologies. As I am sure that you are aware, rural America is experiencing a shortage of pri- mary care physicians and specialist care providers. Primary care physicians are thekeys to meeting the basic health care needs of patients in these areas because theyare able to provide a wide variety of basic health services and identify medical prob-lems needing further attention. Twenty-nine percent of rural residents live inHealth Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) compared to only nine percent of urbanresidents. Statistics from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Developmentin California show that in northern California alone, all of Del Norte county andportions of Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake and Humboldt Counties are all experiencingPrimary Care Health Professional Shortages. People living in remote areas struggle to access timely, quality medical care. Resi- dents of these areas often have substandard access to specialty health care, pri-marily because specialist physicians are more likely to be located in areas of con-centrated population. Because of innovations in computing and telecommunicationstechnology, many elements of medical practice can be accomplished when the pa-tient and health care provider are geographically separated. This separation couldbe as small as across town, across a state, or even across the world. Many areas in California, specifically Northern California are medically under- served areas. The United States Department of Health and Human Services hasclassified portions of Sonoma, Mendocino, Humboldt, Del Norte counties and all ofLake county as federally designated medically underserved areas. Access to medicalcare, especially specialty and trauma care is limited and episodic at best. Often, these communities have been medically underserved due to the concentra- tion of specialty care and health education in urban and suburban neighborhoods.The use of Telemedicine serves to provide California 's underserved patients with the medical services they need. Instead of the patient being forced to travel long dis-tances to reach a specialized provider, the patient, instead, could see their local pro-vider and receive specialized care via telemedicine saving time, improving safetyand providing a much needed service for the patient. Additionally, the need foremergency transport of patients would be significantly decreased due to the abilityof telemedicine to assist in the diagnosis of a trauma patient on site. Californiacould significantly benefit from the development of telemedicine due to its large geo-graphical area with a population located in big cities, smaller towns and isolatedrural regions. Telemedicine has the potential to improve the delivery of health care in America by bringing a wider range of services to underserved communities and individualsin both urban and rural areas. In addition, telemedicine can help attract and retainhealth professionals in rural areas by providing ongoing training and collaborationwith other health professionals. Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital is grateful for the initial funding that your sub- committee provided in fiscal year 2000. This funding will enable us to establish thefirst like. We look forward to working with you to secure additional funds which willenable us to link the remaining 10 sites throughout California 's north coast. Mr. Chairman, we believe that Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital 's Northern Cali- fornia Telemedicine Network creates a national model for providing access to pri-mary, specialty and trauma care services for remote and at-risk populations. Ourdesire is to provide a much needed service \u2014primary and specialty care \u2014to these underserved communities. Therefore, Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital is seeking $2million in continued federal support in fiscal year 2001 for the implementation ofthe final phases of its Northern California Telemedicine Network. The federal in-vestment will enhance our nation 's commitment to protecting the health of our citi-332 zens. Your support for this effort will improve the quality of health care and con- tribute to the saving of lives for thousands of individuals in Northern California. Thank you for your interest. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present this testimony for the record regarding the proposed Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services atCondell Medical Center, in Libertyville, Illinois. As you may know, in the United States today, cardiac diseases are the number one killer of men and women. Everyday, more than 2,600 Americans die of cardio-vascular disease, an average of one death every 33 seconds. Among both men andwomen, and across all racial and ethnic groups, cardiovascular disease is the num-ber one killer in the United States. More than 960,000 Americans die of cardio-vascular disease each year, accounting for more than 40 percent of all deaths na-tionally. In 1998, cardiovascular diseases cost the nation an estimated $274 billionin medical expenses and lost productivity, including more than $50 billion in directMedicare and Medicaid expenditures. It is expected that that figure has increasedto $286.5 billion in 1999. Over the last 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in the indicators of prevalence of heart disease and stroke, particularly among Americans over age 65 \u2014 an age group that is now about 13 percent of the U.S. population and will constituteover 20 percent by year 2010. Currently, almost 10 million Americans aged 65 yearsand older report disabilities caused by heart disease. Of the nearly 5 million pa-tients afflicted with heart failure, 75 percent are older than 65 years of age. Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in Illinois, account- ing for an even higher mortality rate than on the national level. According to theNational Center for Health Statistics, Illinois had the 10th highest 1995 death ratefor heart attacks, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in the nation, accountingfor 101.7 deaths per 100,000 population. Illinois also had the 12th highest rate oftotal cardiovascular diseases in the nation, at 203.7 deaths per 100,000 population. In Lake County, IL, these statistics have even more profound implications. Today, the County has a higher incidences of heart disease, cardiovascular disease andchronic obstructive pulmonary disease than the State of Illinois as a whole. In fact,Lake County had 4.6 deaths per 100,000 population from congenital anomaliesversus Illinois ' 4.2 deaths per 100,000. With a total population of 640,000, Lake County has a potential for 5,312 cardiac catheterizations annually. Currently, there are four institutions with catheterizationlabs in Lake County with a combined total volume of only 1,700 or 32 percent ofthe potential volume, leaving a distinct cardiac health service need in the region.A primary reason for this discrepancy is that many patients are referred out of LakeCounty for interventional services currently unavailable anywhere in the County. Infact, some patients are forced to travel 90 minutes and more to obtain appropriatecardiac care. With the region experiencing a 35 percent population growth through 2010, the need for an expanded primary and specialty health services infrastructure, includingcomprehensive cardiac care, is evident. We here at CMC are taking steps to do identify the risk factors and implement a comprehensive program that will provide, education, prevention, diagnosis, spe-cialty care, surgical care and rehabilitative cardiac care for our patients. Since 1927, Condell Medical Center (CMC) has been a highly respected com- prehensive community health care, prevention and education resource for LakeCounty, Illinois. The Medical Center has grown from its origins as a 12-bed countryhospital to a technologically sophisticated 190-bed acute care medical center with af-filiated health care and educational service facilities strategically located throughoutLake County. Condell Medical Center was the first institution in Lake County to establish a cardiac rehabilitation program in 1978. Since then, the Medical Center has run abasic cardiology program including diagnostic and rehabilitative services at its maincampus in Libertyville, IL. It has also provided emergency cardiac care at its maincampus and its affiliated acute care centers located throughout the northwesternLake County region. Currently, acute care centers are located in Buffalo Grove,Vernon Hills, Gurnee and Round Lake Beach. Condell affiliated medical offices arelocated in these centers in addition to other medical office buildings located in LakeVilla, Grays Lake and Mundelein. A focus on primary care physicians has enabledCMC to manage the medical needs of a large population of patients which has con-tributed to the success of its entire cardiovascular program.333 Condell offers comprehensive care to area residents from the initial onset of the disease through recovery and return to daily routine, including: Diagnostic Care .\u2014Opened in 1996, Condell 's new centralized Cardiology Depart- ment began to offer diagnostic cardiac catheterization services to area residents.One of the first fully-digital cardiac catheterization facilities in the nation, the lab-oratory aids Condell cardiologists in making a more thorough diagnosis of a pa-tient 's heart status. This permits faster clinical decisions, increased continuity of care and less patient stress. Intensive Cardiac Care Center .\u2014CMC currently operates an Intensive Care Unit with staff trained to provide optimal patient care to those with life-threatening ill-nesses. Monitoring equipment links patients with nursing staff. The Total Care Team, through its interdisciplinary cooperative efforts, handles the most critical sit-uations in an efficient, well-organized manner to produce the most effective resultsfor the patients. In the cardiac care program at CMC is primarily comprised of non-invasive diag- nostic and rehabilitative care. The Medical Center referred patients in its primaryand secondary service areas to other outlying hospitals for specialty cardiac surgicalservices. In 1997, 1998 and 1999 a total of 240, 343 and 376 patients respectivelywere referred directly from Condell for interventional cardiac procedures. The practice of referring patients for care interrupted the continuity of care, in- creased the health risk to the CMC patient, inconvenienced the patients and theirfamilies and broke the chain of care between the patient and their primary carephysician. Additionally, the cost of care for those patients who are referred increasessignificantly due to transport costs, repetition of certain diagnostic tests, physicianand nursing assessment during the patient admission to the tertiary hospital. In 1996, CMC established its Cardiac Catheterization Lab providing diagnostic cardiac catheterization services as the first step in the establishment of a regionalcenter for cardiac health services. The catheterization lab established a quality careprogram with comprehensive peer review process and outcomes measurements. With the establishment of the catheterization lab in 1996 and the resulting in- creases in demand for services in 1997, 1998 and 1999, it became very apparentthat the patients of Lake County have chosen CMC as the hospital-of-choice fortheir cardiac care. Today, cardiovascular disease represents 20 percent of all CMC 's hospital admis- sions. In 1998, CMC ended the year with 697 catheterizations, the largest marketshare in Lake County. In addition, the Medical Center referred 191 patients to otherfacilities for open-heart surgery in 1998. When the proposed cardiac care centeropens, it is expected that the number of cardiac care patients will increase signifi-cantly placing additional stress on Condell 's ICU, surgical and ED infrastructure. The addition of a comprehensive cardiac health program including an open-heart surgery and angioplasty program will enable CMC to fulfill its mission of providinga full spectrum of cardiac care. THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR CARDIAC HEALTH SERVICES AT CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER In response to the critical need for comprehensive cardiac health services in Lake County, Illinois and the surrounding region, Condell Medical Center has establishedthe ''Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services '' (RCCHS). The Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services at Condell Medical Center is being developed as a dynamic, multi-faceted facility designed to bolster the LakeCounty region 's ability to deal with the numerous faces of the cardiac threat in an innovative and integrated fashion. The RCCHS will provide a full suite of cardio-vascular services including emergency, surgical, diagnostic, education, preventionand rehabilitation. This Center, which is part of Condell Medical Center 's planned institution wide expansion project, will build upon existing cardiac expertise at the Medical Centerand create a full service regional center that will include: \u2014Cardiac Catheterization Lab (diagnostic and interventional cardiac cath) \u2014Prevention and Education \u2014Rehabilitation334 The new Center will accommodate increased volume expected from the expanded cardiac programs, the Emergency Department and the primary and secondary serv-ice areas. The proposed program will:\u2014Be clinically effective, using an interdisciplinary approach with input from sur- geons, cardiologists, ancillary professionals, nurses, administration and impor-tantly, patients. \u2014Facilitate continuity of care from admission through discharge and after-care in the home and rehabilitation. \u2014Enable cardiologists to maximize patient care through decreased morbidity and mortality through the use of interventional cardiac procedures and on-site open-heart surgery services. \u2014Provide additional suites for use in open-heart surgeries. \u2014Reduce referrals out of CMC and Lake County, allowing closer ''home care. '' \u2014Provide comprehensive cardiac care 7 days a week, 24 hours per day. \u2014Locate all cardiac services adjacent to one another for increased patient conven- ience and improved medical efficiency. Key components of the proposed Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services in- clude: SURGICAL Condell Medical Center will provide for the first time in Lake County open heart surgery capability. It will provide suites for use solely as open heart surgery suiteswhich will co-exist within the expanded surgical center. EDUCATION & PREVENTION Another aspect of the proposed Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services at Condell Medical Center will be the education and prevention programs. This willentail expansion of the existing Health Promotions Program and Cardiac Rehabilita-tion Program. In addition, opportunities for the development of specialty serviceswill be evaluated and implemented. REHABILITATIVE CARE A key element of the Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services at CMC will be an expanded Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, conducted at Centre Club. TheCentre Club is the on-campus health and fitness facility at CMC. This programhelps cardiovascular patients return to a safe, healthy and active lifestyle. This two-phase program combines education with individualized exercise prescriptions, whichare closely monitored by highly trained staff members. As a key part of this initiative, CMC is also in the process of adding a second rehabilitation program off campus at its Gurnee facility. The establishment of this center is also a critical component in the Medical Cen- ter's goal to become the County 's first tertiary care center. Other components of that goal will be becoming a level I emergency department, becoming a level I intensivecare unit (ICU), and becoming a level III OB/GYN facility. Condell Medical Center is seeking $5.5 million in fiscal year 2001 two years for the final phase of its Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services. This proposedfederal partnership in conjunction with the CMC financial commitment of $72.8 mil-lion will provide significant returns on the federal investment through faster andmore effective treatment while helping to reduce the significant costs associatedwith cardiac related illnesses in the area. The proposed Regional Center for Cardiac Health Services will serve as a national model for the provision and effective management of comprehensive cardiac care ina single location for an at-risk population. This partnership, supported by CMC 's fi- nancial commitment of $72.8 million, will provide significant returns on the federalinvestment through faster and more effective treatment while helping to reduce thesignificant costs associated with cardiac related illnesses in the area. It will alsohelp to reduce the very real costs associated with cardiac related illnesses in theregion. Again, Mr. Chairman thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony for the record. We look forward to working with the subcommittee as it strives to imple-ment an effective system for addressing the complex issue of cardiac care.335 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION Chairman Specter, Members of the Subcommittee: My name is Colleen M. Kelley and I am the National President of the National Treasury Employees Union(NTEU). On behalf of the more than 140,000 federal employees represented byNTEU throughout the Federal Government, thank you very much for this oppor-tunity to share our views concerning the fiscal year 2001 budget. NTEU represents employees in many HHS agencies who will be directly affected by funding decisions made by your Subcommittee. NTEU represents employees inthe Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, Sub-stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for HealthcareResearch and Quality, Administration for Children and Families, Administration on Aging, Office of the Secretary, Office for Civil Rights, Program Support Center andthe National Center for Health Statistics. In addition, NTEU represents employeesin the Social Security Administration 's Office of Hearings and Appeals. As the Chairman knows, spending has been severely constrained at most federal agencies over the past several years. These funding shortfalls have resulted in hir-ing restrictions and delayed and canceled employee training which have made it dif-ficult for employees to do their best. With the deficit finally behind us and surplusespredicted for the immediate future, we have an opportunity to provide adequate re-sources to federal agencies. Doing so will enable federal employees to carry out theiragencies ' missions to the best of their abilities and provide first class service to agency customers. The Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget request for program management at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is $131 million. HRSA 's goal is to bring health care services to some of our most neediest populations, in-cluding those in underserved rural communities, people living with HIV/AIDS, andthose who are uninsured. There is little question that HRSA provides essential serv-ices that are desperately in need of expansion. This agency can truly no longer domore with less. The employees represented by NTEU at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) are committed to improving the quality of patient care in ourhealth care system. This agency 's goal is to both cut the number of medical errors and explore ways to better use research to improve medical care in our country. TheAdministration 's budget proposal includes $3 million for program support at the AHRQ, an increase over the prior fiscal year which reflects the important work ac-complished by this agency. President Clinton 's budget proposes $60 million in funding for program manage- ment at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA). This agency is at the forefront of efforts to provide early interventionprograms designed to discourage young people from trying drugs as well as playinga critical role in insuring that mental health and drug abuse services are widelyavailable. The Office of National Drug Control Policy estimates that as many as 5million Americans need substance abuse treatment, yet, they report, less than halfactually receive services. If SAMHSA is to adequately respond to the substanceabuse and mental health needs in this country, the President 's budget recommenda- tion is the minimum that must be approved. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is slated to receive $2.7 billion for its health services programs in fiscal year 2001 under the President 's budget. This budget re- quest reflects the Administration 's continuing commitment to improve health care for the millions of American Indians and Alaska Natives that belong to federallyrecognized Tribes. These additional funds will permit the employees of IHS to con-tinue to make a difference in the health status of the groups served by the IHS. The fiscal year 2001 budget request for federal administration at the Administra- tion for Children and Families (ACF) is $165 million. As the Chairman knows, ACFis one of the government 's premiere agencies for promoting the health and welfare of America 's children. Programs under its jurisdiction include Head Start as well as projects that promote and support child care, foster care and adoption efforts. Thebudget request will permit ACF to hire additional staff in key areas such as moni-toring child welfare, expanding access to quality child care and overseeing the crit-ical Head Start Program. Funding restrictions in past years have hampered ACF 's ability to fulfill its mission and on behalf of the dedicated employees of this agency,I urge the Subcommittee to fully fund this request. For fiscal year 2001, the budget request for program administration at the Admin- istration on Aging (AoA) is $17 million. Since the turn of the last century in 1900,it is estimated that the population of Americans age sixty-five and older has grownfrom 3 million individuals to more than 34 million. Helping older Americans remainindependent and productive is one of the key goals of AoA. The employees of AoA336 operate nutrition programs, disseminate information and are active in the Alz- heimer 's programs. The budget recommendation for AoA is the minimum that should be approved for this important agency. NTEU also represents employees in the Office of the Secretary of HHS. The Presi- dent's budget request for departmental management is $330 million for fiscal year 2001. As you know, the employees in the Office of the Secretary help support thoseactivities associated with the overall operation of the department. In addition, thefiscal year 2001 budget request includes funding to support research on significantpolicy issues including welfare reform, at-risk children and youth and improved ac-cess to health care being conducted in the Office of the Secretary. The President 's budget request for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for Fiscal 2001 is $24 million. The important work of OCR includes enforcing the Nation 's civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination in health and social service programs.Moreover, OCR plays a central role in efforts to prohibit discrimination against indi-viduals with disabilities in programs under HHS 's purview. In the past several years, the funding levels OCR has received have not reflected OCR 's critical mission and we urge this Committee to carefully consider the President 's fiscal year 2001 request. For the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the Administration has re- quested $110 million for program support in fiscal year 2001. This budget requestis intended to support NCHS 's health survey and data collection activities. One of NCHS 's primary responsibilities is to follow changes in health and health care, as- sess the effectiveness of health care programs and identify health and disease pat-terns and risk factors in our country. The budget request reflects the critical workdone by this agency. As the name implies, the Department 's Program Support Center (PSC) provides support services to HHS as well as to other agencies. These services include effortsin three areas, including human resources, financial management and administra-tive operations. For fiscal year 2001, the Administration has recommended a fund-ing level of $326 million for PSC, a small increase over the division 's fiscal year 2000 budget. NTEU also represents employees in the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Social Security Administration. As I have brought to this Committee 's attention in past years, OHA is once again the subject of reorganization efforts. NTEU hasseveral concerns regarding the latest reorganization effort called the Hearing Proc-ess Improvement (HPI) plan. As the Chairman knows, the process at OHA is judicial in nature and is focused around the due process hearing. Disability claimants who have not been found eligi-ble for disability are entitled to a timely and fair adjudication at the hearing officelevel. The OHA hearing procedure permits the dissatisfied claimant to personallyinteract, to personally argue his/her position directly to the decision maker. The de- cision he/she receives is comprehensive and specific; it deals with his/her situationin great detail. One particularly innovative and successful program stands to be eliminated if HPI is implemented. The Senior Attorney Program as originally operated, involved ap-proximately 475 of OHA 's experienced Staff Attorneys who in addition to drafting ALJ decisions, reviewed those disability cases most likely to result in a fully favor-able decision before they were assigned to the disability que for an ALJ hearing.If the evidence indicated that the case was likely to result in a finding of disability,the Senior Attorney would complete development of the case, including securing ad-ditional medical evidence and appropriate medical and vocational expertise. If aftersuch development the case was not likely to be favorably decided without a hearing,the case was forwarded to an ALJ for a hearing. However, if the record establishedthat the claimant was in fact disabled, the Senior Attorney would draft and issueunder his/her authority a fully favorable decision. The average processing time for Senior Attorney decisions was just over 100 days. This was at a time when processing time at the OHA hearing level was 386 days \u2014 more than an entire year. As a result of the Senior Attorney Program, disabledclaimants received their benefits nearly 9 months earlier than otherwise would havebeen the case. From its inception until the Program was sharply curtailed in 1999,the Senior Attorney Program resulted in approximately 50,000 fully favorable deci-sions per year. In every respect the Senior Attorney Program has been a resounding success. It materially improved the quality of service provided to the public, especially thoseindividuals who are disabled and entitled to timely granting of their benefits. De-spite its success, the Senior Attorney as an independent adjudicator is being elimi-nated as part of the HPI Plan.337 NTEU is profoundly skeptical that the Hearings Process Improvement Plan will materially improve disability adjudication at the hearings level. In fact, the failureto retain the decisional authority of Senior Attorneys would seem to doom HPI tofailure. NTEU urges this Subcommittee to carefully review the Hearing Process Im-provement initiative and urges the Chairman to carefully review the shortsightedplan to eliminate the Senior Attorney Program. Without this program, and the addi-tional 50,000 to 75,000 decisions it will help generate each year, there is little ques-tion that a serious degradation of in the quality of service will result. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for this opportunity to share our views on the fiscal year 2001 needs of the agencies within the jurisdiction of your Subcommittee. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER Mr. Chairman and Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony for the record on the Montefiore Medical Center in theBronx, New York and the exciting new Children 's Hospital at Montefiore that we are developing. THE BRONX The Bronx has a population of 1.2 million residents, placing it among the top 10 largest cities in the United States. Approximately 400,000 of those residents arechildren. Neighborhoods in the Bronx rank among the poorest in the nation. Thirtypercent of residents in the Bronx are on some form of public assistance and/or Med-icaid (31 percent). Over one-quarter of the residents have incomes under $10,000 an-nually and sixty percent have annual incomes below $30,000. The Bronx population is largely composed of historically underserved and unin- sured minorities. Three-quarters of the Bronx population are non-white \u201428 percent African American and 50 percent Hispanic. The Bronx is among the nation 's most underserved urban areas with sociodemographic and health status indicators thatunderscore its need for health services. Those health and social indicators include: \u2014An infant mortality rate which is among the highest in the nation; \u2014Rates of teenage pregnancy and low birth weights that are higher than the pro- portions for the City and nation; \u2014The incidence of asthma is six times greater than the national average; \u2014Bronx children living with AIDS in 1996 represented 28.5 percent of all New York City pediatric AIDS cases, and 5.5 percent nationwide. \u2014The lack of industry and a strong economic base leaves the borough with ex- treme housing problems, drug abuse and crime, all underlying problems of pov-erty and unemployment. MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER Established over 100 years ago as a chronic care hospital, Montefiore Medical Center has become a critical resource in addressing the health and social needs ofthe residents of the Bronx. MMC was the first hospital to create a community-ori-ented care program in the late 1960s and early 1970s to meet the needs of under-served residents in the Bronx. This comprehensive public/private health system pro-vides more than one-third of all inpatient acute care, over 42 percent of all tertiarycare, and $50 million in uncompensated care annually. The Medical Center strives for excellence in patient care, medical education, sci- entific research and community services. Staff and faculty at MMC practice ''family- centered care, '' working with families to promote health, prevent diseases, and al- leviate the burden of illness. In 1995, Montefiore Medical Center performed an extensive review of the health of their population, specifically children. The study revealed that children in theBronx are among the City 's most needy, with some of the City 's highest rates of low birth weight, infant mortality, HIV infections and other reportable diseases. It alsorevealed that hospitalization rates for children (0 -19 years) in the Bronx are exces- sive at 65 admissions for every 1,000 persons \u2014nearly twice the average of more af- fluent areas. The study also demonstrated that child health programs at MMC are at great risk for the future. While MMC offers a comprehensive array of child health, preventionand education services through a network of inpatient, outpatient, and communityprograms and facilities, these programs are fragmented and uncoordinated. Thefour-site program is hard to sustain, and utilization declines (due to managed care)threaten the viability of the system. It was determined that many inadequaciesexist due to the limitations of the physical environment. Existing programs and338 services at MMC lack focus for the specific needs of children and lack child and fam- ily-friendly elements. Among the four hospitals, inpatient services for children are inadequate and frag- mented. Ambulatory services for children are scattered throughout the system andare not well housed, and primary and specialty ambulatory services are not ade-quately articulated to meet the health and related needs of children. In addition,there are no existing ancillary services specifically designed for children. Finally, thefragmented nature of existing children 's services makes it increasingly difficult to staff the four-site program. Rather than having a critical mass of pediatric primaryand specialty care in one location, this expertise is dispersed throughout the multi-site system, making departmental cooperation and consultation difficult and staffretention very challenging. It is clear that a restructuring and consolidation of services for children at MMC must take place to ensure the livelihood of the hospital as well as the longevity ofchildren 's health services in the Bronx. In response to this crisis Montefiore has em- barked on a comprehensive initiative to tackle the daunting task of consolidatingall of our children 's services into a central location \u2014the Children 's Hospital at Montefiore. The new Children 's Hospital will serve as a ''hub'' of our child health initiative \u2014eliminating fragmentation within the existing child health network, ena- bling the provision of services in a more direct, cost-effective manner and enablingMMC to better and more efficiently address the ever growing health needs of thechildren in the Bronx. THE MONTEFIORE CHILD HEALTH INITIATIVE The traditional model of children 's hospitals is designed for and focuses on chronic care. There has been very little preventive, supportive or specialty care at children 's hospitals. With the more sophisticated understanding of childhood illness, the re-sulting need for advanced care, and with the increased understanding of the connec-tion between an individual 's health status and his/her lifestyle and family life \u2014a new model of children 's hospitals has emerged. The Montefiore Child Health Initiative, comprised of both the child health serv- ices within the existing Ambulatory Care Network and the Children 's Hospital, is a unique example of a modern and aggressive approach to the provision of com-prehensive children 's primary and specialized health care services. The Montefiore Child Health Initiative proposes a unique model of care that will assure MMC 's continued leadership in the provision of health care and related serv- ices to children in the Bronx and surrounding areas. That proposal includes: An Integrated Child Health Network The establishment of a child health network, which builds on the existing services available through the Ambulatory Care Network, is a necessity in the rapidlychanging environment in the Bronx. The Montefiore Child Health Initiative will en-sure that the Integrated Child Health Network provides each child with access tohigh quality primary and specialty care; effective connections and communicationbetween existing primary and specialty care services/providers; cohesion among thedifferent parts of the network to ensure a full spectrum of child health and relatedservices; and access to the secondary and tertiary services at the Children 's Hospital so that children and families will have the option of receiving care in an organized,cost effective and accountable system of care. The Montefiore Child Health Initiative will provide the consolidation and coordi- nation necessary to effectively and efficiently provide a full range of services for thechildren and families of the Bronx. The network aspects of the Initiative will play a key role in ensuring that a full continuum is and remains available for children and their families through the ex-isting array of services throughout the Bronx, including: \u20143 hospital outpatient departments, providing primary care, specialty care and special programs for children; \u201430 ambulatory care sites \u2014receiving over 300,000 visits annually; \u201421 school-based health clinics \u2014providing services to over 11,000 children annu- ally; \u2014The New York Children 's Initiative \u2014an innovative outreach care program for homeless children providing care to over 6,300 children annually; \u2014An extensive base of privately practicing pediatricians throughout the Bronx and Westchester County. The ''front door '' to the planned Children 's Hospital, the core of the Montefiore Child Health Initiative, is through any one of the affiliated ambulatory care sitesin our network. Within the network each child will have an identifiable primarycare provider responsible for their care. Any site in the system will have the ability339 to assess the need for specialty services and to provide those services and consulta- tions on-site or through referral. There will be constant communication between theprimary care providers in the community and the specialty care providers at theChildren 's Hospital or in the community. The network currently offers specialty services specifically geared to meet the unique health and social service needs of children in the community. It is criticalto note that these programs do not simply target health needs. They also addresssome of the underlying economic and social issues that cause illness in children byproviding prevention and education services for at-risk youth and families in theBronx. Those existing special services include: \u2014Child Abuse Center; \u2014Child Health \u2014Ambulatory care to adolescents with HIV infection; \u2014A nationally recognized mobile lead screening and safe house program; \u2014School-based health program providing direct medical services at 21 schools in the community; \u2014A drop out prevention program; \u2014Outreach to and prenatal/child care services to pregnant women who are either HIV infected or at-risk for infection; and, \u2014Community redevelopment/commercial revitalization. Pediatric Asthma Center A dedicated center for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma is a major focus of the Montefiore Child Health Initiative. The concept of the Pediatric AsthmaCenter stemmed from the disturbing statistics about childhood asthma in the Bronx: \u2014Almost 15 percent of children in the South Bronx have asthma (6 percent na- tionally). \u2014African American children are three times more likely than white children to be hospitalized for asthma, and four to six times more likely to die from it.Rates for Latino children are also higher than those for white children. \u2014More than five times as many children in the Bronx are hospitalized for asthma compared with national rates. \u2014In the South Bronx, the rate is 7.5 times the national rate, and more than twice the rate of New York City overall. The Pediatric Asthma Center will establish a state-of-the-art clinical and edu- cational resource center as well as a community-wide network of services for chil-dren and families linked directly with schools and day care programs. The Center 's services will provide school-based education and pediatric care for children withasthma, and will serve as a hub for a network of diagnostic and clinical serviceslocated in Montefiore 's Integrated Child Health Network. Schools and day care cen- ters will be linked to the Pediatric Asthma Center as well as a local network pri-mary care site for services, training and educational programs. State-of-the-art tech-nology, including diagnostic equipment and computer links for clinical evaluation,and support for school-based health care and education, will be key components ofthe Pediatric Asthma Center. A New Children 's Hospital The Children 's Hospital will provide the critical connection between the providers of children 's health services in the Ambulatory Care Network. It will serve as the hub of the entire Montefiore Child Health Initiative. The new hospital will not stand alone but will be connected to a tertiary care cen- ter. The hospital will be programmed and staffed specifically with the special needsof children and families in mind. Those special features and services include: \u2014State-of-the-art pediatric emergency room; \u2014Medical and and treatment services; \u2014Age appropriate units specifically designed to care for the individual needs of infants, school age children, and adolescents; \u2014A state-of-the-art Pediatric Critical Care Unit, with specialized activities such as dialysis and transplant technologies, designed with adequate space for par-ents to stay with their child; \u2014All single occupancy rooms will have parent sleep-in accommodations; \u2014A playroom on each unit with age appropriate toys, staffed with child life pro- fessionals to assist in the developmental needs of children;340 \u2014School facilities specially designed to meet the needs of each age group; \u2014Liaison child psychiatry services; \u2014Medical information stations on each unit. CONCLUSION The implementation of the Montefiore Child Health Initiative will elevate the quality and scope of primary and specialty health care services to children and theirfamilies in the Bronx. Montefiore Medical Center, with our 100 year tradition of community service and community-based health care programs, is uniquely qualified to implement and op-erate the Montefiore Child Health Initiative which could serve as a national modelof how complete health systems can adapt to and address the very unique healthand social needs of today 's inner-city, minority, children. FUNDING /BUDGET SOURCES The new Children 's Hospital and related facilities will cost $116 million for capital construction. The Medical Center is seeking $5 million in fiscal year 2001 for thiscritical children 's hospital and child health initiative. In fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000 respectively, Montefiore received $2 million and $500,000 respectively forthis initiative. Montefiore Medical Center looks forward to developing relationshipswith the Federal Government to make this plan a reality and to serve as a modelto other cities and hospital systems. Thank you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ST. JOSEPH 'SHOSPITAL HEALTH CENTER Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony and for the support that this Subcommittee gave to St. Joseph 's Hospital Health Center last year. St. Joseph 's, located in downtown Syracuse, New York, is a non-profit 431-bed hospital and health care network providing services to Onondaga County and to pa-tients from 15 surrounding counties. St. Joseph 's is best known for its ranking as the #1 hospital in New York State for open-heart surgery in terms of lowest overallmortality rate. We are very proud of this ranking, which we have held for four con-secutive years. What many people do not know is that we are also the largest hemo-dialysis center outside metropolitan New York. My statement is focused on thesetwo areas of expertise at St. Joseph 's and how we plan to initiate a chronic disease management model that will benefit our current patients with heart and kidney dis-ease and enhance the quality of life for at-risk patients in the region. We see thisinitiative as one with not only health enhancement benefits but also with significantpositive economic implications for the community and the region. St. Joseph 's provides over $7 million in bad debt and charity care to our service region. This comes to about 4 percent of our operating budget. This number hassteadily risen over the years and we feel it will continue to do so unless some dra-matic steps are taken. In order to increase access to patients who are underservedand at-risk for disease, we have implemented a program of ''patient-centered care. '' We believe we achieved our #1 ranking for cardiac care through this process, whichemploys a secondary prevention model for disease management. By applying a mul-tidisciplinary team approach to heart disease and preparing patients before surgeryand rehabilitating them after, we have reduced mortality rates as well as the num-ber of second hospitalizations. We have done this to improve the overall health ofan underserved and underinsured patient base, but also for practical financial rea-sons. While our rehabilitation and education programs for our cardiac patients arelargely unreimbursed, we are rewarded by having to perform less expensive charitycare on patients who would typically end up back in the hospital without diseasemanagement. Recognizing that early assessment is important to reducing the number of expen- sive treatments required later in life, St. Joseph 's instituted a Wellness Place at a local mall so that people could stop in at their convenience. The Wellness Place pro-vides free, general health screenings such as blood pressure readings, cardiac anddiabetes risk assessment, counseling and patient education and seminars. Last year,approximately 15,000 people used the Wellness Place. Nearly 1000 of these peoplewere determined to be at risk for heart disease, diabetes, or vascular problems.These individuals were offered follow-up services intended to change lifestyle, suchas nutritional counseling, smoking cessation, exercise programs and other similarregimens. They were also offered a choice of primary care physician if none wasidentified. This is all done at considerable unreimbursed expense to St. Joseph 's but341 with the knowledge that a great deal of money will be saved in the long run \u2014for the patient, the Medicare system and the hospital. The most dramatic economic im-plications I mentioned are encompassed within this concept \u2014but not all. At risk pa- tients are working people who may lose jobs if their disease progresses. It is impor-tant to realize, however, that patients with diagnosed diseases or who have conges-tive heart failure, may still work and lead productive lives if an effective diseasemanagement program is initiated at the earliest stage possible. The other economicbenefits come in the form of the support required for this program. I will detailthose later in this statement. Assessment is the first line of defense in chronic disease management; but, there are many other factors involved after this step is taken. A program for managementof disease must adequately educate patients and then foster a sense of individualresponsibility for the importance of following prescribed regimens. This takes agreat deal of initial monitoring and time spent with patients by telephone, at com-munity health centers, and in the home. This also requires coordinated communityparticipation by physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, educators, be-havioral specialists and even employers. Diabetes, leading to kidney disease and kidney failure, is the most expensive dis- ease in the country. The second most expensive, and #1 admitting diagnosis forMedicare, is congestive heart failure. The U.S. spends more than $7 billion annuallyin Medicare dollars for these diseases. The clinical relationship between chronic kid-ney failure and heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) requires similar early inter-vention techniques as well as later management, treatment, and rehabilitation. Uti-lizing resources already developed and in place for our cardiac rehabilitation pro-gram, St. Joseph 's is proposing to further develop a chronic disease management program focused on hemodialysis. Combining resources in this way will be cost ef-fective and has the potential to radically change the management of kidney disease. The specific objectives of the program will begin with early identification. Timely referrals to a nephrologist can be improved so that more aggressive treatment canbe initiated to prolong kidney function and allow better preparation of the patientfor dialysis. Second, we will identify, investigate, evaluate, and implement tech-nology that will promote in-center self care and home hemodialysis modalities. TheAksys Corporation has developed a product that has the potential of achieving thisobjective. Third, we will utilize the St. Joseph 's Cardiac Rehabilitation Model for the renal patient. This model will emphasize education and exercise with the goal of im-proving the percentage of patients that stay employed, reduce frequency and lengthof hospitalizations, and improve patient acceptance of and control over disease proc-esses. Finally, we will apply our disease management techniques to our overall goalof reducing the percentage of candidates for kidney transplantation. The ultimategoal of the renal patient and the health care industry is to have renal patients leada ''normal '' life. Currently, kidney transplantation is the modality that is most asso- ciated with that goal. Our history of service and specialization in the areas of cardiac and kidney dis- ease has proven that there is a demonstrable need for a chronic disease demonstra-tion in these areas for the Central New York region. The demonstration will involverelationships and initiatives in Dialysis, Cardiac Care, Home Care, and Wellness.What we lack at this point, is a facility that can be shared by both cardiac and di-alysis patients. Our current dialysis facility, the largest outside the New York Met-ropolitan area, is woefully inadequate in every way. The facility was originally builtas a modular, temporary, unit over 20 years ago. We now treat our overload of pa-tients in the hallways and have legitimate safety concerns that come with over-crowding and questions as to the future structural integrity of the plant itself. Wehave not replaced this facility for financial reasons but, fortunately, have been ableto treat patients satisfactorily. We have three satellite clinics in the region that arealso operating at capacity. Our goal is to implement our demonstration program inan on-campus facility that will provide the space needed for dialysis, exercise facili-ties, classrooms, meeting rooms, examination rooms, an acute kidney unit, andnurse and allied professional training space. Training of personnel is an importantaspect of implementing an innovative chronic disease model. In terms of economic development for the region, we believe that keeping our pa- tients healthy and productive will have the most dramatic impact on the economyalbeit in the long term. For the shorter term, we believe the training programs thatwe currently provide and will expand in areas such as home care, nursing, rehabili-tation specialists, and counseling, to name a few, will bring employment opportuni-ties to people in and around Syracuse. As we expand our efforts, we will likely trainpeople outside the immediate area to be able to serve the outlying areas where oursatellite clinics are and in homes in more remote locations. The facility we envisionwill also provide many construction jobs over the next couple of years. The two-story342 facility, equipment and program operation will cost approximately $13.2 million. St. Joseph 's has requested Federal partnership grant funding of $5.8 million that will also cover start-up operating costs. Our partnership funding request has increasedover the past two year 's by $300,000 due to our current need to upgrade our Acute Kidney Unit as part of our overall initiative. We estimate, based on our currentservices, that our operating budget will exceed $5.5 million per year. As you know, St. Joseph 's received $2 million in fiscal year 2000 from this Sub- committee to begin the planning and site preparation necessary for the new Center.We are very grateful for this support and urge you to complete this investment withan additional $2 million in fiscal year 2001 toward our total requested federal sharefor the initiative. Having made this request, which we realize is considerable, wewould like to assure the Subcommittee that St. Joseph 's will provide, through pri- vate sources, the remainder of the estimated total for this effort or $7.4 million. We recognize the magnitude of this request but believe wholeheartedly that this facility, and the implementation of our chronic disease management model willrepay this initial investment many times over in terms of Medicare savings and interms of providing a national model for replication across the country. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC POWER ASSOCIATION The American Public Power Association (APPA) is the service organization rep- resenting the interests of the more than 2,000 municipal and other state and locallyowned utilities throughout the United States. Collectively, public power utilities de-liver electric energy to one of every seven U.S. electric consumers (about 45 millionpeople) serving some of the nation 's largest cities. The majority of APPA 's member systems are located in small and medium-sized communities in every state exceptHawaii. APPA member systems appreciate the opportunity to submit this statementin support of fiscal year 2001 appropriations for the Low Income Home Energy As-sistance Program (LIHEAP). APPA urges the Committee to support funding of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2001 for LIHEAP. APPA also supports the request for $300 million in emergency fundsin fiscal year 2001 and supports a funding level of $1.5 billion in advanced fundingfor fiscal year 2002. Because the majority of LIHEAP monies are needed during ashort period of time in the winter months, advanced funding for LIHEAP is criticalin enabling states to effectively plan for and administer the program. Moreover, asevere winter and escalating home heating oil prices in the Midwest and Northeast have depleted fiscal year 2000 emergency funds and highlight the important roleLIHEAP plays for the elderly and working poor during winter months. Funding cuts since LIHEAP 's reauthorization in fiscal year 1995 have forced a tightening of eligibility standards and, in some cases, significant reductions in ben-efit levels. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association (NEADA), the primary educational and policy organization for state LIHEAP direc-tors, the number of recipients has been cut by over one million households duringthe recent past and average benefits have declined by about 10 percent. Prior to thedramatic reduction in LIHEAP funding in fiscal year 1995, the program was serving20 percent of the eligible population, with one-half of the recipients being elderlyor disabled Americans living on fixed incomes. Without the assistance provided byLIHEAP, many would be forced to choose between paying their home energy bill orpurchasing other necessities of life, such as food. As the debate over restructuring of the electric utility industry and the issue of providing and funding ''public benefits '' programs continues, some have stated their belief that electric utilities should assume the entire burden of energy assistance forlow income customers as a cost of doing business. As these restructuring efforts takeplace at both the federal and state levels, the risks become greater that bills for res-idential customers, especially those with low incomes, will increase as retail mar-kets are opened to competition. The need for full funding of LIHEAP remains crit-ical in ensuring that all those in need of energy assistance receive help. APPA be-lieves that any public benefits programs should not replace or supersede existingprograms, such as LIHEAP, that are funded by federal appropriations. As evidence of their commitment to low income assistance, public power systems across the country support a variety of programs providing help to low and fixedincome customers. A survey conducted by the National Fuel Funds Network (NFFN)shows that publicly-owned utilities raised 14 to 26 cents more per customer thanother utilities in their efforts to assist low income and needy customers in payingtheir bills. Many public power systems provide special rates for low-income house-343 holds and some have residential conservation and demand side management pro- grams designed to reduce energy consumption. In addition, the impact of welfare reform on energy assistance is just beginning to be felt and LIHEAP is likely to play an important role in the transition. Personsleaving the public assistance rolls are entering lower paying jobs and continue tobe confronted with large energy bills. These families remain at risk. LIHEAP is one of the outstanding examples of a successful state-operated pro- gram. The requirements imposed by the Federal Government are minimal and mostimportant decisions are left to grantees. APPA urges this Subcommittee 's favorable consideration of fiscal year 2001 fund- ing for LIHEAP. Again, thank you for this opportunity to present our views. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DENISE ROBERTS , BOARD MEMBER , PULSE OFCOLORADO Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony regarding this very important issue, Medical Errors. My testimony concerns a series of errors that occurred as my son was under the care of a pediatrician in Pueblo, Colorado. This doctor already had a long historyof providing substandard care to other children. Unfortunately, this information wasnot public knowledge nor was it reported by this doctor 's peers. In early 1999, the Board of Medical Examiners suspended this doctors license in hopes of protectingthe children of Pueblo. The decision was an unusual one since it was based solelyon consumer complaints. The board felt that it had substantial evidence to act uponregarding this physician who was seeing far too many patients per day. In thegrandest of public relations campaign the wealthy physician gained momentumwithin the community, and eventually the Board had a major conflict with local po-litical leaders, hospitals and the peer review committees who did not initially go for-ward to protect the public. Several local doctors publicly sided with the physician,placing blame on the parents of the dead and injured children. The others remainedsilent. Parents and nurses came to the advocacy group that I belong to and informedus of this problem. The parents assumed that the new doctors would report theproblems, they were wrong. Many symptoms were ignored and not charted by thedoctor in question, the other physicians treated them without reporting the inci-dents. In a historic decision, this doctor was given back his license several months after suspension as the board continued to pursue the case. The local medical communityclosed ranks on the board, making it very difficult for the suspension to remain ef-fective until the hearing. In exchange of that costly process, the doctor and theboard agreed to an early retirement in exchange for a clean record with the medialboard. This doctor can go and practice in any other state after he retires here andthe same problems could happen there. My son Taylor Michael Roberts passed away on Feb. 25, 1998 at 14 months. He was a healthy baby until he was prescribed medicine on 9/22/97. I would like to giveyou a brief history of the medical care my son received during his illness. It all started around the end of October 1997 when my son got sick. I took him to Dr. Kuna 's office numerous times. (10 -27-97, 10 -30-97, 11 -12-97, 11 -14-97, 11 - 18-97, 12 -13-97, 12 -22-97). It was the Friday after Christmas, on Dec. 26, 1997, when I took him to Dr. Kuna 's office again. Dr. Rao, Dr. Kuna 's partner saw us and sent us to get some test taken to find out what was wrong with Taylor. I broughtthe test back to Dr. Rao and he told me that Taylor had pneumonia and bronchitis,and to take him home and bring him back Monday. When I took Taylor home hewas very sick all day. The next morning I took him to my personnel physician, andwas told to get him over to the emergency room immediately. I am not a medicaldoctor, but a few things occurred at the hospital that I found disturbing: (1) Theyonly took a blood test of my child after I demanded one be taken. (2) It was Dr.Derrington, another pediatrician on call, not Dr. Kuna or Dr. Rao, that orderedblood cultures. The results confirmed that my son was septic and this was the rea-son he was not getting better. (3) Dr. Kuna wanted to discharge my son days earlierfrom the hospital reasoning that he would be better off at home and more com-fortable there. He stated other children had the same symptoms and were at home.(4) Dr. Kuna lied to us saying that all the tests; blood, and other wise, were all nor-mal upon his release. (5) Dr. Kuna said on the discharge summary (1/5/98) that ''I will monitor the CBC carefully '', yet, no further blood test were taken until Feb. 22, 1998 when my son was diagnosed with meningitis. (6) I was never aware of the factthat Taylor had staph infection only that he was septic. I find it most unsettling that a Doctor would lie to us about the care of our child. This only leads me to believe that he must not comprehend or understand how344 much a parent could love a child and the lengths they would take to keep a child safe. Does he think that the results of the blood test are irrelevant to the life ofmy child? I brought my son back to Dr. Kuna for his follow up appointment on 1/16/98. Dr. Kuna stated, that he was fine, but, to continue the neb treatments. Again, No testswere taken, or results mentioned. I took Taylor back to Kuna 's office on 2/3/98 be- cause he and my daughter had a runny nose and a cough. There again in hisrecords he shows that Taylor had bronchitis. This was never mentioned to me dur-ing my visit. Then I took him back and on 2/7/98 Dr. Rao said he has a viral infec-tion. I called Dr. Kuna on Sunday morning (2/22/98), and told him that Taylor wasvery sick and that he needed to be seen immediately. Dr. Kuna agreed to meet meat his office between 9:00 and 9:30. I told him Taylor had the following symptoms:(1) Fever on Friday night of 99 degrees (2) Fever on Saturday night of 103.8 andnot very controllable with the baths and switching Advil and Tylenol (3) Vomitedonce after the Advil (4) Heavy breathing. (5) Bumps on the back of his neck. (6) Wasgiven Tylenol right before our visit. He informed me that Taylor had a virus infection and was prone to high fevers. I was not satisfied with this diagnosis, and asked him to do a throat culture. Hesaid he had seen one lesion in Taylors throat. Then Kuna checked to see what hisoxygen level would register. The machine showed a level under 90; Kuna thensqueezed the monitor around his finger. I asked him if this would make the monitorreading high. He said it would have a misleading reading of three to four degreeswhich would make Taylors oxygen level okay. I still insisted that he should give mesome medicine for Taylor. My son did not look very good at all. Later on in theafternoon I called Dr. Kuna and explained to him that my child was still very sick.Once again, I was told not to worry it was just a virus. I noticed on the recordsof my visit (2/22/98) that Kuna noted Taylor had a questionable dull left eardrum.This was not reported to me during this visit. Kuna then stated in the dischargesummary '' I requested medicine because I was afraid of him getting an ear infection as in the past ''. I have no idea how Kuna come up with this conclusion, as I was never informed of the ear infection. This is a great example of the deceptive practicethat Dr. Kuna used in his diagnosis of Taylor. I took my son to the hospital on Monday morning around 6:00 a.m., and told them to call Dr. Kuna immediately. I called the hospital before I left, and was informedthat Kuna was scheduled to be on the pediatric floor that morning. My child wasnot very well at all on arrival at the hospital. I explained to them that I thoughtthat he was breathing heavier than usual, and that his eyes seemed strange to me.The doctor writes in her report that he appears well hydrated and is taking fluidswell. She only spent at the most 15 minutes with us. She also writes in her reportthat she checked Taylors neck. During the 15 minutes she never checked his neck.They poked my son numerous times trying to take the 2nd blood test. After the first blood test they told us the results were fine. They further stated that they couldnot believe that results turned out to be OK. Because he looked ill they were goingto recheck the initial blood test. Taylor barely responded to the numerous times thathe poked in the arms while they were trying to obtain blood. They actually had tosend in another lab person to take blood, because the second one could not drawany. They continued to ignore my requests to have Dr. Kuna come look at him. Butonly in the reports does it show that indeed he knew we were there at 8:50. Myhusband carried my son upstairs to be admitted to the pediatric floor. The nursesonce again kept poking him numerous times in the arms to put the IV in. I wentover to Dr. Kuna 's office to talk to him about Taylor since he never showed up. His nurse told me that he was too busy to talk to me at this time, and I should comeback at 12:00. When I went back to his room, my husband and I noticed that hewas rocking and acting like he was not looking at us. We kept asking the nurseto call Dr. Kuna. One of the nurses stated that she noticed his eyes looked funnyupon his arrival to the pediatric floor, but, she did not say anything. Dr. Kuna fi-nally came over on the request of the nurse. He checked his neck and Taylor cried.Then he took Taylor into get a spinal tap. Immediately after the spinal tap, theyhad my husband carry him back to his room. Dr. Kuna told us that our son hadmeningitis. He left us standing there with just the nurse to take care of him. Thisis the part I now find so disturbing. How could he just leave us there? He statedhe was in a hurry to get back to the office to take care of his patients. Momentsafter Dr. Kuna departed, Taylor went into a seizure that lasted 35 minutes. Dr.Kuna did not reappear until the last minutes of the seizure. I questioned why wewere being transferred to St. Lukes hospital instead of Children 's hospital. Dr. Kuna than informed me that the same doctors were available at St. Lukes. Upon arrivalat St. Lukes, the staff fought for Taylors life until we decided to take him off themachines and medicine on Feb. 25, 1998.345 1Manuals and reports relating to utility service include Access to Utility Service, Cap the Gap: Assuring Residential Customers Share Benefits of Electric Industry Restructuring, TheRegulation of Rural Electric Cooperatives, A Guide to Low-Income Energy Efficiency and Energyand the Poor: The Crisis Continues. 242 U.S.C. 8621(b).Dr. Kuna lied on the discharge summaries and he lied to the medical board. There is great concern on his ability to provide quality care for his patients. I am in greatconcern for the safety of other children under this sort of care. After reviewing someof the records and noting some of the mistakes, I am feeling tremendous guilt, be-cause I listened to Dr. Kuna against my better judgment. How could I be so igno-rant to trust this doctor with the life of my child? I thought that he would watchout for my child knowing how they misdiagnosed him the first time. After Taylor 's death I learned that there had been a letter of admonition from the medical board regarding Dr. Kuna and the death of another child. This letter reallyhit home for me. I wish that these letters could be posted in the doctors office forpatients to see. In this instance, I feel that the letter could have made a big dif-ference. I also learned that he had been named in several lawsuits and many otherconsumers had filed complaints with the medical board against him. Had I knownthat he had gotten in trouble before, I would have gone someplace else. Since joiningPULSE, I know now that this problem is nationwide, and many other children havedied and been injured like Taylor was due to medical errors, misdiagnosis, etc. Ihope someday that full disclosure will exist helped by mandatory reporting of med-ical errors as I feel that there are children 's lives at at stake. Had I been informed, I know in my heart that there would have been a much different outcome. Thank you for allowing me to give you this written testimony. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CONSUMER LAWCENTER INTRODUCTION Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, the National Consumer Law Cen- ter appreciates the opportunity to submit written testimony regarding appropriationof funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program for fiscal year 2001.This testimony is submitted on behalf of our low income and elderly clients who facegoing without food or medicine to avoid disconnection due to an inability to affordutility service. The National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to the interests of low-income consumers. Founded in 1969, NCLC provides special-ized legal support and consulting services to low-income consumers, their advocates,government agencies and private attorneys in all aspects of consumer and utilitylaw. NCLC has helped utilities, regulatory commissions and advocates design low-income affordability programs and has published leading manuals and reports onrelated law. 1 NCLC is a strong supporter of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), as it is the primary safety net between low-income consumers and dis-connection of utility service. LIHEAP is designed to target energy assistance tohouseholds most in danger of losing that vital service. However, without adequateregular appropriations, LIHEAP cannot get the job done. On behalf of our low-in-come clients, we urge the restoration of LIHEAP funding to at least $1.5 billion inregular appropriations for fiscal year 2001. This level of funding is slightly less thanthe level appropriated for this program in fiscal year 1988 and far from the $2 bil-lion level authorized to be appropriated for this program in prior and upcomingyears. 2 We also support additional emergency contingency funding of $300 million and advance LIHEAP appropriations for fiscal year 2002 of at least $1.6 billion. Thisamount is still below the pre-1987 regular appropriations levels, but would enablestates to cover a larger portion of the energy burden for eligible customers and in-crease energy efficiency efforts to move households closer to energy self-sufficiency. While emergency funds are critical for responding to life-threatening, brutal win- ters and summer heat waves, increasing the regular appropriations for LIHEAP willallow the states to design more solid programs for the upcoming year. This includesproactive, timely and appropriately designed responses to crisis situations, as op-posed to reactive and potentially ill-timed responses due to the lag time that comeswith the dependence on the release of emergency contingency funds. Delays in re-sponding to heating and cooling crisis needlessly jeopardize the health and safetyof those Americans eligible for assistance.346 3Preliminary results of a survey by the Department of Human Rights, Community Action Agencies, Des Moines Iowa.

A 1999 survey of LIHEAP recipients in Iowa revealed that when the heat-ing bills were unaffordable, almost 21 percent went without medical care, 12.3 per-cent went without food and 19 percent went to bed early with lots of blankets. 3 Analysis of recent data from the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy InformationAdministration show that in 1997, about 2.1 million households suffered from lossof heat. All but 154,000 of the households were LIHEAP eligible. 4The average pe- riod without heat was 3.3 days.5The consequences of disconnections include, health and safety risks associated with alternative heat and lighting sources, such as ker-osene and candles; hunger and malnutrition; hyperthermia and hypothermia andeviction and increased homelessness. Census statistics also show a widespread need for the LIHEAP program.

Source: Compiled from U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Service, LIHEAP Division of Energy Assistance/OCS/ACF table on number of all low-income households, by census region and state based on 1990 Census data. At its peak, regular, non-emergency, funding for LIHEAP was $2.1 billion in 1985. Since then, regular block grant funding has been cut back to $1.1 billion in fiscalyear 1999 and 2000. Consistent with the cutback in funding is the reduction of thenumber of households served. According to the Administration for Children andFamilies, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the number of federallyeligible households using LIHEAP assistance dropped from 7.5 million householdsin 1981 to 4.4 million households in 1996. 6 At the same time, the percent of LIHEAP recipients ' home heating bills covered by LIHEAP has been diminishing as the amount of recipients ' total heating bills has been increasing. In 1981, LIHEAP covered around 23 percent of the total bills andsince 1987, this percentage has steadily dropped from 19 percent in 1987 to 8 per-cent in 1996. 7At the same time total home heating bills have increased in current dollars from $7.0 billion in 1981 to $7.9 billion in 1987 to $10.6 billion in 1996.8 Who is hit hardest by the reduction in LIHEAP funding? It is estimated that 43 percent of LIHEAP eligible households have children.9A recent survey by the Na- tional Energy Assistance Directors Association released in September 1997, showedthat of the 1.2 million households that lost LIHEAP assistance between fiscal year1995 and fiscal year 1997, 313,000 had at least one elderly member and 156,000had at least on disabled member. LIHEAP recipients also tend to be on the low-end of the poverty scale. For exam- ple, in fiscal year 1995, around 40 percent of households that received assistancewere under 75 percent of the poverty level. 10The proportion of energy costs to household income is called the energy burden. In 1995, NCLC completed a studythat illustrated the disparity in energy burden between average residential and low-347 11National consumer Law Center, ''Energy and the Poor: The Crisis Continues, '' January 1995, chpt. II. 1242 U.S.C. section 8624(b).income households. We found the burden for the average residential household is 3.8 percent, while low-income households pay far more. Households receiving wel-fare assistance paid an average of 26 percent of their income on energy, Social Secu-rity recipients paid around 14 percent and minimum wage households paid around12 percent. 11 LIHEAP CAN MOVE HOUSEHOLDS TOWARD SELF -SUFFICIENCY LIHEAP is a block grant that targets assistance to low-income households who pay a high proportion of household income on home energy, assists eligible familiesin crisis situations, and among other things, provides low-cost weatherization to re-duce household energy costs. 12Increased funding for LIHEAP could work towards reducing dependence on energy assistance in the first place. As noted by VickyMroczek, Chief of the Office of Community Services, Ohio Department of Develop-ment and the Director of Ohio 's LIHEAP program: Reduction in energy assistance dependence over time is self-evident with respect to weatherization, but I think it 's also true on the bill assistance side. When someone goes into debt to maintain util-ity service, there are costs or other needs that go unmet. When someone owes theutility money over a long period, ratepayers bear that expense, too. An unpaid finalutility bill on a credit report impinges on a person 's ability to buy or rent housing; sometimes it can show up when a potential employer does a background check. Lossof utility services also affects education performance due to excessive moving orunhealthy conditions in the home. EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY LIHEAP FUNDS Emergency contingency funds are a critical resource in times of crisis, but should not be counted as part of the overall amount of funding a state has to plan a pro-gram. Emergency contingency funds are released only after the emergence of a full-blown crisis, which may arise after the program has shut down for the season.Maintaining current funding levels for LIHEAP regular and emergency contingencyfunding in lieu of restored regular funding will continue to place vulnerable low-in-come and elderly households in potentially life-threatening situations time and timeagain. A more rational approach would be to increase the current level of the reg-ular funding so that programs can effectively plan ahead for crisis situations to miti-gate the danger to safety and health. THE PRIVATE SECTOR Fuel funds, a form of non-federal energy assistance, play an important role in helping those Americans in dire need of energy assistance; however, these funds areonly a small fraction of the LIHEAP. The National Fuel Funds Network estimatesthat in 1998, around $88 million in non-federal energy assistance was raised nation-ally. These private sector funds are critical, but simply not large enough to providethe amount of energy assistance to eligible Americans as the LIHEAP and cannotfill the gap left by reduced levels of regular LIHEAP funding. CONCLUSION We urge the restoration of LIHEAP assistance to, at a minimum, $1.5 billion in regular appropriations for fiscal year 2001 and $1.6 billion in advance appropriationfor 2002. Restored levels of regular funding will enable state agencies design astronger program for the upcoming fiscal year. Finally, the need for LIHEAP assist- ance continues, especially as states implement welfare reform and, as demonstratedthis past winter with the home heating oil price crisis, inadequate funding levelsplace the health of financially vulnerable families in jeopardy. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR THE MENTALLY ILL Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin and members of the Subcommittee, I am Jim McNulty, of Bristol, Rhode Island, a member of the Board of Directors of the Na-tional Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI). I am pleased today to offer NAMI 's views on the Subcommittee 's fiscal year 2001 bill that are of tremendous concern to people with serious brain disorders and their families.348 WHO IS NAMI ? NAMI is the nation 's largest national organization, 210,000 members representing persons with serious brain disorders and their families. Through our 1,200 chaptersand affiliates in all 50 states, we support education, outreach, advocacy and re-search on behalf of persons with serious brain disorders such as schizophrenia,manic depressive illness, major depression, severe anxiety disorders and major men-tal illnesses affecting children. Like so many NAMI members, mental illness has directly affected my life. In 1986, I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressiveillness. Mr. Chairman, for too long severe mental illness has been shrouded in stigma and discrimination. These illnesses have been misunderstood, feared, hidden, and oftenignored by science. Only in the last decade have we seen the first real hope for peo-ple with these brain disorders through pioneering research that has uncovered botha biological basis for these brain disorders and treatments that work. From NAMI 's perspective, this progress was confirmed for all Americans through two watershedevents in 1999 \u2014the White House Conference on Mental Health on June 7 and the release of the Surgeon General 's Report on Mental health on December 13. Taken together, these two events brought together national leaders and the most com-prehensive scientific report ever to substantiate what we have been saying foryears \u2014that severe mental illnesses are brain disorders that are treatable. As the Surgeon General noted, current success rates for treating schizophrenia are near 60percent. Likewise, the success rate for bipolar disorder has risen in recent years andnow approaches 80 percent. For major depression, the rate has climbed to nearly65 percent. These recent advances would not have been possible without substantialinvestment in biomedical research directed to the most complex organ in the humanbody, the brain. SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS RESEARCH AT THE NIH The year 2000 marks the end of the Decade of the Brain \u2014an initiative that grew out of the leadership of your colleagues former Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon andthe late Senator and Governor Lauton Chiles of Florida \u2014it is important for us to put into perspective the gains we have witnessed in brain science that have bene-fited people with serious brain diseases such as schizophrenia and other severemental illnesses. We also need to plan for the future gains that are so necessary. I noted earlier that severe mental illnesses are often quite effectively treated. In fact, tremendous advances in treatment of severe mental illnesses occurred duringthe last ten years, the Decade of the Brain, from the introduction of Prozac andClozapine and other new drug discoveries that have virtually revolutionized mentalillness treatment. Today, many more consumers, patients with serious mental ill-nesses, stand able to take charge of their lives, to be productive, to enjoy recovery,because of these treatment advances. But we should not underestimate how much more must be learned about the brain regions involved in these serious mental disorders, the molecules at the rootsof the terrible symptoms, and the genes that lead to vulnerability to these illnesses.The Decade of the Brain has really only brought us to the threshold of discoverywhen it comes to brain diseases such as schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, ob-sessive-compulsive disorder, childhood mental illnesses and others. We are only nowpoised to fully probe and finally understand the biological underpinnings of the mostserious mental illnesses. Treatment for mental illnesses, while impressive and comparable to some of the best treatments in all of medicine, are still unacceptable for patients, families, andour society. Many people with severe mental illnesses find only incomplete relieffrom their symptoms; disability is still all too commonly associated with these ill-nesses. In my case, treatment for bipolar disorder has proven effective, but neverfor all of the symptoms. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a brain dis-order which has been pinpointed to specific higher regions of the brain, still oftenfail to achieve much gain in treatment. For children matters are worse because weknow so little about the illnesses as they emerge during development, and we knoweven less about how to effectively and safely treat them. The national need for severe mental illness research is most starkly demonstrated by particularly terrible statistics. Our nation stands in the midst of a virtual catas-trophe: a suicide epidemic. Suicide is the eighth most common cause of death in thiscountry and the fourth most frequent cause of life lost under age 65. Rates are in-creasing among young men and the elderly. As it stands, 30,000 Americans will dieby suicide this year, most of whom have a serious mental illness. The most severemental illnesses \u2014schizophrenia and bipolar disorder-disproportionately lead to sui-349 cide. Ten percent of the 2,000,000 U.S. citizens with schizophrenia are take their lives; about half will make a suicide attempt at some point. Fifteen percent to 20percent of the approximately 2,000,000 Americans with bipolar illness will die bysuicide. That severe mental illness research ought to be a priority for our nation is also demonstrated by data from the World Bank and World Health Organization. Severemental illnesses \u2014major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive- compulsive disorder \u2014account for four of the top 10 most disabling illnesses in the world. These brain disorders account for an estimated 20 percent of total disabilityresulting from all diseases and injuries. Mr. Chairman, the public health burden to our nation from severe mental ill- nesses requires that research on these diseases be a high priority, especially giventhe scientific opportunities that exist in the brain sciences. Let me concentrate nowon what we think are sound goals for NIH and NIMH, respectively, so that we canbring the full force of our research to bear on this most important health emergency. NIH INVESTMENT : A CALL FOR INCREASED FUNDING AND ACCOUNTABILITY NAMI applauds your leadership in supporting increases for the NIH. We urge the Subcommittee to follow the recommendations of the scientific community and theAd Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding and increase overall funding for NIHby $2.7 billion (a 15 percent boost) for fiscal year 2001, up to $20.5 billion. Suchan increase would keep Congress on pace to reach the bipartisan goal of doubling NIH funding by 2003. But increased resources are not the only important objective for NIH: better ac- countability is also essential. NAMI applauds your efforts to fairly boost NIH fund-ing and limit disease-of-the week approaches to appropriations. Nonetheless, weurge you to press NIH to invest their resources according to public health need aswell as scientific opportunity, as the 1998 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on NIHpriority setting called for. NIH must balance its investment among diseases so thatincreases in the budget go preferentially to address illnesses that are disabling andcostly and have been underfunded in the past. It is obvious to NAMI that severe mental illnesses would, and should be, a top research priority if public health burden is the principal criteria by which public re-search dollars are allocated. Yet, based on NIH 's own recent estimates, $1.00 is in- vested in research for every $6.86 in costs of AIDS, $9.96 in costs of cancer, $65.65in costs of heart disease, and $161.26 costs in schizophrenia. In other words, 15cents is spent on AIDS research per dollar of costs, compared with 10 cents for can-cer, two cents for heart disease, and less than one cent for schizophrenia. This isobviously not a wise research investment strategy for the United States. NIMH : THE KEY TO THE CURE FOR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES For NIMH, we also applaud this Subcommittee 's leadership, demonstrated by your boosting its appropriations significantly in the past few years and by nearly15 percent in fiscal year 2000, up to its current level of $978.4 million. For fiscalyear 2001, NAMI urges the Subcommittee to fund the NIMH up to the ''professional judgment '' recommendation of $1.169 billion. While NAMI applauds the President 's request to increase NIMH 's budget by 5.9 percent, up to $1.031 billion, we believe that the ''professional judgment '' recommendation needed in order to increase the agency 's success rate for reviewed grants to at least 750 new and competing grants. NIMH is currently attracting more research grant applications than any other insti-tute due to the leadership of the institute and the tremendous research opportuni-ties that exist in the neuroscience 's and in severe mental illness research. NAMI believes that we must ensure that this time of interest, strong leadership, and re-search opportunity is taken \u2014so that people with serious brain diseases have the best hope for the future, for themselves and for their families and future genera-tions. We urge you, Mr. Chairman, to help ensure that NIMH continues its move to spend its taxpayer dollars wisely, with investments in basic neuroscience and molec-ular biology that will undergird the new treatment frontier for severe mental ill-nesses and also with strong commitments to serious brain disorders directed to-wards pre-clinical, clinical, and services research. NIMH should continue its effortsto identify genes linked to severe mental illnesses; to fund and expand clinical re-search into psychotic illnesses, serious disorders in children, and in mood disorders;to continue the probe of the biology of serious mental disorders including schizo-phrenia, mood, and anxiety disorders. NIMH should also use the tools of behavioral science to better understand the ex- pression and best treatment of severe mental illnesses. However, NAMI strongly350 recommends that research in prevention and psychosocial research should be redi- rected in order to address problems associated with serious mental illnesses, con-sistent with the recommendations of NIMH 's own National Advisory Mental Health Council. We agree with the recommendations of the Council that the prevention re-search portfolio has all but excluded serious mental illness research and instead fo-cused on basic behavioral science issues and or social problems such as adolescentrelationships, divorce or poor self-esteem. NAMI believes that we cannot let anotherfive years go by studying children who misbehave while we know so little about seri-ous mental illnesses in children and how to effectively treat these disorders. What research issues are most compelling for our members, the more than 210,000 Americans facing a serious brain disorder? (1) More basic research on the brain and higher brain functioning. (2) More pre-clinical research on the genes, mol-ecules, and brain regions involved in severe mental illnesses. (3) More clinical re-search aimed at understanding the best treatment for these serious disorders andtranslating that research into practice. (4) More research aimed at better under-standing and treating these brain disorders in children. (5) Research aimed at di-minishing relapse and disability in severe mental illnesses. (6) More research onhow people with severe mental illnesses best receive treatment and services. (7) Anaccountable and responsible research investment strategy that will help the nation 's individuals with severe mental illnesses and their families, as well as the countryat large, which must shoulder the burden and costs of these illnesses. Finally, Mr. Chairman, NAMI would like to urge that NIMH 's colleague insti- tutes, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute onAlcohol and Alcoholism (NIAAA) be directed to work cooperatively with NIMH andthe pressing public health crisis posed by persons diagnosed with a severe mentalillness who have a co-occurring substance abuse problem. NAMI believes that alarge and growing body of scientific evidence is making clear that integrated treat-ment, as opposed to parallel and sequential treatment, is the most effective meansof treating these co-morbid disorders. NAMI urges that NIMH, NIDA and NIAAAshould work in partnership to ensure that progress continues in our efforts to betterunderstand co-occurring mental illness and chemical dependency. SAMHSA AND CMHS Mr. Chairman, in addition to urging the Subcommittee to support increased fund- ing for brain research, I would also like to note the importance of federally fundedmental illness services through the Center for Mental Health Services at SAMHSA.Federal support for community-based care is a critical resource for people with themost severe mental illnesses. With many states reducing their psychiatric hospitalbeds and a growing number moving toward managed care systems, the federal in-vestment in community-based care continues to grow in importance. For example,funding for the Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) now constitutes as much as 40percent of all non-institutional services spending in some states. In the President 's fiscal year 2001 budget proposal, a $60 million increase is pro- posed for the MHBG (up from its fiscal year 2000 appropriation of $356 million, to$416 million). While NAMI is extremely grateful for the $68 million increase thatthe Subcommittee enacted for fiscal year 2000, the reality is that this boost in re-sources is not enough to keep pace with the continued widening of gaps in the publicmental illness treatment system in many states. The consequences of these emerg-ing cracks in the service system are readily apparent, not just to NAMI 's consumer and family membership, but also to the public: the growing number of homelessadults on our nation 's streets who receive no treatment services, well publicized tragic incidents involving individuals with severe mental illness who are not access-ing adequate treatment services and the growing trend of ''criminalization '' of men- tal illness and the stress it is placing on state and local jails and prisons. The causes of these growing gaps in the services are varied and complicated: the trend toward privatizing state Medicaid programs through contracting with privatemanaged care firms, cuts in Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) fund-ing and expansion of the mission of public mental health programs beyond servingthe most severely disabled consumers. Moreover, in recent years state mental healthagency budgets have been under increasing pressure as a result of forces beyondtheir control. Among these forces are restrictions on eligibility for SSI and SSDI forpeople whose disability is based in part on drug abuse or alcoholism and a 1997 U.S.Supreme Court decision allowing states to commit sexually violent predators tostate hospitals. In addition to supporting the Administration 's proposed increase, NAMI further recommends that the Subcommittee target all additional funds for the MHBG in fis-cal year 2001 to state and local evidence-based, outreach-oriented service-delivery351 models for persons with severe mental illness in the community. In particular, NAMI urges that any increase in MHBG funding be directed to assertive communitytreatment, including the Program of Assertive Community Treatment, or PACT.PACT programs use a 24-hour, seven day-a-week, team approach that delivers com-prehensive treatment, rehabilitation and support services in community settings.High-quality PACT programs are typically implemented at a cost that is signifi-cantly less than placing an individual in a jail, a residential treatment program ora hospital. PACT is especially effective in serving persons who are the most treat-ment resistant, persons with a co-occuring mental illness and substance abuse dis-order and persons who are high users of inpatient hospitalization services. In addition, NAMI recommends that the Subcommittee consider requiring states to report an unduplicated count of persons served by diagnosis, age and servicesconsumed using the targeted initiative MHBG funds. NAMI is also concerned thatthe Substance Abuse Treatment and Prevention Block Grant is not currently sup-porting programs serving persons dually diagnosed with mental illness and addict-ive disorders. As I noted above, evidence-based research, as confirmed by the NIH,verifies that integrated treatment, as opposed to parallel collaborative or sequentialapproaches, is the most effective model for serving persons with a dual diagnosis.NAMI therefore recommends that the Subcommittee direct SAMHSA to allow statesto use funding from both programs to promote integrated treatment services for per-sons with co-occuring mental illness and addictive disorders. NAMI is pleased that the President 's fiscal year 2001 budget proposes another $5 million increase for the PATH program (up from its current $30 million, to $35 mil-lion). PATH is a formula grant program to the states to support local programs serv-ing homeless persons with severe mental illness. This increase in PATH fundingwill help communities all across the country increase access to treatment and sup-ports for the growing number of homeless with severe mental illnesses. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the President 's fiscal year 2001 budget proposes a new unauthorized line-item as part of the CMHS 's programs \u2014Targeted Capacity Expansion (TCE). According to CMHS 's own justification for this request, this new $30 million is for undefined prevention and early intervention services for personswho are not diagnosed with a severe mental illness who receive services in ''non- mental health settings. '' While NAMI recognizes that such a new program could offer benefit to many communities, we believe a more pressing public health concernis the alarming trend of ''criminalization '' of severe mental illness. NAMI therefore urges that instead of establishing a new TCE line item within the CMHS budget, the Subcommittee instead direct these funds to a new initiativewithin the agency 's Knowledge, Development and Application (KDA) program on criminalization. Such a program should be directed toward innovative state andlocal programs that (1) divert mentally ill, non-violent criminal defendants and con-victs into treatment programs, (2) replicate successful models such as mental healthcourts, and (3) train police officers in how to appropriately interact with suspectswith severe mental illnesses. NAMI is making a similar request to your colleaguesat the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee for a program of simi-lar scope and purpose at the Bureau of Justice Assistance. In January, The Charlotte Observer ran a five-part investigative series that re- ported since 1994, at least 35 people with mental or developmental disabilities havedied under questionable circumstances while under the care of public and privatemental health facilities in North Carolina. Deaths were attributed to suicide, mur-der, neglect, scalding, and falls, and most went unnoticed by the agencies authorizedwith investigating such deaths. NAMI recommends that resources be targeted tofund Protection and Advocacy agencies to investigate questionable deaths and seri-ous injuries, like those deaths in North Carolina that have resulted from restraintabuse. Unfortunately, the Charlotte Observer series is just one of several investigative media reports over the last year that have exposed systemic failures to provide ade-quate treatments and services to individuals with severe and persistent mental ill-nesses. The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Hartford Courant, andThe Orlando Sentinel have revealed a pervasive pattern of neglect by state mentalhealth systems. The need for further investigation, a system of accountability andmandatory reporting of deaths and serious injuries will help ensure that individualswith mental illnesses don 't lose their lives in the very places designed to help them. DOL AND SSA Finally, beyond the NAMI 's traditional concerns with NIMH and CMHS, I would like to note two other departments under the Subcommittee 's jurisdiction that are of concern to NAMI \u2014the Department of Labor (DoL) and the Social Security Admin-352 1APTA Transit Ridership Report, Fourth Quarter 1999.istration (SSA). With regard to DoL, NAMI would like to go on record in support of the Administration request to establish a new Assistant Secretary position fordisability policy. At SSA, NAMI would like to express our strong support for fullimplementation of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act(TWWIIA) and fiscal year 2001 funding for the new work incentives planning andoutreach program. NAMI would like to thank you for your strong support forTWWIIA last year. Enactment of both these proposals will help ensure that progressis made in addressing the barriers to work that still leave more than 80 percentof adults with severe mental illnesses unemployed and out of the economic main-stream. CONCLUSION Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to offer NAMI 's views on fiscal year 2001 funding for programs of critical importance to people with serious brain dis-orders. NAMI looks forward to working with you in the coming months to educateboth the general public and your colleagues in Congress about the critical impor-tance of investment in biomedical research and improved services for people livingwith severe mental illness. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) appreciates this oppor- tunity to testify on the fiscal year 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-cation and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. About APTA APTA 's 1,270 member organizations serve the public interest by providing safe, efficient and economical public transportation service, and by working to ensurethat those services and products support national transportation, energy, environ-mental, community, and economic goals. APTA member organizations include tran-sit systems; design, construction and finance firms; product and service providers;academic institutions, and state associations and departments of transportation.More than ninety percent of the people who use transit in the U.S. are served byAPTA member systems. We submit testimony to this Subcommittee to make the point that public trans- portation can make a difference in how people get to jobs, health care, training, and other social services. According to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), 32 mil-lion senior citizens rely on transit as their driving ability decreases with age; 27 mil-lion people with disabilities depend on transit to maintain their independence; 37million people living below the poverty level often cannot afford a car and use tran-sit to reach jobs. There are 56 million children under driving age, many of whomuse transit to travel to and from school and for after-school activities. Transit rider-ship has grown by more than 15 percent over the past four years and annual rider-ship exceeds the 9 billion mark. Overview Mr. Chairman, we bring a message about the role public transportation can and does play in providing services to millions of Americans. We ask that the Sub-committee consider three issues of particular importance to public transit. First,APTA requests that the Subcommittee direct the Department of Transportation(DOT) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to complete jointcoordination guidelines on human services transportation as soon as possible. Sec-ond, we urge the Subcommittee to highlight the role that public transportation canplay in providing cost-effective access to health care and to work \u2014made better by improved coordination. Finally, we urge the Subcommittee to continue to provideand encourage flexibility with regard to HHS funding being used to pay for thetransportation costs of HHS clients \u2014especially those individuals with special trans- portation needs. Transit agencies have the expertise and infrastructure to providetransportation, and we think that social service agencies could save money on trans-portation service by working with transit agencies. The Federal Government has al-ready invested in public transportation. Let 's not pay twice by allowing separate special purpose systems to be built and subsidized. Mr. Chairman, transit is delivering. U.S. transit ridership was up more than 4.5 percent in 1999. 1Ridership is on the rise in every mode, including a 5 percent in- crease in demand response service. Moreover, these vital services, which provide the353 2TRANSPORTATION COORDINATION: Benefits and Barriers Exist, and Planning Efforts Progress Slowly. October, 1999. (Hereinafter, GAO Report). 3GAO Report, Page 3. 4GAO Report, Page 20.only source of mobility for individuals with disabilities and our elderly population,are seeing a dramatic increase in areas all across America \u2014both rural and urban. Demand response services are on the rise in places like Springfield, Illinois; Mil-waukee, Wisconsin; Pensacola, Florida; Waco, Texas; Fort Myers, Florida; Dallas,Texas; Miami, Florida; and Baltimore, Maryland. Background According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), federal efforts to stream- line the delivery of human services transportation by DOT and HHS began as earlyas 1986 with the establishment of a Coordinating Council. 2Over a course of years, the Council successfully identified numerous barriers standing in the way of trans-portation coordination. However, due to jurisdictional problems, the Council was un-able to fully respond to these barriers. Moreover, even when the Council reachedout to the States in the mid 1990 's, the majority of barriers that were identified were too general to be acted upon with any significant federal response. 3 In fiscal year 1997, report language first appeared in both the Transportation and Related Agencies and Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bills, call-ing for the development of joint planning guidelines to specifically address the useof public transportation in the delivery of human services transportation. APTA,having worked with Congress to encourage this collaboration, was pleased that thebills directed DOT and HHS to develop joint guidelines for coordination of transpor-tation services, including joint identification of human services client transportationneeds and the appropriate mix of transportation services to meet those needs; theexpanded use of public transit services to deliver human services program transpor-tation; and cost-sharing arrangements based on a uniform accounting system forHHS program recipients transported by paratransit systems. Although the joint guidelines have not yet been released, we are hopeful that DOT and HHS will be in a position to release a working draft in the near future. Never-theless, we again urge this Subcommittee to direct HHS and DOT to complete theirjoint coordination guidelines as soon as possible, and to consider the feasibility ofinvolving other federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor, in the process. GAO Report Cites the Value of Transportation Coordination The report issued by the GAO notes that transportation coordination can have nu- merous benefits. It also recommends a number of ways that DOT and HHS can bet-ter coordinate their activities. They include: \u2014requiring the Coordinating Council to issue a prioritized strategic plan by a spe- cific date. \u2014charging the Council with developing an action plan with specific responsibil- ities. \u2014requiring an annual report from the Council on its major initiatives and accom- plishments. 4 APTA fully agrees with the recommendations made in the GAO report. During this period of tight budget caps, every dollar dedicated to human services transpor-tation by transit agencies can be stretched further if coordination is implementedat the federal level and encouraged at the State and local level. These joint guide-lines will be invaluable in providing policy guidance for coordination activities bytransportation agencies and human service providers at the local level. If we can 't get the necessary guidance at the federal level, how can we expect coordination atthe local level? TEA 21 Planning Provisions We are pleased to note that the principal federal surface transportation infra- structure investment law, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21), includes numerous provisions that deal specifically with the importance of co-ordination of transportation activities. First, the bill requires DOT to encouragemetropolitan planning organizations in developing local transportation plans to co-ordinate the design and delivery of transportation services by all entities receivingfederal funds for transportation purposes. Another TEA 21 section requires govern-ment agencies and nonprofit organizations receiving assistance from governmentsources other than DOT for non-emergency transportation services to coordinate thedesign and delivery of transportation services. The law also requires transportationplans to be consistent with air quality goals under the Clean Air Act. Clearly, trans-354 5GAO Report, Page 7.portation services are coordinated with many federal programs to improve overall efficiency. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROVIDES AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO NON -EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE Mr. Chairman, we continue to stress the importance of coordinating transit serv- ice with other government functions because of the great potential for saving taxdollars at all levels of government. To lower costs, non-driving outpatients may trav-el to health care by transit. The alternative may be expensive taxi or ambulanceservice. Rather than using paratransit services (which can cost 10 times the amountof traditional transit fares), 5physically able clients can save themselves and human services agencies significant money by taking other types of public transportation. For example, across the nation, transit vans carry thousands of people to and fromdialysis treatment, saving as much as $200 to $400 per trip as compared to special-ized medical transportation services. During the past decade, transit systems have made it increasingly possible for transit services to be available to all Americans. Wheelchair accessible buses in-creased from 40 percent of the fleet in 1990 to 77 percent of the fleet in 1999. Simi-larly, commuter rail operators reduced the number of non-accessible rail cars bymore than half over the same period. Moreover, virtually all fixed route bus serviceis now accessible to individuals with disabilities. In 1997, the Health Care Financing Administration estimated that it was spend- ing approximately $1.2 billion annually in non-emergency medical transportation.Since then, many state Medicaid offices have found waste, fraud and abuse withintheir transportation systems and have improved the delivery of transportation serv-ices at a reduced cost by coordinating with local public transit operators. In fact,20 percent of the nation 's Medicaid rides are now on public transit. According to the FTA, in four major programs \u2014Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and Unemploy- ment Compensation \u2014each dollar invested in low-cost mobility services reduces the transportation cost of these programs by approximately 60 percent. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DELIVERS PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK Transit Provides American 's Access to Jobs; Employers Gain Access to New Talent During the late 1990 's, Congress and the 50 States took positive steps to get peo- ple off welfare and into the workforce. At the same time, a healthy economy hascreated thousands of new jobs. However, due to America 's changing landscape and the growth of suburban sprawl, many of these new jobs are located in the suburbs.How can we bring people who live in central cities, many of whom have no auto-mobile, out to where the jobs are? Public transportation agencies, in coordinationwith State and local social service agencies and the private sector, have respondedto the challenge. One of the best examples of a successful access to work program (and the value of coordination) is New Jersey Transit 's ''WorkPass '' Program \u2014a comprehensive transportation service and educational program developed to assist public and non-profit agencies in their efforts to move people from welfare to work. The programhas provided assistance to more than 50 public and non-profit organizations, includ-ing county welfare agencies, Medicare agencies, and other social service organiza-tions who offer public assistance for transportation to jobs, medical assistance andchildcare. Partnering with the New Jersey Department of Transportation as well asthe State 's human services agency, New Jersey Transit was able to have a working program within one month, and more than 5,000 monthly passes and one-way tick-ets are purchased by WorkPass members each month. The transit agency notes thatthe success of the program is due to the partnerships it has formed and its abilityto adapt to the different agencies seeking its services. WorkPass is more than just a pass sales program \u2014it has a comprehensive train- ing program which has trained more than 500 welfare and other social service agen-cy representatives. These representatives are taught to read schedules, determinefares and accessibility and provide special transportation services to their clients.New Jersey Transit provides each member with a resource center stocked withschedules, maps, fare charts and other transit information. WorkPass provides par-ticipants with access to job training and education, employment opportunities, med-ical visits, and childcare \u2014all while learning the valuable commuting skills they need to succeed when employed.355 6TEA 21, Section 3037.The cost savings as a result of this program have been tremendous. Under the WorkPass Program, instead of providing their clients with a $6 per diem, welfareagencies reduce transportation costs by using bus and rail monthly passes. Countywelfare agencies are saving between 50 percent \u201460 percent on each WorkPass par- ticipant \u2014an estimated $2 million saved in transportation costs for its members. More Coordination Needed To Deliver People from Welfare to Work Mr. Chairman, the successful New Jersey program is representative of the com- mitment the entire U.S. transit industry has put forth in the effort to assist individ-uals making the difficult transition from welfare to work. In October 1998, an APTAAccess to Jobs Task Force was created to help coordinate and assess APTA memberwelfare to work activities. New services include new routes to employment locationsoutside the existing service area; more direct service to reduce very long trip times;late night and early morning service; so-called reverse commute service; and shut-tles from rail stations and the ends of bus routes to dispersed job locations. The neg-ative impact that these extra efforts may have on transit budgets is easily out-weighed by the changes the programs have made in people 's lives. APTA believes that an awareness of problems encountered by organizations in their welfare to work activities may help other agencies avoid the pitfalls that couldreduce the effectiveness of their welfare to work programs. Therefore, we asked ourmember organizations to describe some of the most common problems that theyhave encountered in implementing welfare to work activities. Not surprisingly,APTA 's 1999 Access-To-Work Best Practices Survey Summary Report reveals that throughout America, the lack of coordination is the number one reason that somewell intentioned welfare to work projects have fallen short of their goals. For example, lack of coordination has hampered programs in Missouri. In St. Louis, there has been a lack of meaningful cooperation with the training staffs ofhuman services agencies. Also, City Utilities of Springfield has experienced dif-ficulty in coordinating information from all the various social service agencies in-volved with their welfare to work program. In fact, in order for them to put togethera comprehensive regional plan, the assistance of an outside consulting company wasrequired to gather all information. Moreover, in Texas, transportation coordinationwith human services agencies is sorely needed in the Fort Worth TransportationAuthority 's (The T) attempt to identify employers willing to hire welfare recipients, and to find strong candidates for certain jobs. Moreover, the transit agency saysthat coordinating various funding sources has been quite difficult \u2014local social serv- ices partners are burdened with the task of tracking separate data from separateFederal agencies, including DOL and HUD. This requirement has been a major bar-rier in streamlining funding for Tarrant County 's welfare to work initiatives. Some 94 percent of welfare recipients attempting to move into the workforce do not own cars and must rely on public transportation to get to work. And while 60percent of welfare recipients live in central cities, the majority of new jobs are inthe suburbs. If we as a nation wish to continue the positive trends in getting morepeople into decent, productive employment, we must provide the necessary coordina-tion and guidance at the federal level to get them there. In the TEA 21 section au-thorizing the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, DOT is required to ''co- ordinate activities with related activities under programs of other federal depart-ments and agencies. '' Eligible Access to Jobs projects financed under that section must be ''part of a coordinated public transit-human services transportation plan- ning process. '' 6Mr. Chairman, we need the help of the Coordinating Council 's joint guidelines in order to fully implement this provision. Mr. Chairman, we 've come so far in the last ten years with respect to providing people on public assistance with access to decent jobs. But without a concerted effortto improve coordination at the federal level, there 's a limit on the amount of services our transit agencies and state DOT 's can provide. Coordination is absolutely crucial to the future success of the welfare to work initiative. INCREASED FUNDS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ADA COMPLIANCE STANDARDS Since the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act, transit agencies have made huge progress in their effort to ensure that all forms of public transportationare accessible to individuals with disabilities. But public investment for further on-vehicle lift, ramp and station improvements must keep pace in order for transitagencies to maintain Federal standards. More than 100 million trips were providedon demand responsive public transit in 1999, at an estimated total capital and oper-ating cost of $1.4 billion. Accordingly, APTA urges this Subcommittee to continue356 to provide and encourage flexibility with regard to HHS funding being used to pay for the transportation costs of HHS clients. This is also an area where the jointguidelines would go far in ensuring HHS programs retain their commitment to mak-ing adequate transportation resources available. CONCLUSION In closing, Mr. Chairman, we again thank you for this opportunity to convey our message about the critical role public transportation can and does play in providingservices to millions of Americans. We ask that in developing the fiscal year 2001Labor, Health and Human Services and Education bill, the Subcommittee direct theDepartment of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Servicesto complete the joint coordination guidelines on human services transportation thathave been requested by Congress. Second, we urge the Subcommittee to highlightthe role that public transportation can play in providing cost-effective access tohealth care and to work \u2014made better by improved coordination. Finally, we urge the Subcommittee to continue to provide and encourage flexibility with regard toHHS funding being used to pay for the transportation costs of HHS clients \u2014espe- cially those individuals with special transportation needs. Once again, we appreciate your consideration of our views. APTA would be pleased to provide you additional information to assist you in your deliberations. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON INDEPENDENT LIVING Chairman Specter and members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS and Education, the National Council on Independent Living (NCIL)thanks you for allowing us to provide written testimony regarding the great needto increase the funding in title VII, Part C of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, asamended, by $75 million over the next three years. This funding will allow states to strengthen and expand the network of centers for independent living throughoutthe country. The National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) is the national membership association of centers for independent living (CILs), statewide councils on inde-pendent living (SILCs), people with disabilities and organizations advocating for therights of people with disabilities. CILs are community-based, non-profit corporations which are governed, managed and staffed by a majority of people with disabilities. CILs are non-residential organi-zations, advocating and providing services that support the efforts of people withsignificant disabilities to live more independently in their own homes, within ourcommunities. Currently, there are 340 CILs, with more than 224 satellite locations. Of these, 229 CILs and 44 satellites are funded with the $45 million dollars authorizedthrough Title VII -Part C of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The balance are sup- ported with state funds. A center 's service area may be one county or a dozen. According to the Rural In- stitute on Disabilities, CILs cover an average of 5.7 counties. Today, 60 percent(1,911) of our nation 's counties receive service from a CIL. This figure is deceiving, however, because a single center may have the task of providing services to an areathe size of Pennsylvania. NCIL is asking that the Senate Appropriations Committee make a strong commit- ment to independent living. You can do this by increasing funding for CILs by $75million over the next three years. As described above, statewide independent living councils are joining in the effort to secure additional funds for CILs. SILCs are governor-appointed bodies which aredirected by the Rehabilitation Act to design a network of CILs. Working in conjunc-tion with the state vocational rehabilitation agencies, SILCs must develop planswhich address the needs of our unserved and underserved communities. This planis submitted to the Department of Education and summarized each year for yourreview. The following are some of the findings from 1998, when CILs were fundedat about $40 million nationally. These figures do not include Massachusetts, Con-necticut, and Minnesota because of their unique funding formulas. First, who did we serve? In 1998, CILs assisted 118,000 people with significant disabilities. Of these, 35 percent were from minority groups, which significantly exceeded the percentage ofminorities in the nation as a whole (29.7 percent according to the Census Bureau).One might ask what would contribute to a success rate that makes CILs the envy357 of many service providers. Perhaps it is because over 28 percent of center employees are also members of minority groups. In the introduction, you were informed that CILs must be run by people with dis- abilities. In 1998, almost 66 percent of the staff were people with disabilities, includ-ing 72 percent of the decision-making positions. When we say 19consumer directed ', we mean it. What about services? If we were VISTA, we might brag about our 2 million hours of community service. Or if we were a single services program, CILs would claim to provide services over760,000 times. But that isn 't who we are. CILs are about assisting people with dis- abilities so they can live more independently in their communities. In addition to responding to almost 340,000 requests for information and referral, CILs provided over 54,000 individuals with peer counseling services; 50,000 receivedassistance finding housing; 34,000 acquired personal assistance services; 33,500 at-tained transportation services; over 54,000 individuals received independent livingskills training, and over 6,000 became employed. In addition, literally tens of thou-sands of individuals received dozens of other services from CILs, including assist-ance in moving out of costly institutional settings such as nursing homes. In 1998, CILs helped over 1,400 people get out of nursing homes AND prevented over 14,500 from going into nursing homes. According to the 1998 State Data Bookon Long Term Care Program and Market Characteristics, the average cost of nurs-ing home services across the U.S. is $34,938/person/year. As you can imagine, thereis a wide variation in nursing home costs from state to state. In Washington, forinstance, the annual cost was $42,340. Those who leave or avoid entering a nursing home are able to remain in their communities because they receive personal assistance and other community-basedservices. According to a 1999 report from the National Conference of State Legisla-tures, the average cost for community based services is $14,902 per person. In otherwords, when a center is able to help a person move from a nursing home to commu-nity-based services, they save taxpayers an average of $20,036. In 1998, CILs savedtaxpayers over $318 million. Think of it: A savings of $318 million AND people re-main in their own homes with their own families, as contributing members of theircommunities. Imagine the financial rewards in Alaska alone, where nursing homes cost $92,520 per year for each resident while home health costs $33, 616. This amounts to a sav-ings of $58,904 per person, per year. Investing in CILs for independent living makes sense. \u2014If the federal CIL program were a seed or magnet project, it would claim that with the $39,955,310 CILs re-ceived in 1998, they were able to attract an additional $144 million outside of thefunding from Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act. This includes a variety of govern-ment, private foundation, fundraising, and fee-for-service arrangements. In otherwords, CILs make the taxpayers ' money work for us \u2014and for their consumers. Here 's another interesting fact .\u2014The average cost for serving an individual at a CIL was $1,655. This amount is particularly startling when it is remembered thatthis number does not include the thousands of people who are served through infor-mation and referral, community education and systems change activities not count-ed in the case service records kept by CILs. These are individuals and groups whobenefit from the information and referral services provided as a core service at everycenter and satellite, they are also individuals and groups served through communitytraining and awareness activities, and through the systems change activities thatresult in sweeping improvements in the way the needs of people with disabilitiesare met in general. Thus far, this request has concentrated on statistics and data. NCIL doesn 't want to lose track of the fact that this appeal for funding helps real people make realchanges in their lives. Sometimes, in the course of advocating for change, both thefiscal and personal costs are lost. However, these things we know:\u2014Additional stress will be put on our health care and housing systems as baby- boomers age. \u2014Our nation is relying on institutions to address the needs of people who are el- derly and/or with disabilities. \u2014Institutions are expensive and much more restrictive than most people need. \u2014Individuals, given a choice, will remain with their families and in their own homes, participating in community activities. \u2014Oregon saved $278.3 million dollars between 1981 and 1996, by serving 73 per- cent of eligible elderly people and those with disabilities in the community.358 \u2014The personal attendant services that Kansas offers under Medicaid waivers have saved the state $2,000 per person per year. \u2014Wisconsin 's Community Options program, which offers personal assistance and other services to keep people with disabilities in the community, has saved thestate as much as 25 percent of the cost of nursing home placement for peopleat risk of institutionalization. In each of the above states, it is due to a strong independent living movement that community-based services have been as successful as the figures would indi-cate. This movement is initiated and fueled by strong CILs. In Oregon and Wis-consin, it was through the efforts of CILs that those states moved from the typicalfragmentation of services, to a single point of entry, thus streamlining service deliv-ery and significantly reducing costs. That 's what CILs do. Here are some examples of the personal impact of their work: A man in Fulton, Mississippi was injured in an automobile accident and sustained a spinal cord injury. Like most who have this experience, this gentleman was toldthat he would need 24-hour care in a nursing home at a cost to the state of $30,000/year. A staff member from the satellite center in Tupelo helped him find a wheel-chair, counseled him, and helped him get financial assistance from the state 's Spinal and Head Injury Fund. Today, this man is living with his elderly mother and receiv-ing four hours a day of personal assistance services at an annual cost of less than$8,000/year. A woman in New York was facing a life in a psychiatric center at an annual cost of $137,000 due to pressure from her family and her own lack of assertiveness. Thecenter spent $212 to provide peer counseling, advocacy, and other services to helpher work with her family and find her own apartment, where she now lives. Shereceives a HUD rent subsidy of $2,712 per year. The Hawaii Center for Independent Living has been helping a man who experi- ences quadriplegia return successfully to his community. In addition to providingindependent living skills training and helping him access assistive technology, thecenter has been working with local vocational rehabilitation services and a smallbusiness called Custom Computer Consulting to tie his lights, fans, phones, andother appliances to his computer. Because of their efforts, he is going to make it! At the center for independent living in Hot Springs there was a consumer who used a power wheelchair due to paralysis, was deaf and visually impaired. Thisyoung woman was not very educated, had been labeled as having behavioral prob-lems, and her vocational rehabilitation counselor had virtually given up on her. Thecenter began working with her using very limited signing skills, and taught her typ-ing and computer skills to improve her ability to communicate. Everything abouther changed. Suddenly she could express herself and people understood her. Shefound a job that paid a competitive wage and offers benefits such as medical insur- ance. This woman, who had been on SSI all her life, is now a taxpayer. The centerworked with her approximately two months for a total cost of less than $5,000 \u2014 less than one year 's worth of SSI payments. CILs keep families together. In Milwaukee, Independence First helped a single parent with quadriplegia. She contacted their assistive technology program for ideason baby care adaptations while she was still pregnant. After her child was born sheused the program to help her get an adapted baby carrier for trips into the commu-nity, and ideas for a lifting harness to help her get the baby onto and off of thefloor. The technology coordinator worked with Sharon and several county agenciesto assure that the child 's care needs could be adequately met. In 1994, a rural nursing home contacted the center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. One of their residents was a young mother in her early thirties who had incurred a trau-matic brain injury as the result of a car wreck. The injury had left the mother aparaplegic, with left-sided paralysis. The young mother wanted desperately to leavethe nursing home and reestablish a relationship with her three small children. Thewoman 's physician and her own family members refused to help relocate her to Tulsa. The woman didn 't even have the $307 needed to pay for her monthly medica- tions. Nor did she have money for food, rental or security deposits. After sevenmonths, the center was successful in locating resources within the community andmoved this mother out of the nursing home. Six years later, she is still living inde-pendently in her own apartment and enjoying being a mother. A young Maryland college student injured in an automobile accident at 24 had been discharged from a rehabilitation center into a nursing home in Hyattsville,Prince George 's County, MD. A center for independent living contacted the young man who was, ''convinced I was going to be there forever. '' The center for inde- pendent living provided peer support and information about resources he could uti-lize to maximize his re-integration into the community. Today he is living in his359 own apartment, attending the University of MD, and majoring in computer science and graphic arts. Why do we need $75 million? Today, the CIL network reaches less than one percent of all people with signifi- cant disabilities in the United States. While not every person with disability needsa center 's help, there remain vast areas of the U.S. where no center exists at all. Forty percent (40 percent) or 1,230 of our nation 's counties receive no service what- soever from a CIL. Hundreds more receive only superficial coverage. At the current rate of coverage (5.7 counties per center), The Rural Institute on Disabilities estimates that we need at least an additional 216 CILs. Some stateshave estimated that there should be at least one ''fully-funded '' center for every 500,000 persons, or an additional 185 CILs nationwide. What is a ''fully-funded '' CIL? Today, CILs are woefully underfunded. The average federally-funded CIL receives approximately $163,285 to support the operations of the center. Most statewideindependent living councils believe that CILs need a strong base \u2014anywhere from $200,000 to $500,000 per center per year \u2014to do their job. The National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) believes a center needs at least $250,000 to support day-to-day operations, meet standards and assurances required by the RehabilitationAct, and address the goals of the community. The Independent Living Research Uti-lization Program (ILRU) has found limited funding to be the most common reasonfor the fiscal collapse of CILs. A $25 million increase in each of the next three years will fill the gap. When we first raised this issue to you last year, several of you expressed concern that thecurrent funding formula, based solely on population, would send most of the moneyto larger communities at the expense of rural areas. This year, we are suggestingthat each $25 million increment be divided roughly in half so that each state re-ceives an flat allocation of $250,000, plus an allocation based on population. What will be the impact of a $75 million increase over the next three years? In Illinois, funding would increase from $1.5 million to $3.7 million. The Illinois SILCwill recommend that the funds be used to address underserved inner-city people, aswell as the unserved areas in the four southern counties bordering Indiana. Pennsylvania 's funding would grow by $2.3 million over three years, making it possible for CILs which have been operating at less than half the recommendedbudget to finally reach their potential, and open long-needed CILs in Du Bois andJohnstown. In Florida, funding will increase from $1.8 to almost $4.4 million. The Florida SILC will use the additional funds to not only shore up the existing CILs, but alsoaddress the needs of the people in 27 of the state 's 67 counties who are receiving virtually no service at all. In a rural state like Idaho, funding will grow from less than $700,000 to almost $1.6 million. This will allow us to strengthen the existing CILs, expand services toCoeur D 'Alene and Caldwell, and set up a center on an Indian Reservation. Kentucky will increase it 's budget from $490,000 to $1.7 million. There are four fledgling CILs in Bowling Green, Lexington, Harlan, and Covington which are oper-ating on budgets of less than $70,000 each. This increase would make it possiblefor those CILs to add the staff they need to begin seriously addressing the inde-pendent living needs of people in these communities. In a large state like California, both urban and rural needs would be addressed. CILs in San Diego and San Francisco are responsible for such large populations(The San Diego center provides services to 11 percent of the state 's population) that they have consumers within their local communities who they cannot assist. Thiswill greatly increase their capacity to serve those folks plus allow for the fundingof satellites in the adjoining counties. Arizona is among the most underserved states in the country. With an additional $1.3 million, Arizona will be able to fully fund existing CILs in Phoenix, Tucson,Prescott, and Yuma, plus add new CILs in Flagstaff, Sierra Vista, and the NavajoNation. The Texas SILC has identified 18 unserved and underserved areas throughout the state which they would cover with an additional $3.2 million, and Mississippi wouldturn their satellites in Tupelo, Meridian, McComb and Greenville into CILs plus cre-ate a whole new set of satellites. In other words, an increase of $25 million over each of the next three years will make it possible to fill gaps in a service system which, in spite of proven successover the last twenty years, remains pitifully inadequate.360 Centers for independent living are a great bargain for America. They keep people active and involved in their communities. They save the taxpayer money. Giventheir track record, we know that CILs will use that $75 million to double or triplethose dollars. However, even if they didn 't, think of the changes and savings. At an average cost of $1,655 per consumer for comprehensive IL services, they will servean additional 45,317 people. They will help another 1,630 individuals relocate fromnursing homes \u2014and prevent another 16,000 from entering. Funding centers for independent living makes sense: Common sense and dollars and cents. NATIONAL COUNCIL ON INDEPENDENT LIVING PROPOSED INCREMENTAL REQUEST SUMMARY The National Council on Independent Living proposes that there be three annual increases in Part C of $25 million rather than one of $75 million. Each $25 millionappropriation would be divided into two allocations. Approximately one-half of each year 's appropriation would be granted to states in $250,000 increments. (Note that $250,000 \u00d750 states = $12 12million. For appropria- tion purposes, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have traditionally been con-sidered states and the territories have received somewhat less. For the purposes ofdiscussion, we are using a figure of $125,000 for each of the four territories.) Thismeans that each state, regardless of its size or population will receive a base in-crease of $750,000 over three years. Approximately one half of the $75 million willbe appropriated to states in this manner. The remainder of each year 's appropriation, an amount somewhat less than $12 12 million because of the allocations to DC and the territories, will be granted to states based upon their percentage of the nation 's population. For discussion and projec- tion purposes, we are using the conservative figure of $1112million. As part of the appropriation process, NCIL requests that Congress attaches spending authority language regarding the disbursal of these funds, as follows: \u2014Each center for independent living (CIL) must have a base funding level of at least $250,000. Therefore, before any new centers are created, existing centersmust receive at least $250,000 in operating funds from the state and/or FederalGovernment. Satellite centers may receive somewhat less based upon the rec-ommendation of the statewide independent living council (SILC). \u2014Receipt of the additional Part C funds is contingent upon maintenance of each state 's funding effort. These additional funds are intended to supplement, not supplant existing funds generated in the state legislature for the operation ofcenters. \u2014After each center is receiving an annual minimum base funding of at least $250,000, all Title VII funds shall be distributed following the directions setforth in the State Plan for Independent Living. Attached are two identical worksheets produced in Microsoft Excel and in Word Perfect which show how the $75 million will be distributed state-by-state over threeyears. The worksheet has seven columns: \u2014A list of the states and territories; \u2014Each state 's annual distribution based upon its percentage of the nation 's popu- lation. As explained above, we are using a conservative figure of $11 12million; \u2014Each state 's distribution of $250,000, which we call equity; \u2014The 1 year total increase that each state is likely to be allotted if we receive an incremental increase of $25 million; \u2014The 3 year total increase that each state is likely to be allotted if we receive three incremental increases totaling $75 million; \u2014The funds currently allocated through Title VII Part C are in the 1999 total col- umn; \u2014The 2003 total is each state 's likely allotment if we are successful in our efforts. The 2003 total represents a combination of current (1999 total) and new (3 yeartotal) funds.

A CIL is a non-profit corporation, which assists people with significant disabilities who want to live more independently. CILs are managed and staffed by people withdisabilities, are always located in the communities they serve, and assist peoplewith all types of disabilities. How do CILs assist people? The foundation of CIL services is the peer relationship \u2014people with disabilities assisting other people with disabilities as role models, mentors, and counselors.Each center is unique because it offers services based upon the particular needs ofits community. At the same time, centers are alike in that they all offer core serv-ices: information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems advocacy,and independent living skills training. How many centers are there in the U.S.? Currently, there are 340 centers for independent living, with more than 224 sat- ellite locations. Of these, 229 centers and 44 satellites are funded through Title VII - Part C of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (as amended). A center 's service area may be one county or a dozen. According to the Rural Institute on Disabilities, CILscover an average of 5.76 counties. Today, 60 percent (1,911) of our nation 's counties receive service from a CIL.362 What role do satellites play in the CIL network? Satellites, sometimes called branch offices, are administered by an existing center and fill a critical need in the independent living network. Satellites make it possiblefor services and programs to be provided in outlying areas while avoiding the over-head of a freestanding, non-profit corporation. Some satellites have only one or twostaff while others have more to address the needs of their communities. Costs forsatellites vary, therefore, from state to state and community to community. What must CILs do to receive Title VII -Part C funds? In addition to submitting a viable application in a statewide competition, CILs must meet standards and assurances set by Congress, as well as goals and objec-tives, which address the needs of their communities. The assurances are fiscal andprogrammatic reporting requirement, while each standard has indicators of compli-ance which address the day-to-day operations of the center. Centers report annuallyon their progress and are visited periodically as part of a state and federal oversightprocess. What is the current funding level for federally funded centers? Current funding for Title VII -Part C of the Rehabilitation Act is $43,692,496. This is an average of $163,285 per center and $97,821 per satellite. Are CILs a good investment? You bet! Last year the Department of Education gathered information from 295 of the centers. In addition to responding to almost 340,000 requests for informationand referral, these centers provided over 54,000 individuals with peer counselingservices; 50,000 received assistance finding housing; 34,000 acquired personal as-sistance services; 33,500 attained transportation services; and over 54,000 individ-uals received independent living skills training. In addition, literally tens of thou-sand of individuals received dozens of other services from centers, including assist-ance in moving out of costly institutional settings such as nursing homes. Why do we need more centers for independent living and satellites? Today, the CIL network reaches less than one percent of all people with signifi- cant disabilities in the United States. While not every person with a disability needsa center 's help, there remain vast areas of the U.S. where no center exists at all. Forty percent (40 percent) or 1,230 of our nation 's counties receive no service what- soever from a CIL. Hundreds more receive only superficial coverage. How many more CILs do we need? At the current rate of coverage (5.7 counties per center), The Rural Institute on Disabilities estimates that we need at least an additional 216 centers. Some stateshave estimated that there should be at least one ''fully-funded '' center for every 500,000 persons, or an additional 185 centers nationwide. What is a ''fully-funded '' CIL? Today, CILs are woefully underfunded. As stated above, the average federally funded CIL receives approximately $162,285 to support the operations of the center.States have set funding targets ranging from $200,000 to $500,000 per center peryear. The National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) believes a center needsat least $250,000 to support day-to-day operations, meet the standards and assur-ances, and address the goals of the community. The Independent Living ResearchUtilization Program (ILRU) has found limited funding to be the most common rea-son for the fiscal collapse of centers. What level of support is needed for CILs? Centers for independent living need an additional $75 million to build a strong nationwide network of centers. This increase will bring the total budget for TitleVII-Part C to $120 million, a fraction of what is expended for other programs assist- ing significantly fewer persons. CILs have a proven record of accomplishment, dis-tinguishing themselves among consumers, advocates, and providers alike. Supportfor CILs makes good sense! PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CITY OF NEWARK , NJ Mr. Chairman: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit testimony on behalf of the City of Newark, New Jersey regarding two innovative projects that areof importance to us: (1) the Children 's Health Care Services Center and (2) the New- ark Museum Science Education Project.363 CHILDREN 'S HEALTH CARE SERVICES CENTER The Children 's Health Care Services Center will provide a coordinated approach to offering health and social services to uninsured/underinsured pregnant womenand children between the ages of 0 through 5. The City 's Department of Health and Human Services will partner with other community organizations and hospitals toprovide a full spectrum of health, social services and mental health services. There is a tremendous need in Newark for such comprehensive services. The City of Newark has been designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionas a pocket of need for children. An analysis of trends in the City of Newark revealsthat 1/5 of Newark resident births in 1996 were to teenage mothers (under age 20).Teenage mothers have accounted for 1 in 5 Newark resident births from 1989through 1996. Over one-half of Newark resident women who delivered in 1996began pre-natal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. In contrast three fourthsof all New Jersey mothers giving birth in 1996 began pre-natal care in the first tri-mester. Since 1989 the percentage of Newark mothers receiving pre-natal care inthe first trimester has generally declined for all age groups. In fact, the rate ofmothers giving birth in 1996 who received no pre-natal care was six times as highfor Newark (8.3 percent) as for the State as a whole (1.3 percent). By race, nearly12 percent of black mothers in Newark and 3 percent of white mothers received nopre-natal care. In 1996 the number of Newark resident infant deaths 80, a 14.3 percent increase over the 70 infant deaths in 1995. Notwithstanding this one year increase, the num-ber of resident infant deaths in Newark decreased from a high of 189 deaths in 1989to the current level. Neo-natal deaths have been increasing over the past 8 years,from 52 percent of the total infant deaths in 1989 to 58 percent in 1996. The leadingcause of death for infants in Newark in 1996 is low birth-weight. The second leadingcauses of death were congenital anomalies and sudden infant death syndrome. Other ailments that affect the health of Newark children include pulmonary dys- functions such as asthma and lead poisoning. As of December 31, 1998, Newark hada caseload of 1,613 children under age six with blood lead levels over 20 ug/dL. In1998 an average of 25 percent of nearly 2,000 children tested had blood lead levelsover 20 ug/dL. The objective of the Newark Children 's Health Care Services Center is to posi- tively impact on the health of Newark 's children through the development of a co- ordinated health care system that will allow the City to bring health care servicesto the community. Through the use of focus groups, the DHHS will assess and re-evaluate Newark residents use of existing services. Focus groups will be conducted to analyze barriersto services and residents utilization rates. Based upon the analysis, the DHHS willdesign the Children 's Health Care Services Center as a consumer friendly service center. At minimum, the Center will provide services that include, pre-conception coun- seling, early pregnancy testing, pre-natal care, substance abuse counseling and re-ferral services, family counseling, pediatric practice with related services includingWIC, immunization, nutritional counseling and case management services. Healtheducation will be offered to develop parenting skills and managing households. Through the centralization of services, we believe that we can increase access to the array of health and social services needed by Newark residents to raise healthychildren. The City seeks $2.5 million in Federal support for this initiative. NEWARK MUSEUM Newark is truly at a crossroad \u2014we are a City with all of the problems of many major urban centers, but we are also a City with vast potential. We have begun toturn the corner \u2014there is a renewed vitality and sense of optimism in Newark. The Newark Museum seeks $2.0 million to support its new Science Initiative Edu- cation. The City of Newark has committed $1.7 million dollars to date toward thepreparatory collections care necessary to make this initiative possible. Additionally,The Museum plans a $5 million dollar operating endowment fund based upon a pub-lic/private partnership to assure adequate on-going support, of which $1.2 millionhas been raised to date. Research has shown that the ongoing maintenance cost ofscience galleries is several multiples of that of art galleries. The plan calls for the creation of a major permanent exhibition based upon its natural science collection. The exhibition, called Making Sense of the NaturalWorld, will explore scientific phenomena through natural history specimens and liveanimals. Museum audiences will participate in mindful science learning throughstimulating and engaging experiences that integrate the collections, Dreyfuss Plane-tarium and Mini Zoo. This gallery, along with the Museum 's plan to institutionalize364 cohesive science education programs parallel to its distinguished art and culture programs, is the core of The Newark Museum Science Education Initiative. The cohesive science education at The Newark Museum will entail greater use and dissemination of their science gallery, planetarium and live animal resources,thus providing new learning opportunities for individuals, families, schools, andcommunity organizations. This initiative also allows the Museum to safeguard thethousands of scientific specimens, so critical to its success, in proper housing bothin the exhibition and in technologically advanced, environmentally appropriate be-hind-the-scenes storage. The Newark Museum is recognized as one of the nation 's leading cultural institu- tions. It is located in Newark, New Jersey 's largest city, and within Essex County, the State 's most densely populated. The Museum 's constituency is economically and ethnically diverse, reflecting the distinctive character of the city, northern New Jer-sey and the metropolitan region. In 1998, The Newark Museum served an audienceof 462,000 children and adults. The Newark Museum 's natural science collections of 74,000 specimens in the areas of geology, botany and biology are being utilized today in programs that allowfor participatory and inquiry-driven experiences, to engage visitors in meaningfulscience learning. Science-related programs draw more visitors to The Newark Mu-seum than any other offering, despite the fact that the science galleries have beenclosed for more than a decade. Realizing the opportunity to attract larger audiencesand better serve Newark and New Jersey residents, the Museum has embarked ona new science initiative. It will enable the Museum to reopen the science galleriesand builds upon the Museum 's proven track record of excellence in interdisciplinary arts and humanities programs. The Newark Museum New Science Education Initiative: Reshaping Science Edu- cation In planning the new Science Initiative, Museum staff and Trustees have been guided by the principles contained in Goals 2000 and by New Jersey 's recently adopted Core Curriculum Content Standards for K -12 education. Critical thinking, mathematical, and scientific understanding will be fostered as visitors question, ex-periment, compare, and analyze real specimens from the Museum 's science collec- tions, and participate in planetarium and Mini Zoo programs designed to effectivelycommunicate complicated and abstract science concepts. The science plan will also include a Science Resource Laboratory for teachers, which will provide them with a space to research and test curriculum ideas forhands-on activities in the natural and planetary sciences. Based on the results ofresearch conducted with Newark educators, these monthly multi-session and one-time in-service teacher professional development workshops will provide teachersopportunities to become more comfortable teaching science and meet the state-man-dated re-certification requirements. The same Science Labs will be used by schoolclasses and in after school and weekend programs to reinforce science concepts thatare introduced in Making Sense of the Natural World, the projected new exhibition. For high school students from Newark and other state urban districts, the Science Initiative calls for a Science Career Ladder. These innovative programs are designedto provide ''at-risk '' teens with critical exposure to careers in science and to teach workplace ethics and behavior. This builds upon an already successful YouthAliveprogram at the Museum. In addition, the plan will provide a Science Internship Pro-gram, which will offer students a year-long experience in scientific research, collec-tions management, and the planetary sciences at The Newark Museum. The New Natural Science Exhibition, Making Sense of the Natural World This gallery, intended primarily for a family and elementary school audience, will be one of the few in the country to combine the best of natural history museumsand science centers by marrying actual biological, geological and botanical speci-mens with hands-on, inquiry-driven activities. In this exhibit, visitors will experience the wonder of nature 's diversity and then look at collections the way scientists look at them. They will begin to learn that nat-ural history specimens individually and collectively provide volumes of informationabout science. They will understand how ordering the natural world led to the real-ization that the Earth is constantly changing and that life adapts to those changes.Moreover, they will appreciate that evidence of those changes is as close as theirown backyard. Recurring throughout the exhibit will be the concepts of bio-complexities and dy- namic geological forces as fundamentals of the natural world. The museum 's strik- ing collections will be the vehicle for explaining \u2014making sense of- these concepts as they relate to living and non-living systems, globally and locally.365 The exhibition will be divided into five sections. The first is an Introductory Gal- lery, called the Diversity Arc, in which visitors will realize that by uncovering rela-tionships within groups of specimens, scientists have been able to order and makesense of the diversity around them. Visitors will meet their video host at the firstof several stations that are located throughout the exhibit. The host is a museumscientist who will guide visitors ' observations and enhance their understanding of the exhibit 's concepts. The host is one of the ways the exhibit will depict people as part of nature and interpreters of it. It will serve to put the exhibit components intocontext for the visitor. In the second gallery, The Dynamic Earth: Forces of Change, sound and light will give visitors the feeling of being present at the beginning of the Earth. A short videowill elaborate on the formation of the planet, plate tectonics and climate. Video ani-mation will be used to communicate abstract geological concepts. Specimens will bedisplayed that illustrate the products of geological activity, climate change and gla-cial activity. Mineral and rock specimens will be chosen for the stories they can tell.Fossils, such as Glossopteris, found on today 's widely separated continents, will show how tectonic forces split the continent on which the fern once grew. Next, the visitor will encounter Life Adapts to Change, which will show the tre- mendous variety of environments on the Earth \u2014the consequences of where con- tinents and oceans are located today, and climate. Specimens from the African Sa-vannah will show how different species have adapted to a unique biome, the grass-land, through color, behavior and structure. The exhibit also contains an interactivenatural selection component explaining the process. The remainder of the exhibitwill illustrate two different kinds of adaptations to the environment: structural andbehavioral. At this junction, visitors will have the choice of either continuing to Collections: Tools of Knowledge or Diversity in Your Backyard: New Jersey Highlands. In Col-lections: Tools of Knowledge, visitors will discover that science is a dynamic, ongoingactivity that uses specimens and collections as tools to make sense of the naturalworld. In this section, visitors explore how science is actually conducted. Scientistswill tell their own story of how they collect data and analyze it, and there will beequipment which visitors can manipulate in activities designed to mimic the workthe scientists perform. For most of the population, science is an abstract art, almostlike magic. This area of the exhibit will assign the tasks of the scientist to the vis-itor, making the process of science much more concrete. The final, and largest, section is called Diversity in Your Backyard: New Jersey Highlands, which will feature a re-creation, in the form of a walk-in diorama, of anoak-hickory forest biome of the New Jersey Highlands. It is a demonstration of howand why the interdynamics of geology and biology creates an ecosystem. Using NewJersey as a backdrop, this gallery will provide specific examples of Dynamic Earthand Adapting to Change in a recreated environment of the New Jersey Highlands.This will allow visitors to apply the complex ideas introduced earlier to examplesfamiliar to them and to make sense themselves of the natural world. A tented ''field station '' will offer opportunities for hands-on activities. In closing, federal support is critical for each of these initiatives. It is my hope that the subcommittee will find them worthy of your support. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY OF NEW JERSEY The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) is the largest public health sciences university in the nation. Our statewide system is located onfive academic campuses and consists of 3 medical schools and schools of dentistry,nursing, health related professions, public health and graduate biomedical sciences.UMDNJ also comprises a University-owned acute care hospital, three core teachinghospitals, an integrated behavioral health care delivery system, a statewide systemfor managed care and affiliations with more than 200 health care and educationalinstitutions statewide. No other institution in the nation possesses the resourceswhich match our scope in higher education, health care delivery, research and com-munity service initiatives with federal, state and local entities. We appreciate the opportunity to bring to your attention our priority projects that are consistent with the mission of this committee. These projects are statewide inscope and include collaborations both within the University system and with our af-filiates. Our research projects also underscore UMDNJ 's commitment to eliminating racial disparities in health care delivery. New Jersey, with its small geographic sizeand its large diverse population, is an idea site in which to conduct research and366 develop activities that will address this important issue. The first of our priority ini- tiatives is the Child Health Institute of New Jersey: UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) has developed the Child Health Institute of New Jersey as a comprehensive biomedical research center fo-cused on the health and wellness of children. At this institute, biomedical research-ers address the prevention and cure of environmental and genetic diseases of infantsand children. The Child Health Institute is integral to the long-term plan for theenhancement of research at RWJMS in developmental genetics, particularly as it re-lates to disorders that affect a child 's development and growth, physically and func- tionally. The program will enable the medical school to expand and strengthen basicresearch efforts with clinical departments at Robert Wood Johnson University Hos-pital, in particular those involved with the new Bristol-Myers Squibb Children 's Hospital. The CHI will build on a current NIH funding base at RWJMS and its academic partners of more than $50 million with significant strengths in genetic, environ-mental and neurosciences research at the medical school and the associated jointresearch and advanced degree programs with academic institutions and the phar-maceutical industry. The Child Health Institute will focus research on the molecular and genetic mech- anisms that direct the development of human form, subsequent growth, and acquisi-tion of function. Broadly, the faculty and students will investigate disorders thatoccur during the process of development; to discover and study the genes contrib-uting to developmental disabilities and childhood diseases; to determine how genesand the environment interact to cause childhood diseases; and to identify the causesand possible avenues of treatment of cognitive disorders found among conditionssuch as mental retardation, autism and related neurological disorders. Approximately half of the admissions to children 's hospitals are for genetic dis- orders, and the majority of these are the result of genes interacting among them-selves and with the environment. Examples include autism, heart defects, diabetes and cleft lip. Babies are five times more likely to have a cleft lip if their mother carries a particular gene andsmokes during pregnancy. Mothers with this gene who don 't smoke don 't increase the risk for their child. Preventing this class of clift lips is now possible throughtesting mothers coupled with behavior modification. Despite new therapies, asthma-related problems have risen by 50 percent over the past decade with hospitalization rates 4 -5 times higher for African Americans. Ef- fective prevention and treatment will require greater understanding of the molec-ular mechanisms that elicit asthmatic attacks, and more understanding of the mo-lecular reactions mounted by cells once stimulated by environmental factors. Contin-ued exploration of the basic molecular underpinnings of injury reactions will leadto more rational methods to prevent, minimize and treat asthmatic reactions and deaths. Urban academic medical centers such as RWJMS are at the epicenter of thecurrent escalation in asthma and the Child Health Institute is well positioned toaddress this critical issue. Development of the Child Health Institute will fill a critical gap through the ex- pansion, by new recruitment, of an intellectual base upon which basic molecularprograms in child development and health will build. It is expected to cost almost$30 million for our building with an additional $10 million endowment for programs.We are requesting an appropriation of $5 million from the Federal Government tocomplement $3 million already received from the Federal Government, $18 millionraised in the private sector and $10 million we expect to raise from the State. A second priority is the Gallo Prostate Cancer Center:The Dean and Betty Gallo Prostate Cancer Center (GPCC) was established at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) with the goal of eradicating prostate cancerand improving the lives of men at risk for the disease through research, treatment,education and prevention. GPCC was founded in memory of Rep. Dean Gallo, a NewJersey Congressman who died of prostate cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage.The purpose of the GPCC is to establish a multi-disciplinary center to study all as-pects of prostate cancer and its prevention. The Cancer Institute of New Jersey isa partnership of UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and hospital affili-ates. Prostate cancer is particularly devastating in New Jersey. With the highest popu- lation density in the country, our state has one of the highest prostate cancer ratesin the nation. African-Americans diagnosed with the disease are twice as likely todie from it. To help eliminate this health disparity, GPCC is collaborating with orga-nizations such as ''100 Black Men '' in a prostate cancer initiative that will make educational programs and cancer screenings available in all 21 counties throughoutthe State.367 GPCC unites a team of outstanding researchers and clinicians who are committed to high quality basic research, translation of innovative research to the clinic, excep-tional patient care, and GPCC efforts will be focused in four major areas: Basic,Clinical and Translational Research; Comprehensive Patient Care; Epidemiologyand Cancer Control; and Education and Outreach. GPCC scientists will investigate the molecular, genetic and environmental factors that are responsible for prostate cancer initiation and progression. Our researcherswill develop appropriate model systems that will facilitate the design and implemen-tation of novel strategies for prevention and treatment. GPCC will foster multi-dis-ciplinary efforts that will lead to the effective translation of basic research, im-proved patient care and novel clinical trials. Another goal of the GPCC is to under-stand the etiology of prostate cancer susceptibility and to find effective modalitiesfor prevention of the disease. The Cancer Institute of New Jersey has received $5 million in federal funding over the last two years for the Gallo Prostate Cancer Center. This important fund-ing has enabled us to establish a world-class program in prostate cancer researchthat includes publications in prestigious national journals. CINJ has used its find-ings to leverage additional research dollars for individual investigators from suchagencies as CapCure, the Department of Defense and several private foundations.Top investigators have been recruited to initiate programs in prostate cancer re-search through our education and pilot grant programs. Additional federal funding is being sought this year to build on our basic research in prostate cancer and to support the development of technological approaches totest new methods of prevention and treatment. This additional funding will alsoallow us to enhance our treatment of patients with prostate cancer through severalnew clinical trials for patients at all stages of the disease. We seek $2 million infederal funding to enhance the research, education and cancer care programs of theGallo Prostate Cancer Center at our New Brunswick facility and to expand theseprograms statewide. Another priority this year is to establish a statewide General Clinical Research Center: New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation and hosts some 175 healthcare companies within its borders. Yet, New Jersey has failed to attract largeamounts of clinical research dollars because there is no General Clinical ResearchCenter within the state. As a consequence, patients in the state lack adequate access to the latest in clin- ical research studies. UMDNJ is well positioned to reverse this trend and requestsfederal funding to provide the infrastructure to compete more effectively for bothNIH and pharmaceutical research dollars. The UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Clinical Research Center (CRC) is a 16-bed dedicated clinical research facility located in New Brunswick, New Jersey. New Brunswick is known as the ''health care city '' and is home to many of the state 's major pharmaceutical firms. Robert Wood Johnson Medical School is con- sistently ranked among the most diverse in the nation. As such, the University can make significant contributions in the clinical research training of under-represented minorities enrolled in medical, nursing, dental, phar-macy, public health, dietary and other advanced degree programs across the state.The medical school is home to the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the Child HealthInstitute of New Jersey and other nationally recognized centers of excellence. Weare well positioned to uphold NIH policies regarding the inclusion of women, minori-ties and children in clinical research studies. Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has a well-established research environment that provides insight into the basic mechanisms of disease, innovative approachesto patient care that leads to the etiology and pathogenesis of disease, and patientcare outcomes. Scientists in the basic and clinical departments continue to make na-tionally recognized contributions in their areas of expertise. Researchers within themedical school have been in the forefront of medical discoveries, including advancesin Parkinson 's disease, Lyme disease, disorders of sexual dysfunction, epilepsy, pros- tate cancer, psoriasis, cardiology, and obesity. In addition to broad-based programsat RWJMS ' three campuses in Piscataway, New Brunswick and Camden, the CRC is committed to expanding its research programs by collaborating with other schoolswithin the UMDNJ system as well as with affiliated institutions. This includes: The UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) located in Newark is developing a Clinical Research Center on its campus. Once established, both Centers will worktogether to provide the infrastructure to optimize clinical research across the state.The UMDNJ-New Jersey Dental School (NJDS) has outstanding research in bio-materials and a nationally recognized dental training program. The UMDNJ-Schoolof Health Related Professions (SHRP) has a research team in its nutrition program368 that currently collaborates with the CRC at RWJMS. The UMDNJ-School of Osteo- pathic Medicine located in Stratford in southern New Jersey, the UMDNJ-School ofNursing, with statewide nursing programs and the UMDNJ-School of Public Healthprovide additional opportunities for collaboration. Additionally, UMDNJ is affiliated with the Veterans Administration Health Care system in New Jersey and already collaborates with the VA on many initiatives. Wewould look forward to a partnership with the VA to provide clinical research studiesto this large and diverse patient population. UMDNJ is requesting $1.7 million through an NIH grant to develop a General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) that will link all clinical research activities acrossour statewide campuses and allow us to expand these activities to affiliated partnerssuch as the VA HealthCare System in New Jersey. The opportunity exists to builda clinical research organization that would be at the cutting edge of new medicalpractices. Collaborations will result in a powerful unit that can organize medical ex-perts and patients in response to federally and industrially sponsored trials of newtherapies. Federal participation is needed to support a single network of clinical re-search and training programs throughout the state that will provide the impetus forthe designation of our statewide program as a General Clinical Research Center. Our final priority is the establishment of a Center for BioDefense:In considering the threat of biological weapons use, the New York/New Jersey area is a prime target. UMDNJ is well poised to expand several current areas ofexpertise in the national response to this threat. UMDNJ 's Center for Education and Training (CET) is the nation 's foremost pro- gram in education and training concerning chemical threats. The Center has pro-vided hazardous materials training to more than 175,000 individuals, including po-lice, firefighters and health care personnel. Preparing emergency response personnelfor chemical and biological incidents is an extension of the Center 's existing exper- tise. UMNDJ has several Level I and Level II Trauma Centers within its statewide system. A crucial component of the trauma network is the state 's helicopter trauma service linking the northern and southern regions of the State. Members of theUMDNJ Emergency Response Team participated in a federally-sponsored ''Weapons of Mass Destruction '' education program last year. A number of laboratories in our system are engaged in rapid methods of detection of virulent agents with particular emphasis on the most dangerous multi-drug re- sistant species. The molecular basis of drug resistance is the focus of our labora-tories, as well as the establishment of large libraries of clinical strains available forepidemiological and other studies. Many of our faculty are advisors to the U.S. Government and serve on various committees and advisory panels. Our researchers are studying the effects of expo-sure to a variety of chemical and organic agents. UMDNJ has considerable expertisein analysis of genotoxic effects of radiation, toxic chemicals and other agents. The University 's Newark campus is an internationally renowned center for the identification, treatment, and basic research of TB and other emerging and re-emerging pathogens. UMDNJ is a founding partner in the International Center forPublic Health in Science Park, Newark. The establishment of the Center for Emerg-ing Pathogens at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School will add another layer ofexpertise in the analysis of a number of pathogens. Gene chip technology is a recent, cutting-edge technology enabling the simulta- neous analysis of thousands of DNA sequences. Recent state funding has led to theformation of the Center for Applied Genetics at UMDNJ. In the context of a biologi-cal weapons threat, new chips will be designed displaying sequences representinga panel of potential agents for rapid screening and identification. Additional funding of $2.5 milllion will enable UMDNJ to provide a comprehen- sive statewide program ranging from our nationally acclaimed training ability in thepublic health arena to internationally recognized expertise in infectious diseasebasic research. PREPARED STATEMENT OF NEWYORK UNIVERSITY Mr.Chairman: Thank you for allowing me to submit this testimony for the Pro- moting healthy lifestyles, eliminating disparities in oral health on the basis of raceand ethnicity, and removing barriers to health care access are important prioritiesfor the New York University College of Dentistry. It is therefore a matter of urgencyfor the College to undertake major renovations to modernize its patient-care facili-ties.369 The NYU College of Dentistry has been in existence for 135 years. NYU educates more than eight percent of the nation 's dental graduates, making it the largest den- tal school in the United States. It is also the nation 's largest provider of comprehen- sive preventive, primary, and specialty oral health care at one site, as well as amajor Medicaid provider and safety net for free or low-cost care to the uninsuredand working poor. NYU also provides the nation 's most extensive private dental health outreach, preventive education, and screening programs that serve public schools, day carecenters, Head Start programs, handicapped facilities, hospitals, and homeless shel-ters. Indeed, last summer over 1,000 New Yorkers took part in a College-sponsoredfree oral-cancer screening as part of a national effort to alert Americans about the dangers of oral cancer. With the heavy, 24 hour-a-day, 365 days-a-year usage of the NYU dental clinics and the need to keep pace with changing technologies and equipment, the NYU Col-lege of Dentistry has launched a major capital project to refurbish and upgrade itsclinical facilities to ensure that patients will be treated in an environment that pro-motes their optimal health, safety, and comfort. With 565 clinical operatories (treat-ment facilities) serving the public on a daily basis, the College seeks to upgrade 256of its most heavily used and antiquated operatories which are located on four floorsof its eleven-story structure. Recognizing that the clinics are the heart of the institution, NYU is requesting $5 million over three years to renovate and modernize the clinics and labs on thesefour floors currently serving the oral health needs of a vast number of needy NewYorkers. WHO ARE OUR PATIENTS ? The NYU College of Dentistry has a long tradition of providing comprehensive, low-cost dental services to people who are unable to afford private dentistry, includ-ing many new immigrants. Each year NYU 's dental clinics treat tens of thousands of poor and low-income New Yorkers who have no other place to turn for dentalcare. The NYU College of Dentistry draws the largest portion of its patient popu-lation from New York City 's largely Hispanic Lower East Side, which is a federally- designated dental health professional shortage area (HPSA), and has many patientsfrom other medical/dental HPSAs in Manhattan, including Chinatown, East Har-lem, Central/West Harlem, and Washington Heights/Inwood, as well as shortageareas in Brooklyn. In all, the NYU dental clinics attract the most multiethnic, multicultural popu- lation in the nation, as evidenced by the fact that: \u201465 percent of patients are minority Americans, primarily African Americans, members of Hispanic subgroups, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Ameri-cans; \u201430 percent of patients are senior citizens; \u201410 percent of patients are children; \u201470,000 of our 250,000 visits annually are made by Medicaid recipients; \u201415,000 people receive emergency care every year; \u20145,000 emergency patients are treated free of charge each year, and since the av- erage cost of a routine visit to the NYU dental clinics is presently $43.00, com-pared to $360 to $1,100 for a typical hospital emergency room visit, this is ex-tremely cost-efficient care; \u201410,000 school children annually visit the NYU pediatric dentistry clinic; and \u20142,500 children receive dental services annually through the Head Start pro- gram, both through a three day-a-week busing program which brings young-sters to the College and through on-site care in their neighborhoods, making theNYU College of Dentistry the largest Head Start provider of dental services inthe nation. In addition to the Head Start busing program, the College buses children daily from local public schools to the College for care, and conducts a busing program forelderly adults in cooperation with local social service agencies. The College has alsoadded, at its own expense, a state-of-the-art mobile dental van with four dental sta-tions to expand its outreach effort on behalf of poor children who have been severelyimpacted by the dramatic decrease in the availability of publicly-funded, pediatricoral health resources. It is anticipated that the mobile dental clinic program will provide more than 1,500 patient visits each year, consisting of primary dental care and/or preventiveservices to preschool and school-age children ages 4 -13 from poor, minority, and im- migrant families. Additionally, staff members inform low-income families of theireligibility for the dental, prescription, and other health benefits available to their370 children through the Children 's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. Moreover, since the dental van is staffed in part by minority Americans, including an African-American pediatric dentist, children who visit the van are exposed to role modelsfor health profession careers. INSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION The NYU College of Dentistry 's leadership in the health care arena has been rec- ognized through grants for innovative pediatric dentistry programs, a MedicaidManaged Care Provider Grant from the New York State Department of Health todevelop a model for school-based dental services, and significant funding from theNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH). The latter includes major support, obtained in collaboration with the Forsyth Den- tal Center of Boston, to establish a Minority Oral Health Research Center at NYUto improve the oral health status of minorities and increase the number of minori-ties working in the health professions. In addition, the College has received wide-spread acclaim for initiating the Consortium for the Prevention and Early Detectionof Oral Cancer. THE COST OF DENTAL EDUCATION AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY The high cost of dental equipment and materials, combined with the lack of a hos- pital infrastructure, has long made the cost of dental education the highest of anyprofession. As a private dental school, the NYU College of Dentistry is often ableto pursue newer, more effective therapeutic approaches and to transfer these ad-vances to practice with more freedom and speed than is possible among some of ourpublic counterparts. However, tuition for dental education is necessarily greater foran independent academic dental institution. For those of us who make our livesamong students, it is therefore never easy to increase tuition. But although we haveredoubled our efforts at cost containment, we recognize that there is a limit beyondwhich we cannot go without sacrificing the quality of our academic and patient careprograms. As a result, NYU 's tuition for the 1999 -2000 academic year is $36,886 for each year in the four-year D.D.S. program, making tuition at the NYU Collegeof Dentistry the highest in the nation. The irony is that although tuition at NYUCD is very expensive, it is nevertheless the most cost effective dental education in the nation. In fact, according to theAmerican Association of Dental Schools, the amount of money it takes to educatea dental student for one year at NYU \u2014approximately $40,000 \u2014is substantially below the national mean of $60,000, and less than half of that at some state-sup-ported institutions. A chief reason for our high tuition is the prevailing poverty of the population we treat, which effectively results in NYU dental students subsidizing the charity care.We provide approximately $4 million in free dental care annually \u2014through tuition. THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITY The NYU College of Dentistry does not currently possess the infrastructure to support the treatment needs of its patient community, including the introduction ofnew technologies. To put it another way, current clinical facilities impede our abilityto provide an optimal patient care environment for the thousands of patients whoseek treatment daily. Physically, our clinics are bursting at the seams. Much of the existing clinical care space is over 35 years old and is cramped and out-of-date. To meet appropriatestandards of care, this infrastructure must be redesigned immediately. The averagesize of an operatory is approximately 65 square feet. In order to provide optimal pa-tient care involving a dentist and a dental assistant, each operatory should be 100 square feet. Addressing these concerns will require extensive renovation and mod-ernization of 256 of the existing 565 dental operatories and development of newspace for additional clinical facilities to keep pace with the growth of our patientpool. New York University College of Dentistry 's health promotion initiatives, its pro- grams to expand access to mainstream oral health benefits for our neediest citizens,and its reputation as a force for social action in medically-underserved areas allplace the College in an excellent position to advance the national agenda for healthcare. Accordingly, we believe that support for renovated and modernized patientcare facilities at the College is an appropriate focus for Congress. The communitycare goals of the NYU College of Dentistry are entirely consistent with the commit-ment to make health care an equal opportunity, available to all, regardless of finan-cial means, age, or racial or ethnic group. Our dental clinics also greatly relieve the371 pressure on an already over-burdened public health system, and in emphasizing early, preventive and comprehensive treatment, save health care costs down theroad. With help in creating clinical facilities that foster the well being of our commu- nity, the NYU College of Dentistry can continue to meet the needs of new Ameri-cans and of native racial and ethnic minorities, and to alleviate the disproportionateoral health burden of poor and minority Americans. Thank you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL AND THE LOVELACE RESPIRATORY RESEARCH INSTITUTE Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I appreciate the opportunity to present testimony on behalf of the University of Miami School of Medicine, theLovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, NM and our jointly pro-posed Tobacco Addiction Risk Assessment Research Center (TARARC) which will bedevoted to the reduction of health risks associated with addiction to tobacco andother harmful substances. We deeply appreciate your leadership, Mr. Chairman. Ifully understand and appreciate that you and your congressional colleagues facemany constraints and challenges and we appreciate your willingness to devote spe-cial attention to the important public health issues related to tobacco addiction andits many harmful consequences. As the former campaign manager for Tom Luken,who served on the Hill for over 18 years, I was personally impressed by the dedica-tion, commitment and hard work that all of you put into serving this great countryof ours. We feel strongly that the unique challenges you face have never been great-er than at this point in history, but there has also never been a greater opportunityto apply science-based solutions to solving the riddle of addiction and greatly im-proving public health by eliminating or reducing its negative health consequences. As you may know, approximately 20 percent of all deaths are associated with to- bacco smoking. Tobacco kills more people than murder, AIDS, suicide, illicit druguse and automobile accidents combined. The medical consequences of tobacco addic-tion include the three leading causes of death: cardiovascular disease, cancer andcerebrovascular disease and its related medical costs are astronomical. For example,in Florida in 1996, tobacco-related Medicaid pay-outs were estimated to be between$264,000,000 and $365,000,000. However, tobacco use is also the most preventablecause of disease and death. We now know that nicotine is at least as addictive as cocaine or heroin. Recent studies even suggest that nicotine interacts with other drugs of abuse, that it rein-forces craving and increases intake of cocaine and other drugs. However, nicotineis a special case of addiction because tobacco is legally sold and its use is not prohib-ited among adults. In spite of the evidence that nicotine is an addictive drug whichaffects the brain in the same way that illicit substances such as opiates and cocainedo, nicotine dependence has not been considered substance abuse. The University of Miami School of Medicine and the Lovelace Respiratory re- search Institute are uniquely qualified to address the issue of addiction to tobaccoand other harmful substances. University of Miami faculty members have signifi-cant expertise and experience in many relevant areas including substance abuse,evaluation research, community research, behavioral medicine, disease prevention,treatment of tobacco-related diseases, basic science research, epidemiology and pub-lic health. The University of Miami 's Tobacco Research Evaluation and Coordinating Center (RECC) has been responsible for the evaluation of Florida 's Tobacco Pilot Program. Other strengths in the area of biomedical research and treatment includePediatric Oncology and the Batchelor Children 's Research Center, the Pediatric En- vironmental Respiratory Center, as well as the proposed Tobacco Addiction Risk As-sessment Research Center (TARARC). The Batchelor Children 's Research Center is currently under construction and will provide a state-of-the-art clinical and researchfacility that will be one of the nation 's largest devoted to children 's health. It is de- signed to foster collaboration among researchers and clinicians and will include afocus on cancer as well as many other diseases. It, along with the Pediatric Environ-mental Respiratory Center, will provide an appropriate and ideal setting for thestudy of tobacco-related, maternal-child health issues as well as a study of the im-pact of second-hand (environmental) smoke on the respiratory health of children.The Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute has undertaken some of the leadingstudies of animal models of smoking and the role of nicotine in immune function. The proposed Tobacco Addiction Risk Assessment Research Center will be devoted to the study of unrecognized health risks associated with addiction to tobacco prod-ucts, predominantly in minority populations who may be uniquely susceptible to im-372 mune suppression, increased fetal HIV transmission, increased respiratory inflam- mation and infection, synergistic negative health effects with other abused sub-stances and impaired immunological function of non-smoking family members ex-posed at home or in utero. The Center will use animal models to study disease proc-esses prior to assessing the equivalent condition in human subjects. Finally, theCenter will address the culturally relevant behaviors that underlie tobacco use inhuman populations. The importance of the Center lies in its bridging the use of ani- mal models to the study of disease in people and the subsequent formulation andtesting of medical and behavioral interventions to improve or eliminate the negativehealth consequences associated with tobacco use. Of further interest is the oppor-tunity to compare two different Hispanic populations that differ in genetics and cul-tural characteristics (Mexican in new Mexican and Cuban in Florida) as well ascharacterizing African-American and Caucasian populations. Creating the TobaccoAddiction Risk Assessment Research Center represents a unique opportunity tobuild upon the rich diversity of Florida 's population, the commitment of the Univer- sity of Miami School of Medicine to the community and our experience with behav-ioral interventions, particularly related to tobacco use and substance abuse. Floridais an ideal location for the proposed Center, being a bellwether state for social, de-mographic and epidemiological changes that the rest of the nation is currently fac-ing or will face in the near future. Our extensive experience working with tradition-ally hard-to-reach populations such as minority substance abusers will ensure thatthe interventions we develop will be culturally and linguistically appropriate and ac-ceptable. We also have a means for rapid dissemination of effective prevention andintervention within minority communities through an already developed communityhealth care coalition. The goals of the Tobacco Addiction Risk Assessment Research Center are to:\u2014Identify risk behaviors which lead to tobacco use and substance abuse. \u2014Reduce the incidence and prevalence of tobacco use and that of other addictive substances. \u2014Reduce the development of and suffering from disease associated with tobacco and other addictive substances through research and interventions in the basicsciences, clinical medicine and epidemiological research. \u2014Reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. \u2014Develop, test and apply science-based community interventions to achieve these goals. We know that intervention with effective prenatal programs saves a tremendous amount of money that otherwise would be spent on healthcare after birth. The samecan be said for early intervention at other points in the life cycle. My own personalresearch experience with the early detection of breast cancer through the screeningof over 30,000 medically underserved women has demonstrated that early detectionand intervention saves dollars as well as lives. As is true for cancer, we already pos-sess a great deal of knowledge that could be used to develop interventions and pre-vention strategies for addiction to tobacco and other harmful substances. Applyingthis knowledge could effect savings of billions of dollars for state, local and nationalgovernments. Equally important, the quality of life will be improved for individuals,families and their communities as well as society at large. It is becoming ever moreapparent that we, as a society, cannot afford to ignore prevention and early inter-vention strategies since crisis management is far too costly in terms of quality oflife and unnecessary expenditures of dollars. By achieving our stated goals, the Tobacco Addiction Risk Assessment Research Center will be in a perfect position to (1) improve quality of life, (2) decrease mor-bidity and mortality, (3) increase survival and (4) significantly decrease health careexpenditures by applying effective prevention and intervention. I thank you verymuch for your valuable time and stand ready to serve you in any way possible. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR STATE COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAMS The National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP) thanks this committee for its continued support of the Community Services BlockGrant (CSBG) and seeks an appropriation of $630 million for the state grant portionof the CSBG. The amount appropriated for the state grant portion in fiscal year2000 was $530 million. We are requesting an increase of $100 million in order toexpand the efforts of the Community Services Network in assisting those familiesremaining on welfare with the intensive services they need to transition to work andto assist low-income workers in remaining at work through supportive services suchas transportation and child care. These additional funds will also assist states in373 developing services in the four percent of counties that are not currently served by the CSBG. NASCSP is the national association that represents state administrators of the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), and state directors of the Department ofEnergy 's Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program. BACKGROUND The states believe the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is a unique block grant that has successfully devolved decision making to the local level. Federallyfunded with oversight at the state level, the CSBG has maintained a local networkof over 1,000 agencies which coordinate over $5 billion in federal, state, local andprivate resources each year. Operating in more than 96 percent of counties in thenation and serving over 9 million low-income persons, local agencies, known asCommunity Action Agencies (CAAs), provide services based on the characteristics ofpoverty in their communities. For one town this might mean providing job place-ment and retention services, for another developing affordable housing. In ruralareas it might mean providing access to health services or developing a rural trans-portation system. Since its inception, the CSBG has shown how partnerships between states and local agencies benefit citizens in each state. We believe it should be looked to as amodel of how the Federal Government can best promote self-sufficiency for low-in-come persons in a flexible, decentralized, non-bureaucratic and accountable way. Long before the creation of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, the CSBG was setting the standard for private-public partnerships thatcould work to the betterment of local communities and low-income residents. Familyoriented, while promoting economic development and individual self-sufficiency, theCSBG relies on an existing and experienced community-based service delivery sys-tem of CAAs and other non-profit organizations to produce results for its clients. MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICES NETWORK Locally Directed. \u2014Tri-partite boards of directors guide CAAs. These boards con- sist of one-third elected officials, one-third low-income persons and one-third rep-resentatives from the private sector. The boards are responsible for establishing pol-icy and approving business plans of the local agencies. Since these boards representa cross-section of the local community, they guarantee that CAAs will be responsiveto the needs of their community. Adaptability. \u2014CAAs have demonstrated success in moving persons from welfare to work and in assisting low-income families in achieving self-sufficiency. CAAs pro-vide a flexible local presence that governors have mobilized to deal with emergingpoverty issues. Leveraging Capacity. \u2014For every CSBG dollar they receive, CAAs leverage nearly $3.50 in non-federal resources (state, local, and private) to coordinate efforts thatimprove the self-sufficiency of low-income persons and lead to the development ofthriving communities. Volunteer Mobilization. \u2014CAAs mobilize volunteers in large numbers. In fiscal year 1997, the most recent year for which data are available, the CAAs elicitednearly 27 million hours of volunteer efforts, the equivalent of almost 13,000 full-time employees. Using the minimum wage, these volunteer hours are valued atmore than $139 million. Emergency Response .\u2014CAAs are utilized by federal and state emergency per- sonnel as a front line resource to deal with emergency situations such as floods, hur-ricanes and economic downturns. They are also relied on by citizens in their commu-nity to deal with individual family hardships, such as house fires or other emer-gencies. Accountable .\u2014The federal Office of Community Services, state CSBG offices and CAAs have worked closely to develop a results-oriented management and account-ability (ROMA) system. Through this system, individual agencies determine localpriorities within six goals for CSBG and report on the outcomes that they achievedin their communities. The statutory goal of the CSBG is to ameliorate the effects of poverty while at the same time working within the community to eliminate the causes of poverty.The primary goal of every CAA is self-sufficiency for its clients. Helping families be-come self-sufficient is a long-term process that requires multiple resources. This iswhy the partnership of federal, state, local and private enterprise has been so vitalto the successes of the CAAs.374 WHO DOES THE CSBG SERVE ? National data compiled by NASCSP show that the CSBG serves a broad segment of low-income persons, particularly those who are not being reached by other pro-grams and are not being served by welfare programs. Based on the most recentlyreported data, \u201467 percent have incomes at or below the poverty level; 44 percent have incomes below 75 percent of the poverty guidelines. In 1997, the poverty level for a fam-ily of three was $13,330. \u2014Only 38 percent of adults have a high school diploma. \u201437 percent of all client families are ''working poor '' and have wages or unem- ployment benefits as income. \u201425 percent depend on pensions and Social Security and are therefore poor, former workers. \u201423 percent receive cash assistance from TANF. \u201460 percent of families assisted have children under 18 years of age. WHAT DO LOCAL CSBG AGENCIES DO ? Since Community Action Agencies operate in rural areas as well as in urban areas, it is difficult to describe a typical Community Action Agency. However, onething that is common to all is the goal of self-sufficiency for all of their clients.Reaching this goal may mean providing daycare for a struggling single mother asshe completes her General Educational Development (GED) certificate, movesthrough a community college course and finally is on her own supporting her familywithout federal assistance. It may mean assisting a recovering substance abuser ashe seeks employment. Many of the Community Action Agencies ' clients are persons who are experiencing a one-time emergency. Others have lives of chaos broughtabout by many overlapping forces \u2014a divorce, sudden death of a wage earner, ill- ness, lack of a high school education, closing of a local factory or the loss of familyfarms. CAAs provide access to a variety of opportunities for their clients. Although they are not identical, most will provide some if not all of the services listed below: \u2014employment and training programs \u2014transportation and child care for low-income workers \u2014individual development accounts \u2014micro business development help for low-income entrepreneurs \u2014a variety of crisis and emergency safety net services \u2014local community and economic development projects \u2014housing and weatherization services \u2014Head Start \u2014nutrition programs \u2014family development programs CSBG funds many of these services directly. Even more importantly, CSBG is the core funding which holds together a local delivery system able to respond effectivelyand efficiently, without a lot of red tape, to the needs of individual low-incomehouseholds as well as to broader community needs. Without the CSBG, local agen-cies would not have the capacity to work in their communities developing local fund-ing, private donations and volunteer services and running programs of far greatersize and value than the actual CSBG dollars they receive. CAAs manage a host of other federal, state and local programs which makes it possible to provide a one-stop location for persons whose problems are usually multi-faceted. CAAs manage the Head Start program in many communities. Using theirunique position in the community, CAAs recruit additional volunteers, bring in localschool department personnel, tap into religious groups for additional help, coordi-nate child care and bring needed health care services to Head Start centers. Inmany states they also manage the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program(LIHEAP), raising additional funds from utilities for this vital program. CAAs oftenadminister the Weatherization Assistance Program and are able to mobilize fundsfor additional work on residences not directly related to energy savings that maykeep a low-income elderly couple in their home. CAAs also coordinate the Weather- ization Assistance Program with the Community Development Block Grant programto stretch federal dollars and provide a greater return for tax dollars invested. Theyalso administer the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition program as wellas job training programs, substance abuse programs, transportation programs, do-mestic violence and homeless shelters, food pantries, as well as gardening and can-ning programs.375 EXAMPLES OF CSBG AT WORK CAAs in many states have been working diligently to support families receiving cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) blockgrant. The CAAs and the state CSBG offices have been developing methods of cre-ating an effective transition from welfare to work for families. In Illinois, all 36 Community Action Agencies are providing their outreach work- ers with training and certification in Family and Community Development. This isa joint effort of Iowa State University and Southern Illinois University (SIU) to de-velop certification standards. SIU provides three hours of course credits for personswho successfully complete this program. Illinois now has over 500 people certifiedwithin its 36 CAAs. These individuals will spend more staff time providing com-prehensive assistance to each low-income person to help them become self-sufficient.At first this expanded effort will cost more, but will produce lasting results in thelong-term. Additionally all 36 CAAs have entered into performance contracts with the Illinois Department of Public Aid to assist welfare recipients who are now ''on the clock '' as far as finding jobs before their welfare benefits lapse. When an agency places awelfare recipient in a job whose salary is above 125 percent of the official povertyguidelines and has benefits, the agency is paid $1,200. They are paid $1,000 foreach successful placement in a job whether or not it has benefits or has a salarythat is equal to 125 percent of the poverty guideline. The Community and EconomicDevelopment Association of Cook County (CEDA) is using these funds for job cre-ation. In Pennsylvania, community development has been a major focus. For example, Montgomery County Development Commission opened the CADCOM Micro Enter-prise Resource Center (CMERC). The purpose of the center is to nurture start-upand emerging small business. The center provides a six-week training course,hands-on management assistance, access to shared office equipment, flexible leasesand expandable space. In its first year, the program successfully started three busi-nesses. In New Hampshire, CSBG funds are being used for alcohol and drug rehabilita- tion programs for welfare recipients to assist them in staying drug free and in secur-ing and keeping jobs. To recapitulate: The CSBG provides a community-based service delivery system. Each local organization, through its local board of directors, establishes prioritiesand serves its community and low-income residents through programs designed anddelivered locally in partnership with state and local governments, businesses, civicand religious groups and others. The CSBG leverages resources that are far in ex-cess of the appropriations it receives. Additionally, nearly 27 million hours of volun-teer services are contributed to CAAs annually. CSBG agencies have used the in-creased funds they received for the last two years to continue their activities thatlead to self-sufficiency and have become integrally involved in the implementationof TANF in most states across the nation. Those families who remain on welfarehave substantially greater impediments to successfully becoming self sufficient, anincrease in the CSBG will make it possible to meet these special needs, while stillhelping working poor families remain in the workforce. NASCSP therefore urges this committee to provide an increase that factors in in- flation and to fund the CSBG grant to the states at $630 million. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS On behalf of the nearly 38,000 clinically practicing physician assistants in the United States, the American Academy of Physician Assistants is pleased to submitcomments on fiscal year 2001 appropriations for Physician Assistant (PA) educationprograms that are authorized through Title VII of the Public Health Service Act. A member of the Coalition for Health Funding (CHF), the American Academy of Physician Assistants supports the CHF recommendation to appropriate $37.7 billionfor the Public Health Service in fiscal year 2001. The Academy is also a memberof the Health Professions and Nursing Coalition (HPNEC) and supports the HPNEC recommendation to provide at least $335 million to support the Title VII and VIIIprograms in fiscal year 2001. The Academy believes that a 10 percent increase infunding for the Title VII health professions programs is well justified. The programsare essential to the development and training of primary health care professionalsand contribute to the nation 's overall efforts to increase access to care by promoting health care delivery in medically underserved communities. The Academy is very concerned that the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget request once again proposes to eliminate funding for the primary care medicine and376 dentistry programs, through which physician assistant educational programs receive support. We wish to thank the Members of this Subcommittee for your historicalrole in supporting funding for the health professions programs, and we hope thatwe can count on your support for these important programs in fiscal year 2001. OVERVIEW OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT (PA) EDUCATION As many Subcommittee Members are aware, PA programs provide students with a primary care education that prepares them to practice medicine with physiciansupervision. The first PA program was started at Duke University approximately30 years ago, and today there are 120 accredited PA educational programs. Physician assistant programs are located at schools of medicine or health sciences, universities, teaching hospitals, and the Armed Services. All PA educational pro-grams are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Edu-cation Programs upon recommendation by the Accreditation Review Committee forPA Education. Prior to admission, the typical PA student has a bachelor 's degree and 45 months of health care experience. The most common prior health experience of PA studentsinvolves pre-hospital care, such as emergency medical technicians or paramedics. Other students come from backgrounds in nursing, allied health technologies, men-tal health fields, and social work. The typical PA program consists of 111 weeks of instruction. The first phase of the program consists of intensive classroom and laboratory study, providing stu-dents with an in-depth understanding of the medical sciences. More than 400 hoursin classroom and laboratory instruction are devoted to the basic sciences, with over70 hours in pharmacology, more than 149 hours in behavioral sciences, and morethan 535 hours of clinical medicine. The second year of PA education consists of clinical rotations. On average, stu- dents devote more than 2,000 hours or 50 -55 weeks to clinical education, divided between primary care medicine and various specialties, including family medicine,internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, surgery and surgical spe-cialties, internal medicine subspecialties, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. Dur-ing clinical rotations, PA students work directly under the supervision of physicianpreceptors, participating in the full range of patient care activities, including patientassessment and diagnosis, development of treatment plans, patient education, andcounseling. Physician assistant education is competency based. After graduation from an ac- credited PA program, the physician assistant must pass a national certifying exam-ination jointly developed by the National Board of Medical Examiners and the inde-pendent National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. To maintaincertification, PAs must log 100 continuing medical education credits over a two-yearcycle and reregister every two years. Also to maintain certification, PAs must takea recertification exam every six years. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PRACTICE Physician assistants are licensed health care professionals educated to practice medicine as delegated by and with the supervision of a physician. In all states ex-cept Mississippi, physicians may delegate to PAs those medical duties that are with-in the physician 's scope of practice and the PA 's training and experience, and are allowed by law. A physician assistant provides health care services that were traditionally only performed by a physician. Duties include, but are not limited to, performing physicalexaminations, diagnosing and treating illnesses, ordering and interpreting labora-tory tests, suturing wounds, assisting in surgery, providing patient education andcounseling, and making rounds in nursing homes and hospitals. Forty-six states, theDistrict of Columbia, and Guam authorize physicians to delegate prescriptive privi-leges to the PAs they supervise. PAs are located in almost all health care settings and in every medical and sur- gical specialty. Fourteen percent of all PAs practice in rural areas where they maybe the only full-time providers of care (state laws stipulate the conditions for remotesupervision by a physician). Approximately twenty percent of PAs work in urbanand inner city areas. The majority of PAs are in primary care. Nearly one-quarterpractice in surgical specialties. Seventy percent of PAs practice in outpatient set-tings. In 1999 an estimated 154 million patient visits were made to PAs and approxi- mately 196 million medications were prescribed or recommended.377 CRITICAL ROLE OF THE TITLE VII , PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT , PROGRAMS A growing number of Americans lack access to primary care, either because they are uninsured, underinsured, or they live in a community with an inadequate sup-ply or distribution of providers. The growth in the uninsured U.S. population in-creased from approximately 32 million in the early 1990s to nearly 45 million today.Simultaneously, the number of medically underserved communities continues torise, from 1,949 in 1986 to 2,900 today. The role of the Title VII programs is to alleviate these problems by supporting access to quality, affordable, and cost-effective care in areas of our country that aremost in need of health care services, specifically rural and urban underserved com-munities. This is accomplished through the support of educational programs thattrain more health professionals in fields experiencing shortages, improve the geo-graphic distribution of health professionals, and increase access to care in under-served communities. The Title VII programs are the only federal education programs that are designed to address the supply and distribution imbalances in the health professions. Sincethe establishment of Medicare, the costs of physician residencies, nurses and someallied health professions training has been paid through Graduate Medical Edu-cation (GME) funding. However, GME has never been available to support PA edu-cation. More importantly, GME was not intended to generate a supply of providerswho are willing to work in the nation 's medically underserved communities. That is the purpose of the Title VII Public Health Service Act Programs, which supportsuch initiatives as loans and scholarships for disadvantaged students, scholarshipsfor students with exceptional financial need, centers of excellence to recruit andtrain minority and disadvantaged students, and interdisciplinary initiatives in geri-atric care and rural health care. TITLE VII SUPPORT OF PA EDUCATION PROGRAMS Targeted federal support for PA education programs is currently authorized through section 747 of the Public Health Service Act. The program was reauthorizedin the 105th Congress through the Health Professions Education Partnerships Actof 1998, Public Law 105 -392, which streamlined and consolidated the federal health professions education programs. Support for PA education is now considered withinthe broader context of training in primary care medicine and dentistry. Public Law 105 -392 reauthorized awards and grants to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine, as well as colleges and universities, to plan, develop, and oper-ate accredited programs for the education of physician assistants and faculty, withpriority given to training individuals from disadvantaged communities. The fundsensure that PA students from all backgrounds have continued access to an afford-able education and encourage PAs, upon graduation, to practice in underserved com-munities. These goals are accomplished by funding PA education programs thathave a demonstrated track record of: (1) placing PA students in health professional shortage areas; (2) exposing PA students to medically underserved communities dur-ing the clinical rotation portion of their training; and (3) recruiting and retainingstudents who are indigenous to communities with unmet health care needs. The program works. A review of PA graduates from 1991 -1999 reveals that 16.5 percent of students graduating from PA programs supported by Title VII are fromunderrepresented minorities, compared to 7.7 percent of graduates from programsthat did not receive Title VII support. Similarly, 13.5 percent of the graduates whoattended PA programs receiving Title VII support during the eight-year period prac-tice in underserved communities, compared to 10.1 percent of graduates of programsnot receiving such support during the same period. The PA programs ' success in recruiting and retaining underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students is linked to their ability to creatively use Title VIIfunds to enhance existing educational programs. For example, a PA educational pro-gram in Iowa uses Title VII funds to target recruitment efforts to disadvantagedstudents, providing shadowing and mentoring opportunities for prospective stu-dents, increasing training in cultural competency, and identifying new family medi-cine preceptors in underserved areas. PA programs in Texas use Title VII funds tocreate new clinical rotation sites in rural and undersered areas, including new sitesin border communities, and to establish non-clinical rural rotations to help studentsunderstand the challenges faced by rural communities. Several other PA programshave been able to use Title VII grants to leverage additional resources to assist stu-dents with the added costs of housing and travel that occur during relocation torural areas for clinical training. Without Title VII funding, many of these special PA training initiatives would not be possible. Institutional budgets and student tuition fees simply do not provide suf-378 ficient funding to meet the special, unmet needs of medically underserved areas or disadvantaged students. Nevertheless, the need is very real, and Title VII is criticalin meeting it. NEED FOR INCREASED TITLE VII SUPPORT FOR PA EDUCATION PROGRAMS Increased Title VII support for educating PAs to practice in underserved commu- nities is particularly important given the market demand for physician assistants.Without the Title VII funding to expose students to underserved sites during theirtraining, PA students are far more likely to practice in the communities where theywere raised or the communities in which they attended school. Title VII funding isa critical link in addressing the natural geographic maldistribution of health careproviders by exposing students to underserved sites during their training, wherethey frequently choose to practice following graduation. The supply of physician assistants is inadequate to meet the needs of society, and the demand for PAs is expected to increase. A 1994 report of a workgroup of theCouncil on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), ''Physician Assistants in the Health Workforce, '' estimated that the anticipated medical market demand and the estimated workforce requirements for PAs would exceed demand. Additionally, theBureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of available PA jobs will in-crease 47 percent between 1996 and 2002. Despite the increased demand for PAs, funding has not proportionately increased for the Title VII programs that are designed to educate and place physician assist-ants in underserved communities. Between fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1997, PAprogram funding went from $6.5 million down to $5.9 million and, as of fiscal year1997, was restored to $6.376 million. PA program funding was slightly increasedagain for fiscal year 1998 at $6.398 million. The fiscal year 1998 appropriation pro-vided 42 awards to support the training of approximately 1600 PA graduates. Thefiscal year 1999 allocation was $6.8 million; the fiscal year 2000 appropriation forthe cluster assumes funding for the PA programs at the fiscal year 1999 level. RECOMMENDATIONS ON FISCAL YEAR 2001 FUNDING The American Academy of Physician Assistants urges members of the Appropria- tions Committee to consider the inter-dependency of all the public health agenciesand programs when determining funding for fiscal year 2001. For instance, whileit is important to fund clinical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)and to have an infrastructure at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that ensuresa prompt response to an infectious disease outbreak, the good work of both of theseagencies will go unrealized if the Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) is inadequately funded. HRSA administers the ''people '' programs, such as Title VII, that bring the cutting edge research discovered at NIH to the patients \u2014 through providers such as PAs who have been educated in Title VII-funded pro-grams. Likewise, CDC is heavily dependent upon an adequate supply of health careproviders to be sure that disease outbreaks are reported, tracked, and contained. The critically important programs administered by NIH, HRSA, and CDC are in- tegral components within the nation 's public health continuum. One component is not more important than another, and no one component can succeed without ade-quate support from each of the other elements. The Academy is particularly con-cerned that any increase for the NIH not be made at the expense of the health pro-fessions education program or other public health programs, as recommended thisyear by the Senate Budget Committee. The American Academy of Physician Assistants is particularly appreciative of the modest increase in funding for PA education programs that was appropriated duringthe 105th Congress. However, the increase has not been sufficient to meet the in-creasing demand for PA graduates in the growing number of medically underservedcommunities. Accordingly, the Academy respectfully requests that the Title VIIhealth professions programs, including PA programs, receive a 10 percent fundingincrease in fiscal year 2001. Thank you for the opportunity to present the American Academy of Physician As- sistants ' views on fiscal year 2001 appropriations. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL JEWISH MEDICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your support last year and the opportunity to present this testimony regarding the National JewishMedical and Research Center 's proposal to build an integrated Center for Environ- mental Health Research and Service (CEHRS). This Center will, under one roof,379 support research and provide clinical services for patients with respiratory and im- mune diseases with the mission of controlling or eradicating environmental and oc-cupational illness in the Rocky Mountain Region. It will serve as a regional resourceand national model for the delivery of environmental clinical health services, con-duct both basic and field research on environmental illness, and ''translate '' new knowledge, to better inform the public and help guide rational environmental policyby government, at both regional and national levels. National Jewish Medical and Research Center is known worldwide for the diag- nosis and treatment of patients with environmental, respiratory, immune and aller-gic disorders, and for groundbreaking medical research. For the past 20 years, thiscentury-old nonsectarian, nonprofit medical center has earned an international rep-utation for its treatment of environmental illness and for research leading to thedetection and prevention of environmental disorders including asthma, berylliosis,tuberculosis, and building-related illnesses. With funding from Federal agencies including the NIEHS, NHLBI, NIAID, EPA, DOE, and CDC/NIOSH, as well as foundations and private industry, National Jew-ish has become one of the leaders in the field of environmental health. NationalJewish is deeply committed to providing accessible, affordable and high quality carefor environmentally and occupationally exposed individuals, to consulting for gov-ernment and industries in the region and nationally, and to educating medical pro-fessionals and the public on matters of environmental risk and health. Our nation faces a significant challenge for the 21st century \u2014how to safeguard the health of the American public from environmental hazards. We are faced withthe reality that many Americans, particularly the working poor, blue collar middleclass, minorities, children and the elderly, are exposed daily to environmental toxinsthat may cause major lung, heart, immune and allergic diseases, disability and un-timely death. We must find ways to better diagnose, treat and, most importantly,prevent environmental disease. In addition, federal agencies and corporations facethe daunting task of cleaning up environmental ''sins of the past ''\u2014without unduly endangering the health of today 's hazardous waste workers and the members of communities that surround them. The State of Colorado has historically been medically underserved, in environ- mental health services, with fewer than 40 medical practitioners in Colorado whoare board certified to practice environmental and occupational health. While the Di-vision of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at National Jewish pro-vides consultation to industry, agriculture, community groups, and labor, its servicesare outstripped by the regional need for expertise. National Jewish is forced to turnaway many patients and groups who have environmental concerns because of phys-ical and staffing limitations at the Center. These needs range from communitygroups seeking advice on the hazards of radioactivity and of metal-contaminatedsoil, to industries needing help in the control of lead poisoning and biological hazard exposures, to regional agencies seeking aid in the investigation of disease outbreakscaused by airborne molds or tuberculosis-like organisms. National Jewish is uniquely positioned in the Rocky Mountain region to serve as a model health care institution for implementing innovative environmental healthprograms that reduce the risk of respiratory and immune system disease. Regionallyand nationally, the diseases that are treated at National Jewish Medical and Re-search Center are on the rise, including asthma, diseases due to environmental to-bacco smoke, building-related respiratory and allergic illnesses. National JewishMedical and Research Center specializes in helping both small and large regionalemployers address practical issues of toxic exposure assessment, exposure control,medical management of occupational illness, and remediation. Employees and theiremployers, while aiming to make the workplace safer and more productive, oftenlack enough information about the toxic effects of airborne chemicals, metals, andorganic matter that produce disability. Recent studies show that 1 in 10-hospital ad-missions is related to a workplace injury or exposure. More than half of all patientsseen in general medicine clinics in the central U.S. report past or ongoing exposureto one or more known toxin. The solutions to these environmental health dilemmas are to prevent exposures from causing disease and, if environmental exposures have already occurred, to de-tect disease earlier and to develop more effective treatments for disease. National Jewish can best increase our effectiveness by housing these major activi- ties in a single, dedicated location. The CEHRS will be a showcase for the applica-tion of the most advanced environmental science and directly to the prevention ofdisease in groups of Americans at environmental risk. By showing how a multidisci-plinary approach can help eradicate environmental respiratory and allergic diseases,our Center will be a model for other centers around the country who may addressother forms of environmental illness, such as those linked to skin disease, neurologic380 disorders, liver disease, and cancer. National Jewish Medical and Research Center believes that by maintaining a tight focus of both clinical care and research in anarea of great need \u2014the respiratory and immune systems \u2014its Center will be able to deliver long term solutions to the most important forms of environmental disease. The CEHRS will meet this need by integrating the following existing and new program components in the new Center: The Clinic for Environmental and Occupational Health Care .\u2014A combined adult and pediatric outpatient clinical practice staffed by experienced environmental andoccupational health physicians and nurses who diagnose and treat environmentaldisorders. Annually, this clinical group screens and evaluates more than 2,000 pa-tients with suspected environmental or occupational lung and allergic disorders. The Environmental Disease Prevention and Research Service .\u2014A multidisciplinary team of physicians, researchers, epidemiologists, industrial hygienists, and healtheducators, who conduct practical research aimed at ''real life '' problems solving by measuring airborne exposures to toxins and implementing innovative programs thatdetect the effects of chemicals in individuals and in the air. The goal is to devisepractical, cost-effective solutions to reducing risks of cancer, lung fibrosis, and aller-gic lung disease. The Environmental Away-Team Consultation Service .\u2014A mobile consultation service staffed by a team of environmental and occupational health experts who goanywhere in the country to measure environmental exposures, monitor for disease,and advise industrial and agricultural employers, labor, and private citizens on themanagement and control of environmental hazards. This service has gone on-site tomore than 20 states. The Respiratory Protection Program .\u2014A mobile service that helps individuals and corporations to educate and provide appropriate types of masks for people being po-tentially exposed to airborne hazards. Firefighters, hazardous waste workers, mu-nicipal employees, and others who encounter potentially lethal exposures to highlytoxic materials call on this service. The Environmental Education/Community Outreach Service .\u2014A risk communica- tion service that utilizes the internet as well as more traditional educational ap-proaches to deliver up-to-date, balanced, practical environmental information tocivic groups, labor, industry, and local and Federal Government agencies. The Occupational and Environmental Medicine Training Program .\u2014Based at Na- tional Jewish and the Department of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics at theUniversity of Colorado School of Medicine, this is the only training program for en-vironmental medicine in the State of Colorado. The Environmental Toxicology Section .\u2014A research unit dedicated to under- standing oxidative stress which is a natural process that produces disease when un-desirable oxidant gases or dusts are inhaled, causing inflammation. The Environmental Immunology Laboratory .\u2014A research unit dedicated to under- standing how environmental toxins cause allergic diseases. National Jewish is the only academic research facility in Colorado that provides clinical care for patients with suspected environmental or occupational illnesses. Pa-tients from the region as well as from all 50 states come to National Jewish Medicaland Research Center for medical diagnosis and care. Patients receive superior carewithout regard to their ability to pay. Each year $7 to $10 million of free or heavilysubsidized care is provided. National Jewish was recently ranked as the best hospital in the nation for excel- lence in treating respiratory diseases in U.S. New and World Report 's ''America 's Best Hospitals. '' American Health magazine termed National Jewish one of the fin- est U.S. hospitals in allergy, immunology and pulmonology for both adult and pedi-atric patients. The Institute for Science and medicine rated National Jewish amongthe top 10 independent biomedical research institutions \u2014of any kind \u2014in the world, and the only one that also provides patient care. It was ranked as one of the threemost influential research institutions for immunology and as the number one pri-vate immunology research institution in the world. Partnerships with governmental agencies .\u2014In addition to conducting research di- rectly funded by several agencies, National Jewish faculty provide advice and con-sultation to local, regional and Federal Government offices, including: the ColoradoDepartment of Health and the Environment, the Governor 's Air Toxics Science Advi- sory Committee, the U.S. DOE Beryllium Standards Advisory Committee, oversightBoards for Hanford Reservation in Washington State, the Nevada Test Site, and LosAlamos National Laboratories, the EPA air pollution research advisory panel, andthe OSHA Metalworking Fluids Standards Advisory Committee, and both CDC/NIOSH and NIH research advisory committees. Partnership with community health organizations .\u2014Faculty members conduct community outreach, speaking at local hospitals on environmental health. Three of381 our faculty have served as presidents of the Rocky Mountain Academy for Environ- mental and Occupational Medicine, the regional society for all physicians practicingin this field. Partnership with regional industry and labor .\u2014National Jewish has helped orga- nize and conduct medical education and medical surveillance programs for many re-gional industries, helping them to protect employees from hazards in the workplace. National Jewish proposes to establish a public/private partnership with the Fed- eral Government in support of the establishment of the ''Center for Environmental Health Research and Service. '' This partnership will cover the cost of the construc- tion of a new, 50,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility which will house all basicand clinical environmental research, clinical care, outpatient services, training andconsulting services affiliated with the Environmental Health Research and Sciencesprogram. The total cost of the proposed facility is $14 million. National Jewish received a $1 million HRSA grant from this Subcommittee in fiscal year 1999 and $250,00 lastyear to carry out the initial phases for the construction of the CEHRS. NationalJewish seeks $5 million in HRSA follow-on funding in fiscal year 2001 to help con-struct the new Center. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the hearing record regarding an important initiative in ruralhealth being undertaken by Idaho State University 's (ISU) Institute for Rural Health Studies. Specifically, ISU has requested federal partnership assistance to es-tablish the Idaho Telehealth Integrated Care Center to address the many healthchallenges faced by Idaho as a rural and frontier state where 90 percent of the geog-raphy and about one half of the population is outside of an urban area. The threemain objectives of the Idaho Telehealth Integrated Care Center (ITICC) are to: \u2014improve the quality and quantity of access to healthcare for people living in Ida- ho's rural and frontier areas, \u2014promote professional development in telehealth for faculty and practicing pro- fessionals, and \u2014provide professionals-in-training educational experiences in integrated care and telehealth. This integrative model meets many of the objectives for whole-person primary care outlined in Healthy People 2010. In addition to improving care and providerprofessional support, this integrated care program can serve as a national model forthe integration of general medical, oral health, and mental health. The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive telehealth clinic providing con- sultation and technical assistance in a variety of fields to support care in rural andfrontier areas. The concept is simple. By contacting the ITICC, facilities in rural andfrontier areas can schedule assistance across the health care spectrum. For example,if a rural clinic determines they need support in audiology, they can call the ITICCand schedule an audiology consultation. Rural partners will be recruited from TribalNations, Indian Health Service, critical access hospitals, private and public clinics.Particular attention will be taken to provide care in culturally sensitive ways. Inaddition to supporting patients and caregivers in rural and frontier areas, theITICC will serve as practice and training outlet for the university community. Idaho consists of 44 counties covering 83,574 square miles \u2014geographically, the 14th largest state in the U.S. The 1998 population of the state was 1,228,684 \u2014only 9 states have a smaller population. Of the 208 towns in the state, 2 have popu-lations over 50,000 and 16 towns have populations less than 100; 186 have less than10,000 people. About 40 percent of the population lives outside of an urban area,distributed over 9/10ths of the states geographical area. Idaho 's per capita income was $18,170, ranking 43rd in the U.S. in 1997. The median household income was$32,000 in 1997. Idaho ranks in the upper 1/3 (16th) of the states in number of per-sons employed, but 42nd in average annual pay. Just over 400,000 people in thestate are employed, largely in the service industry. Forty-one thousand of those peo-ple are employed in health related fields. In Idaho, an estimated 150,000 people \u201460,000 of whom are children \u2014live below the poverty level. Idaho ranks 3rd in the nation for number of persons under 18years of age and 40th in persons over 65 leaving the state with an abundance ofchildren and a dearth of older, potentially wiser, elders. Twenty three percent (23percent) of children under 5 live in poverty. In 1995, five counties had no full-timephysician. In 1996, the physician to population ratio was 145 per 100,000 placing382 Idaho in the unenviable position of having the worst patient to physician ratio in the United States. Access to mental and oral health is even more limited. The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth defines telehealth as the use of ''telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, pa- tient and professional health-related education, public health and health adminis-tration. '' The distribution of telehealth is irregular and largely explainable by an area's resources. According to a 1999 NTIA report on defining the digital divide, the more available resources, the more likely an area is to have access to telehealth.While telehealth has been seen as a panacea for improving health care in ruralareas, the very rurality of these areas is preventing appropriate penetration of theproposed solution. Integrated telehealth combines two promising trends in healthcare to lower social and financial healthcare costs. Integrated telehealth uses telecommunication tech-nology to combine physical and behavioral healthcare to deliver community-basedwhole-person care. It overcomes social, economic, geographical, and climatologicalbarriers that hinder access. Training students in integrated telehealth care placesIdaho as a leader in healthcare training innovation. Integrated telehealth should re-duce medical error; improve recruitment and retention of healthcare students andproviders; combat burnout and employee turnover; and improve healthcare in ruraland underserved areas. The key to success for ITICC is building a collaborative network. While univer- sities and communities have not traditionally enjoyed strong collaborative relation-ships, this trend has been reversed in telehealth. The majority of telehealth pro-grams serving communities around the U.S. are based in academic centers. Initially,a working group will be founded composed of consumer, practice, student, and fac-ulty representatives. Using implementation strategies based on other successfulprojects such as the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network, East CarolinaUniversity, and the Telemedicine Research Center, the working group will develop-ment implementation strategies for the ITICC. Four telemedicine practice suitesand up to eight rural clinics will be connected with up to an additional 27 rural clin-ics to follow bringing the total to 35. The ITICC system will interface with the IdahoCritical Access Hospital program that will wire up to 50 hospitals. Between the twoprojects, up to 85 communities will have access to the ITICC. The areas of consultation available through Idaho State University include:\u2014Geriatric Care \u2014Family Medicine \u2014Health Education \u2014Healthcare Administration \u2014Mental Health, Child & Adult \u2014Nutrition & Therapy \u2014Oral \u2014Rural Health Research \u2014Speech Pathology & Audiology This project is designed to avoid the mistakes of other telehealth programs, which tend to focus on the technology and overlook the importance of maximizing humancapital and the powerful effect of training on system change. The director of thisproject has been involved in designing, implementing, and evaluating telehealth pro-grams for nearly a decade serving as a technology advisor to national and inter-national groups and is the author of theory and evaluation papers. The clinical staffare mature in their fields. The ITICC team has intentionally chosen a smaller,scaleable project over a larger, riskier enterprise. Ongoing evaluation, using stand-ardized measures, is built into the system design. During Year 3 there will be a spe-cial focus on refinement, sustainability, and dissemination of the program so otherprograms can benefit from the lessons learned by ITICC. Sustainability is always a concern for any program, especially one that is as heav- ily invested in equipment as telehealth must be. The core elements of this programare based on proven technology that can be sustained at minimum cost and frustra-tion to users. Because the ITICC is connected with a training institution, ITICCmoney can be leveraged for other training and research grants. Moreover, becausethe ITICC target is health professions shortage area, most consultations will be re-imbursable under HCFA rural telehealth reimbursement regulations. Mr. Chairman, ISU is seeking to establish a telehealth model for rural outreach. The 4 million dollars in federal partnership assistance requested will provide train-ing benefits as well as improve the quality of care for Idaho 's rural and frontier resi-383 dents. We believe this will be an excellent investment of taxpayer funds that will be repaid many times over through local cost-savings and the provision of an inte-grative health model that can be replicated nationally. For example, it is well docu-mented that local treatment usually results in cost savings. Receiving appropriatecare when it is needed reduces the risk of hospitalization. It has been calculatedthat if each clinic prevents just one hospitalization through appropriate integrativecare, there is the potential for 100 percent cost offset across the life of this project. Clearly the dollar cost offset is impressive but when added to the benefits of reducedmedical error, better training, and recruitment and retention of providers in ruraland frontier areas the benefits mount. Perhaps the most compelling case can bemade by looking at the improvement to the quality of life for an individual personand his or her family and community when appropriate community based, whole-person care is finally possible. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF BABYLAND FAMILY SERVICES , INC. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the Public Witness Hearing Record regarding a model edu-cational program that will close the ''digital divide '' among minority inner city chil- dren and families. Babyland Family Services (BFS) is a major non-profit child andfamily service organization, founded in 1968 in Newark, New Jersey, that providescomprehensive child and family development services at 14 sites to 1,500 at riskchildren and their families each year. The Annie E. Casey Foundation, a nationalleader in children 's issues, highlighted Babyland in its annual 1998 Kids Count re- port as a model in community-based child and family development. BFS was alsoone of a select number of agencies that received a 1999 Century of Caring award,from the NJ Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), for its service to chil-dren and families. Babyland has also taken the lead on several community-wide ini-tiatives: Success By 6, Family and Children Early Education Services (FACES), Ab-bott Preschool Family Worker Program, and the Pediatric Asthma Reduction Effort(PARE). These initiatives include collaborations with over 30 other child care cen-ters, several public and parochial elementary schools, and several service providers.Together these initiatives serve over 5,000 children and families. BFS integrates its wide network of services in order to enable each child and indi- vidual to reach their potential \u2014intellectually, emotionally, spiritually, socially, and physically. Babyland 's holistic philosophy \u2014integrating child, family, staff and com- munity development \u2014serves as a model and has been studied by other communities throughout the nation and as far away as South Africa. Babyland serves at-riskchildren (from infancy to 18 years old), parents striving to be self-sufficient, teenageparents (including young fathers), struggling families and distressed neighborhoods. BFS programs provide a continuum of educational services to individual children as well as multiple support services for family members. By virtue of this con-tinuum, the agency is able to build extensive relationships with families and to pro-vide follow-up care. As a result, BFS is in a unique position to launch and overseea major computer and technology initiative that will provide extensive training andtechnology support for individual families having no other tangible means of becom-ing computer literate or of acquiring the requisite skills necessary to be informedand self-sufficient. This initiative would empower not only present clients but alsothose who will receive BFS services in the future. BFS services include:\u2014Quality child care for children under three years old, through the Early Head Start Program; \u2014Early childhood education for preschoolers; \u2014After school and summer enrichment programs for school-age children; \u2014Pediatric health services, including a pediatric AIDS and asthma program; \u2014Parent education for teenage mothers and pregnant women, young fathers, se- verely distressed parents, foster parents, and grandparents; \u2014Emergency shelter and counseling for battered women and children; \u2014Foster care homes for boarder babies and sibling children; \u2014Self-sufficiency services that include: life skills, family literacy, substance abuse and mental health counseling, and employment training/placement in conjunc-tion with networking partners; \u2014Training in the areas of child development, domestic violence, foster care, family support, health and parent leadership; and \u2014Community organizing and neighborhood leadership training for parents and residents.384 Computer technology is transforming the economic and social landscape of this country by offering information and educational opportunities for individual growthand community development. Inner-city children and residents are inadequatelyprepared to take advantage of these growth opportunities. If the gap in informationtechnology \u2014the digital divide \u2014is not bridged, a large segment of society will be fur- ther polarized and left without the tools needed for full participation in society. Spe-cifically, BFS is seeking to establish the telecommunications linkages necessary forthe educational development of 670 children and to provide computer and tech-nology training for 2,000 parents, teachers, and employees. As a result, this initia-tive will strengthen children 's educational skills; promote the self-sufficiency of and enhance the educational skills of parents; enable the agency to better track childand family needs in order to enhance client services; and link the community tolocal and national resource centers. The proposed technological network will linkcenter and home-based child care facilities; community resources and service pro-viders; educational, economic and resource information sources; training centers andadministrative offices. The establishment of this network will be a model for edu-cating urban children and serve as a conduit for comprehensive family support serv-ices. The Specific Provisions of the BFS proposal include:\u2014Computer hardware and software (technical assistance, installation and wiring, modems, printers etc.) for children, parents and residents, and teaching/socialservice staff in classrooms, homes and social service offices. \u2014Technology Center, as part of a new multi-purpose community resource center, that will provide distance learning, professional development and training inbasic and advanced computer and technology skills for low-income parents,neighborhood residents and entry-level employees. \u2014Computer Training, Curriculum Development and Professional Development for children, parents and residents, educational and social services staff, as well asnational and international community-based family service providers. The initiative will benefit:\u2014Preschoolers (550) at eight centers and 120 school-age children (after school/ summer enrichment programs) at five centers. \u2014Parents and family members (1,750) at 13 Babyland sites with links to commu- nity resources; \u2014Agency Staff (250) for client tracking purposes; training and professional devel- opment; and access to community resources to be provided throughworkstations and/or palm pilots for caregivers/teachers and social service staff. \u2014Parents and children in the home for educational instruction and support, eco- nomic and resource information, links to other parents and teachers, parentingeducation (child and family health, child behavior and development, culturalsensitivity, etc) and professional education (ex. Certifications, GED, etc.). \u2014Family day care homes with links to community resources, professional edu- cation, BFS child care centers and other child and family resource centers. \u2014Child and family service providers throughout New Jersey, the nation and South Africa. The BFS digital divide initiative will seek specifically to greatly enhance:\u2014Early childhood development and education for young children (three to 13 years old). \u2014The ability of inner city residents, especially low-income parents and teenagers, to learn computer and technology skills. \u2014Tracking of 1,500 children in center- and home-based child care facilities; teen- age parents and victims of domestic violence; homeless families; foster childrenand families. \u2014Provision and delivery of professional development for BFS staff and parent education programs and curriculum development efforts. \u2014Delivery of clinical and therapeutic services to parents and children. \u2014The ability to fulfill State and Federal reporting requirements. \u2014The ability to provide consultation to international family service providers. Current BFS parent and staff training programs that will be continued and ex- panded through the implementation of this initiative include: \u2014Foster parent training for over 300 candidates; \u2014Domestic Violence training for nearly 40 community staff; \u2014Family Worker training for over 50 Abbott Preschool family workers; \u2014Child care training and accreditation for nearly 100 child care staff from 30 cen- ters; \u2014Parent leadership training for 30 parents from three public schools, through a grant from the Victoria Foundation; \u2014Family literacy training for 40 parents; and385 1Reauthorization of the TBI Act is currently under consideration by the Congress. Funding must continue uninterrupted through fiscal year 2001.\u2014Family day care training for 20 family day care providers. Of particular note, Babyland established an international training program with the Goldfield Metropolitan Corporation, a community-based organization in SouthAfrica, in order to exchange information on child care, community development andfamily services. In 2000, we are looking forward to providing distance learning forover 100 parents and staff at the Early Head Start Program. Mr. Chairman, as your Subcommittee deliberates funding requests from many qualified candidates coming to you for assistance this year, I urge you to review andconsider our request for a $1 million 21st Century Learning Centers Grant to bridgethe digital divide among inner-city families in Newark. We make this request inorder to help us fulfill our mandate as a provider for thousands in our city but also,in return, to act as a model for other agencies in cities around the country who mayalso be able to help the technologically disadvantaged gain access to the resourcesand skills necessary to survive in the 21st Century. Thank you. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BRAIN INJURY ASSOCIATION The International Brain Injury Association (IBIA) respectfully requests $15 mil- lion in fiscal year 2001 for the Traumatic Brain Injury Act (TBI Act).1IBIA is a non-profit organization dedicated to the support and development of medical andclinical professionals and others who work to improve opportunities and successesfor persons with brain injury. Headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, IBIA isthe only international association representing and convening brain injury profes-sionals and specialists throughout the world. The TBI Act, Public Law 104 -166, is the first nationwide attempt to discern the extent of brain injury in this country, to assist states in providing services to per-sons with brain injury, and to further research on brain injury rehabilitation. Likeother medical research and treatment in the United States, the TBI Act serves asa model for the rest of the world. IBIA and its members, therefore, strongly urgeyour support for $15 million to continue the critical work being done under the rel-atively nascent law. The Act defines TBI as an insult to the brain, not of a degenerative or congenital nature but caused by an external physical force, that may produce a diminished oraltered state of consciousness, which results in an impairment of cognitive abilitiesor physical functioning. TBI can also result in the disturbance of behavioral or emo-tional functioning. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in young Americans. Motor vehi- cle crashes, sports injuries, falls, and violence (including shaken baby syndrome andother child abuse) are the major causes of traumatic brain injury. TBI can strikeanyone \u2014infant, youth, adult or elderly person \u2014without warning, and often with devastating consequences. TBI affects the whole family and often results in hugemedical and rehabilitation expenses over a lifetime. Approximately 2 million Americans experience TBI each year. About half of these cases result in at least short-term disability, and 50,000 people die as a result oftheir injuries. Each year, approximately 230,000 persons require hospitalization forTBI (30 percent of which show disabilities a year post injury), and over 1 millionpeople receive emergency medical care for TBI. The national cost is estimated atmore than $48 billion annually. Every year about 80,000 people sustain severe braininjuries leading to long term disability. Through the TBI Act, the Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that there are 5.3 million persons liv-ing with long term, severe disability as a result of brain injury and as many as 6.5million persons living with some form of injury including mild and moderate braininjuries. The TBI Act was enacted ''to provide for the conduct of expanded studies and the establishment of innovative programs with respect to traumatic brain injury. '' Under the law, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsiblefor activities related to assessing the incidence of traumatic brain injury, conductingprevention research and increasing awareness of TBI; the Maternal and ChildHealth Bureau (MCHB) under the Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA), is responsible for implementing a TBI State Demonstration Program; and386 the National Institutes for Health (NIH) has been delegated the responsibility of conducting basic and applied research and holding a consensus conference. CDC SURVEILLANCE , EDUCATION AND PREVENTION The TBI Act authorized CDC to support studies in collaboration with State and local health-related agencies to: (1) determine the incidence and prevalence of trau-matic brain injury; and (2) develop a uniform reporting system under which Statesreport incidents of traumatic brain injury. CDC has published TBI surveillancemethods and guidelines for public health purposes and created and oversees amulti-state, uniform reporting system to provide nationally representative data todefine groups at higher risk, causes and circumstances of injury, and outcomes ofinjury. This information is critical in the planning, implementation, and evaluationof programs for preventing TBI and any accompanying disabilities. CDC 's population based surveillance activities have provided the data for the epi- demiologists and statisticians to estimate the incidence and prevalence of brain in-jury in this country. As CDC 's estimates become more refined, the numbers of per- sons sustaining long term disabilities as a result of brain injury are increasing tre-mendously. Improving the accuracy of these estimates by conducting surveillance inadditional states is crucial to understanding the impact brain injury has on the na-tion's medical and rehabilitative systems and accompanying costs, educational insti- tutions, lost income and productivity, and the immeasurable toll on persons sus-taining brain injury and their families. The TBI Act also directed CDC to conduct research into identifying effective strat- egies for the prevention of brain injury, implementing public information and edu-cation programs for the prevention of brain injury, and broadening public awarenessof the health consequences of such injury. CDC has drafted a brochure for personswith mild TBI who are treated in emergency departments, which discusses potentialproblems they may encounter and how to identify services. With additional fundingthe brochure can be widely distributed and other public awareness efforts can beinitiated. For fiscal year 2000, approximately $3 million was appropriated for CDC 's work under the TBI Act. CDC has used most of this funding on its incidence and preva-lence studies. More money is needed for education and prevention initiatives. We,therefore, respectfully request an increase of $2 million for education and preventionprograms. Funding of $5 million for fiscal year 2001 is necessary to continue CDC 's surveillance work, as well as to implement effective education and prevention activi-ties. HRSA /MCHB TBI DEMONSTRATION GRANTS PROGRAM Under the TBI Act, HRSA directs the Maternal and Child Health Bureaus to pro- vide and administer grants to States for demonstration projects to improve servicesfor persons with TBI. The TBI Demonstration Grants are intended to help States implement statewide systems that ensure access to comprehensive and coordinatedTBI services for the 5.3 million persons with long-term disabilities and their fami-lies. The projects are to involve all relevant disciplines, organizations and con-sumers. State Planning Grants Planning grantees are developing statewide TBI advisory boards; designating state agency and staff positions responsible for TBI activities; assessing statewideneeds to address the full spectrum of care and services from initial acute treatmentthrough community reintegration for individuals with TBI; and drafting statewideaction plans to develop comprehensive, community-based systems of care that in-clude physical, psychological, educational, vocational, and social aspects of TBI serv-ices. State Implementation Grants The implementation grants require states to establish interagency linkages; edu- cation and training for persons with TBI and their families; data collection to trackprograms, resources and enhance program evaluation; develop materials for low lit-eracy and culturally or ethnically distinct populations; develop a pre-dischargemodel to be used in acute care sites in the development of long term resource plansfor individuals with TBI; and develop a model to coordinate financial resources toprovide services that most effectively meet the needs of persons with TBI. In fiscal year 2000, $5 million was appropriated for this program. To maintain the continuity of these projects, we request $5 million for fiscal year 2001.387 2The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement on Reha- bilitation of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury, October 26 -28, 1998.NIH RESEARCH ON TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION The TBI Act directed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct a con- sensus conference on TBI. In October 1998, the NIH held such a conference regard-ing managing traumatic brain injury and related rehabilitation concerns. The eventwas sponsored by the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research(NCMRR) within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(NICHD). Conference participants evaluated the scientific data concerning rehabili-tation practices for persons with TBI. Particular emphasis was placed on rehabilita-tion of cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial difficulties associated with mild, mod-erate and severe TBI. The conference brought together national and internationalbiomedical researchers and clinicians, as well as person with TBI and their families. Participants undertook a detailed review of the evidence-based scientific evalua- tions of cognitive and behavioral rehabilitative interventions. In response to ''what research is needed to guide the rehabilitation of people with TBI, '' the conference statement listed the following priorities: 2 \u2014Epidemiological studies on the risk factors and incidence of TBI are needed for different age groups, gender and race. \u2014The relationship between substance abuse and TBI should be studied. \u2014Existing CDC surveillance systems based on hospital discharge summaries or death records should be expanded to include emergency department encountersin order to augment the current database for research. \u2014Studies of the placement of persons with TBI in nursing homes and psychiatric facilities are needed to clarify what constitutes appropriate placement. \u2014The epidemiology of mild TBI should be studied. \u2014The duration, natural history, and life-course manifestations (neurological, cog- nitive, social, psychological, economic, etc.) of mild, moderate, and sever TBIshould be studied. \u2014Gender differences in survival rates, patterns of severity, and long-term mani- festations of TBI should be studied. \u2014The consequences and effects of rehabilitation after TBI in the elderly should be studied. \u2014The experience of minority group members with TBI should be studied. \u2014Research training is needed in the areas of injury epidemiology and clinical re- search in order to enhance the quality of all research related to TBI. \u2014The time course of TBI should be studied in animals with respect to injury se- verity, influence of age and gender and effects of interventions. \u2014Research is needed on the appropriate timing of therapeutic interventions after TBI. \u2014Research is needed on the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional consequences of TBI. \u2014The neurobiology of TBI in humans should be studied with modern imaging techniques (e.g. positron emission tomography [PET] and functional magneticresonance imaging with neuropsychological findings. \u2014Promising treatments of TBI derived from animal studies should be tested in humans. \u2014The epidemiology and management of TBI in sports should be studied. \u2014Well-designed and controlled studies of the effectiveness of rehabilitation inter- ventions are needed. \u2014Economic analysis of TBI including major determinants of costs, is needed. \u2014Innovative rehabilitation interventions for TBI should be developed and studied. \u2014The predictors of quality of life for persons with TBI, their families, and signifi- cant others should be studied. \u2014Studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between specific cognitive defi- cits and global outcomes. \u2014Validation of generic health-related quality of life assessment instruments for use in TBI is needed as well as the development and validation of TBI-specificinstruments. \u2014Uniform standards and minimal data sets to describe injury type, severity, and significant interacting variables, which could provide a total injury profileacross a continuum of recovery, should be developed. \u2014The relationship between the pathophysiology of TBI and the effectiveness of different interventions should be studied. \u2014The long-term consequences of TBI of varying severity, including the con- sequences of aging for a person with TBI, should be studied.388 3The National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke engages in numerous research studies, some of which could benefit traumatic brain injury research; NINDS has expressed aninterest in undertaking TBI specific research.\u2014The developmental impact of TBI in childhood with respect to the need for spe- cial education, mental health, and rehabilitation services should be studied. \u2014The effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation of persons with TBI should be studied. \u2014Severity risk-adjustment models for studies of persons with TBI should be es- tablished. \u2014The effectiveness of peer support for persons with TBI, their families, and sig- nificant others should be studied. \u2014Innovative study methodologies to assess the effectiveness of complex interven- tions for persons with TBI should be developed and evaluated. The NIH Consensus statement concludes that ''funding for research on TBI needs to be increased. '' IBIA therefore requests $5 million for brain injury research to be conducted by the National Institutes of Health through the National Center on Med-ical Rehabilitation Research and/or the National Institute on Neurological Disorderand Stroke. 3 CONCLUSION There are few conditions that can strike anyone at any age at any time. Trau- matic brain injury is one of them, and as a result is often known as the ''silent epi- demic. '' As the United States medical community perfects trauma care and rehabili- tation, more individuals (who might have otherwise died) are living with brain inju-ries than ever before. CDC must keep track of the growth of this epidemic, devisepublic awareness campaigns and establish effective prevention programs. The statesneed to assess the needs of their communities and include persons with brain injuryin their services. And as the National Institutes of Health conducts basic and ap-plied research on the myriad of disorders that affect the brain, trauma to the brainand the resulting affects on the person and his/her life must not be excluded. IBIA respectfully requests $15 million in fiscal year 2001 for the Traumatic Brain Injury Act ($5 million for CDC, $5 million for HRSA, and $5 million for NIH). PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE EPILEPSY FOUNDATION The Epilepsy Foundation is the national voluntary organization that works for people affected by seizures through research, education, advocacy and service. Thenational office together with its network of more than 60 affiliates across the coun-try advocate for increased funding for medical research to find better treatment andan eventual cure for epilepsy, and works with Federal Government agencies andCongress to advance the interests of people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked sei- zures. It is an economic burden on individuals, families, communities, and societyas a whole because of resultant increased health care costs. Epilepsy is a formidablebarrier to normal life, affecting educational attainment, employment, and personalfulfillment. The stigma that comes from seizures and societal misconceptions aboutthem remain as facts of life for many individuals with epilepsy. Epilepsy and seizures affect 2.3 million Americans of all ages. Approximately 181,000 new cases of seizure and epilepsy occur each year; 10 percent of all Ameri-cans will experience seizures in their lifetimes. According to the most recent dataavailable, in 1995, 300,000 children aged 14 and under had epilepsy; 1.4 millionadults under age 64 and 550,000 aged 65 and over had epilepsy. Epilepsy is a chron-ic condition that usually requires a lifetime of continual medical treatment and edu-cation. As many as 44 percent of people with epilepsy continue to have seizures de-spite treatment; 56 percent have early or delayed seizure control with treatment.Currently, there is no cure for epilepsy. THE COST OF EPILEPSY IN THE UNITED STATES Epilepsy is a major, unsolved health problem affecting the lives of millions of Americans and their families. The economic impact in the United States is also tre-mendous. A three-year study sponsored by the Epilepsy Foundation to determinethe financial costs of epilepsy to individuals and the nation was completed in 1999.Using data from actual cases as a basis for the estimate, the annual financial costof epilepsy in the United States is approximately $12.5 billion. Of this, $1.7 billion(14 percent) are direct medical costs while $10.8 billion (86 percent) are indirect389 medical costs. The study also found marked divisions in costs among those people with epilepsy whose seizures are easy to control and those who continue to experi-ence seizures, despite treatment. Indirect costs are primarily employment related. Individual men and women who continue to experience seizures despite treatment were estimated to lose hundredsof thousands of dollars in wages while also experiencing loss of productivity athome. Each man lost a total of $317,000 or 35 percent of his lifetime wages. Eachwoman lost a total of $140,000 or 25 percent of her lifetime wages. The high concentration of costs among those people with epilepsy who continue to experience seizures emphasizes the importance of seizure control in reducing theeconomic burden of epilepsy on society and the individual and also demonstrates thecost-saving potential of effective interventions that increase seizure control. Recentadvances in medical, surgical, and vagal nerve stimulation therapies hold promisefor reducing the frequency and severity of seizures in people with intractable epi-lepsy. Epilepsy research is an area largely under-funded compared to other diseases. The results of this cost study provide compelling evidence of the need for increased support in this area. The cure of intractable seizures and all forms of epilepsy mustbe a research priority for the nation. CURING EPILEPSY : FOCUS ON THE FUTURE A White House-initiated conference sponsored by the National Institute of Neuro- logical Disorders and Stroke was held March 30 -31, 2000 at the National Institutes of Health. The conference featured clinicians and scientists who discussed innova-tive discoveries likely to lead to the prevention and cure of epilepsy. Presentationson diverse topics included the prevention of epileptogenesis (how epilepsy begins),ameliorating the effects of epilepsy genes, monitoring epileptogenesis, developingnew therapies and using surgery and other forms of technology. The primary message from the conference is that epilepsy treatment is due to un- dergo a fundamental change in direction from treating the seizures which are thesymptoms of epilepsy to treatment of the underlying condition in the brain. Thegoals of treatment will be the prevention and cure of epilepsy, no seizures and noside effects for those who have already developed the condition and dramatic newways of preventing epilepsy that is acquired from injury, infection or errors of devel-opment. Opportunities for further breakthroughs in epilepsy research identified at the con- ference are dependent upon increased funding to the National Institutes of Healthand the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the develop-ment of a coordinated plan for pursuing these opportunities. ADVANCES IN EPILEPSY RESEARCH In his testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D.,Director, NINDS, described several major initiatives for fiscal 2001. These prioritiesinclude efforts to address developmental and degenerative disorders of children,such as epilepsy, that can result in a lifetime of disability. The severe epilepsy syn-dromes of childhood produce developmental delay and brain damage that can resultin a life of dependence on others and continually accruing costs to the health caresystem and society. Research has led to the discovery of good predictors for remis-sion or relapse of epilepsy in children. For the sake of these children and those oth-ers who will develop epilepsy, research focused on the prevention and treatment ofepilepsy in our youngest citizens must be a national priority. One area of research that holds great promise is the identification of the genes responsible for predisposition to certain types of epilepsy. Research has identifiedseveral genes for childhood epilepsies in the last few years. During his recent testi-mony, Dr. Fischbach explained that the NINDS has emphasized gene discovery inepilepsy since even the most common forms, such as febrile convulsions, have a heri-table component. Advances in genetic therapy, coupled with genetics research, willnot only suppress seizures, but cure certain types of epilepsy. Another area of great clinical importance to people with epilepsy has been the de- velopment of new anti-epileptic drugs. The Foundation recommends research sup-port from the NINDS for comparative trials of anti-epileptic drugs to assure thatpeople with epilepsy receive the greatest possible benefit from these newly availablemedications. These medications have shown great promise but more research isneeded to eradicate this disorder.390 CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL EPILEPSY PROGRAM As directed by Congress in 1993, the CDC launched its epilepsy program within the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Focus-ing on early detection and effective treatment of epilepsy, the epilepsy program tar-gets its outreach and education efforts on consumers, health professionals, andhealth systems. The CDC was appropriated an additional $1 million for fiscal year2000 to expand epilepsy surveillance, public awareness activities, and public andprovider education. The fiscal year 2000 funding is the first significant increasesince 1993, illustrating Congress ' and CDC 's renewed commitment to epilepsy and the issues which surround it. Current CDC activities in the area of epilepsy include programs geared toward teens and adolescents, a population which struggles with the stigma associated withthis disorder. The Foundation hopes to help teens, through a web based teen chatroom, forums, and special events, to make more informed decisions about their be-haviors and life plans, while at the same time educating the general public. Experts agree that timely recognition of seizures and effective treatment can re- duce the risk of subsequent brain damage, as well as disability and mortality frominjuries incurred during a seizure and from recurring seizures. With additionalfunding in fiscal year 2001, epilepsy activities can be expanded to include a broaderpublic awareness and communication strategy including laying the groundwork forprograms targeted at seniors and children and continued efforts for teens. Increasedfunding would allow for the implementation of local community activities; improvedsurveillance and prevention research; and more extensive provider education. FISCAL 2001 FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS Epilepsy research funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke is vital to continuing the fight against epilepsy. The promise of future break-throughs in epilepsy research can only be achieved by increased funding for epilepsyresearch and prevention programs. The Foundation urges Congress to increase thefederal commitment to epilepsy research by allocating sufficient funding for theNINDS and Centers for Disease Control. National Institutes of Health .\u2014The Foundation supports Congressional efforts to double the NIH budget over 5 years and is seeking a 15 percent increase for fiscal2001, resulting in a total NIH budget of $20.6 billion. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .\u2014The Foundation sup- ports a 15 percent increase for NINDS in fiscal 2001, creating a total NINDS budget of $1.19 billion. This increase is consistent with efforts to double NIH research fund-ing over 5 years. Epilepsy Research .\u2014The Foundation urges Congress to support a major expansion of epilepsy research within NINDS. In 1999, NINDS spent approximately $74 mil-lion dollars on epilepsy research. We are seeking a commitment to triple thatamount over the next few years. Centers for Disease Control Epilepsy Program .\u2014The Foundation is seeking a $5 million increase in fiscal year 2001 support for the CDC 's epilepsy program within its chronic and environmental account. With additional resources, the CDC and theFoundation can make great strides in combating the negative consequences associ-ated with epilepsy and seizures. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROTARY INTERNATIONAL Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to present written testimony on behalf of Rotary International insupport of the polio eradication activities of the U.S. Centers for Disease Controland Prevention. As you know, 2000 is a water shed year in the battle to eradicatepolio. The penultimate goal of the international polio eradication initiative, theinterruption of polio transmission, is within our grasp. We remain on track for ourprimary target: certification of eradication by 2005. This monumental effort, towardwhich countless millions have endeavored, has required the commitment and for-titude of a climb to Everest 's peak. As we near our goal \u2014a world free of polio \u2014we cannot become complacent. We cannot allow the daunting challenges that lie beforeus to diminish our resolve. As with an expedition to scale Everest, the most difficultstage of our journey, the stage most fraught with the risk of failure, is the finalpush to the summit. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin and members of the Subcommittee for your tremendous commitment to this391 effort. Without your support of the CDC 's polio eradication activities, the battle against polio would be impossible. The global eradication strategy is working. In 1985, when Rotary began its PolioPlus Program, 100 nations around the world suffered under the burden of polio.The Western Hemisphere has now been polio-free for nearly 9 years, and today poliois confined only to Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East, and South Asia. Thanks to the polio eradication efforts over the last decade, approximately three million children who might have been polio victims are walking and playing nor-mally. Tens of thousands of public health workers have been trained to investigatecases of acute flaccid paralysis and manage immunization programs. Cold chain,transport and communications systems for immunization have been strengthened.A network of more than 140 polio laboratories has been established. Significant challenges lie before us. Continued political commitment is essential both in polio endemic countries, to support the acceleration of eradication activities,and in donor countries, so that the necessary human and financial resources aremade available. Access to children everywhere is needed, particularly in countriesaffected by conflict. Truces must be negotiated if National Immunization Days areto proceed in these countries. The continued leadership of the United States is crit-ical if we are to overcome these challenges. Rotary International is a global association of more than 29,000 Rotary clubs, with a membership of over 1.2 million business and professional leaders in 160countries. In the United States today there are some 7,500 Rotary clubs with400,000 members. All of our clubs work to promote humanitarian service, high eth-ical standards in all vocations, and international understanding. Less than one year remains to defeat this disease in the nations where the polio- virus still causes death and disability. With your continued support, soon no childwill ever be struck down by polio again. FISCAL YEAR 2001 BUDGET REQUEST For fiscal year 2001, we respectfully request that you provide $91 million for the targeted polio eradication efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,a $5 million increase from the fiscal year 2000 funding level, thereby meeting thePresident 's budget request. This $5 million increase is necessary to meet the meet the need for additional oral polio vaccine resulting from the accelerated immuniza-tion schedule in 2000. In addition, we must continue to meet the enormous costsof eradicating polio in its final stronghold \u2014sub-Saharan Africa. The underdeveloped and conflict-torn countries of Africa represent the greatest challenges to the successof the global Polio Eradication Initiative. This additional appropriation will allowthe CDC to help African nations accelerate polio eradication activities, improve sur-veillance for polio and other diseases, and support peace-building cease-fires forNIDs. Without the additional $5 million, we may not be able to eradicate polio inAfrica by the Target 2000 date, prolonging the need to continue expensive NIDs androutine immunization worldwide. The time for the final assault against polio is now. ERADICATING POLIO WILL SAVE THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST $230 MILLION ANNUALLY In 1998 the Chairman of the House Committee on International Relations com- missioned the General Accounting Office to investigate the soundness of WHO costestimates for the eradication or elimination of seven infectious diseases. The UnitedStates was a major force behind the successful eradication of the smallpox virus,and the GAO concluded that the eradication of smallpox has saved the UnitedStates some $17 billion to date. Even greater benefits will result from the eradi-cation of polio. Although polio-free since 1979, the United States currently spends at least $230 million annually to protect its newborns against the threat of importation of the po-liovirus, in addition to its investment in international polio eradication. Globally,over $1.5 billion U.S. dollars are spent annually to immunize children against polio.This figure does not even include the cost of treatment and rehabilitation of poliovictims, nor the immeasurable toll in human suffering which polio exacts from itsvictims and their families. Once polio is eradicated and immunization against it canbe discontinued, tremendous resources will be unfettered to focus on other healthpriorities. PROGRESS IN THE GLOBAL PROGRAM TO ERADICATE POLIO Thanks to your leadership in appropriating funds, the international effort to eradicate polio has made tremendous progress.392 \u2014Since the global initiative began in 1988, 3 million children in the developing world, who otherwise would have become paralyzed with polio, are walking be-cause they have been immunized. \u2014The number of polio cases has fallen from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 \u2014of which 35,000 were reported \u2014to approximately 6,000 reported cases in 1999. More than 180 countries are polio-free, including 4 of the 5 most populous coun-tries in the world (China, U.S., Indonesia and Brazil). \u2014Almost 2 billion children worldwide have been immunized during NIDs in the last 5 years, including 147 million in a single day in India. During 74 NationalImmunization Days, 16 Sub-National Immunization Days and 7 Mopping-up ac-tivities conducted in 1999, over 450 million children received oral polio vaccine.This represents nearly 75 percent of all the world 's children under the age of five. \u2014All polio-endemic countries in the world have conducted NIDs \u2014most recently in Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of the Congo. The achievement of suc-cessful NIDs and implementation of APF surveillance in Somalia and Sudanshows that polio eradication strategies can be implemented in all countries. T H ER O L EO FT H EU .S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Rotary commends the CDC for its leadership in the global polio eradication effort, and greatly appreciates your Subcommittee 's support of the CDC 's polio eradication activities. For 2000, you appropriated a total of $87.2 million for the CDC 's global polio eradication activities. Because of Congress ' unprecedented support, in 2000 the CDC is: \u2014Supporting the international assignment of more than 110 long-term epi- demiologists, virologists, and technical officers to assist the World Health Orga-nization and polio-endemic countries to implement polio eradication strategies,and 10 technical staff to assist UNICEF and polio-endemic countries. This in-cludes 30 CDC staff provided directly on assignment to WHO and UNICEF. \u2014Providing over $60 million to UNICEF for approximately 700 million doses of polio vaccine and operational costs for NIDs in some 60 countries in Asia, East-ern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Many of these NIDs would not takeplace without the assurance of the CDC 's support. \u2014Providing over $20 million to WHO for surveillance and NIDs ' operational costs, primarily in Africa. As successful NIDs take place, surveillance has emerged asa critical need, to determine where polio cases are continuing to occur. Goodsurveillance can save resources by eliminating the need for extensive immuniza-tion campaigns if it is determined that polio circulation is limited to a specificlocale. \u2014The leading specialized polio reference lab in the world providing the largest volume of both operational (poliovirus isolation) and technologically sophisti-cated (genetic sequencing of polio viruses) lab support to the 148 laboratoriesof the global polio laboratory network. \u2014Serving as the primary technical support agency to WHO on scientific and pro- grammatic issues regarding: (1) laboratory containment of wild poliovirus stocksfollowing polio eradication, and (2) when and how to stop polio vaccinationworldwide following global certification of polio eradication in 2005. OTHER BENEFITS OF POLIO ERADICATION Increased political and financial support for childhood immunization has many documented long-term benefits. Polio eradication is helping countries to developpublic health and disease surveillance systems useful in the control of other vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Already, much of Latin America is free of measles,due in part to improvements in the public health infrastructure implemented duringthe war on polio. As a result of this success, measles has been targeted for eradi-cation in the Americas by the year 2000. The disease surveillance system \u2014the net- work of laboratories and trained personnel built up during the Polio Eradication Ini-tiative \u2014is now being used to track measles, Chagas, neonatal tetanus, and other deadly infectious diseases. NIDs have been used as an opportunity to give childrenessential vitamin A, as well as polio vaccine. The campaign to eliminate polio fromcommunities has led to increased public awareness of the benefits of immunization,creating a ''culture of immunization '' and resulting in increased usage of primary health care and higher immunization rates for other vaccines. It has improved pub-lic health communications and taught nations important lessons about vaccine stor-age and distribution, and the logistics of organizing nation-wide health programs.Lastly, the unprecedented cooperation between the public and private sectors servesas a model for other public health initiatives.393 RESOURCES NEEDED TO FINISH THE JOB OF POLIO ERADICATION The World Health Organization estimates that $1 billion is needed from donors for the period 2000 -2005 to help polio-endemic countries carry out the polio eradi- cation strategy. The estimated shortfall for the years 2000 -2001 now stands at ap- proximately $300 million. In the Americas, some 80 percent of the cost of polioeradication efforts were borne by the national governments themselves. However, asthe battle against polio is taken to the poorest, least-developed nations on earth,and those in the midst of civil conflict, many of the remaining polio-endemic nationscan contribute only a small percentage of the needed funds. In some countries, upto 100 percent of the NID and other polio eradication costs must be met by externaldonor sources. We are asking that the United States continue to take the leadershiprole in meeting this shortfall. The United States ' commitment to polio eradication has stimulated other coun- tries to increase their support. Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Italy are amongthose countries that have followed America 's lead and have recently announced spe- cial grants for the global Polio Eradication Initiative. Japan has also expanded itssupport to polio eradication efforts in Africa. Germany has made major grants thatwill help India eradicate polio by the target year 2000. In December 1999 theUnited Kingdom announced two grants totaling U.S. $94.6 million for polio eradi-cation efforts in India and Africa. The Government of India will receive U.S. $62.6toward its Pulse Polio Initiative over the next two years. In addition, the U.K. willgrant a total of U.S. $32 million to African nations that are poliovirus reservoirs,affected by conflict or both. These nations include Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia,Sudan, DR Congo and Angola. By the time polio has been eradicated, Rotary International expects to have ex- pended approximately $500 million on the effort \u2014the largest private contribution to a public health initiative ever. Of this, $373 million has already been allocatedfor polio vaccine, operational costs, laboratory surveillance, cold chain, training andsocial mobilization in 120 countries. More importantly, we have mobilized tens ofthousands of Rotarians to work together with their national ministries of health,UNICEF and WHO, and with health providers at the grassroots level in thousandsof communities. Polio eradication is the most cost-effective public health investment, as its benefits accrue forever. The world will begin to ''break even '' on its investment in polio eradi- cation only two years after the virus has been vanquished. When we reach the summit, we will be able look out upon a world in which the scourge of polio is a thing of the past. This will be our gift to the children of thetwenty-first century. Thank you for this opportunity to present written testimony. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is pleased to provide a written statement on the fiscal year 2001 appropriation for the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC). The ASM is the largest single life science society in theworld with more than 42,000 members representing a broad spectrum of subspecial-ties, including microbiologists who work in clinical, public health, biomedical and in-dustrial laboratories. The ASM appreciates the Subcommittee 's ongoing support of the CDC, particularly for the CDC 's National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which funds programs, addressed in this statement, related to emerging and drugresistant infectious diseases, public health infrastructure, bioterrorism preparednessand food safety. The ASM endorses the recommendation of the CDC Coalition to increase the over- all CDC budget to a level of $4.1 billion, an amount that exceeds the President 's budget request by approximately $600 million. The CDC requires additional new re-sources to respond to an array of continuing and new public health challenges. Asthe ''Nation 's Prevention Agency, '' the CDC is charged with promoting health and quality of life by anticipating, identifying, preventing and controlling diseases andother public health threats. The CDC must have adequate resources to expect andbe prepared for unexpected public health emergencies throughout the country andacross the globe, including, for example, a bioterrorism event, a global influenzapandemic, a large scale environmental disease threat or an unforeseen public healthdanger. In the following statement, the ASM will focus on specific areas within the CDC budget which are of concern to the microbiological community.394 EMERGING AND DRUG RESISTANT INFECTIOUS DISEASES : PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS AND NEEDS The American people benefit from a well-funded and effective federal health sys- tem. In the past year, the rapid response by health officials identified an outbreakof West Nile encephalitis in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey; linked E. coliO157:H7 infection at an upstate New York county fair to contaminated water; andtied a multi-state outbreak of Listeria infections to contaminated hotdogs and cold-cut meats manufactured at a single plant. These successes are due to state-of-the-art molecular laboratory diagnostic tools, as well as to coordinated communicationsand disease reporting systems among health agencies. Initiated in 1995 by the CDC,the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases cooperative agree-ments are helping to rebuild the nation 's public health infrastructure at state and local levels, and making possible success against infectious disease outbreaks. In fis-cal year 1999 CDC awarded more than $40 million to all states and four cities toboost preparedness against possible chemical and biological terrorism, and devel-oped laboratory protocols for several of the possible bioterrorism agents to sharewith state and local laboratories. In 1999 the CDC also distributed nearly 300,000copies of recommendations for prevention and control of hepatitis C infection (HCV)infection and HCV-related liver disease to physicians and health care providers na-tionwide. The ASM recognizes and applauds the breadth of the CDC 's contributions to these and other successful public health campaigns. Despite positive past experiences,however, the vigilance needed against disease will only intensify as we movethrough the 21st century. The blood-borne hepatitis C virus, for example, has in-fected more than 4 million persons in the United States, 3 million of whom remainchronically infected and therefore at risk for developing cirrhosis or liver cancer. Inthis country each year, 8000 to 10000 die from cirrhosis or primary liver cancer. TheCDC is coordinating the Hepatitis C Public Information Campaign, aimed towardnotifying all prior transfusion recipients at risk for HIV infection. It will continueongoing investigations into various risk factors and modes of transmission, as wellas collaborate with other groups like the American Liver Foundation to educate thepublic about HCV. Sufficient funding would strengthen and expand thismultipronged effort against HCV infection. Like the hepatitis viruses, both ''old'' and newly emerging or reemerging infectious diseases will continue to challenge our so-ciety 's well-being and productivity, and thus make even more imperative an ade- quately funded federal public health agency. The CDC is recognized the world over for its efforts to combat the threats of new, emerging and drug resistant infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are a crisis ofglobal proportions which threaten gains in health and life expectancy and which arenow the world 's biggest killer of children and young adults. Substantial new funding is needed to enable CDC to fully implement its comprehensive plan, ''Preventing In- fectious Diseases: A Strategy for the 21st Century. '' The additional $25 million re- quested for this initiative in the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget would not provide adequate resources needed to fully implement the next phase of the plan.The ASM concurs with other supporters of the CDC that an additional $162 millionwould achieve in the appropriate time frame the CDC goals set forth in 1998 foremerging infections. These goals include a broad range of improvements to such crit-ical functions as detection and prevention of emerging pathogens, communicationamong all levels of government health agencies, and integration of laboratoryscience with on-site epidemiology. Also targeted in the 1998 plan was the alarming trend toward antimicrobial re- sistance among pathogenic microorganisms. Approximately 28 percent of bacteriathat cause hospital-acquired infections in the United States, for example, are resist-ant to the specific antibiotic once considered most effective against that particularinfection. Especially problematic is the reduced susceptibility of Staphylococcusaureus to vancomycin. The CDC has specific plans to address this problem whichwill require sufficient funding: improved clinical guidelines for antibiotic usage; bet-ter public education on the issue of overuse of antibiotics; research on antibiotic re-sistance genetic markers as monitoring devices; and a national surveillance systemto assess the overall impact of antibiotic resistance. PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE The ASM recommends that Congress increase the budget requested to modernize the CDC 's outmoded, severely inadequate and deteriorating physical plant. CDC needs funding and authority to modernize existing laboratory and support facilitiesand construct new facilities according to its long range facilities master plan whichaddresses building and facilities needs through the year 2009. Almost all of CDC 's395 laboratory capacity is currently dangerously antiquated, unsafe and unsuitable for modern scientific research activities related to CDC 's public health role. CDC has experienced substantial program growth in recent years, and facilities have not keptpace with new programs created in response to an increasing number of dangerousthreats from deadly pathogens. The ASM recommends that Congress provide atleast the $127 million requested (an additional $70 million over fiscal year 2000)for CDC infrastructure needs and consider providing an even higher level of $175million to fully meet the facilities needs and repairs at CDC and accelerate plannedconstruction and upgrades. BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE The CDC has established a national effort to protect the public 's health in the event of a biological or chemical terrorist attack. The initiative builds on the effortsbegun at CDC in fiscal year 1999 that focused on building core capacity within CDCand in states to establish clinical laboratory surveillance, information technologyand epidemiologic expertise for the highest probability agents. The ASM notes thatfunding for CDC bioterrorism preparedness activities decreases by $6.5 million toa level of $148.5 million in the Administration 's budget request. Current funding levels permit only partial implementation of this program, leaving many states andcities with limited or no coverage in some key preparedness areas. Additional fund-ing would allow more state and local health departments to build capacity in essen-tial areas of biological and chemical preparedness including: planing, surveillanceand epidemiology, biological and chemical laboratory services and electronic commu-nication. A recent Institute of Medicine report on ''Chemical and Biological Terrorism: Re- search and Development to Improve Civilian Medical Response, '' stresses the need for long-term public health infrastructure improvements. Bioterrorism preparednessis also a part of CDC 's larger effort to reinvest in the public health system to estab- lish capability to respond to naturally occurring infectious disease threats. The ASMsupports the requested $2 million for CDC deterrence efforts to monitor laboratorycompliance with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and toensure the safe handling of potential threat agents in diagnostic and research lab-oratories. FOODBORNE AND WATERBORNE DISEASES While often not as dramatic as a newly identified infection, foodborne and water- borne disease outbreaks in recent years have been sudden and deadly. The CDCrightly has not neglected this ever-present threat to the American public. In collabo-ration with the FDA and USDA, the CDC has revitalized measures against furtheroutbreaks caused by contaminated food and water supplies. For example, the CDCPulseNet program, now in more than 30 states, enables local health departmentsto rapidly identify the microbial agents responsible for an outbreak, by utilizingmodern molecular fingerprinting technologies. Rapid response is essential in suchoutbreaks, as spread of infection can occur if the food or water source is not quicklyidentified and removed. Foodborne diseases alone are estimated to cause 5,000deaths and 76 million illnesses in the United States yearly. Therefore, the ASM rec-ommends approval of the Administration 's proposed increase of $10 million for foodborne diseases as part of the CDC budget for infectious diseases in fiscal year2001. COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY An investment today in the CDC is an investment in tomorrow 's public health. Finding our way safely through the maze of public health problems often seemscostly, but the collective price tag of infectious disease in death, illness, and dollars is alarming. For instance, hospital-acquired infections kill 88,000 people annually inUnited States and cost more than $4.5 billion each year. Public health officials esti-mate that foodborne illness costs this nation 's economy several billion dollars annu- ally. Just in this country, the influenza pandemics of 1957 -1958 and 1968 -1969 cre- ated combined economic losses of about $32 billion (1995 dollars). Monetary savings, of course, are not the only reward from a strong, innovative, and forward-looking public health system in the United States. More importantly,the American public rightly receives physical and emotional benefits from its long-standing support of medical and scientific research. Those benefits may be directand obvious, such as identification of contaminated water supplies, or less obviousbut equally important, as in the case of a strengthened infrastructure for publichealth to develop and share health-related technologies and information amonghealth agencies. A reinvigorated public health system with effective programs will396 help protect the public against existing and emerging threats, such as antimicrobial resistance, chronic diseases with infectious origins and pandemic influenza. Thank you for the opportunity to provide a written statement for the hearing record on the CDC 's fiscal year 2001 appropriations. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEAMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION Chances are heart attack or stroke will be the death or disabler of you or a loved one. Heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases remain America 's lead- ing cause of death and a main cause of disability. Cardiovascular diseases accountfor nearly 1 of every 2 deaths in the U.S. The American Heart Association is dedicated to reducing death and disability from heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. We commend this Com-mittee for making fiscal year 2000 funding for the National Institutes of Health andthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a top priority. But, we are con-cerned that our government is still not devoting sufficient resources for research andprevention of America 's No. 1 killer \u2014heart disease \u2014and to our country 's No. 3 kill- er and a leading disabler \u2014stroke. Heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases have been America 's No. 1 killer since 1919. Nearly 60 million Americans \u20141 in 5 \u2014of all ages suffer from one or more of these diseases. Hundreds of millions of Americans have major risk factorsfor these diseases \u2014about 50 million have high blood pressure, 40 million have ele- vated blood cholesterol (240 mg/dL), 49 million smoke, 106 million adults are obeseor overweight and 10 million have physician-diagnosed diabetes. As the babyboomers age, the number of Americans afflicted by these often disabling diseaseswill increase substantially. Cardiovascular diseases cost Americans more than anyother disease. Americans will pay an estimated $327 billion for cardiovascular-re-lated medical costs and lost productivity in 2000. These diseases constitute 4 of thetop 5 hospital costs for all payers, excluding childbirth and its complications, and4 of the top 5 Medicare hospital costs. Heart disease is also the leading cause ofpremature, permanent disability of American workers, accounting for nearly 20 per-cent of Social Security disability payments. HOW YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE Now is the time to capitalize on a century of progress in understanding heart at- tack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Promising, cost effective break-throughs in treatment and prevention are on the horizon. We challenge our govern-ment to stay the course to double funding by year 2003 for NIH, for heart andstroke research and to translate research into effective clinical and community ini-tiatives. This will cut health care costs and improve quality of life. For fiscal year2001 we urge you to do the following. \u2014Appropriate a 15 percent increase over fiscal year 2000 funding for the overall NIH\u2014the third step toward the goal of doubling the budget by year 2003. This goal is echoed by groups such as Research!America and the Ad Hoc Group forMedical Research Funding. NIH research provides cutting-edge treatment and prevention strategies, cuts health care costs, creates jobs and maintains America 's status as the world leader in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries. \u2014Provide a 15 percent increase over fiscal year 2000 funding for NIH heart re- search and stroke research. Researchers are on the brink of advances that could pave the way to prevention and even a cure so you or a loved one will be spared pain and suffering from heartdisease and stroke. \u2014Allot a $25.2 million increase over fiscal year 2000 funding to expand CDC 's Cardiovascular Health Program to 11 more states for a total of 29 states. We must make our science real and applicable through community interventions that encourage Americans to make healthful lifestyle choices to prevent heart dis-ease and stroke. HEART AND STROKE RESEARCH BENEFITS ALL AMERICANS Thanks to advances in addressing risk factors and in treating cardiovascular dis- eases, more Americans are surviving heart attack and stroke. Heart and stroke re-search and prevention breakthroughs are saving and improving lives. Several cut-ting-edge examples follow. \u2014Emergency Cardiac Care .\u2014Daily more than 700 Americans suffer sudden car- diac arrest \u2014the unexpected, abrupt loss of heart function. A particular se-397 quence of actions known as the ''chain of survival '' offers hope. Early use of both breathing and chest compression techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitationand delivery of a powerful electrical shock to re-start the heart are critical torestore life. Each minute of delay in returning the heart to its normal rhythmdecreases chance of survival by 10 percent. Our Operation Heartbeat Program,alone, estimates that 100,000 lives could be saved if automatic externaldefibrillators were more widely available. \u2014Advanced Imaging Technology .\u2014Research has revolutionized imaging tech- nology to diagnose heart disease. You probably know someone who has had anangiogram. In this procedure, a catheter is inserted in an artery and navigatedup to the heart. Then a dye is injected so x-rays can show artery narrowing that can trigger a heart attack or a stroke. About 1.2 million patients in 1997 werehospitalized for this procedure which causes discomfort and risk of infection andbleeding, and in rare cases, heart attack or stroke. Now angiograms are beingreplaced by two new imaging procedures that are easier, safer and cheaper. Thehigh speed CT scan takes fast pictures, producing a measure of blockages in ar-teries to the heart, and help doctors better tailor treatments. Three-dimensionalcoronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), uses strong magnets to pro-vide detailed images of the arteries to the heart. Taking less than an hour,MRA evaluates heart anatomy and other heart functions, providing a com-prehensive, noninvasive, heart examination. \u2014Surgery to Reduce Risk for Stroke .\u2014In many cases surgeons can prevent stroke by removing the buildup of plaque from the main artery to the brain that isseverely narrowed. Also, it helps stroke survivors reduce their risk of anotherstroke. About 140,000 procedures are performed each year. \u2014State-of-the-Art Life-extending drugs .\u2014Research has produced new drugs to help prevent and treat heart attack and stroke. Cutting-edge drugs to control bloodpressure and cholesterol are more effective than ever in saving lives and en-hancing quality of life. When prevention fails, revolutionary ''clotbuster '' drugs can reduce disability from heart attack and stroke by dissolving blood clotscausing the attack. Use of t -PA, within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms, can restore blood flow through the clot-obstructed artery and reduce chances of per-manent disability by 33 percent, saving health care costs. T -PA offers hope for the estimated 1.1 million Americans who will suffer a heart attack and 450,000at risk of a clot-caused stroke this year. So Americans can continue to benefit from these types of breakthroughs, we sup- port a doubling of the overall NIH budget by year 2003. We recommend an fiscalyear 2001 appropriation of $20.5 billion for the NIH, the third step toward that goal.We have a special interest in individual NIH entities that relate directly to our mis-sion. Our funding recommendations for these institutes and programs follow. HEART RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR NHLBI The above and other advances have been made possible by more than 50 years of American Heart Association-sponsored research and more than a half-century ofinvestment by Congress in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Thanksto research, no longer does a heart attack or stroke necessarily mean immediatedeath. Now that more Americans are surviving, heart attack and stroke can meanpermanent disability, requiring costly medical care and loss of productivity andquality of life. We urge this Committee to double the NHLBI budget, including heart research, by year 2003. As the next step toward reaching this goal, we advocate an fiscal year2001 appropriation of $2.330 billion for the NHLBI, with $1.355 billion for heartand stroke-related research. A funding level of this amount will allow NHLBI to ex-pand existing programs and invest in promising new initiatives. Several challengesand opportunities to advance the battle against heart disease are highlighted below. \u2014Promoting Adherence to Medical and Behavioral Therapies .\u2014Failure to follow medical recommendations causes tens of thousands of deaths a year, increasedhospitalizations and delayed recovery, costing Americans $100 billion annually.An estimated 50 percent of patients do not comply with prescribed treatments.Many life-extending drugs for heart attack survivors and heart failure patientsare underused. Medical advances are continually improving chances of survivalfor Americans who suffer from or are at high risk of heart attack, stroke andother cardiovascular diseases. Not all patients or doctors take advantage of in-formation we now know will reduce or treat Americans at risk of heart diseaseor stroke. Innovative theories about behavioral, cultural, social, psychological,and environmental methods to increase adherence to lifestyle and medical regi-mens must be tested. Research is needed on effective indicators to measure398 standard of delivery of care of health systems and to change physician behavior and practices. Increased funding in this area will lead to development of bettermethods for getting patients and healthcare providers to adhere to cost-effec-tive, lifesaving therapies. \u2014Immune System Research Programs for Heart Disease .\u2014Basic knowledge about the body 's disease fighting system is increasing rapidly, particularly in its in- volvement in the causes and development of heart disease and stroke. Innova-tive approaches are needed to use this knowledge to accelerate progress frombasic knowledge to clinical applications. Promising areas that merit further re-search include, inflammatory response to blood vessel injury that occurs in ath-erosclerosis (the cause of most heart attacks and strokes); healing of damaged heart tissues after a heart attack; and chronic rejection following heart trans-plantation. Increased funding in this area would better identify those at riskand may lead to revolutionary treatments to prevent heart disease and stroke. \u2014Maintaining Weight Loss .\u2014An estimated 106 million Americans age 20 and older are overweight or obese, a condition that increases risk of diseases suchas heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes. Clinical Guidelineson the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity inAdults, supported by NHLBI and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestiveand Kidney Diseases, reviews evidence that it is possible for overweight andobese Americans to lose a large amount of weight over six months, but only afew maintain it. Increased funding is needed to start studies to improve under-standing of weight loss maintenance. Researchers must examine behaviors thatinfluence obesity, weight loss and weight loss maintenance. \u2014Heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in women .\u2014Cardio- vascular diseases remain a main cause of disability and the No. 1 killer ofAmerican females, killing more than 500,000 a year. Cardiovascular diseaseskill more females than the next 14 causes of death combined. They kill morefemales than males. About 1 in 5 females live with consequences of cardio-vascular diseases. The clinical course of cardiovascular disease is different inwomen than in men and current diagnostic capabilities are less accurate inwomen than in men. Once a woman develops a cardiovascular disease, she ismore likely than a man to have continuing health problems and is more likelyto die from it. Despite the seriousness of these diseases, they are largely unrec-ognized by both women and their doctors. Additional funding is needed to allowNHLBI to expand research on cardiovascular diseases in women and to createmore informational and educational programs for female patients and healthcare providers on cardiovascular diseases risk factors as authorized under Pub-lic Law 105 -340, the Women 's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998. STROKE RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR NINDS Stroke is a major cause of disability and America 's No. 3 killer. America 's 4.4 mil- lion stroke survivors often face debilitating physical and mental impairment, emo-tional distress and overwhelming medical costs. An estimated 600,000 Americanswill suffer a stroke this year. Considered a disease that strikes our grandparents,stroke also afflicts newborns, children and young adults. More Americans are dyingfrom stroke than ever before. We urge a doubling of the stroke research budget through the NINDS by year 2003. An fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $1.184 billion for NINDS, with $125 mil-lion for stroke research, the next step toward the goal, will allow the NINDS to ex-pand studies and start new research to prevent stroke, protect the brain duringstroke and enhance rehabilitation. Some challenges and opportunities follow. \u2014Emerging Stroke Risk Factors .\u2014Many Americans are controlling major stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure and smoking, yet the number of peoplefalling victim to stroke continues to rise. With the growing number of strokes,scientists are defining new stroke risk factors, re-examining existing ones andreconsidering a long-held belief that no difference exists in risk between youngand older patients with similar risk factors. Researchers are studying heartvalve disease coupled with an irregular heartbeat; elevated white blood cellcount that signals an infection leading to inflammation and clogging of arteries;long-term effects of previous high blood pressure; and high levels of C-reactiveprotein in blood that signals inflammation of blood vessels. Increased fundingto study these areas may lead to new ways to prevent stroke. \u2014Therapeutic Strategies for Stroke .\u2014Several major clinical trials investigating drugs and techniques have identified progressive methods for preventing andtreating stroke in high risk populations. But, more drugs and procedures to pre-399 vent strokes need to be developed and evaluated. Funding for new clinical stud- ies are crucial for advancing additional cutting-edge stroke treatment and pre-vention. \u2014Public and Professional Education for Stroke .\u2014T-PA is the first effective FDA- approved emergency treatment for clot-caused stroke. Yet, only 5 percent ofthose eligible for t -PA receive it. As a member of the Brain Attack Coalition, a group of national organizations committed to fighting stroke, we are workingwith NINDS to increase public awareness of stroke symptoms and appropriateemergency action. Together, we are sponsoring and distributing a televised PSAon this issue and striving to develop systems to make t -PA readily available to appropriate patients. When these systems are fully implemented, stroketreatment will change from supportive care to early brain-saving intervention.More funding is needed to educate the public about stroke symptoms and theneed for prompt treatment and to assure appropriate community response sys-tems are in place. More health professionals must be educated about t -PA and the need for rapid response. \u2014Acute Stroke Treatment Centers .\u2014Rapid, early treatment must be available to stroke victims who arrive in the emergency department within the three-hourwindow of opportunity for t -PA. Funding to develop acute stroke treatment cen- ters is key to rapid early treatment. These centers would provide 24-hour emer-gency transportation, emergency department physician and nurse, a neurologistor stroke specialist, access to a diagnostic neuroradiologist or stroke professionalwith experiencing in reading and interpreting brain images and aneurosurgeron for treatment of bleeding stroke and serious complications. Thecenters would provide an opportunity for new stroke treatments to be evaluatedearly when they could have the most beneficial effect. RESEARCH IN OTHER NIH INSTITUTES BENEFIT HEART & STROKE National Institute on Aging defines how the aging process contributes to cardio- vascular diseases, a main disabler and No. 1 killer of older Americans. An fiscalyear 2001 appropriation of $62 million for cardiovascular research will allow con-tinuation of studies and expansion into promising areas. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases studies help in reducing cardiovascular disease death and disability. We advocate an fiscal year2001 appropriation of $1.313 billion for the NIDDK to advance research to help dia-betics, 2/3 of whom die from heart disease or stroke. National Institute of Nursing Research studies play a key role in promoting self- care and patient education. NINR research is critical to primary and secondary pre-vention of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. We advocate anfiscal year 2001 appropriation of $103 million for the NINR. Animal research is critical for heart and stroke research. We support an fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $776.3 million for the National Center for Research Re-sources to help institutions and researchers get animals and provide humane care.Increased resources will fortify animal research, help correct deficiencies in researchanimal resources and strengthen Clinical Research Area Centers and BiomedicalTechnology and Infrastructure Areas. AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY AHRQ, the lead health care quality agency, acts as a ''science partner '' with public and private health care sectors in improving health care quality, reducing its costsand broadening access to essential services. AHRQ is an active participant in devel-oping evidence-based information needed by consumers, providers, health plans andpolicymakers to improve health care decision making. We concur with the Friendsof AHRQ 's recommendation of an appropriation of $300 million for the AHRQ to im- prove health care quality, reduce medical errors and expand availability of healthoutcomes information. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION The best way to protect the health of Americans and lessen the enormous finan- cial burden of disease is through prevention. Your commitment cannot stop at thelaboratory door. You must fund the work that brings research into the places whereheart disease and stroke live \u2014the towns and neighborhoods that populate America. The CDC builds the bridge between what we learn in the lab and how we live in communities. CDC sets the pace on prevention. We recommend an fiscal year2001 appropriation of $4.1 billion for CDC, with a doubling of the chronic diseaseprevention line for at total of $570 million.400 As a result of the efforts of this Committee, since fiscal year 1998, CDC 's Cardio- vascular Health Program will cover 18 states. This initiative allows states to design/and or implement programs to meet local needs to prevent and control heart attack,stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. In 1997, CDC released a report outliningwhat the nation 's priorities should be in chronic disease prevention. The report, Un- realized Prevention Opportunities: Reducing the Health and Economic Burden ofChronic Disease, said ''strong chronic disease prevention programs should be in place in every state to target the leading causes of death and disability in our soci-ety \u2014and their principal risk factors. '' Until the Appropriations Committee started a comprehensive Cardiovascular Health Program in fiscal year 1998, the CDC-ad-ministered Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant was the only sourceof federal funding to states for targeting cardiovascular diseases, the No. 1 killerin every state. We laud this Committee 's creation and expansion of a state-based cardiovascular health program that will be in 18 states in fiscal year 2000. An fiscal year 2001appropriation of $50 million for the Cardiovascular Health Program will allow CDCto expand it to 11 more states for a total of 29 states. The WISEWOMAN Program uses CDC 's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program to also screen uninsured and low-income women age 50and older for heart disease and stroke risk factors. We commend this Committeefor providing funding to expand the program to seven states. An appropriation of$20 million will allow CDC to support 20 states in WISEWOMAN. The Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant is a vital resource for states in addressing heart disease and stroke. It is critical in helping states withtheir role in preventing chronic diseases. We recommend an fiscal year 2001 appro-priation of $210 million for the PHHSBG. We urge the Committee to address, asthe Unrealized Prevention Opportunities document points out, the need to targetrisk factors. We support CDC 's efforts to build: \u2014a comprehensive nutrition and physical activity program with an appropriation of $30 million; \u2014a national program to prevent tobacco use, including a public education cam- paign to reduce youth access to tobacco, through CDC 's Office of Smoking and Health with an appropriation of $130 million; and \u2014a comprehensive school health education program with an appropriation of $25 million. Coupled with a nationwide Cardiovascular Health Program, these initiatives will advance the fight against heart disease and stroke. We urge you to make cardio-vascular health a national priority. ACTION NEEDED Significantly increasing resources for research and community intervention pro- grams will allow this nation to continue making strides in the battle against heartattack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH MEDICAL RESEARCH PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN 'SHEALTH , OBSTETRIC AND NEONATAL NURSES The Association of Women 's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the fiscal year 2001 appropriations fornursing education, research, and workforce programs, as well as programs designed to improve maternal and child health. AWHONN is a membership organization of22,000 nurses whose mission is to promote the health of women and newborns.AWHONN members are registered nurses, nurse practitioners, certified nurse mid-wives, and clinical nurse specialists who work in hospitals, physicians ' offices, uni- versities and community clinics across North America as well as in the ArmedForces around the world. AWHONN appreciates the support that this Subcommittee has provided for nurs- ing education, research and workforce programs, as well as maternal and childhealth programs in the past. We realize that there are many competing prioritiesfor the Subcommittee members, and we appreciate your consistent support.401 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AWHONN joins many others in supporting a 15 percent increase for the National Institutes of Health in fiscal year 2001. With the leadership provided by this Sub-committee, Congress is well on its way to doubling NIH funding by 2003. In addi-tion to the overall support, there are two specific funding recommendations thatAWHONN recommends within NIH. National Institute of Nursing Research AWHONN encourages this Subcommittee to support the professional judgement budget request of $110 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research(NINR). One of AWHONN 's top priorities is a $20 million dollar increase in funding for the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). NINR engages in significant re-search affecting areas such as: research on health disparities in ethnic groups, train-ing opportunities in genetic research and in health disparities, and studying tele-health interventions in rural/underserved populations. These research programs di-rectly affect patients and families and contribute to decreased medical costs and in-creased quality of patient care. In addition, NINR research improves outcomes for women and children. A report by the U.S. Agency for Health Care states that the most common reason for hospitaladmission in the United States is childbirth. This accounts for 3.8 million annualhospital admissions. This is a joyous event in most women 's lives, but complications of pregnancy such as pre-term birth and low birthweight infants are some of themore expensive reasons for hospitalization. Nurse research has helped redesign caredelivery models that optimize pregnancy outcomes and shorten hospital stays forvulnerable low birthweight babies. For example, NINR-funded projects have contributed to breakthroughs in nursing that have improved infant health after hospital discharge for at-risk mothers andbabies. One model utilized home follow-up assessment and care by an advancedpractice nurse and showed decreased health system costs by shortening the lengthof stay of the infant and avoiding subsequent re-hospitalization. Because of the emphasis on biomedical research in this country, there are few sources of funds for high-quality behavioral research for nursing other than NINR.It is critical that we increase funding in this area in an effort to improve the con-sumer 's experience with the health care system, optimize patient outcomes and de- crease the need for extended hospitalization. National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) AWHONN supports the professional judgment budget, which includes an increase of $294 million, bringing the appropriation for NICHD to just over $1 billion. NICHD seeks to ensure that every baby is born healthy, that women suffer no adverse consequences from pregnancy, and that all children have the opportunityto fulfill their potential for a healthy and productive life unhampered by disease ordisability. With increased funding NICHD could expand its use of the NICHD Ma-ternal-Fetal Medicine Network to study ways to reduce the incidence of low birthweight. Prematurity/low birthweight is the second leading cause of infant mortalityin the United States and the leading cause of death among African American in-fants. AWHONN, like many organizations directly involved in initiates to improvethe health of women and newborns, looks to NICHD to provide national initiatives,such as the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network to assist with the care of pregnantwomen and babies. On specific example of the important research that evolves from NICHD is re- search that led to the remarkable reduction in the rate of HIV transmission frommother to infant during pregnancy and birth. In fact, this past year, grantees fo-cused on treatment that reduces the viral load during pregnancy finding that therisk of HIV transmission from mother to infant can be further reduced. Additionally,NICHD, in collaboration with NIAID, is now conducting studies to evaluate whethernevirapine, administered during the time a mother is breastfeeding can reduce therate of HIV transmission through breast milk. The results of these studies andmany others will lead to significant advances in ensuring that babies are bornhealthy, while decreasing maternal morbidity. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Nurse Education Act (NEA) AWHONN is requesting an increase of 15 percent over fiscal year 2000 to fund the NEA at approximately $78 million. Fiscal year 2000 funding for the NEA was$67.8 million.402 The Nurse Education Act (Public Health Service Act Title VIII) helps schools of nursing and nursing students prepare to meet patient needs in a changing healthcare delivery system, favoring programs in institutions that train nurses for practicein medically underserved communities and Health Professional Shortage Areas. Re-authorized as the Nursing Workforce Development section in 1998, the new NEAgives the Department of Health and Human Services more discretion over the focusof federal spending, while keeping with previous goals. In addition, funds from theNurse Education Act support projects that would increase educational opportunitiesfor minority nurses who would then be able to provide culturally competent, linguis-tically appropriate health care services to underserved communities. AWHONN supports the continued designation of funds for education and training of critically needed primary care providers \u2014advanced practice nurses. These nurses \u2014clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners and certified nurse-mid- wives \u2014have historically provided a pool of qualified providers for underserved com- munities. Advanced practice nurses are providing services in communities wherephysician services are sometimes not even available. Due to the current demand forthese services, and expected increases in demand, it is critical that the Division ofNursing, through the Health Resources Services Administration, is provided thefunding to address the education and training needs of this essential pool of pro-viders. While many advance practice nurses are providing greatly needed services in crit- ical areas, the nursing community is facing shortages in nurses with the com-petence, skills and experience to meet the demands for complex patient care. Withgreater frequency we are receiving calls from our members reporting gaps in staff-ing resulting from fewer and fewer available professional registered nurses. We un-derstand that at this time the nursing shortage is regional in nature, but the entirenursing community is anticipating a significant professional nurse shortage to peakaround 2010. With the increasing technical complexity of the health care system, it is critical that a pool of highly skilled and experienced professional nurses beavailable to safeguard the health of our nation. We anticipate that the aging babyboomer generation will require more health care resources in 2010 at the time whenthere will be a historic low in nurse supply. While we wait for the results of themost recent nurse sample survey to confirm these concerns, AWHONN believes itis critical that Congress act to ensure the continued supply of professional nursesin our nation. Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Because of the increasing demands for the services provided through this block grant, AWHONN recommends a substantial increase for the Maternal Child HealthBlock Grant to $800 million for fiscal year 2001. This program provides comprehensive, preventive care for mothers and young children, as well as an array of coordinated services for children with special needs.MCH programs are facing increased demands for services due to continued growthin the Children 's Health Insurance Program, which in turn identifies more children who are eligible for other MCH Services. Title V complements Medicaid and theState Children 's Health Insurance Program by providing ''wrap-around '' services and enhanced access to care in underserved areas. Additional funding would give states the resources they need to expand prenatal and infancy home visitation programs, an approach that has been shown to improvethe prenatal health-related behavior of women and reduce rates of child abuse andneglect as well as maternal welfare dependence. Postpartum home visits can alsoincrease the percentage of mothers who choose to breastfeed. Many new motherscan get frustrated and stop breastfeeding in the first few days; a visit from a quali-fied health care provider can greatly encourage women to continue breastfeeding.This can also positively impact the goals of the Healthy People 2010 initiative toraise the rate of initiation of breastfeeding to 75 percent and the six-month rate ofbreastfeeding to 50 percent. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION \u2014FOLIC ACID AWARENESS AWHONN recommends an increase to $20 million in the fiscal year 2001 appro- priation to enable CDC to effectively promote folic acid awareness. For over 30 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been deeply involved in the prevention of birth defects. The public health impact of birthdefects is tremendous. Of the four million babies born each year in the UnitedStates, approximately 150,000 are born with a serious birth defect. According toCDC, the lifetime costs of caring for infants born in 1992, with at least one birth403 1These birth defects include: Spina bifida, urinary obstruction, lower-limb and diaphrag-matic hernia. 1The ASM is a member of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding and endorses the Ad Hoc Group 's recommendation for NIH funding for fiscal year 2001.defect1or cerebral palsy was about $8 billion. The emotional and financial burden for the families with affected children is devastating. The first steps in preventing birth defects includes surveillance, to find out what types of birth defects are occurring, how often and where, and research into thecauses of birth defects. The ultimate goal of surveillance and research is to developand implement strategies to prevent birth defects. An example of such a preventionactivity is the current folic acid education campaign to prevent neural tube defects(NTDs). Each year in the United States, an estimated 2,500 babies are born withNTDs, birth defects of the brain and spinal cord, such as anencephaly and spinabifida. These NTDs are among the most serious, costly and preventable birth de-fects. The lifetime cost of each case of spina bifida in 1992 was estimated to be near-ly $300,000. Yet, up to 70 percent of NTDs can be prevented if all women of child- bearing age consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, beginning before pregnancy. In an effort to spread this information, AWHONN is working closely with the CDC, March of Dimes, and more than 40 public and private organizations, to coordi-nate a national educational campaign through the National Council on Folic Acid.Last year Congress increased funding for CDC 's efforts in support of the folic acid campaign from $1.5 to $2 million. However, current funding is woefully inadequate.We respectfully request that you provide the CDC $20 million in funding to preventthese serious birth defects. Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on these critical areas of fund- ing. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), representing over 42,000 research- ers and clinicians, recognizes with appreciation Congress ' historically strong support of medical research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is crit-ical to improving the health and well-being of all Americans. The ASM particularlycommends the leadership of Senators Specter and Harkin and the members of theSenate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Re-lated Agencies for providing a $17.8 billion appropriation for NIH in fiscal year2000. This investment in basic and clinical research will lead to further advancesin disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. As an organization knowledgeable about public health threats, the ASM rec- ommends that Congress increase the proposed fiscal year 2001 budget request forNIH to provide additional resources for basic and clinical research to address an in-creasingly complex set of scientific and medical challenges. The ASM endorses a$2.7 billion increase (15 percent) which would bring the NIH budget to $20.5 billionin fiscal year 2001. During the past two years, Congress has increased the NIHbudget by 15 percent each year, steps toward the goal of doubling the NIH budgetby 2003 1. One of the NIH 's highest priorities is the funding of medical research through re- search project grants, which generate new scientific knowledge and opportunities.Under the proposed fiscal year 2001 budget, the NIH estimates that it would sup-port 7,641 new and competing grants, a disturbing 1300 fewer grants than awardedin the current fiscal year. In addition, noncompeting and competing grants wouldbe allowed only a 2 and 2.1 percent inflation increase, respectively, well below the3 percent normally allowed and certainly well below general inflation rates. PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS There is no doubt that public health has benefited, not only in the United States but around the world, from bipartisan support for scientific research. The U.S. pub-lic expects and deserves, real advances in medicine and science. Through researchfunding, the NIH consistently contributes to our national health and to a real returnon the public 's financial investment. Advances from NIH supported research in the past year alone include the identification of a gene in salmonella bacteria linked topathogenicity and present in many other disease-causing bacteria, suggesting inno-vative approaches to antibiotics and vaccines. NIH supported scientists also dem-404 onstrated that an inexpensive and simple treatment regimen with the antiretroviral drug nevirapine can reduce transmission of the HIV virus from mother to infant.These and other impressive successes must continue in the fight against infectiousand chronic diseases and other threats to public health. Infectious diseases remain the third largest cause of death in the United States, and a number one killer worldwide. Globally, acute respiratory infection is the lead-ing infectious killer, responsible for 3.5 million deaths in 1998. Pneumonia and in-fluenza are the leading infectious killers in the United States, ranked 5th in pre-liminary data for 1998. In an age of medical miracles, stubborn infectious diseasessuch as malaria persist, new infectious diseases such as hantavirus are emergingand old infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) are reemerging. One-third of the world 's population has latent TB and multi-drug resistant TB cases have been reported from 45 states over a 5 year period. The disease is the 8th leading causeof death worldwide, and on the rise in this country. Another ''old'' disease, malaria, is undergoing a global resurgence, with 275 million cases annually resulting in anestimated 1.1 million deaths. In the United States, an estimated 271,000 people areliving with HIV infection, while the hepatitis C virus (a cause of cirrhosis and livercancer) has infected almost 4 million and kills about 9,000 annually. In the UnitedStates, the rate of new HIV/AIDS infections is 40,000 per year, and over 420,000people with AIDS have died as of June 20, 1999. The HIV/AIDS epidemic will soonbecome the worst epidemic of infectious diseases in recorded history, with over 16million people estimated to have already died from AIDS at the end of 1999 and33.6 million living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Vaccines against both viruses are des-perately needed. As a nation, global health should be a high priority, for humanitarian reasons and because of our own vulnerability. For example, over 60 cases of West Nile virus en-cephalitis were detected in New York last year, the first documented cases in theWestern Hemisphere of a virus restricted to Africa, West Asia and the Middle East. Within the NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has responded aggressively and effectively to microbial threats. The NIAIDis the third largest component of the NIH due to the emergence of HIV/AIDS in theearly 1980s and the realization that infectious diseases will continue to emerge un-predictably and at times explosively. It is clear that despite the defeat of diseaseslike smallpox, the dangers of infectious diseases are far from eliminated. One of themost significant threats to public health continues unabated, namely our inabilityto treat some infectious diseases because of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resist-ance is emerging for almost one-third of hospital acquired pathogens, as well as formany community acquired pathogens. Newly discovered pathogens, reemergingmore virulent pathogens, with their sobering potential as bioterrorist weapons,mean that our struggle against infectious diseases is far from over and must be in-tensified. The ASM recommends that NIH funding be increased to expand support for re- search to unlock the basic mechanisms of disease, for antimicrobial resistance, vac-cine research, the infectious etiology of chronic diseases, emerging infectious dis-eases, hepatitis C, Lyme disease, opportunistic infections including tuberculosis,AIDS-related research, and microbial gene sequencing research. This intimidatinglist of microbial targets represents some of the most serious threats to public health,but also offers exciting possibilities for scientific advancement. SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AND OPPORTUNITIES As we enter the 21st century, scientific opportunities are greater than ever, thanks to historic advances in basic and clinical research over recent years. Theseopportunities promise future benefits through new knowledge, new treatments, andnew prevention strategies. We have witnessed the power of basic research to en-hance public health manifested, for example, as effective hepatitis B vaccines or thedevelopment of rapid diagnostic tests for specific pathogenic microorganisms. Weenter the century with new research capabilities, with more sophisticated laboratorytools and with a scientific workforce that is increasingly interdisciplinary in its atti-tudes and abilities. Remarkable opportunities await researchers as a result of DNA and computer technologies developed in the latter part of the 20th century. ASM concurs with theNIAID 's strategic plan statement that ''DNA technologies are profoundly altering the health research landscape . [and] revolutionizing approaches and epidemiology of infectious diseases;radically advancing the understanding of immune activation and regulation; uncov-ering the genetic bases of disease susceptibility; and accelerating the developmentof new diagnostic, treatment and intervention strategies. '' This suggests stunning405 returns on public investment in basic research through the NIH. Add to these possi- bilities those provided by computer modeling, robotics and x-ray crystallography,and our future defenses against infectious diseases will likely look quite differentthan those of the past century. NATURE OF AND REQUIREMENTS OF TODAY 'S RESEARCH New technologies will be a trademark of research in the 21st century, but they will not be the only agent of change reshaping our scientific approach to fightingboth old and new diseases. The NIH will support the skilled personnel and theknowledge base necessary to adapt to these changes. Much of the research landscape has changed over the past century, and will con- tinue to change. Undoubtedly, scientific research will become even more expensive.Our increasing dependence on highly sophisticated technologies, such as advancedcomputers, functional imaging, and gene chips, increases the cost of doing research.The growing use of genetically modified animals and more elaborate animal facili-ties adds significant cost, as does the obvious need for more clinical research andclinicians participating in multi-institution studies. Scientific advances are cumu-lative and research is a multi-year process that may not produce a satisfactory prod-uct for a long period of time. Long-term funding for research and its underpinninginfrastructure remains a necessary part of assuring scientific and medical advances. Among the factors reshaping how we will do research is the absolute necessity for burgeoning data bases, innovative computer usage, and information sharing within highly complex research projects. The NIH is responding to this new world of infor-mation with informatics projects, input from the National Library of Medicine, andinterdisciplinary efforts in the fields of biology, computer science, and mathematics.In fiscal year 2001, the NIH plans to provide the infrastructure to train the nextgeneration of interdisciplinary scientists, to develop new means for storing, man-aging, and accessing vast data collections, and to enhance basic research in bio-medical computing. To accomplish these new approaches to research, resources mustbe sufficient to train scientists in interdisciplinary fields and to encourage coopera-tive efforts among specialists. Research in the 21st century must also adapt to significant changes in patient populations. Since the beginning of 20th century, life expectancy at birth in theUnited States has increased from fewer than 50 years to more than 76 years. Asa result, future research will focus more than ever on enhancing the quality ofhuman life. By the middle of this new century, the number of Americans over 65will more than double and the number over age 85 will increase five-fold, makingdiseases of the aged a higher priority for researchers. An example is our growingawareness that microorganisms play more of a role in chronic disease than pre-viously thought, an area now being investigated by the NIH. A virus has been foundin spinal cords of victims of the neuromuscular disease known as Lou Gehrig 's dis- ease. Other chronic diseases with a possible microbial etiology include peptic ulcers,arthritis, cardiovascular disease, conditions affecting the lungs, and some types ofcancer. Women and minorities in the United States and around the world also bear a dis- proportionate burden of many infectious diseases, including AIDS, sexually trans-mitted disease, auto immune diseases and end stage renal disease. The NIH sup-ports research to improve the health status of patients affiliated with these dis-eases. ECONOMIC BENEFITS Triumph over diseases that assault human health is not the only reward from re- search. The financial benefits of research are significant, through both economicstimulus and cost-savings. Approximately 82 percent of the funds appropriated tothe NIH flows into research labs across the nation, supporting the work of morethan 50,000 researchers affiliated with some 2,000 hospitals, universities, and otherresearch institutions. Federally supported research offers obvious benefits to the bio-technology and pharmaceutical industries, which utilize discoveries from basic re-search and in return receive increased revenues and a steady input of opportunitiesfor new-product development. In 1999, more than 153,000 highly skilled workerswere employed by U.S. biotech companies, generating an impressive $19 billion inannual revenues. The American public, however, is the greatest recipient of scientific and medical advances. Surveys consistently show that citizens support increased funding formedical research, in recognition of the importance of public health and of researchas the foundation underlying success against disease. Through efforts by the NIAIDthere are clear examples of direct benefits from basic research: the identification of406 infectious agents for several human diseases, including Lyme disease, broncho- pneumonia, hemorrhagic fevers, and diarrheal illness; the cause of syphilis, Treponema palllidum, and of E. coli strain K 12 andChlamydia trachomatis, of a chromosome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium fal-ciparum, and of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As a result of these laboratory discov-eries, we will develop more specific and more effective diagnostic, treatment andprevention strategies. The dividends from public investment in a vigorous and well-funded research enterprise are not merely hypothetical, but very real improvementsin public health and the national economy. The ASM appreciates the opportunity to submit written testimony to support in- creased funding for the NIH in fiscal year 2001 appropriation. PREPARED STATEMENT OF TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony for the record on a subject of utmost importance to diabetic patients in Texas and the na-tion. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC), in response to theprevalence of diabetes among the Hispanic and elderly populations that it serves,is proposing to establish a Center for Diabetes Prevention and Control for whichTTUHSC is seeking $6.3 million over three years. This center will engage in a widearray of diabetes prevention and control activities including: \u2014Development and operation of easily accessible diabetes eye care outreach, as- sessment, and treatment centers; \u2014Perform clinical investigations of the predisposition to infection among dia- betics, especially diabetic Hispanics; and, \u2014Conduct in-depth surveys that focus on Hispanics and the elderly residents of rural areas to identify persons with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes and totrack the incidence, prevalence, and treatment of diabetes among the generalpopulations; \u2014Examine the use of telemedicine and other technologies as a means of deliv- ering diabetes education, consultation, and care to patients in remote commu-nities and rural areas. Mr. Chairman, diabetes is one of the most physically and financially debilitating preventable diseases facing our nation. The number of people diagnosed with diabe-tes continues to increase, especially among Hispanics and the elderly in regions likeWest Texas. It is for these reasons that the Texas Tech University Health SciencesCenter (TTUHSC) seeks funding to support its diabetes efforts and to assist theHealth Sciences Center in enhancing its diabetes expertise and facilities. Today, an estimated 865,347 adults in Texas have diagnosed diabetes and for every recognized diabetic there is at least one case where the disease has not beendiagnosed. The situation may be starker still for West Texas because diabetes occursmore often in the elderly and among Hispanics \u2014two groups prominent in the re- gion's population. As in the nation, Hispanics in Texas are two to four times more likely to have diabetes than are members of the non-Hispanic Caucasian population.It is estimated that approximately 22 percent of elderly Hispanics suffer from thedisease. Hispanics are already the second largest and are also the fastest growingminority group in the United States. In 1993 there were 27 million Hispanics in theUnited States, representing 10 percent of the population. By 2050 Hispanics willconstitute 21 percent of the U.S. population. In light of this demographic trend, thefollowing statistics on diabetes among Hispanics are indeed ominous. About 5 per-cent of Hispanic Americans between the ages of 20 and 44 years, and 20 percentof those between the ages of 45 and 74 years have diabetes. These data translateto 1.8 million Hispanic adults with diabetes. About half of those have been diag-nosed, but the other half remains undiagnosed and untreated. The Texas Diabetes Council estimates that 35 percent of the diagnosed diabetics in Texas are Hispanic. Studies conducted in Texas, New Mexico and in Mexico showthat the risk of having diabetes in adult Hispanic men and women is 13 to 25 per-cent, compared to 3 to 8 percent in Anglo adults. The problem of diabetes in the Hispanic population is aggravated by a variety of financial and non-financial barriers that limit access to modern health care andhealth information. When limited access delays diagnosis and treatment of diabetes,irreversible complications involving the visual, renal, cardiovascular, and nervoussystems are more likely to develop. When education on ways to manage diabetes isunavailable, the disease is much more likely to progress and to result in needless,preventable exacerbation.407 The total economic impact of diabetes in 1997 was estimated to be $98 billion. That includes $44.1 billion in direct medical and treatment costs and $54 billion inindirect costs attributed to disability and mortality. The overall annual cost of diabetes in Texas is approximately $4 billion, $1.6 bil- lion in direct costs and $2.4 billion in indirect costs, largely from long-term dis-ability. The shortage of health professionals in West Texas compounds the problemby limiting the number of people who can screen for the disease and provide propercare, appropriate nutrition education, and other self-management instruction. Additionally, diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and ampu- tations as well as a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, birth defects, prematuredeath, and disability. The diabetics ' risk of renal disease, ocular disorders, and gan- grene is 17 to 50 times greater than that of the general population. Cardiovascularcomplications among diabetics occur twice as often as they do among non-diabetics.A higher incidence of complications from diabetes, including: nephropathy, retinop-athy, and peripheral vascular disease, has been documented among Hispanics. Kidney failure is one of the most devastating consequence of diabetes \u2014half of the nation 's cases of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) are caused by diabetes. Annual Medicare costs from ESRD total $15 billion. In West Texas, it is estimated thatnearly 70 percent of all ESRD is caused by diabetes. The extraordinarily high preva-lence of diabetes-related ESRD in TTUHSC 's catchment area is due in part to its large Hispanic and Native American populations, groups having the highest ratesof diabetes in the United States. Preventing diabetes-related ESRD has the poten-tial for saving billions of dollars in Medicare costs annually. The risk of renal disease, ocular disorders, and gangrene in diabetics are, respec- tively, 17, 25, and 50 times that of the general population. The risk of cardio-vascular complications is twice that seen in non-diabetic subjects. The overall an-nual cost of diabetes in Texas is approximately $4 billion, $1.6 billion in direct costsand $2.4 billion in indirect costs, largely from long-term disability. The proposed TTUHSC Center for Diabetes Prevention and Control will include the following components: Diabetic Eye Care Assessment and Treatment Center Because diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, an Eye Care Assessment and Treatment Center can provide greatly needed evaluation and treatment for all typesof diabetic retinopathy, particularly those that respond to laser surgery. Comprehen-sive eye examinations utilizing digital retina photography detect diabetic retinop-athy, photography coupled with angiography quantifies disease severity, and state-of-the-art eye lasers provide sight-preserving treatment. Using public outreach toemphasize the need for regular screenings \u2014even when visual loss is not apparent \u2014 centers in both El Paso and Lubbock will help fill the need for quality eye careamong the West Texans most prone to diabetes \u2014Hispanics and the elderly. Population-Based Diabetes Survey Although estimates can be derived from national surveys, hard data are not avail- able on either the disease 's prevalence or the quality of care provided to rural and Hispanic diabetics. Research by TTUHSC faculty suggests that Hispanics and ruralelderly are much less likely to receive appropriate medical care than non-Hispanics.The proposed survey would provide precise estimates of the prevalence of diabetesin a region with substantial numbers of rural and Hispanic residents as well as in-formation on ethnic differences in the continuity and quality of medical care af-forded diabetics. To derive estimates of the prevalence, along with the additionalneeded information, a base sample of approximately 6,600 completed surveys willbe obtained. Diabetes Clinical Research Center Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the nation 's leading cause of death and diabetics have a higher incidence of CVD than do non-diabetics. Because TTUHSC serves aregion with particularly high rates of diabetes, CVD is very prevalent among its pa-tients. By establishing a Diabetes Clinical Research Center, TTUHSC can betteridentify diabetics at increased risk for CVD. Center investigations can also help pre-dict the specific form of CVD to which these patients are most prone \u2014heart attack, heart failure, stroke, disease of blood vessels in the legs and arms, or kidney failure.Armed with this knowledge, physicians can customize their patients ' disease man- agement. Research Project: Diabetes Mellitus and Infections Diabetics are particularly prone to infection, perhaps because of the effects of high glucose levels and other diabetes-related changes on the white blood cells that de-408 fend the body against infection-causing organisms. However, definitive evidence on possible diabetes-linked changes in the function of these blood cells is lacking. This project will evaluate white blood cell activity in Hispanic diabetics. Cells will be examined for possible causes of any changes in their protective function. If com-promised cellular function can be documented, then clinical trials of medicationsthat inhibit white cell damage would follow. Prevention of infection and related com-plications of diabetes would represent a clinical ''cure'' of the disease. Diabetes Education Telemedicine Project A two-year demonstration project will evaluate the medical efficacy and economic feasibility of telemedicine as a means to deliver diabetes education to underserveddiabetics, particularly Hispanic and elderly residents of remote, rural West Texascounties. Over a network linking rural health facilities with TTUHSC-El Paso, a bi-lingual Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) will serve diabetics and their familymembers who cannot access effective education on diabetes management. The CDE will implement and manage the project in four rural communities. The project will be evaluated to determine the medical efficacy and economic feasibilityof providing diabetes education and related services to rural communities via tele-medicine technology. The funds requested for the proposed Center will allow TTUHSC to significantly enhance it faculty expertise and expand its diabetes prevention and control activi-ties and facilities. TTUHSC has as its major objectives the provision of quality edu-cation and the development of academic, research, patient care, and communityservice programs to meet the health care needs West Texas. The 108 county regionserved by TTUHSC which comprise 50 percent of the state 's land mass and 13.9 percent of the population of the total state. This 131,000 square mile service areathat is home to 2.55 million people has been and remains highly underserved byhealth professionals and accessible health care facilities. This initiative brings the clinical and scientific expertise of TTUHSC to bear on the provision of comprehensive, accessible and affordable diabetes outreach, edu-cation, prevention and care for the underserved and Hispanic and elderly popu-lations of West Texas. The proposed Center will provide a national model of diabetesoutreach, education, prevention and care. Because the region 's Hispanic population tends not to be transient, the Center can track significant disease indicators andoutcomes over a substantial period of time in a large Hispanic sample, data avail-able nowhere else in the United States. Such data will be crucial for federal andstate efforts to create prevention and care programs that reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve state and national health indicators. The Center 's national relevance justifies TTUHSC 's request for federal support. Mr. Chairman, we here at Texas Tech Health Sciences Center look forward to working with you to successfully implement this initiative over the coming threeyears. We are seeking $6.3 million over three years for the complete implementationof this initiative. Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony for the record. PREPARED STATEMENT OF SANTA MARTA HOSPITAL Thank you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to submit this testimony for the written record on a very important initiative underway at Santa Marta Hospital inLos Angeles California, The Diabetes Education and Management Program. Thisinitiative has been implemented in response to one of the most critical and expen-sive medical crises threatening our patients. This program will provide a nationalmodel for diabetes education, outreach and disease for underserved and highly at-risk populations, specifically, Hispanic Americans. Santa Marta Hospital 's three-year multi-site, Diabetes Education & Management Program will focus on the provision of diabetes education, outreach and health careservices to an extremely at-risk, underserved and economically disadvantaged His-panic population. Approximately 40 percent of the target population for the DiabetesEducation and Management Program are uninsured, and live at or below the feder-ally defined poverty line. This initiative will address the urgent diabetic epidemic that is affecting the His- panic population in Santa Marta 's service area, the State of California and the na- tion. This innovative community-based program will use specially trained residentsof the community to provide educational presentations, information and outreach tothe residents of the hospital 's service area. These ''Health Promoters '' who will themselves be graduates of the Diabetes Education program, will be trained to pro-vide screening, educational presentations, preventative services and outreach for409 primary medical care to residents of the neighborhood. The specific Objectives, Methods and Evaluation strategies that will be implemented as part of this initia-tive include: Objectives 1. To train initially 20 (and ultimately 100 over the three year life of the dem- onstration) Community Health Promoters who will then provide diabetes educationand medical services to at least 150 people in the East Los Angeles community an-nually, moving to 200 people in year three. 2. To develop 70 courses annually that will include educational presentations ad- dressing stages of diabetes, symptoms, nutrition and treatment options, both inSpanish and English. 3. To provide low cost or no cost lab tests, medical care, and diabetes treatment to members of the East Los Angeles community. 4. To expand the scope of community outreach to include a much broader range of diabetes medical, educational and psychosocial services provided to poor peoplein East Los Angeles. Methods/Strategies to be used to meet the program objectives 1. The program will be composed of both diabetes education classes and preventa- tive and primary care medical services. The education component will focus on dia-betes presentations addressing symptoms, nutrition, and treatment. Approximately10 or 12, 12-week courses will be offered serving approximately 30 people per class(at least 200 people per year, by year three). 2. Primary care programs will include: regular medical check-ups and lab work, screenings for diabetes, referrals to specialized physicians, and referrals to psycho-social services. Lab work and medical family history will be obtained at the begin-ning and end of the 12-week program. Results will be compared and used as a per-formance evaluation tool for the Diabetes Education & Management Program. 3. Diabetes education and management courses will be taught first by trained hos- pital staff. Eventually, 20 community Diabetes Education & Management Programparticipants, diagnosed diabetics themselves, will receive 50 hours of training to be-come diabetes educators in order to increase the number of people providingscreenings in the community. This will improve program effectiveness because thiscommunity responds positively to community based programs. 4. The community outreach program will continue to be supplemented by regular visits from Santa Marta 's Mobile Health Care Delivery Van. This mobile clinic, staffed by doctors and nurses, will provide basic medical evaluations, testing, healtheducation materials, and referrals to the Diabetes Education & Management Pro-gram. Evaluation Strategies 1. Monthly, the project Clinical Director will review progress and present status reports to Santa Marta Hospital. The project Clinical Director 's report will list the number of people benefiting from the education program, accomplishments, prob-lems, corrective actions, and campaign status. 2. At the end of each 12-week course, participants will fill out evaluation forms assessing course effectiveness. The results will be compiled by the project ClinicalDirector quarterly and presented to the Hospital. 3. At the end of year one, the program will be thoroughly reviewed by the hospital President & CEO to determine program effectiveness, formulate recommendations,and make required changes to ensure its continued success. Their report will beshared with all interested parties, including donors and local health and social serv-ice agencies. The Diabetes Education & Management Program will provide education, medical and psychosocial services to people living in East Los Angeles. The program in-cludes: free educational classes, two free lab work visits per participant (one at thebeginning of the 12-week course and one at the end to test compliance and programeffectiveness), and low or no cost medical services for related health effects of diabe-tes. Diabetes is known to be one of the most under identified causes of and contribu- tions to death and that it disproportionately affects the Hispanic population. Addi-tionally, it is widely recognized that the Hispanic population is three times morelikely to have diabetes than other non-Hispanic populations. Today, there are ap- proximately 15.7 million people or 5.9 percent of the population who have diabetes.While an estimated 10.3 million have been diagnosed, 5.4 million go undiagnosed.Hispanics represent 12 percent to 14 percent of all diabetes cases nation-wide. Addi-tionally, it is estimated that approximately 22 percent of elderly Hispanics sufferfrom the diabetes. Hispanics are the second largest and fastest growing minority410 group in the United States. In 1993, there were 27 million Hispanics in the United States, representing 10 percent of the population. By 2050 Hispanics will constitute21 percent of the U.S. population. Ninety-seven percent of the population surrounding Santa Marta Hospital is His- panic. \u2014The Hospital 's census indicates that 66 percent of its patient population suf- fers from undiagnosed and diagnosed diabetes, and there are alarmingly high statis-tics for those who suffer from complications such as gangrene, kidney failure, heartdisease and blindness. Of that number the Hospital estimates that it can target atleast 2,440 \u20142,840 with its Diabetes Education and Management Program. Located within an inner-city neighborhood plagued by poverty, gang violence and drugs, Santa Marta Hospital is a sanctuary of hope for the 19,000 people who walkthrough its doors each year as well as the 955,000 who reside in its service area.Ninety percent of Santa Marta 's patients rely on Medicare and MediCal programs to access health care services. The remainder can pay only a small portion of theirhospital expenses or rely on Santa Marta 's charity care. Given the poverty of its pa- tients, the hospital depends on the partnership of corporations, foundations and in-dividual donors to fund the cost of new medical programs and necessary major cap-ital expenditures. The per capita cost per diabetic admission to hospitals in California is $8,600. This does not include non-hospital-based dialysis and other medical supply costs;lost work time; or other societal effects. The cost of doing nothing is $4,472,000 (520people \u00d7 $8,600), and these costs are generally supported by Medicare and MediCal (Medicaid) reimbursement. Santa Marta 's proposed program will save Medicare/ MediCal programs in California alone $2,400,000. Given the financial ability of the affected population and the high expense of dia- betes, Santa Marta Hospital is seeking $2 million in fiscal year 2001 for the fullimplementation of this needed community based prevention, education and manage-ment initiative. Poverty, gang violence, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, rampant teen-age pregnancy and an exceptionally high school dropout rate are just some of the harsh realitiesimpacting the seven-mile area surrounding Santa Marta Hospital. There are over9,000 hardcore gang members and 58 established gangs who shadow the communitywith a constant threat of violence. As the only Catholic Hospital in an overwhelm-ingly Catholic population, Santa Marta provides a sense of sanctuary where patientsexperience safety and care with dignity. Founded in 1924, Santa Marta Hospital was originally a ten-bed maternity hos- pital. Today the hospital 's maternity department delivers over 1,500 newborns each year, and coordinates Comprehensive Perinatal Service Programs for the almost1,000 poor pregnant women who walk through its doors annually. The hospital ex-panded in 1971, and grew into a 110-bed acute care facility offering medical servicesincluding: Radiology, Surgery, Labor and Delivery, Nuclear Medicine, Laboratory, Pharmacy, Cardiopulmonary, and Physical Therapy. In 1989, a 20,000 square foot,24-hour Emergency Room Intensive/Coronary Care Unit (ICU/CCU) transformed thehospital into a complete comprehensive medical facility. The hospital prides itself on offering several critical programs that impact the health of the larger community. Santa Marta is a place of hope and service in theircommunity. They know that the hospital doors are open, and that no one is everturned away or refused care on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual orienta-tion, age, national origin, disability, or ability to pay. Enhancing its broad range of hospital services, Santa Marta coordinates the struc- ture for Pediatric, Family Care, and Obstetrical Clinics to assist overall outpatienthealth care. ''Health Fairs '' and ''Health Seminars for Seniors, '' reinforce the hos- pital 's outreach to the medically indigent with an emphasis on preventative care. Additionally, the hospital coordinates a highly successful program for ''at-risk '' youth that has the collaboration of local area schools, social service agencies, juvenile au-thorities, and youth/adult employment programs. The program introduces teens toa professional environment where they can explore positive, future-oriented alter-natives to the world of drugs and gang violence. Each year over 250 at-risk resi-dents of the community work more than 9,600 hours and are exposed to positiverole models, while gaining the self-esteem resulting from helping others in need. In the fiscal year ending June 1999, Santa Marta Hospital treated over 19,000 patients and wrote off more than $11 million in fee reductions, and more than $2.1million in charity care. The hospital also spent nearly $900,000 in community serv-ice programs. Nearly 90 percent of Santa Marta 's patients are government reim- bursed cases (45 percent Medicare and 45 percent Medi-Cal). And due to extremehardship, the remainder are treated for a very low fee or at no charge. Santa Marta understands well that patient education is critical. People with dia- betes can reduce their risk for complications if they are educated about their dis-411 ease, learn and practice the skills necessary to better control their blood glucose lev- els, and receive regular checkups from their health care team. Santa Marta Hospitalencourages its patients to work with them to set goals for better control of bloodglucose levels, as close to the normal range as is possible for them. Health care edu-cation is vital. Because people with diabetes have a multi-system chronic disease, they are best monitored and managed by highly skilled health care professionals trained with thelatest information on diabetes to help ensure early detection and appropriate treat-ment of the serious complications of the disease. Santa Marta Hospital is proposingits Diabetes Prevention and Management as a team approach to treating and moni-toring this disease in an extremely at-risk population. Hospital statistics indicate that members of the East Los Angeles community are more likely than the national average to suffer, or be at risk of suffering from diabe-tes. In addition to genetic predisposition, many community members are obese, havepoor nutrition, and do not practice strong preventative medicine. Consequences ofuntreated or unmanaged diabetes include blindness, amputations, kidney failure,high blood pressure and strained work, financial and family relations. Remember,there is no cure for diabetes. This initiative, at its core a twelve week program of diabetes screening, education, and management program, will be culturally and linguistically sensitive order to ad-dress diabetes from a prevention perspective, preserving the health and financial re-sources of our patients, our hospital, and governmental health care programs. Santa Marta estimates that the program cost to test, educate, and provide initial medical treatment to program participants will be between $1,000 and $1,500, de-pending upon the seriousness of pre-existing diabetes-related conditions. In 1997,the average cost of health care for people with diabetes nationally was $10,071, asopposed to $2,699 for individuals without the disease. By learning to manage their diabetes, participants of Santa Marta 's Diabetes Edu- cation & Management Program can potentially eliminate days missed from workdue to diabetes, costly hospitalizations, and permanent disability from blindness,amputation, or kidney-failure. Given program compliance, the cost of the edu-cational program would be recouped in health care savings within three months.Using 1997 health care cost data, the initiative could demonstrate $200 million sav-ings over a twenty-five year span. Thank you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to submit this testimony. We look forward to working with you this year to secure $2 million in fiscal year 2001 toimplement this very needed community based diabetes education and managementprogram. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN Good afternoon. I am Gilbert Omenn, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs of the University of Michigan and CEO of the University of Michigan Health Sys-tem. I am an internist and a geneticist, as well as a former Associate Director ofOSTP and of OMB. I am submitting this testimony on behalf of a coalition of over 20 academic health centers across the nation to highlight several specific needs in the NIH budget. Therecommendations which I will present have been endorsed in various parts by theAssociation of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Federation of AmericanSocieties for Experimental Biology (FASEB). I want to thank all the Members of this Subcommittee for your outstanding sup- port of the National Institutes of Health. The funding increases you have providedover the past several years have had \u2014and will continue to have \u2014a significant im- pact on our nation 's biomedical and behavioral research enterprise. We are hopeful, even confident, that the NIH budget will continue on the trajectory to double by fis-cal year 2003. The remarkable scientific advances from recent decades have posi-tioned our nation to exploit very responsibly what is certain to be a ''golden era of biology '' for benefits in medicine, public health, and the broader economy and soci- ety. I seek your support for three specific items in the NIH budget that will enhance the extraordinary partnership between academic institutions and the federal gov-ernment, representing the research community and the investing public: \u2014Increase extramural construction funding so that academic investigators sup- ported on a project basis by NIH can have a greater probability of access tostate-of-the-art facilities to carry out their highly valued biomedical and behav-ioral research.412 \u2014Adjust the salary cap to treat extramural researchers similarly to their col- leagues in the intramural programs of NIH itself. \u2014Establish a peer-reviewed, flexible grant program for shared resources to meet evolving and transitional research needs at the institutional level, aligning theefforts of the institutions and not just the faculty in the research agenda of theNIH. INCREASE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES : CONSTRUCTION , RENOVATION , AND EQUIPMENT It is vitally important that we have the facilities and equipment to fully exploit research opportunities and utilize the increased project grant funding. Exciting de-velopments in genomics, chemical biology, neurosciences, cancer, and many otherfields require new kinds of equipment and facilities. Even the best minds cannotcompensate for outdated equipment and facilities. We thank you and your Senate colleagues for including $75 million in competitive funds for extramural construction in the fiscal year 2000 budget through the NIHNational Center for Research Resources (NCRR). The National Science Foundation (NSF) completed a study in 1998 on the status of scientific research facilities at U.S. colleges and universities. This analysis gen-erated an estimate of $3.6 billion in deferred biomedical research construction andrepair or renovation projects. In a March 1998 report, the Association of AmericanMedical College (AAMC) stated that ''The government should reestablish and fund an NIH construction authority, consistent with the general recommendations of the Wyngaarden Committee report of 1988, which projected at that time the need fora 10-year spending plan of $5 billion for new facilities and renovation. '' In June 1998, the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) re-ported that ''Laboratories must be built and equipped for the science of the 21st Century. Infrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space aswell as new construction, where appropriate. '' Thus, there is a well-documented need for several billion dollars to rectify this sit- uation as we ramp up the research project investments. Such funding must comefrom all possible sources, of which federal participation is a key element. We urge the Subcommittee to provide a funding level of $250 million for extra- mural construction in fiscal year 2001. The funds would be awarded on a peer-re-viewed, competitive basis and would require institutional matching funds to lever-age these NIH resources. RAISE THE SALARY CAP ON EXTRAMURAL SCIENTISTS NIH and the academic community share a major concern about recruiting and re- taining excellent clinician-investigators in biomedical and behavioral research.These physicians typically have considerable accumulated debt from their medicaland post-graduate training, and they have an opportunity cost in choosing researchcareers. Medical schools increasingly expect them to earn their way through clinicalservice and by earning support for their research time by competing for federalgrants. Both clinical practice and industrial research opportunities offer substantialhigher incomes. As these faculty move up the ranks and develop successful careers, they or their academic departments are penalized by a salary rate cap imposed back in 1991. Un-fortunately and, I believe, unintentionally, Congress omitted a salary adjustment toaccount for inflation. Thus, the maximum salary rate (on a 100 percent basis, pro-rated for the proportion of time spent in funded research) was locked at $125,000from 1991 through 1998. Of course, NIH pays only a portion of each faculty mem-ber's salary, so the rate is set at competitive levels at the institution and the vast majority are below the maximum. Meanwhile, the NIH intramural program \u2014through the Senior Biomedical Re- search Service (SBRS) \u2014can pay senior investigators salaries up to $157,000 a year. This amount is roughly equal to what the salary cap on academic researchers wouldbe if it had been indexed for inflationary increases over the past decade. Congress has wisely moved, step-by-step, toward achieving equivalent maximal salary rates for the extramural program. Starting with fiscal year 1999, as youknow, Congress established the principle of increasing the cap by linking the sala-ries to the Senior Executive Pay Scale of the Senior Biomedical Research Service,at Level III in fiscal year 1999 and level II ($141,300 per year) in fiscal year 2000.This process can be completed this year by setting the maximum for senior inves-tigators at Level I. In sum, in order to retain the most talented academic researchers in biomedical and behavioral research, especially clinician-investigators, and in order to assure eq-uity between intramural and extramural scientists, we seek your support in raising413 the current salary maximum for extramural academic researchers to Executive Level I, or $157,000 per year. ESTABLISH A FLEXIBLE INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH FUND TO ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF RESEARCH Government, universities, and industry observers all have called for attention to various inefficiencies in the federal-academic partnership. The White House Officeof Science and Technology Policy has held four hearings around the country, includ-ing the final hearing in New York City, at which I was a speaker, to draw attentionto ways to strengthen the relationship between the federal government and univer-sities for research. As you know, during the past decade, financial pressures on the clinical enterprise of academic medical centers have intensified, particularly so since the implementa-tion of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which was on a path to generate far deeperspending cuts than Congress intended in 1997 (partly redressed in 1999). It is in-creasingly difficult to generate institutional margins to underwrite research needsthat are not covered well in the individual project grant mechanism. We want to enhance the impact of NIH funding by being flexible enough to change with the science, accommodate and align ourselves with new national prior-ities, and make the most of the NIH and institutional investments in individualsthroughout their careers. Glitches in funding cycles, changes in NIH policies andpriorities, needs for research resources, and opportunities to mobilize research in new directions could be addressed better with a modest fund in the hands of theinstitutional leaders, based on competitive funding. Collaborative, interdisciplinaryresearch initiatives can be stimulated much more effectively and accountablythrough a modest amount of flexible resources at a level above the individual inves-tigators. Thus, we propose that you provide funding for NIH to establish a ''Flexible Insti- tutional Support for Health Research '' or ''FISHR '' program. Program resources would provide institutional support for the following priorities: to fund interdiscipli-nary, shared research resources; to assist postdoctoral fellows and beginning inves-tigators to establish independent research projects; and to rapidly infuse short-termresources into investigations which offer tremendous promise for research progress. We recommend that the NIH establish such a peer-reviewed, three-year grant program through the National Center for Research Resources. Grants could be inthe range of $25,000 to $300,000 per year for Deans of medical, public health, nurs-ing, dental, and pharmacy schools which qualify through having NIH projectawards. Applications would provide general plans for needs anticipated to evolve.Awards would permit flexibility within the institution to determine spending prior-ities, within the categories approved (as proposed above). To assure accountability,we suggest two mechanisms: (1) a local internal review committee, comprised ofNIH-supported investigators at the institution, to review specific proposed alloca-tions, on a prospective basis; and (2) a retrospective review by NIH research pro-gram staff prior to approving eligibility to submit a competitive renewal applicationat the end of the grant award period. We urge you to include $60 million in the fiscal year 2001 appropriation for NIH to initiate this Flexible Institutional Support for Health Research (FISHR) Program.Such annual funding would favorably modify the impact of the recent stresses expe-rienced by research and academic institutions which threaten the efficiency of ournational research enterprise. CONCLUDING REMARKS Mr. Chairman, the extramural research community applauds the bipartisan ac- tions and commitments to increase funding for biomedical and behavioral researchthrough the NIH. Based on polls conducted by Research!America, including polls inmy state of Michigan, we know that the American public strongly supports theseinvestments and has high expectations for payoff in new knowledge and medical andpublic health innovations. We also applaud the investments in related federal agen-cies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation. We are confident that the Congress and the NIH can enhance the impact of the project-based investments by taking the three additional steps we recommend: pro-vide $250 million in fiscal year 2001 to upgrade extramural laboratory space andinstrumentation; increase the maximal salary rate on NIH grants to ExecutiveLevel I so that extramural salaries can match the maximum for intramural sci-entists; and initiate a Program for Flexible Institutional Support for Health Re-search (FISHR). Each of these steps will increase the productivity and efficiency of414 the academic/government partnership in biomedical and behavioral research and re- search training. On behalf of academic health centers across the nation, I thank you for your at- tention to these needs and recommendations. Best wishes to each of you and to yourfamilies and staff members. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY The American Physiological Society is pleased to have this opportunity to submit its views on fiscal year 2001 funding for the National Institutes of Health. The APSappreciates this Subcommittee 's strong support for biomedical research, its dedi- cated efforts for many years, and in particular, the extraordinary efforts that yielded15 percent funding increases over the past two years, placing the NIH on the pathto a five-year doubling of its budget. The American Physiological Society (APS) is a nonprofit scientific society that seeks to integrate life sciences research and education from the molecule to thewhole organism. The APS was founded in 1887 and currently has more than 9,000members. Our members conduct research and educate the next generation of physi-cians and scientists at colleges, universities, and medical schools throughout theU.S. Many of our members are also engaged in research activities in industry andgovernment. The APS is grateful for the $17.8 billion that Congress has provided for the NIH for fiscal year 2000. This is a time of abundant scientific opportunity. One emergingarea of particular interest to the APS is the new field of physiological genomics.Thanks to the revolution in information technology, scientists have been able to ac-complish large-scale genome sequencing, and some are already working on the anal-ysis of these huge collections of data. With our growing ability to analyze this dataand zero in on key genes, we find ourselves poised before a promising and chal-lenging new era. As the editors of the new on-line and print journal PhysiologicalGenomics observed in an editorial published on-line July 15, 1999, ''[T]he enormous task of linking genes to function has now begun. '' The editors go on to explain that our current state of knowledge now permits us to trace biological processes from thefirst actions of genes within the nucleus of cells through cellular processes, the influ-ence of specific genes upon the functions of tissues and organs and, ultimately, theirimpact on the workings of the whole organism. Conducting such studies on indi-vidual genes and gene combinations responsible for particular diseases will permitus to identify how the internal environment defined by our genetic makeup interactswith external influences to keep us healthy or make us sick. The promise of physio-logical genomics is that this knowledge will point the way to new therapies, diag-nostic tools, and better overall health management. The APS offers this as an example of how NIH-funded research is leading us to- ward a treasure trove of medically useful knowledge. The APS joins with the Fed-eration of American Societies for Experimental Biology and the Ad Hoc Group forMedical Research Funding in urging Congress to provide a $2.7 billion or 15 percentincrease in fiscal year 2001 as the third step toward doubling the NIH budget byfiscal year 2003. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY The American Chemical Society (ACS) would like to thank Chairman Arlen Spec- ter and Senator Tom Harkin for the opportunity to submit testimony for the recordon the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appro-priations bill for fiscal year 2001. As you may know, ACS is a non-profit scientific and educational organization, chartered by Congress, representing 161,000 individual chemical scientists and engi-neers. The world 's largest scientific society, ACS advances the chemical enterprise, increases public understanding of chemistry, and brings its expertise to bear on state and national matters. ACS firmly believes that no investment the governmentmakes generates a higher rate of return for the economy than research and develop-ment (R&D). In fact, economic experts maintain that today 's unprecedented eco- nomic growth would not have been realized but for the substantial research invest-ments by the public and private sectors over the past few decades. Looking ahead,the American Chemical Society (ACS) is concerned that constant dollar declines infederal support for basic research over the past decade, particularly in the physicalsciences, have weakened the roots of innovation in all fields and put future economicgrowth at risk. In order to sustain our technological leadership and living standards,increased funding for basic research should be a top priority for use of the non-So-415 cial Security budget surpluses. As a framework for increasing R&D funding, ACS supports doubling federal spending on research within a decade, as well as balancedfunding among different areas of science. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS ACS commends Congress and the administration for the 15-percent increase last year for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and we support a comparable in-crease for fiscal year 2001. As the major supporter of biomedical research in theUnited States, NIH is the primary source of new biomedical discoveries that areleading to longer, healthier lives as well as reduced health-care costs due to preven-tion, early detection, and more cost-effective treatment of disease. An example of theenormous return on this investment is the recent decline in both the incidence ofcancer and the mortality rate from it. In addition, NIH-supported research providestraining for new scientists, stimulates technological advances in the pharmaceuticaland biotechnology industries \u2014both of which contribute positively to the balance of trade \u2014and makes the United States a world leader in biomedical research. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES As the largest source of federal funding for basic research, NIH should leverage its investments in biomedical research by maintaining strong support for all areasof basic research critical for sustained advances in public health and quality of life.Strong support for chemistry and the other physical sciences that underlie or com-plement biomedical research must be maintained if cutting-edge biomedical discov-eries are to continue. For this reason, ACS believes it is essential that the NationalInstitute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) receive increases proportional to theother NIH institutes. NIGMS supports quality, non-disease specific basic researchand training that underpins advances in other institutes. NIGMS plays a centralrole in generating basic knowledge across science disciplines, strengthening theroots of innovation in the biomedical community, and fostering tomorrow 's break- through discoveries. NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES The National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) supports the state-of-the-art research infrastructure necessary to provide high-quality biomedical and behavioralresearch, including the expansion, remodeling, and construction of extramural re-search facilities. The Center facilitates the development of new technologies andtechniques by which scientific inquiry can be undertaken. In addition, NCRR pro-vides grants such as the Shared Instrumentation Grants program, which providesa cost-effective mechanism for groups of NIH-supported investigators to obtain com-mercially available, technologically sophisticated equipment costing more than$100,000. Through these contributions, NCRR offers the potential for revolutionaryapproaches to health-related research. Strong and steady support for cutting-edge researchers that advances human health is absolutely essential to ensuring the large return investment made on NIHresearch over the past decade. Sustained growth in funding for NIH is needed tobuild upon past scientific achievements, address present medical needs, and antici-pate future health challenges. Volatility and significant fluctuations in funding canbe as harmful to the research enterprise as inadequate growth. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the subcommittee, we appreciate the opportunity to submit written testimony on behalf of the National Multiple SclerosisSociety. The Society is the world 's largest private voluntary health agency devoted to the concerns of all those affected by MS. Throughout the Society 's 53-year history, our number one priority has been research to understand MS and apply this knowl-edge to the development of new treatments and a cure. Cumulatively, the Societyhas expended over $260 million in research funds in the United States and abroad.Our current annual budget for research exceeds $20 million. This represents thelargest privately funded program of basic, clinical, and applied research and train-ing related to multiple sclerosis in the world. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS MS is an often progressive, degenerative disease of the central nervous system, unpredictable in its course, and devastating in its effects. It can cause spasticity,tremor, abnormal fatigue, bladder and bowel dysfunction, visual problems and mo-416 bility impairment. The disease usually is diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 \u2014 but is life long. Many people with MS live thirty years or more with constant unpre-dictability and increasing disability. MS affects more than twice as many women asmen, can result in loss of employment and loss of a place in society and the commu-nity. Recent studies sponsored by the MS Society show that the annual cost to eachaffected individual as a result of MS averages $34,000, and the total cost can exceed$2 million over an individual 's lifetime. For all people with MS in the United States \u2014some third of a million individuals \u2014the annual cost is nearly $9 billion. Ending the devastating medical, personal and financial effects of this unpredictabledisease is completely dependent upon the discovery of safe and effective treatmentsthat halt progression of the disease and reverse its symptoms. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUNDING NIH plays the major role in maintaining our country 's preeminence in bio- technology and provides worldwide leadership in health research and discovery. TheNational MS Society recognizes that new discoveries and breakthroughs could comefrom any area of biomedical research and could apply to the primary concern of ourmembers: finding new treatments and eventually a cure for MS. Therefore we en-courage Congress to focus on NIH as a whole and on agencies of particular rel-evance to our concern, knowing that a well-funded federal research enterprise willbenefit all of us. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society believes that in order to take advantage of current opportunities in biomedical and rehabilitation research, Congress mustcontinue the trend of the last two budget cycles. A further 15 percent increase inNIH funding for fiscal year 2001 would bring us closer to doubling the NIH budgetover the five-year period 1999 -2003. In order to pursue cutting edge research, the Society recommends that this translate into a parallel 15 percent increase for theNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Medical and Rehabilita-tive Research, the primary institutes that conduct nearly all of the MS-related re-search undertaken by the Federal Government. NEUROSCIENCE CENTER The NIH budget proposal for fiscal year 2001 includes $73 million over two years for construction of a new National Neuroscience Center at NIH. The Center willbring together in one facility, with necessary new lab space, both basic and clinicalintramural scientists from the many institutes involved in neuroscience in order toencourage their interaction and the translation of basic research findings. The Cen-ter will emphasize important cross cutting themes such as neurodegeneration, re-generation and repair of neurons, neurogenetics and pain research. Federal fundingfor the Center would increase the pace of discovery in all areas of neuroscience andhelp translate laboratory discoveries into new and effective treatments for patients.The proposed funding is included in NIH 's Building and Facilities budget, and it is our understanding that it will not affect funding for research. The National MS So-ciety recommends fully funding the proposed National Neuroscience Center at NIH. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF MS RESEARCH The National MS Society has commissioned the National Academy of Sciences/In- stitute of Medicine (NAS/IOM) to undertake a strategic analysis of basic and clinicalresearch for multiple sclerosis. The NAS/IOM will review current knowledge aboutthe cause and treatment of MS and recommend a strategic plan to guide future in-vestment. The study will be broadly based, assessing current and future contribu-tions from private and governmental organizations, both in the U.S. and aboard. Animportant goal of the study will be to identify areas of research that may not havebeen exploited in the past and to identify new fields of research. At the completionof the study, we anticipate a set of recommendations for future strategies that canbe considered not only by the NMSS, but also other MS societies around the globe,governmental funding agencies, and by pharmaceutical and biotech companies in-volved in MS programs. The analysis was initiated in May 1999, and should be com-pleted early in 2001. We look forward to the opportunity to report the results to theSubcommittee in our testimony next year. SUMMARY The National MS Society recognizes that new discoveries and breakthrough find- ings could come from almost any area of biomedical research and could apply to theprimary concern of our members: finding a cure for MS. We thus encourage Con-417 gress to focus on NIH as a whole, and on agencies of particular relevance to our concern, knowing that a well-funded federal research enterprise will benefit all ofus. Continuing the 15 percent annual increase in funding through 2003 is an ex-traordinarily good use of federal resources, and we encourage you to do whateveryou can to make this a reality. In addition, in order to take advantage of potentialdiscoveries in all areas of neuroscience and help translate these discoveries into newand effective treatments for patients, we recommend fully funding the proposed Na-tional Neuroscience Center at NIH. PREPARED STATEMENT OF NEWYORK-PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL I am Dr. Herb Pardes, President and CEO of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. For the last several years, I was Dean of the College of Physicians and Surgeonsof Columbia University in New York. I submit this testimony on behalf of academichealth centers across the nation that play a vital role in advancing the frontiers ofmedicine by conducting extramural NIH biomedical and behavioral research. We in the academic health community urge you to improve this academic/federal partnership by recognizing the following three concerns which limit the extramuralbiomedical and behavioral research community from operating at optimal capacityand efficiency: \u2014the need for state-of-the-art facilities to carry out the increasing volume of fed- erally-supported biomedical and behavioral research; \u2014the need for competitive salaries for extramural researchers; and \u2014the need for a peer-reviewed, flexible grant program for shared resources to meet evolving and transitional research needs at the institutional level. INCREASE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES -CONSTRUCTION , RENOVATION , EQUIPMENT Exciting developments in genomics, chemical biology, neurosciences, cancer, and many other fields require new kinds of equipment and facilities. Even the bestminds cannot compensate for outdated equipment and facilities. It is vitally impor-tant that we have the facilities and equipment to fully exploit research opportunitiesand utilize the increased project grant funding. The National Science Foundation (NSF) completed a study in 1998 on the status of scientific research facilities at U.S. colleges and universities. This analysis gen-erated an estimate of $3.6 billion in deferred biomedical research construction andrepair or renovation projects. In a March 1998 report, the Association of AmericanMedical College (AAMC) stated that ''The government should reestablish and fund an NIH construction authority, consistent with the general recommendations of theWyngaarden Committee report of 1988, which projected at that time the need fora 10-year spending plan of $5 billion for new facilities and renovation. '' In June 1998, the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) re-ported that ''Laboratories must be built and equipped for the science of the 21st Century. Infrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space aswell as new construction, where appropriate. '' My colleagues and I urge you to provide the NIH with $250 million for extramural facilities construction in the fiscal year 2001 Labor/HHS/Education funding bill. Thefunds would be awarded on a competitive basis, requiring institutional matching toleverage the NIH resources. RAISE THE SALARY CAP ON EXTRAMURAL SCIENTISTS Another case of cost-shifting by the Federal Government is the cap on salaries for academic researchers. Since the cap was first imposed in the early 1990s, at roughly$125,000 a year, the Consumer Price Index has risen more than 20 percent. Theresult is two-fold. Academic medical centers and universities have been increasinglyforced to bear more of the costs of investigators ' salaries; and many promising re- searchers have been driven out of academic research altogether, drawn by more lu-crative posts in the private sector. Physician investigators are critical to translating the substantial fundamental sci- entific advances to patients. Additional years of postgraduate training, after physi- cians receive their MD degree, are required for board eligibility, independent of re-search training and career development. Newly trained MDs are incurring insur-mountable debts as a result. In 1997, nearly half of all medical school graduatesheld debts greater than $75,000. Mounting debts combined with the salary cap serveas disincentives for the youngest and brightest physicians from pursuing careers inacademic research. The results are dramatic and disturbing: Between 1994 and418 1997, the number of MDs submitting new grant applications to the National Insti- tutes of Health dropped by more than 32 percent. At the same time, the National Institutes of Health has created new mechanisms such as the Senior Biomedical Research Service (SBRS) to keep its most talentedintramural scientists on the NIH campus. Under the SBRS, the NIH can pay itssenior investigators up to $157,000, (Executive Level I) roughly equal to what thesalary cap on academic researchers would be if it were indexed for inflationary in-creases over the past decade. In fiscal year 1999, Congress tied the extramural salary cap to Level III of the Executive Pay Scale, which \u2014at that time \u2014was $125,900. Thus, the increase was not significantly above the previous cap of $125,000. In fiscal year 2000, Congressraised the salary cap from Executive Level III to Executive Level II (now $141,300).While this takes into account increases in the cost-of-living over the past decade,the extramural salary cap is still not on par with intramural NIH scientists whocan receive a maximum salary of Executive Level I. I urge you to raise the current cap on academic researchers should to Executive Level I ($157,000/year) to match the cap currently imposed by the NIH on its ownsenior scientists under the Senior Biomedical Research Service. ESTABLISH A FLEXIBLE INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH FUND TO ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF RESEARCH A third concern to our nation 's academic medical institutions is inefficiency in the federal-academic partnership. As you know, during the past decade, financial pres-sures on the clinical enterprise of academic medical centers have intensified, par-ticularly so since the implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 during thepast year. It is increasingly difficult to generate institutional margins to underwriteresearch needs that are not covered well in the project grant mechanism. These funds would be used to enhance the impact of NIH funding by being flexi- ble enough to change with the science, accommodate changing national prioritiesand make the most of the NIH and institutional investments in individuals through-out their careers. Glitches in funding cycles, changes in NIH policies and priorities,needs for research resources, and opportunities to mobilize research in new direc-tions could be addressed better with a modest fund in the hands of the institutionalleaders, based on competitive funding. Collaborative, interdisciplinary research ini-tiatives can be stimulated through resources at a level above the individual inves-tigators. Thus, I urge you to provide funding for NIH to establish a ''Flexible Institutional Support for Health Research '' or ''FISHR '' program. Program resources would pro- vide institutional support for the following priorities: to fund interdisciplinary,shared research resources; to assist postdoctoral fellows and beginning investigatorsto establish independent research projects; and to rapidly infuse short-term re-sources into investigations which offer tremendous promise for research progress. Academic health centers recommend that the NIH establish such a peer-reviewed, three-year grant program through the National Center for Research Resources.Grants could be in the range of $25,000 to $300,000 per year for Deans of medical,public health, nursing, dental, and pharmacy schools which qualify through havingNIH project awards. Applications would provide general plans for needs anticipatedto evolve. Awards would permit flexibility within the institution to determine spend-ing priorities, within the categories approved (as proposed above). To assure ac-countability, I would suggest two mechanisms: a local internal review committee,comprised of NIH-supported investigators at the institution, to review specific pro-posed allocations, on a prospective basis; then a retrospective review by NIH re-search program staff prior to approving eligibility to submit a competitive renewalapplication at the end of the grant award period. I urge you to include $60 million in the fiscal year 2001 NIH funding bill to ini- tiate this Flexible Institutional Support for Health Research (FISHR) Program.Such annual funding would favorably modify the impact of the recent stresses expe-rienced by research and academic institutions which threaten the efficiency of ournational research enterprise. CONCLUDING REMARKS The Congress and the NIH can enhance the impact of the project-based invest- ments by taking three additional steps: increase to $250 million the funding to up- grade extramural laboratory space and instrumentation; increase the maximal sal-ary rate on NIH grants to match the maximum for intramural scientists; and ini-tiate a Program for Flexible Institutional Support for Health Research (FISHR).419 Each of these steps will increase the productivity and efficiency of the academic/gov- ernment partnership in biomedical and behavioral research and research training. On behalf of academic health centers across the nation, I thank you for your at- tention to these needs and recommendations. Best wishes to each of you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS The Bioengineering Division of the Basic Engineering Group of the Council on En- gineering, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME International), ispleased to provide comments on the bioengineering-related programs in the NIH fis-cal year 2001 budget request. The ASME Bioengineering Division is focused on theapplication of mechanical engineering knowledge, skills and principles from concep-tion to the design, development, analysis and operation of biomechanical systems. THE IMPORTANCE OF BIOENGINEERING Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies physical, chemical and mathematical sciences and engineering principles to the study of biology, medicine,behavior, and health. It advances knowledge from the molecular to the organ sys-tems level, and develops new and novel biologics, materials processes, implants, de-vices, and informatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment ofdisease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health. From the perspectiveof mechanical engineering, bioengineering provided for the development of the artifi-cial heart, prosthetic joints and numerous rehabilitation technologies, as just severalexamples. THE NEED FOR INCREASED INVESTMENT IN BIOENGINEERING The Bioengineering Division recommends that support for Bioengineering Re- search as a percentage of the total NIH research project grants (RPGs) budget beincreased to meet the future explosion in Biomedical Engineering Research. In addi-tion, it recommends that a separate, independently funded institute be establishedto provide adequate support for basic Bioengineering Research. BACKGROUND NIH is the world 's largest and most eminent organization dedicated to improving health through medical science. During last 50 years, the NIH has played a pre-eminent role in the major breakthroughs that have increased average life expect-ancy by 15 to 20 years. The NIH is comprised of different Institutes and Centers that support a wide spectrum of research activities including basic research, disease and treatments re-lated studies, and epidemiological analyses. The missions of individual Institutesand Centers may focus on a particular organ (e.g. heart, kidney, eye), on a givendisease (e.g. cancer, infectious diseases, mental illness), or on a stage of development(e.g. childhood, old age), or, may encompass crosscutting needs (e.g. sequencing ofthe human genome). Investigator-initiated RPGs continue to be one of the NIH 's highest funding prior- ities. In fiscal year 2001, RPGs represent 56.9 percent of the total NIH budget, andprovides $10.3 B, a 6.1 percent increase over fiscal year 2000, to fund an estimated31,524 research project grants. This represents an addition of 237 grants over thefiscal year 2000 total. Total grants include non-competing grants and competing newgrants. NIH estimates it will support 7,641 competing new RPGs in fiscal year 2001.This number is 1,309 below estimated fiscal year 2000 levels. CURRENT INVESTMENT IN BIOENGINEERING IS INADEQUATE In fiscal year 1999, Bioengineering Research Support was at $0.645 B or 7.6 per- cent of the total NIH RPGs budget. In fiscal year 2000, Bioengineering ResearchSupport is estimated at $0.661 B or 6.8 percent of the total NIH RPGs budget.While the Bioengineering Division acknowledges that there is a small increase inthe budgeted support for Biomedical Research, it also notes there is an actual de-crease in the percentage of funding, a trend which could indicate a decrease in em-phasis on Bioengineering within NIH. The focus of bioengineering issues at the NIH is the Bioengineering Consortium (BECON), which consists of intramural and extramural senior-level representativesfrom each of the NIH institutes, centers, and divisions plus representatives of otherfederal agencies with funding authority for bioengineering research. BECON itselfdoes not have funding authority.420 Because BECON is not independently funded, the individual Institutes and Cen- ters under the NIH umbrella must use their annual appropriations to support bio-engineering research, a practice that may contribute to the under-funding of bio-engineering research. For example, the National Institute of Dental andCraniofacial Research 's (NIDCR) share of the total RPG NIH budget, excluding AIDS, is approximately 1.38 percent for fiscal year 2000. Yet, it is anticipated thatNIDCR will allocate 41.28 percent of that budget, or $55.4 million, to bioengineeringresearch, an amount representing 8.38 percent of the total RPG NIH budget for fis-cal year 2000. ASME 's Bioengineering Division believes that this is indicative of the under-investment being made in Bioengineering Research. CONCERNS While ASME 's Bioengineering Division supports NIH and the priorities identified in the fiscal year 2001 Budget Request, it is concerned about two issues: the reduc-tion in the number of new projects; and, the lack of a direct support mechanism forbioengineering research. Reduction in the Number of New Projects .\u2014NIH estimates it will support a total of 7,641 new and competing RPGs in fiscal year 2001. This number is 1,309 belowestimated fiscal year 2000 levels, a reduction of 14.6 percent. This reduction appearsto be inconsistent with the theme of recruiting and training new clinical investiga-tors, especially in Bioengineering where the number of researchers is increasingrapidly in Bioengineering academic departments at universities across the nation. As an example, the number of applicants for CAREER Awards in Biomedical Engi-neering at the National Science Foundation increased from 38 in fiscal year 1999to 55 in fiscal year 2000, an increase of 45 percent. ASME 's Bioengineering Division believes this is an early indication of the coming explosion in Biomedical Engineer-ing Research. Lack of a Direct Support Mechanism for Bioengineering Research .\u2014Funding for Bioengineering research remains a small portion of the total NIH research budget.BECON does not include resources for the collaborative support of extramural re-search. At this time, an intramural bioengineering research program does not existfor broad-based, multidisciplinary research. This situation places a burden on indi-vidual NIH Institutes, and appears to be inconsistent with the vision of the role ofBiomedical Engineering in increasing biological knowledge, facilitating the develop-ment of novel devices and drugs, and providing the technological means to improvehealth care. RECOMMENDATIONS To address the concerns listed above, the ASME Bioengineering Division rec- ommends that: \u2014support for Bioengineering Research as a percentage of the total NIH RPGs budget be increased to meet the future explosion in Biomedical Engineering Re-search; and, \u2014a separate bioengineering research institute be established to: provide an administrative structure to assist in the coordination, communica- tion, and promotion of bioengineering research supported by the many insti-tutes within NIH to increase the opportunities for new collaborations, dis-semination of new technologies or research findings and the availability offunding opportunities, special seminars, conferences, and related activities; have the authority and funding to provide extramural grants specifically tar- geted to support activities that do not fall within the disease-related insti-tutes of NIH (e.g., proposals for the development or evaluation of generic tech-nologies that cross many health disciplines; training grants for pre-doctoraland post-doctoral trainees in bioengineering; and, funding for specialized ex-tramural centers which would enable universities to develop core supportstructures for enhancing the training, research endeavors and development oftechnology in all fields of bioengineering); and, support the development of a modest intramural program in Biomedical Engi- neering to focus primarily on new technologies that could evolve to becomecore resources for both intramural and extramural investigators. \u2014as an interim measure prior to the establishment of a separate Bioengineering Institute, the NIH create an Office of Bioengineering Research modeled afterthe Office for Research on Minority Health (ORMH) to:serve as the coordination center within the Office of the Director for Bio- engineering Research issues; and, have the legislative authority to award grants for priority bioengineering re- search that other Institutes or Centers are unable to fund.421 CONCLUSION The ASME Bioengineering Division endorses the National Institutes of Health 's fiscal year 2001 budget request for bioengineering. Triumph over disease and dis-ability, and speeding the rate at which fundamental discoveries are translated intoeffective therapies, are essential for the vitality of this nation. The Division is concerned about details of the budget request. To address these concerns, the ASME Bioengineering Division recommends that: \u2014support for Bioengineering Research Support as a percentage of the total NIH RPGs budget be increased to meet the future explosion in Biomedical Engineer-ing Research; \u2014a direct support mechanism for bioengineering research be established to pro- vide adequate support for basic bioengineering research, a centralized focus forextramural bioengineering research at NIH, a strong intramural bioengineeringprogram at NIH, and increased coordination of bioengineering research withinthe highest levels of NIH and among other federal agencies; and, \u2014as an interim measure, the NIH establish an Office of Bioengineering Research based on the ORMH model. ASME International 's Bioengineering Division appreciates the opportunity to present its views to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services andEducation. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR CANCER RESEARCH On behalf of the 26 organizations which comprise the NCCR and consist of 80,000 cancer researchers, nurses, physicians, and health care workers; tens of thousandsof cancer survivors and their families; 40,000 children with cancer and their fami-lies; 90 cancer hospitals and cancer centers across the country; and more than 2 mil-lion volunteers. It is on their behalf that I submit this testimony in support of theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Indeed, the harvest of the past investment of the American people and Congress in supporting biomedical research is now being realized as we are bringing on linepowerful new tools that are delivering more precise and rapid information that isalready enhancing our understanding and control of cancer. As just one example,I will focus here on diet and the prevention of cancer to illustrate one facet of thisexciting advancement. We have all known that eating more fresh vegetables and fruits are good for us. For example, eating broccoli appears to be beneficial in lowering the risk of cancer.A few years ago, a group at Johns Hopkins isolated and identified the active sulfurcompound from broccoli called sulforaphane that when administered to animals pre-vented cancer from developing when they were subjected to carcinogens. Most re-cently, Dr. James Brooks and Dr. Pat Brown at Stanford University have illumi-nated the mechanisms through which this compound might prevent cancer. Whencells were administered this sulforaphane, they turn on a battery of genes that in-crease the cell 's defense system that protects DNA from damage. Conversely, sulforaphane turns off a set of enzymes that tend to activate the carcinogens to amore DNA damaging form. This double barrel effect of sulforaphane of both enhanc-ing the ''good guys, '' while eliminating the ''bad guys '' in the carcinogenic mecha- nisms, is at the heart of how sulforaphane might protect us from cancer. This new DNA chip assay allows us to test many other similar compounds and select the ones that would be most beneficial. This study was made possible by an-other application of this new DNA chip technology of which Dr. Klausner spoke toyou in his testimony on February 15. He reported how this technology was used toaccurately identify two different forms of what appeared to be similar cancers thathad responded differently to the same therapy. Therefore, the DNA chips are notonly being used to identify specific types of cancers and how they might respond todifferent drugs, but are also being used to study how factors in our diet might lowerthe risk of cancer. For a long time, we have known that people living in China and Japan have one- tenth the rate of breast and prostate cancer in comparison to the United States.However, when the people from Asia migrate to this country, their breast and pros-tate cancer rates increase dramatically toward that which we experience here withinthe United States population. What is it in the diets and environments that bringsthis dramatic change about? Is the increased rate due to a loss of a protective factoror the addition of a detrimental factor such as a carcinogen? We have always sus-pected that there are many things in our diet that might alter our cancer risks, andthrough the use of these new molecular techniques, it will be possible to hunt these422 agents out in a more systematic and rapid form. This means that much of the initial testing can take place in cell systems using these DNA chips and then extendingthe information to a more definitive study in animals and then in clinical trials inhumans. More is coming from the new DNA technology, and this is only the firststeps in a major revolution in how we study cancer that resulted from your previousinvestments, and it is now applicable to many diseases. Another exciting area of research is on human pluripotent stem cells. A new, emerging theory is that cancer is a stem cell disease. The potential applications forstem cell research could have an incredible impact on improving cancer treatmentand prevention. The research in this area is just emerging, and it would be a trag-edy to restrict. The NCCR urges Congress to permit the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH) to fund and provide oversight for research on human pluripotent stemcells and strongly opposes any attempts to ban this very promising area of research.The NIH guidelines, which the NCCR supports, create a federal regulatory frame-work for appropriate applications and derivations of stem cells, require that stemcell research is accountable to federal oversight and federal reporting mechanisms,and ensure that stem cell research is pursued in an ethical and responsible mannerunder public scrutiny. There are dozens of other discoveries and exciting possibilities as delineated in the NCI Bypass Budget Report and elsewhere that need to be funded. We know thatthe control of cancer will only come through research. The bad news is that we arenot taking advantage of these opportunities in an appropriate manner. The questionthat always comes up is, ''Are we paying for bad research. '' It is important to realize that when President Richard Nixon declared ''war on cancer '' we were funding at 40 percent of the approved grants, and today we have dropped down to 32 percentof the approved grants. There is little doubt that if we now extended this up to 50percent of the approved grants that we would have a much better chance of findingdiscoveries at a more rapid rate. No one knows where the next major discovery willcome from, and history has shown that many of the experts have often guessedwrong on this matter. It would seem apparent that funding more approved projectswould increase the chances. This increase in funding is not a waste in comparison to the cost to the nation \u2014 over $107 million and half a million lives annually \u2014and the need to stop the devas- tation and carnage of cancer as quickly as possible. I think we need to bet on morehorses in the research race. We all might be surprised at which research will win,but one will win as it did for Lance Armstrong in his fight against cancer so hecould finally reenter and win the grueling Tour De France bicycle race. I am con-fident that increasing our bets to funding the top 50 percent of the approved grantswill prove to be a good bet for the American people. To do this, we would have toextend the budget to $4.1 billion for the National Cancer Institute, the level rec-ommended in the fiscal year 2001 Bypass Budget. More funding for young physician scientists is also of critical importance, because the goose that lays the golden eggs is now dying of malnutrition. The work to whichI just referred, on diet studies, of Dr. James Brooks at Stanford as well as otherimportant discoveries in this area by Dr. William G. Nelson at Johns Hopkins arethe results of a young surgeon and a young medical oncologist having the oppor-tunity to carry out laboratory based research on cancer while still practicing as lead-ing physicians. They are some of the most valuable warriors in our fight againstcancer. Unfortunately, there has been a dramatic drop in the number of these youngphysicians entering research, and this is witnessed by the M.D. postdoctoral train-ing funded by the National Institutes of Health (51 percent decrease in six years)and in those trainees funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (57 percentdecrease in two years). These numbers are documented in a study appearing inScience (Vol. 283, Page 131, 1999) by Dr. Leon Rosenberg. These young physician scientist are under intense pressure as funds have moved away from our non-profit medical institutions and over to become the profits of theinsurance companies. The insurance companies do not invest in the training of theseyoung scientists and neither do they fund their research. At prior times, the non-profit medical schools used funds that they received for medical care to supportthese young physician scientist. All that has happened is that the funds have nowshifted from one pocket to the other, and the support for the development of physi-cian research has evaporated. The insurance companies may be the only major in-dustry that does not return any appreciable percent of their profits to support re-search and development and to protect their customer, the patient, in the future. This shift in research funding is a tragedy that is choking the goose that lays the golden egg of research discovery for our people. It is urgent for Congress to act tosupport the National Cancer Institute and the NIH in these dire times and to helpstop this hemorrhaging of our major medical training centers that is choking our423 young physician scientist who are forced away from the laboratories and research to desperately try to fill beds to compete for the decreasing care dollar distributedfrom the insurance companies. Insurance companies are also slowing the pace of research by denying payment for and, therefore, patient access to clinical trials. Investigational therapy adminis-tered under the aegis of a fully approved clinical trial is often the best therapyavailable to many patients. It is important that patients not be denied access toclinical trials. The knowledge gained through these studies is absolutely essentialto achieve progress in cancer care. Both patients and research suffer when healthinsurers will not reimburse for routine patient care costs in clinical trials. This iscompromising our capacity to translate research from the laboratory bench to thebedside. The NCCR supports legislative efforts to ensure third-party payer 's cov- erage of patient-care costs in clinical trials. In my 40 years in research at Johns Hopkins, I have never seen such a dramatic change as that which has occurred in the past few years, and it certainly is not forthe good of the patient nor for the future generations. America deserves better. Iknow these are difficult and sensitive issues, but I hope you can help lead us intoan exciting future. Increasing NIH and NCI support would certainly make a tre-mendous difference, and it is most needed. I am also here to assure you that cancer researchers are committed to upholding the integrity of the clinical trial process, so that patient safety and confidentialityare of the utmost importance. There are inherent risks to being a cancer patient,as there are to receiving anesthesia or any drugs. The critical points are to ensurepatient safety through close patient evaluation and informed decision-making, whichare hallmarks of clinical research. Informed decision-making is enabled by explain-ing all potential risks and benefits to patients. This process is an essential compo-nent to clinical trials, so that patients are fully aware of complications that couldoccur and can weigh the risks and benefits in order to determine whether or notto participate. An oversight structure, comprised of federal guidelines and oversight as well as local oversight through institutional review boards (IRBs) and data safety moni-toring boards (DSMBs), closely tracks research protocol activities to safeguard pa-tient care in research. Further, investigators and protocol nurses carefully monitorthe progress and safety of patients participating in clinical trials. In conclusion, clin-ical trials provide excellent care for patients, are a necessary and important stepin research, are very closely monitored, and serve as the lynchpin between researchand accepted medical practice for making advancements in the war against cancer. The NCCR thanks you for providing this year 's 15 percent increase to NIH as the second installment to double the budget of the NIH over five years. In terms offunding for fiscal year 2001, we are requesting the third 15 percent increase forNIH, $4.1 billion for the NCI, and $622 million for cancer control efforts and the CDC. This third increase to NIH will bring us within 2 years of doubling the NIHbudget. While amazing progress has been achieved in cancer treatment, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in America. Let me share with you a few factswhich indicate the wide-reaching scope and magnitude of cancer. One in two malesand one in three females will develop cancer of the course of a lifetime. Look to yourleft and look to your right. The odds are that one of these individuals will be diag-nosed with cancer. One in four Americans will die form cancer. Now, look to yourleft, look to your right, and look at me. The odds are that one of us will die fromcancer. Today alone, more than 3,000 people will be diagnosed with cancer, and over1,500 will die from cancer. Over the course of this year, over 1.2 million Americanswill be diagnosed with cancer and over half a million will die from cancer. Too manypeople live with cancer, Mr. Chairman, and too many people die from cancer. Wehave a moral obligation to aggressively pursue cancer research and turn cancer froma too-often terminal disease into a treatable, preventable disease. It is important that we understand the magnitude of cancer statistics both now and in the future. While cancer rates \u2014the number of people per thousand in the population who develop cancer in a given year \u2014have dipped slightly by 2.6 percent between 1991 and 1995, cancer incidence, the new cases of cancer reported eachyear, is expected to increase hugely over the next decades. As the Baby Boom Gen-eration ages, the number of Americans over age 65 will double to 69.4 million in30 years, and the number of Americans over age 85 will quadruple. Currently, 64percent of cancer occurs in patients over 65, the Medicare population. By 2010 can-cer incidence is expected to increase 29 percent and mortality 25 percent with an-nual costs exceeding $200 billion. The Medicare program is already facing seriousproblems, but it will be utterly overwhelmed and crippled if cancer prevention and424 treatment options do not improve significantly over the next thirty years. It is im- perative, thus, to mount an aggressive cancer research front immediately. Let me summarize for you what is needed to mount an aggressive and successful, federal campaign against cancer that can fully exploit the promising research oppor-tunities that abound and then apply that knowledge to improve cancer prevention,detection, and treatment at a time when the incidence of cancer is projected to in-crease dramatically. We need a 15 percent increase in the NIH budget and $4.1 bil-lion for the National Cancer Institute. These increases will enable high-quality andinnovative research, much needed support and training for young investigators, newequipment for researchers and institutions, and the necessary infrastructure to sup-port cancer research in our increasingly technologically sophisticated age. We alsoneed to fully support the important cancer related programs at the CDC, such asthe cancer registries, breast and cervical cancer detection programs, and the Envi-ronmental Health lab among others. We recommend that the Committee provide$622 million for cancer control efforts at the CDC. The combined efforts of and ade-quate funding for NIH, NCI, and CDC are integral to understand, prevent, diag-nose, treat, and ultimately eradicate cancer. I wish to thank you for allowing meto present this to you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CHILDREN 'SHEART FOUNDATION Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Subcommittee Members: On behalf of The Chil- dren 's Heart Foundation and all who are suffering from congenital heart defects we enter this testimony for consideration at the fiscal year 2001 budget hearings. According to the NIH Guide (Gene Nutrient Interactions in the pathogeneses of congenital heart defects), September 1994, 42 percent of all birth defects are causedby congenital heart defects. Eight percent of all deaths during the first year of lifeare caused by this condition, and of the 30,000 babies born each year with thisanomaly, 2,900 of them will die before their first birthday. Thirty six hundred chil-dren under the age of fifteen die annually from congenital cardiovascular malforma-tions (CCVM) or congenital heart defects. In addition to the incredible impact on families, the social costs are great as well. Many children who survive infancy are forced into a life of dependency on medica-tions, medical procedures, and repeated open-heart surgeries. In 1992 nearly $500million was spent to pay for 44,000 hospitalized children who were under fifteenyears old. Because so few of these children live long enough to have children of their own, it has been difficult to carry out genetic studies of CCVM. However researchers havenow come to the conclusion that most CCVM occurrences are caused by genetic de-fects. According to information provided by the NHL&BI, the direct cause for atleast eight different structural heart defects may be genetic. While we at The Children 's Heart Foundation appreciate the genetic studies that have been ongoing at the NIH, we also realize that clinical studies on proceduresand methods of treatment are vital to the future of patients suffering with con-genital heart defects. We wish to encourage the committee to support more clinicalprojects in congenital heart research. It is our understanding that at present thebudget for congenital heart research at the NHL&BI is fifty million dollars. We ask that the members of this committee grant fifty million additional dollars to the NHL&BI with directives to increase clinical and molecular research con-cerning congenital heart defects. The increase will bring the budget to 100 milliondollars, but in a budget of, what we understand to be 15 billion dollars this is asmall increase to support research in America 's number one birth defect. In the next few pages we will present the stories of some of the families who have lived with these life-threatening conditions. One of these families has lost the battlewhile others still live with the daily difficulties that accompany their illness. Pleaseaccept these testimonies and the requests to testify before this committee under theauspices of The Children 's Heart Foundation. Individuals and grassroots efforts can only do so much. Congress must take on this effort and increase appropriations. So again, we implore this committee to grantan increase of fifty million dollars to the fiscal year 2001 budget earmarked to theNHL&BI for congenital heart defects research. We thank you for your attention toour requests.425 PREPARED STATEMENT OF JESSICA COWIN Mr. Chairman, members of the committee and all who hear this testimony. My name is Jessica Cowin and I am 16 years old. I am requesting to be slotted to testifybefore the appropriations subcommittee. I have had five heart surgeries since I was 4 days old because I was born with a hypo plastic left heart. A hypo plastic left heart is a heart that has no left side,in other words I had no pump. At 4 days and 18 months the doctors performedclosed heart surgeries on me. At 5 years and 13 years, I had open-heart surgeries.All of these surgeries worked, for a while, but my heart began to fail in the lasttwo years. The doctors and my parents agreed that I needed a heart transplant. Itwas very scary to think that the doctors were going to put someone else 's heart in- side of me, but if I wanted to live longer that 's what I had to do. On September 25, 1999, my mother got a phone call from the Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago (where I have had all of my surgeries), saying that they hada heart for me. It has been two months since my transplant and even though I amon a lot of medication I already feel better. Before the transplant I had no energyand got sick more often than other children. It also took me longer to get better.I have also missed a lot of school in the past three years and I missed my friends,too. This has been very stressful for my family because everyone worries a lot about me. I still have to go to a lot of doctors, physical therapy, counseling and cardiacrehabilitation. I know my mom worries a lot about the medical bills even thoughshe tries not to show it. Without the research for congenital heart defects, I would not be here today. I was born in 1983 at Children 's Memorial Hospital. At that time they were not even doing heart transplants there. They started doing transplants in 1988, when I was5 years old. I have personally benefited from the research of all of my five surgeries. My mom tells me that there are still babies born with heart problems that do not live and that I am really lucky that I have such good doctors and that they knewwhat to do for me. I agree with her. Please provide more federal funding for con-genital heart research to the National Institute of Health. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANDREA PIWOWAR My name is Andrea Piwowar. Twenty-three years ago, I was born with several congenital heart defects. I was diagnosed with tricuspid atresia with transpositionof the great arteries and a large ventricular septal defect associated with pulmonaryhypertension and an absent pulmonary valve. When I was three months old, I had a banding of the pulmonary artery. In Janu- ary of 1982, I had a modified Fontan, a surgical procedure which makes it possiblefor blood to enter the lungs without being pumped in by the right ventricle. Thisis achieved by connecting the pulmonary artery directly to the right atrium. In mysituation, since I had transposition of the great arteries and a ventricular septal de-fect along with tricuspid atresia, the underlying need for the Fontan procedure, thesurgeon corrected the transposition and closed the hole between the two atria. Seven months following the modified Fontan, I had a stroke. In December of the same year, I had yet another stroke. It is my understanding that it was thoughtthat clots were forming in the pulmonary stump; therefore, after the second stroke,I was operated on again and the pulmonary stump was removed. The doctors couldnot find where the clots came from. Even to this day, there is no explanation of thestrokes. After that operation, I was put on Coumadin and Lanoxin. As a result of the strokes, which occurred after my corrective heart operations, I have both orthopedic and speech impairments and require the use of an electricwheelchair for mobility purposes. Throughout my childhood, my parents fought forthe appropriate accommodations to be made in the school systems and for my rightto be in classes with able-bodied children. I felt like it was necessary for me to workharder on class assignments just so I could keep up with the class. I also felt thatI had to prove myself to my teachers. I am now an Indiana University graduate and am currently looking for a job. I have had a couple of interviews and have spoken with employers and recruiters overthe telephone. At times, I feel as if my impairments make it difficult for me to makea good first impression with potential employers. I have been hung up on whilespeaking with recruiters and employers have postponed and cancelled interviewswith me. Like other patients who have had the Fontan operation, I am beginning to see some of its side effects. Within two years, I have had atrial fibrillation three times,426 each time requiring a cardio version to get back into normal rhythm. I also have an enlarged atrium which is causing my blood return to become sluggish. My first bout with atrial fibrillation occurred during the week of college midterms. I thought it might have been something that I had brought on myself, because Ihad been working on several projects at one time and staying up late to study, butI hadn 't done anything differently than I did during the previous semester. It wasn 't until I was in the hospital that I found out that atrial fibrillation was a side effectfrom the Fontan procedure. No one had informed me of any possible side effects of the Fontan. Only by speak- ing with my cardiologist and reading personal experiences of other Fontan patientsI am beginning to understand more about the side effects; however, I have yet tounderstand why some people with congenital heart defects have strokes while othersdo not. As I mentioned earlier, no one can explain why I had two strokes after theModified Fontan operation. Several years ago, I wrote a letter to Dr. Thilenius, the cardiologist who saw me before and after the modified Fontan procedure was performed, inquiring aboutHypo plastic Left Heart Syndrome. I received a response that explained what Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome was and the surgical procedures that could be per-formed, depending on the severity of this disease. I was also given an explanationof my congenital heart defects and the surgical procedure that were performed tocorrect them. I was informed that strokes rarely occur after a Fontan procedure, sorarely in fact, that it is not even mentioned as a complication, but yet they stilloccur and no one seems to know why. So, I ask you, the distinguished members of the subcommittee, to increase appro- priations to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to support clinical studiesin the area of congenital heart research. As more congenital heart research is per-formed, researchers may discover why some people with congenital heart disease aremore prone to having a stroke than others and find a way to prevent them fromoccurring. I would like to submit my request to be given the opportunity to testify before you, the distinguished members of the subcommittee, on the issue of allocating in-creased funds to the National Institute of Health for congenital heart research. Thank you for your time. PREPARED STATEMENT OF MEGAN VAN PELT My name is Megan Van Pelt and I am the mother of a child born with a con- genital heart defect. Congenital heart defects have been a part of my life since Iwas a child. My Cousin was born with a very severe congenital heart defect andunderwent many open-heart surgeries. Being a child I could have never understoodthe magnitude or impact on the family during this time. Doctors told my aunt thathe would not live past the age of nine. By the grace of god and congenital heartresearch twenty-nine years later my cousin is still alive and functioning as a normalhealthy adult. Who could know that twenty-seven years later, I myself would dealwith the issue of congenital heart defects. In the summer of 1997 my husband andI were anxiously awaiting the arrival of our first child. During my routine twenty-four week check up I was excited to finally see our baby in an ultrasound. As theultrasound progressed the technician informed me that she needed to get the obste-trician to come in and look at the baby 's heart. After the doctor reviewed the tape, he informed me that our unborn child had a complex congenital heart defect. Formy husband and me the next three months were a blur of cardiology visits andInternet research. On October 10, 1997 my amazing son, John ''Jack '' Ryan Van Pelt, came into our lives, changing us forever. Nothing could have prepared me forthe next four months. Jack was born a navy blue color which according to the doc-tors was normal because of the lack of oxygen his body was getting. Jack weighed4.5 pounds at birth. He was immediately transported to Children 's Hospital in Chi- cago. I have never felt so helpless. A heart catheterization which was done shortly after Jack arrived at Children 's Hospital, confirmed the initial diagnosis of transposition of the great vessels as wellas three holes in his heart. This meant that Jack 's heart had developed backwards and all his blood was flowing in the wrong direction. Because of Jack 's size the Cardio-Thorasic team did not feel that he was strong enough or big enough to sur-vive the complicated surgery that he needed. We spent the next two months in theNeonatal Intensive Care unit, waiting. Because of his heart Jack experienced liverand kidney failure. Everyday was a hurdle for Jack and many days were touch andgo. I thanked God for everyday I had with him.427 Finally on December 4th the surgeons felt Jack 's condition was deteriorating and the surgery could no longer wait. The surgeons explained at length the surgery thatJack would undergo. The procedure was relatively new and if successful Jack wouldnot need to undergo future surgeries. I will never be able to verbalize how it feltto sign my son 's life over to this team of doctors. The actual surgery took ten hours. When Jack came out of surgery everyone warned us he would look horrible, I amhappy to say, they were all wrong. My husband and I could not believe how pink he now looked. His body was finally receiving oxygen. The doctors warned us thatthe next 48 hours would be the most critical. Jack came through with flying colors.He had fought for his life and won. My son was a survivor. Through those three months I could not believe the amount of people I became close to who had children surviving with congenital hearts defects and dying fromcongenital heart defects. This is the number one birth defect that children are bornwith, why don 't most parents know this? Why isn 't there better education? But most importantly why isn 't there more research? There are children that I met who will undergo open-heart surgery every three years as their hearts grow. Unfortunatelythe funding for projects is not there to help researchers find ways to fix defects thefirst time so it will be the only time these children are forced to undergo additionallifesaving procedures. I am happy to say that Jack is doing very well at the age of two. We visit the cardiologist once a year. With every visit I hold my breath afraid that he will needanother surgery. Should that day come we will take it in stride. The most terrifyingpart of having one child with a congenital heart defect becomes the fact that everychild you have following has an even higher chance of being born with a congenitalheart defect. One out of every 115 babies is born with a congenital heart defect inthe U.S. each year. There are many worthy causes and issues today, but there needsto be a greater awareness of this, our number one birth defect. Because of our expe-rience it has been extremely important to my husband and I to give back. We havebecome involved with the Children 's Heart Foundation, which raises money for re- search in congenital heart defects. Many of our recipients have gone on to receivefunding from the NIH for pediatric congenital heart research. When it comes rightdown to it, the funding that is needed isn 't there. The American Heart Association gives less than 1 percent of their funding to research of congenital heart defects. I ask you to take the time to visit a cardiac wing in a pediatric hospital. There is a great chance that your family, friends, or associates have been or will be af-fected by a congenital heart defect. My family is reminded of it daily my cousinwhom I spoke of earlier and his wife are seven months pregnant. Sadly they havejust found out through ultrasound that their child will need to have open-heart sur-gery. I ask you to sincerely consider dedicating more money for the research of pedi-atric congenital heart research. Help us to educate the public and find the answersto the number one birth defect. Thank you for your time and consideration. We havean opportunity as the leading healthcare nation in the world to find cures and newsurgical procedures to help these brave young fighters and I encourage you to sup-port us in the fight. Thank you for your attention. PREPARED STATEMENT OF TERESA TAYLOR Mr. Chairman; and Members of the Committee. I am requesting to be slotted to testify before the appropriation sub-committee and I am honored to give my per-sonal testimony. My name is Teresa Taylor from Skokie, Illinois in the county of Cook, the 21st Congressional District of Illinois in the United States of America. I would like toaddress this committee on behalf of all the children born with congenital heart dis-ease, those surviving, and in honor of those that have lost their lives including myson, Sam. It is with a personal story and a family history that I testify. I want to go down on record that my son Sam and countless others that have died prematurely not forgotten but remembered. And to be a constant reminder for theneed for additional federal funding for research on congenital heart defects. My son Sam, was born in Chicago, Illinois April 1993. He was born with hypo plastic left heart syndrome. In other words, his left side of his heart was under-developed. The left side of the heart is the main pumping chamber of the heart andpumps blood to the rest of the body. The devastation over our son 's condition has caused us great sorrow and pain. We knew very little in 1993 of his disease. There was little that we could do except lis-ten to the Doctors ' prognosis and go along with the treatment they suggested. In 1993, the options for Sam were immediate open-heart surgery, or wait for a heart428 transplant. We opted to place Sam on a heart transplant list originally called the UNOS (united network of organ sharing). We were told that Sam would probablyget a heart within the next 6 -9 weeks. We did not receive a heart when we had thought. The heart for Sam came when he was 5 months old. He lived in the hos-pital his whole life on a ventilator. I would not call this life support but assistanceso that his heart and lungs would not flood up with blood while he waited for aheart. Sam died 2 weeks after transplantation. He died due to lung and hospital related infections. Because Sam waited only two days short of the longest wait foran infant heart doctors did not know what to expect of his out come. Today doctorsknow that an infant and most likely any patient waiting for a heart transplant can-not survive as long as Sam did on a ventilator. Because of Sam, doctors know thatit is critical to find better ways to manage a patient waiting for a heart transplantand open-heart surgery. Today at Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, doctors have perfected open-heart surgery that would have been used on Sam instead oftransplantation (the procedure is called Norwood). Research helped in this matterand patients like Sam helped them in their research. Sam and other children paidwith their lives to help doctors understand congenital heart defects and find waysto better manage and treat their condition. I make a plea to this committee, let this show that research is direly needed to prevent cases where the doctors only learned after the child 's death of appropriate treatment for a child with a congenital heart defect. My story does not end here. I had a brother who died from a congenital heart defect called tetralogy of Fallot. Today, many are living many more years thanksto research. These dedicated Doctors to find ways to manage and treat children withcongenital heart defect such as tetralogy of Fallot. My family history of congenitalheart defects goes back at least three generations. All of those in my family whodied were boys. I would like my daughters to one day have children of their own.I would hope that they will feel safe that if they have a boy and he is born withcongenital heart disease that they will not have to grieve for the loss of their sonbut embrace his survival. It is my personal dream to see my son in the face of mydaughter 's children, happy and healthy. I want this story to someday have a happy ending to parents across the country because federal dollars were spent in providing research in this area, we need asparents to take a stand and ask questions. Why did this happen to my child, isthere research being done in this area, what is the treatment for these children,what is their long term prognosis, will we learn something from this and can ourchildren have the future that they deserve so much? I have heard countless stories subsequent to our son Sam 's death. Stories of sur- vivors with the same condition Sam was born with. These children are living todaybecause of research in congenital heart defects. I only wish today that my son hadthis chance for a life. I can only wish to carry on a legacy in his name, to help otherchildren have a chance to live and enjoy life like other children. The more moneythat can be generated toward research, the more children in the future will livewith a heart defect not die of it. I plead to this committee to pleases allocate morefederal dollars to the to the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and to direct researchfunds on congenital heart disease. Thank you for your attention in this matter. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE DORIS DAYANIMAL LEAGUE The Doris Day Animal League is a non-profit, member supported national animal advocacy organization located in Washington, D.C. On behalf of our 295,000 mem-bers and supporters, we respectfully present to the subcommittee our concerns relat-ing to The Coulston Foundation of New Mexico and continued federal funding ofthat facility. The Coulston Foundation is a private animal research laboratory based in Alamogordo, New Mexico. It reportedly owns more than 600 chimpanzees, 300 otherprimates, and an unknown number of other animals who are kept at two facilities,one on civilian ground, the other on Holloman Air Force Base. The Coulston Foundation has the worst animal care record of any research facility in the history of the Animal Welfare Act, and has long been of concern to the animalprotection community and many Members of Congress. The laboratory has been in-vestigated seven times by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for seriousviolations of the Animal Welfare Act. While the seventh investigation is ongoing, theprevious six have led to formal charges against the lab. In August 1999, The Coulston Foundation and USDA signed an unprecedented settlement agreement pertaining to the most recent set of charges. Under the settle-429 ment, The Coulston Foundation agreed to divest 300 of its chimpanzees by January 2002, allow external financial and animal welfare monitors to inspect the facilities,and to ''cease and desist '' from further violating the Animal Welfare Act. Yet at least five chimpanzees have died at The Coulston Foundation since the agreement wassigned. The case of Donna, a 36 year old chimpanzee is perhaps the most shocking of these recent deaths. She died last November from severe infection to the uterus,bowels and peritoneal cavity after carrying a dead fetus in her womb for at leasttwo weeks. Records indicate that veterinary staff at The Coulston Foundation wereaware of Donna 's condition, but failed to provide adequate care in a timely fashion. In total, at least 14 chimpanzees and 4 other primates have died negligent deaths at The Coulston Foundation since 1993. Three chimpanzees died at the lab thatyear when the temperature in their cage soared to 150 degrees. In 1994, four mon-keys died at the laboratory from water deprivation and resultant dehydration. In1997, a healthy 11 year old chimpanzee named Jello died after being improperlyanesthetized. In March of that year, another chimpanzee, Echo, died when veteri-nary staff failed to stabilize her for shock before surgery. In early 1998 a chim-panzee named Holly died during a drug testing protocol. In June 1998, two morechimpanzees died during a protocol involving the same drug tested on Holly. In May1999, a chimpanzee who was being used in an invasive spinal study died from neg-ligent care. Five others, including Donna, died at The Coulston Foundation in thesecond half of 1999. The USDA is not the only federal agency concerned with the deteriorating situa- tion at The Coulston Foundation. In fact, in December 1999, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration placed a restriction on The Coulston Foundation for 270 violations ofGood Laboratory Practice standards, and warned the lab that no protocols or datawould be accepted by the agency until the violations are corrected. As a major funder of The Coulston Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has also shown concern over the laboratory 's record, and in February, 1999, it placed a restriction on funding to the lab. According to the restriction, futurefunding would depend on The Coulston Foundation 's hiring of seven ''fully qualified '' veterinarians. However, it is our understanding that the laboratory has only twofull-time veterinarians to date. The situation at The Coulston Foundation is quickly deteriorating. Documents ob- tained from NIH under the Freedom of Information Act state that ''Based on current cash flow of [The Coulston Foundation], it appears unlikely that it can continue op-erating for much more than two or three months longer ''. That document was dated April 29, 1999. Since that time, NIH has granted at least $1.1 million in ''supplemental awards '' to the laboratory. This continued fund- ing appears to be in direct contravention of NIH 's own restriction and the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, under which the Director of NIH must ''suspend or revoke Public Health Service funds '' to any facility which has failed to correct violations of the Animal Welfare Act. It is time for a candid reassessment of the Federal Government 's involvement with The Coulston Foundation. The prospect of the laboratory going bankrupt isvery real, and the short- and long-term ramifications for the welfare of hundredsof animals there are serious. While my organization understands that NIH is notultimately responsible for the welfare of the animals at The Coulston Foundation,it does bear some moral responsibility for the animals there, many of which werebred for and used in NIH-funded research. There is immense public concern for the welfare of the animals at The Coulston Foundation, many of whom were previously owned by the Air Force and are the sur-vivors and descendants of America 's space program. There is also frustration over the financial aspect of the situation. While The Coulston Foundation is seeminglyincapable of complying with the law, it has been the recipient of millions of federaldollars (at least $27 million since 1993), and continues to receive taxpayers ' money through NIH. The government must address the situation at The Coulston Foundation and work to avert what could be a potentially disastrous scenario. We, therefore, respectfullyask the government to take emergency action and appropriate $5 million via fiscalyear 2001 Appropriations for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Re-lated Agencies for the care of the 300 chimpanzees which The Coulston Foundationis under federal order to divest. While the ownership and care of the animals cer-tainly ought to be transferred to another party, the chimpanzees could feasibly re-main on Holloman Air Force Base for the time being. As a long-term solution to the problems at The Coulston Foundation, we urge Congress to pass the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection430 1Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. 2000. Federal Funding for Bio- medical and Related Life Science Research fiscal year 2001. http://www.faseb.org.Act (H.R. 3514), which would create a network of federally supported private sanc-tuaries to which chimpanzees no longer needed in research could be retired. The chimpanzees and other animals at The Coulston Foundation are unable to advocate for themselves, and the laws which are supposed to protect them are fail-ing to do so. While it is The Coulston Foundation 's ultimate responsibility to provide for the animals in its care, it seems incapable of doing so. The government has en-abled the situation to escalate by continuing to fund the breeding and use of ani-mals at the laboratory. A new direction is desperately needed. We respectfully ask this Congress to en- sure that our own government does not perpetuate a situation which is ultimatelyharmful to the very animals it is charged with protecting, and instead takes actionto remedy the deteriorating situation at The Coulston Foundation. Thank you foryour consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETIES FOR EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY Mr. Chairman, Mr. Harkin, Members of the Subcommittee: The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, FASEB, is the largest organization oflife scientists in the United States. Founded in 1912, FASEB is comprised of 20 soci-eties with a combined membership of more than 60,000 scientists. Each year,FASEB brings together representatives of our member societies to review the bio-medical research programs at NIH and other federal agencies. After considerabledeliberation and debate, these scientists produced funding recommendations foreach agency examined. This year 's proposals are contained in a report released for this budget cycle. 1 First, we would like to thank both the chairman and ranking member for their ardent support for the research programs at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)and for their efforts over the past two years toward doubling the NIH budget withinfive years. We also would like to ask that both Mr. Specter and Mr. Harkin continueto work with their colleagues to press forward with this vital national investment.We urge them to provide NIH with a 15 percent increase for fiscal year 2001, mak-ing the third installment toward the bipartisan goal to double the NIH budget. Thisadditional funding is needed to sustain and further increase the momentum withinNIH programs that has been begun through your hard work. While FASEB believes there are many issues important to the continued long- term success of the NIH and health research in this nation, our statement will focuson our two highest priorities. First, we need to fund more research projects, espe-cially investigator-initiated research projects, and second, we need to ensure a con-tinued supply of highly-talented science personnel to carry out that research. Research that is conceived and initiated by individual scientists, investigator-initi- ated research, has been the key to the nation 's extraordinary progress in science. The magic that NIH has produced over its history has occurred by supporting cre-ative scientists to do excellent research in laboratories around the nation. We haverequired them to compete for support, under scrutiny of their peers and competitors,in the marketplace of ideas. The resulting scientific innovation and progress pro-duced by this mechanism is attested to by the fact that since 1945, 57 of the 76U.S. winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were supported by NIHbefore they won their award, including the 1999 award-recipient, Dr. Gunter Blobel.The competitive, peer-reviewed system has excellence at its core and should remainthe principal mechanism used by NIH to distribute research support. NIH shouldsupport the work of more scientists in their laboratories; this will be the key to in-creasing research productivity of the system as a whole. This competitive system is,we truly believe, the most efficient, cost-effective and productive way to carry outbiomedical research and to maximize the return we get from it. Budget increases, therefore, should be used largely to support more research grants and to fund them at the lengths and levels approved by the peer-review proc-ess. In some study sections, where grant applications are reviewed, my colleaguesreport that projects rated among the top twenty to twenty five percent come backfor re-review when the NIH is unable to fund them. We need more resources toeliminate the redundant and discouraging cycle of re-submission and re-review. Weneed scientists doing research, not ''in the system '' of review. There is no shortage of good ideas. Therefore:431 \u2014the central principle guiding dispersal of research funds by NIH is \u2014and should remain \u2014competitive merit review by their peers; and \u2014the first priority in allocating NIH budget increases should be to support more grants for research initiated by individual scientists and to fund proposals atthe durations and levels recommended by peer-review. With a 5.6 percent increase in funding for fiscal year 2001, NIH predicts that it will be able to fund 31,524 research project grants, an increase of only 237 grantsover the fiscal year 2000 estimate. We recognize that several mitigating issues con-tribute to this situation. One appears to be the prudent concern about making toomany long-term commitments without the assurance of continuity of growth in NIHfunding. That is, if too many grants are funded one year then many fewer grantsmight be renewed the next year if growth does not continue. There was also signifi-cant need to re-build base programs that were unable to be fully developed by NIHin the past due to financial restraints. Furthermore, an increasing number of sci-entific questions today require interdisciplinary strategies. These strategies tend toinvolve powerful new areas of science and involve complex new technologies and,consequently, they are typically very expensive. However, the inability to fund more grants illustrates the limitations of the pro- posed 5.6 percent increase. The total number of funded projects will rise only lessthan one percent, and the number of new grants awarded will actually decrease.With the continued increase in the NIH budget that we advocate here, it is nowtime to turn our attention toward investigator-initiated projects and substantiallyincrease their numbers. In summary, the best way to sustain the phenomenal productivity flowing from laboratories across the country is through competitively reviewed, investigator-initi-ated research projects. Further increasing the number of investigator-initiatedprojects will accelerate our efforts to prevent, treat and cure diseases affecting mil-lions of Americans and their families. Hand in hand with the need for more research projects is the need to invest in the training of more scientists. We need to inspire young people to pursue careersin science. To attract a new generation of highly talented individuals, we mustpresent them with a vision of opportunity to make a career in academic biomedicalresearch with a realistic chance for success. Funding new investigators brings newand creative ideas into science and sets the stage for future progress. A decreasein new grants sends a devastatingly negative message to the young people of thisnation. The absolute number of proposals from first-time applicants has declined as a per- centage of total grant applications during the 1980s and 1990s. This is an unfortu-nate loss to the science community, as young investigators have frequently been thesource of the novel insights that have led to major scientific breakthroughs. We aresuccessful at ensuring that our young scientists have the appropriate skills to suc- ceed, but we must also make sure that they do not lose the desire or lack the meansto establish their own laboratories and initiatives. Therefore we encourage NIH tocontinue developing and implementing competitive funding mechanisms that pro-vide salary support and start-up funding to facilitate the transition of outstandingyoung investigators from their post-doctoral training to independent positions. One indispensable group of researchers, physician-scientists, is already facing a critical shortfall. Physician-scientists bring a unique perspective to medical researchand education. This group plays an essential role in the cross-fertilization betweenmedical research and medical practice. Their contributions in laboratory and clinicalsettings are central to the progress in the battle against disease. In addition, theyplay an essential role in training tomorrow 's physicians in the practice of scientific medicine. To ensure the rapid and effective translation of research knowledge intohealth care practice, and to ensure that insights from medical practice reach thelaboratories, we need to have a strong cadre of physician-scientists working in med-ical schools and teaching hospitals across the nation. Concern over the relative decline in the numbers of physician-scientists led FASEB to initiate a major review of issues related to the education and career de-velopment of this important research resource. Our study concluded that there isa real threat to the future supply of physician-scientists. There has been a declinein the number of new physicians choosing to pursue research careers. Concomi-tantly, the current pool of physician-scientists is aging. We found that the propor-tion under the age of 45 was at an all-time low. These findings suggest that we mayhave lost our ability to recruit young, talented physicians to careers involving re-search. One plausible cause for this trend is that increasing medical school debt compels newly trained physicians to enter clinical practice in order to pay off their sizableloans. Other possible factors include a dearth of physician-scientist role models in432 medical schools and residency training programs, a decrease of emphasis on re- search and the science underlying medicine in medical school curricula, as well asperceptions that the research career is too daunting or prone to failure. Further-more, declining revenues in academic medical centers (brought on by managed careand other external forces) have tended to increase the clinical burdens placed onphysician-scientists and have adversely affected the attractiveness or feasibility ofthis career path. Combined M.D./Ph.D. programs such as the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) have been quite successful in producing physician-scientists; however, theseprograms do not support many or most M.D./Ph.D. candidates because funding forpositions in these programs is so limited. FASEB therefore recommends that youenhance the contribution of this successful program by doubling its budget, therebyincreasing its capacity to recruit and train bright, young physician-scientists. MSTP and other M.D./Ph.D. programs are designed for first-year medical students who know they seek a career in medical research; however, there are also insuffi-cient training opportunities for medical students and medical graduates who becomeinterested in pursuing this career path after their medical training begins. FASEBhas proposed a series of recommendations to correct this situation: \u2014a national program for debt forgiveness for physicians who receive rigorous re- search training and pursue research careers; \u2014support for the training and mentoring of early career physician-scientists through expansion of research training programs for medical students, residentsand physicians who have already completed specialty training; and, \u2014elimination of the statutory salary caps on NIH awards to extramural investiga- tors so as to remove disincentives to research careers in medical centers. Our principal reason for submitting our perspective to the subcommittee is to ask their continued support for doubling NIH funding by fiscal year 2003. We need tofund more research projects and support more researchers. Quantifiable results willtake time to see from this new investment. But as evidenced by the spectacularachievements resulting from our past investment that are being realized in doctor 's offices and biotechnology companies today, the funds that we invest now will yieldamazing future results that will further revolutionize medicine. For instance, a recent NIH-sponsored breast cancer prevention trial offers to make an enormous impact on public health, and the lives of countless Americanwomen, by providing the first proven measure to reduce the risk of breast cancer.In this trial, the drug tamoxifen, was shown to reduce the incidence of breast cancerin women at high risk for the disease. The underlying evidence that led the NIHinvestigators to pose this particular question was grounded in studies initiated dec-ades ago. Specifically, tamoxifen was first developed more than 20 years ago as atreatment for breast cancer, and the genetic mapping efforts that culminated in theidentification of two breast cancer related genes, BRCA 1 and 2, were also initiatedin the 1980s. Today, scientists are continuing to look for other drugs that mightsimilarly reduce the risk of cancer and also reduce the side effects associated withuse of this drug in some women. Thus, the cycle continues and the gains to be hadare amplified. But such benefits take time to accomplish. Another example is the discovery that mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause medullary thyroid carcinoma; a cancer that is often hereditary and is difficult totreat once it develops. This discovery made it possible to identify the carriers of thismutated gene within high-risk families with 100 percent certainty. The thyroidgland of carriers of the mutated gene could then be removed in early childhood be-fore any tumors developed and metastasized. NIH-funded research supported inves-tigators at each stage of this work from the discovery of this gene to the mappingof the genetic locus and the identification of mutations. Nearly 15 years elapsedfrom the initiation of the mapping to the identification of the causative gene. Today,the discovery process stemming from this research continues with the identificationof other components in the RET system and the unexpected recent recognition that mutations in some of these other components cause Hirschsprung disease, which isthe most common cause of intestinal obstruction in childhood. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman (and members of the subcommittee), the public has expressed its support for increased funding for medical research and leaders bothin Congress and in the Administration have supported the goal of doubling the NIHbudget within five years. Funding increases in the last two years have enabled NIHto sow the seeds of discoveries that we will reap three to five years from now. Withincreased support for young investigators and physician-scientists, we will inspireand encourage researchers who will continue to make these discoveries a decadefrom now.433 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CHEST PHYSICIANS I am Susan Pingleton, M.D., FCCP, President of the American College of Chest Physicians, Professor of Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Di-rector of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at the University of Kansas Med-ical Center, Medical Director of the Medical ICU, Chair of the ICU Committee, anda member of the KU Internal Medicine Foundation Board Trustees and the Grad-uate Medical Education Committee. Thank you for affording me the opportunity to submit this testimony for the record on behalf of the American College of Chest Physicians ( ''ACCP ''). The ACCP is a professional medical specialty society of more than 14,500 physicians, scientists,allied health professionals and educators who specialize in diseases of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system. Since it was established in 1935, the College has beena leader in cardiopulmonary medicine. Its members are specialists in pulmonology,cardiology, cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery and critical care medicine. TheCollege provides a unique opportunity for these specialists to further their profes-sional education and to combine expertise from several disciplines in the study ofheart and lung disease. The ACCP appreciates the opportunity to offer its views to this important Com- mittee on fiscal year 2001 appropriations for the National Institutes of Health(''NIH'') and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ''CDC ''). The ACCP is proud of its historic role in working with and supporting various institutes at NIHwho in turn support and encourage biomedical research of great importance to ourpatients and the entire country. The President 's budget request for NIH of approximately $18.8 billion, while laud- able, does not go far enough to prevent and combat all of the health problems overwhich the NIH has responsibility. We applaud this Committee 's efforts to make fis- cal year 2000 funding for the National Institutes of Health a top priority, but westill need to commit substantial resources to research and prevention of pulmonaryand cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the College urges you to appropriate a 15percent increase over fiscal year 2000 funding for the overall NIH. We agree withsuch groups as the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding and the AmericanHeart Association that an increase of this level is necessary to sustain the highstandard of scientific achievement embodied by the institutes. Thus, we recommenda fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $20.6 billion for the NIH. We also support a 15percent increase over fiscal year 2000 funding for NIH heart and lung research spe-cifically. The College supports significant increases to the budgets of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute ( ''NHLBI '') and the National Institute of Allergy and Infec- tious Disease ( ''NIAID '') to levels that will enable these fine institutes to continue their wide spectrum of research, both basic and applied, for the prevention andtreatment of cardiovascular and lung disease. With respect to the NHLBI, the ACCPrecommends a fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $2.330 billion. This level of fundingwill allow the NHLBI to expand many of its existing programs and fund excitingnew initiatives. The NHLBI is committed to maximizing the use of new technologiesthat are quickly becoming available and ensuring that standard health practicesthroughout the country reflect a thorough utilization of the knowledge that re-searchers and health professionals have acquired. This increase in funding willallow the NHLBI to expand its programs for genomic analysis in cardiovascular,lung, and blood diseases, in an effort to more precisely identify the causes and ap-propriate treatments of disease. NHLBI will be able to continue and advance a pilotprogram that is testing new uses of MRI technology to diagnose heart attack pa-tients who may be candidates for thrombolytic therapy, a clot-dissolving treatmentthat may be able to significantly limit damage from heart attacks. This increase infunding will also enable NHLBI to establish innovative new clinical research net-works, and study the underlying reasons for health disparities among various seg-ments of the population in order to reduce these disparities. Combating asthma is a high priority for the College. We know it is a priority for both the NHLBI and NIAID. The ACCP supports a fiscal year 2001 appropriationof $935 million for NIAID, not including the estimated allocation for AIDS. Morethan 50 million Americans suffer from allergies and/or asthma, and these diseasesare major causes of illness and disability. The economic costs associated with asth-ma are enormous. Asthma costs the U.S. about $7.5 billion annually. Between theyears 1980 and 1994, the prevalence of asthma in the U.S. rose 75 percent. Theprevalence of pediatric asthma rose 160 percent during these years. In addition,asthma morbidity and mortality rates have been increasing in the United Statesover the last decade, with over 5,500 people dying in 1996 as a result of an asthmaattack. These increases have been concentrated disproportionately in children and434 minorities. These increases are alarming to the ACCP. We therefore strongly sup- port the efforts of the NHLBI and NIAID in working to establish control over thisdisease. The need for continued funding of tuberculosis ( ''TB'') prevention and treatment is painfully clear. TB is the eighth leading cause of death worldwide. Two millionpeople will die from TB this year. One out of every three people in the world haslatent TB, thus creating a huge potential for transmission of the disease and devel-opment of active TB. Multi-drug resistant TB, which is caused by incorrect or in-complete treatment, is an increasing problem in this country and throughout theworld, with as many as 50 million individuals infected. Multi-drug resistant TB killsmore than half of those infected in the United States and is usually fatal in the de-veloping world. These statistics underscore the necessity of continued funding forTB prevention and treatment activities. Given the ease with which TB is transmitted, however, the statistics of reported cases do not reveal the whole story. Consider these statistics: an infected personwith a normal immune system has approximately a 10 percent lifetime risk of devel-oping active TB. If a person is HIV co-infected, he or she has an 8 percent annualrisk of developing active TB. Therefore, if a person is infected with HIV and TB,and lives five years from the time of the TB infection, there is a 40 percent chancethat person will develop active TB with the risk it will be spread to others. If thatsame person lives 12 years, it is a virtual certainty that he or she will develop activeTB. With the lives of our children at stake, our Nation 's future, now is not the time to reduce funding for TB. A decrease in federal funding is likely to lead to a surgein active TB cases, including deadly multi-drug resistant TB cases. Tuberculosis isan immense economic drain on families and on nations and is a significant causeof poverty. The ACCP, therefore, urges this Committee to increase funding for TBprevention and treatment activities. Through its federally-funded research, NIAIDhas already determined the complete genomic sequence of two strains of the TB bac-terium. These exciting breakthroughs are crucial to NIAID 's plans to develop a TB vaccine, but these efforts cannot advance without Congress 's substantial financial support. We urge the Congress to support basic and applied research to the fullest capa- bilities. Without it, many of the crucial health benefits produced by the NIH wouldnot be possible. With respect to the NHLBI, we continue to be impressed with thequality of leadership of its Director, Dr. Claude Lenfant. Research sponsored by theNHLBI has led to tremendous strides in combating cardiovascular and pulmonarydiseases as well as hematological disorders. We recognize the strains that have beenplaced upon the federal budget in recent years. Nonetheless, diseases of the heartand lungs continue to pose the most serious threat to our Nation 's health. The desir- ability of exercising fiscal austerity should not cause us to lose sight of the signifi-cant health and financial benefits of funding medical research. The recent scientific achievements of the NIH, and in particular NHLBI, have created promising oppor-tunities for understanding disease and improving medical care. In order to benefitfrom these efforts and create new opportunities for advancement, Congress must in-crease its funding of both existing and proposed research projects. These scientific achievements hold a personal interest for me. I was born with a serious heart defect that had to be corrected through primitive cardiac surgery whenI was a child. I had to be packed in ice to slow down my heart rate. Today, bypassmachines do this work, leaving surgeons to concentrate on the heart itself. My heartstopped during the operation, and the resulting nerve and muscle damage to mylegs required me to learn how to walk again. I was given a low probability of sur-viving past my teenage years, yet here I am today, partially due to scientificachievements. These experiences led me to enter into the medical profession. They also lead me now to support substantially increased funding for clinical research. Indeed, we be-lieve that NIH in general and NHLBI in particular ought to devote greater re-sources to clinical research, the primary focus of many of our members. I am compelled to share with the Committee some very telling NIH statistics about the prevalence of heart and lung disease. Cardiovascular diseases afflict morethan 60 million people. Cardiovascular diseases account for nearly 1 out of every2 deaths in the U.S., and lung disease accounts for 1 out of every 7 deaths in theU.S. In addition to the untold costs of human suffering, the economic costs associ-ated with diseases of the heart, blood vessels, lungs and blood represent 25 percentof the total economic costs due to illness, injury, and death in 1999. More than 30million Americans suffer from a chronic lung disease. Lung diseases alone cost theU.S. economy an estimated $85 billion annually in direct medical expenditures. Themost telling statistic, however, is that heart disease continues to be the number onecause of death in this country. Cerebrovascular disease ranks third, and chronic ob-435 structive pulmonary disease (COPD), including asthma, ranks fourth. Thus, three of the top four leading causes of death are diseases that NHLBI is charged withcombating. These numbers point to NIH 's need for continued federal support for its vital pro- grams. The ACCP continues to do its part to support research. Through our CHESTFoundation, many ACCP members voluntarily donate their own funds every yearto support young investigators. This year, the CHEST Foundation will award morethan 20 clinical research grants to young investigators. We believe this is uniquecompared to other medical societies. We are committed to improving the quality ofthe lives of the most important people we represent \u2014our patients. But we cannot do it alone. NIH appropriation levels must be increased to ensure that our progresstoward that goal is not thwarted. The Federal Government must not waiver in itsstrong commitment to biomedical advances of the future that would yield tens ofbillions of dollars in health care savings. Therefore, funding levels consistent withthe important goals and essential mandate of NIH must be achieved. As first hand observers of hundreds of thousands of deaths each year caused by tobacco usage, the members of the ACCP urge this Committee to fully fund the to-bacco control efforts of the NIH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(''CDC ''). Smoking is the primary cause of preventable death and disability in Amer- ica, causing more than 400,000 deaths, and costing approximately $89 billion annu-ally in medical expenses alone. An estimated 48 million Americans smoke ciga-rettes, and over time, about half will suffer death or disability as a result of theiraddiction. Smoking diseases, such as lung cancer, emphysema, and coronary arterydisease, and other cardiopulmonary diseases have become a major socioeconomicproblem of transcending importance. Treatment of these diseases will continue todrain over $800 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund. There are over 40 diseases/conditions that are caused by or aggravated by the use of tobacco. Lung cancer isthe leading cause of cancer-related death in our population. Yet, the numbers ofcancer diagnoses could be drastically reduced if we could make serious inroads bycurtailing the use of tobacco \u2014the number one cause of lung cancer. The NHLBI has made important strides in identifying the deleterious health effects of smoking, es-pecially with respect to women. The ACCP, which has its own Task Force onWomen, Smoking, and Lung Cancer, supports the Institute 's continued efforts in this important area. Increasing social, political, and legal pressure nationwide against smoking has, overall, made a modest dent in reducing the prevalence in smoking. As physicians,we confront on a daily basis debilitating disease and death that result from inhala-tion of tobacco smoke. While the ACCP has been active for more than 30 years ineducating the public about the harms of smoking, even our best efforts cannotmatch the power of Congress to direct funds to combat lung cancer and other deadlydiseases that result from tobacco use. As part of our commitment to improving the health of our patients, the ACCP supports the work of the CDC in reducing death and chronic morbidity caused bytobacco use. Adequate funding of the tobacco-related research and state initiativesof the CDC are critical. We urge Congress to increase funding for this tobacco pre-vention work at the CDC to $130 million. CDC plays a leadership role in imple-menting and coordinating state-based efforts and is focused on preventing initiationamong youth and promoting cessation. States that are planning to commit tobaccosettlement funds to tobacco prevention have requested considerable technical assist-ance from CDC as they seek to develop comprehensive and effective state programs.States such as Florida, Massachusetts and Mississippi that already have com-prehensive programs in place relied considerably on CDC 's expertise. Funds for to- bacco prevention at CDC are also used to maintain a comprehensive database ofsmoking and health information and conduct laboratory work regarding the dangersof nicotine and other toxic compounds in tobacco. An appropriation of $130 millionwill significantly expand the capacity of health and education departments to buildand evaluate comprehensive tobacco control programs, develop and promote healthcommunication campaigns for target audiences, and expand school health programsthat equip young people with the skills and knowledge to avoid tobacco addiction. Medical science has made giant strides in eliminating some diseases that have af- flicted populations in the United States and throughout the world. The ACCP con-tinues to seek new and improved treatments and procedures to ameliorate the ef-fects of diseases resulting from the direct and indirect inhalation of tobacco smoke.We urge this Committee to take action to curtail the national epidemic of tobacco-related death and disease and to protect our Nation 's children from tobacco addic- tion and disease. On behalf of the American College of Chest Physicians and our millions of pa- tients, I would like to thank you for affording us this opportunity to submit our436 views for your consideration. The ACCP would be happy to answer any questions you may have in the future. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN GASTROENTEROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS The American Gastroenterological Association ( ''AGA '') urges Congress to increase funding for medical research on digestive diseases and disorders over fiscal year2000 by 15 percent for the National Institutes of Health ( ''NIH''), by 41 percent for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ''CDC ''), and by 47 percent for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( ''AHRQ ''). Within NIH, AGA rec- ommends at least a 15 percent increase for the National Institute of Diabetes andDigestive and Kidney Diseases ( ''NIDDK ''), the National Cancer Institute ( ''NCI''), and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( ''NIAID ''). MEDICAL RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS AGA appreciates the opportunity to present its views regarding fiscal year 2001 appropriations for NIH, CDC, and AHRQ. AGA is the nation 's oldest, not-for-profit specialty medical society, consisting of over 10,000 gastroenterologic physicians andscientists who are involved in research, clinical practice, and education on disordersof the digestive system. As the nation 's largest and leading voice of the gastro- intestinal research community, AGA is uniquely qualified to advise Congress on thecurrent status of federally-supported digestive disease research programs and theareas in need of further research. Each year more than 62 million Americans are diagnosed with digestive dis- orders .\u2014Among the more common gastrointestinal disorders are inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disorders, gastrointestinal cancers, and foodborne ill-ness. In some of these areas, medical research has brought us close to developinglifesaving treatments and cures. Yet, in others, we still lack even a basic under-standing of the cause and transmission of the disease. This testimony focuses onthese serious health problems and makes recommendations on how Congress shouldallocate this country 's precious medical research dollars. Specifically, AGA rec- ommends that Congress urge NIH to issue research grants in the following areas: \u2014Intestinal diseases caused by combinations of luminal (including nutritional and bacterial), environmental, and genetic factors with an emphasis on inflam-matory bowel diseases and GI cancers; \u2014Modulation and understanding of epithelial injury and repair to include: under- standing of epithelial cell cycle regulation in the GI tract; the effect of aging;and studies of epithelial stem cells and their use for developing new approachesto organogenesis; \u2014Cellular and molecular regulation of intestinal nutrient and electrolyte trans- porters \u2014to include effects of nutritional factors, genetic abnormalities, aging, and disruption of transport function to understand physiology and pathobiology;and \u2014Development of physiologic tests to characterize the phenotypic subgroups of functional gastrointestinal disorders, including non-ulcer (functional) dyspepsia,functional constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (motility). The following discussion supports the need for research in the aforementioned areas. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn 's Disease) It is estimated that one million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease (''IBD'').\u2014The two forms of IBD are Crohn 's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Crohn 's Disease usually causes intermittent inflammation deep within the intestinal wall ofthe small intestine whereas Ulcerative Colitis causes continuous inflammation andsores in the top layers of the lining of the large intestine. Although older and young-er people may also develop this disease, IBD usually begins between the ages of 15and 40 and persists throughout life with remissions. IBD affects people in the primeand most productive years of their lives and results in substantial morbidity andeconomic loss to them and society. It is especially brutal in children who may sufferdevelopmental delays or stunted growth. People with IBD experience abdominalpain, fever, bowel sores, intestinal bleeding, anorexia, weight loss, fullness, diar-rhea, constipation, and vomiting. In severe cases, IBD can cause death. In additionto potentially disabling gastrointestinal problems, people with this disease may alsosuffer from arthritis, skin problems, inflammation of the eyes or mouth, kidneystones, gallstones, or other diseases of the liver and biliary system. Further, ap-437 proximately five percent of people with ulcerative colitis will develop colon cancer with the risk increasing based on the duration and extent of involvement of thecolon. Studies on the cause of IBD are desperately needed in order to have a better un- derstanding of the disease and work towards more effective management and treat-ment. Specifically, AGA recommends that NIDDK support genomic research aimedat identifying abnormal genes in persons with IBD and finding the causes of IBD. Motility Disorders It is estimated that up to thirty percent of all Americans may be affected at some time during their lives by motility disorders. \u2014Irritable bowel syndrome ( ''IBS''), the most common motility disorder, is especially troubling because a patient does notpresent with any pathognomonic symptoms or laboratory findings of the disease,making diagnosis and treatment extremely difficult. Instead, patients present withabdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. It is believed to be causedby overly sensitive intestines that have muscle spasms. Further research is needed in this area due to the high prevalence and the lack of a basic understanding of IBS, a factor which has made drug manufacturers reluc-tant to fund research. If more federally funded research was focused on IBS, itwould stimulate more private-public partnerships, and lead to advances in medicalknowledge. As such, AGA urges Congress to direct the NIDDK to focus additionalresources on IBS and to encourage the Office of Research on Women 's Health to de- vote more of its attention to these areas of research in light of the high incidenceof IBS among women. Specifically, AGA recommends that NIDDK support researchinto the development of physiologic tests to characterize the phenotypic subgroupsof functional gastrointestinal disorders, including non-ulcer (functional) dyspepsia,functional irritable bowel syndrome (motility). Gastrointestinal Cancers Approximately 226,600 new cases of gastrointestinal cancers will be diagnosed this year. \u2014Sadly, 129,800 Americans will die from these cancers. The most common can- cers involve the colon/rectum, stomach/esophagus, and pancreas. \u2014Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and ranks fourth as the most common cancer. \u2014Although risk fac- tors, such as race (increased prevalence and mortality for African Americans),influence the development of this cancer, 70 percent to 80 percent of colorectalcancer cases involve average-risk individuals. If diagnosed early, this cancer ishighly curable. However, many people with colorectal cancer are asymptomaticuntil the later stages of the disease and wait to seek professional advise untilthis time. As such, research and early detection through screening remains thekey to preventing, treating, and curing this disease. We applaud Congress forits major step forward in preventing and curing this disease by providing Medi-care coverage for screening and declaring March ''National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month ''. We encourage Congress to continue this work and require coverage for screening for all Americans. Further, we urge Congress to supportadditional research on colorectal cancer. Finally, we commend NCI for its workon the Progress Review Group ( ''PRG '') for colorectal cancer. \u2014Pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed in 28,300 Americans in 2000 with 28,200 people projected to die from this disease. \u2014It is a highly lethal form of cancer with the lowest survival rate among all major malignancies. Like other diges-tive cancers, this cancer is frequently asymptomatic. African Americans have a50 percent higher incidence and mortality rate than Caucasians. Further, agemay increase the risk for this disease because the average age at diagnosis is70 and it rarely occurs before 40. Diabetes mellitus has also been linked to thedevelopment of this cancer. We appreciate NCI 's recognition of this growing problem and the need for research in this area through its establishment ofpancreatic cancer PRG. \u2014Of increased concern to AGA are esophageal and stomach cancers. Lower esopha- geal and upper stomach cancers are the second most common gastrointestinalcancers. \u2014It is projected that 33,800 Americans will be diagnosed and 25,100 will die in 2000 from these cancers. These cancers also often remain undetectedbecause they are asymptomatic or present with vague symptoms. In fact, only10 percent to 20 percent of patients with stomach cancer are diagnosed at anearly stage. Both are more common in African Americans with stomach canceralso occurring more frequently in Hispanics and Asian Americans. Of height-ened concern to AGA is Barrett 's esophagus, a precursor to esophageal cancer, and the relationship between Barrett 's and chronic gastroesophageal reflux dis- ease ( ''GERD ''). Five to ten percent of people with Barrett 's esophagus develop438 cancer of the esophagus. We urge Congress to direct the NCI to fund a Progress Review Group ( ''PRG '') on esophageal and stomach cancers to further study these deadly diseases. AGA encourages the NIDDK to support research into themodulation and understanding of epithelial injury and repair to include the un-derstanding of epithelial cell cycle regulation in the gastrointestinal tract andstudies of epithelial stem cells and their use for developing new approaches toorganogenesis and transplantation. Foodborne Illness Foodborne illness is estimated to cost annually $5 to $6 billion dollars in direct medical costs and productivity losses. \u2014Most foodborne illnesses attack the gut caus- ing gastrointestinal problems which may lead to dehydration and shock, and if nottreated, death from vascular collapse and renal failure. Those populations at-risk forsevere repercussions from foodborne illness include those with decreased immunesystems, pregnant women and fetuses, young children, elderly, and those with inad-equate access to health care. We appreciate NIDDK 's efforts to further our under- standing of this illness through its RFA on foodborne illness research which was co-sponsored by AGA through the American Digestive Health Foundation ( ''ADHF '') and the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association. AGA recommends that Congress en- courage the NIH, including NIDDK and NIAID, and others conducting foodborne ill-ness research like the United States Department of Agriculture and the CDC to con-centrate more intensively on research into treatments for foodborne illness. AGAurges NIDDK and NIAID to support research on (1) intestinal diseases caused bycombination of luminal (including bacterial), environmental, and genetic factorswith an emphasis on inflammatory bowel diseases, and (2) the reaction of the gutto foodborne pathogens, including research on the pathogenesis of the disease, thereasons for antibiotic resistance, the reaction of the gut to infections, the develop-ment of animal models to test therapies, and the invention of vaccines or substancesthat bind with the toxins to prevent the illness. Training of Physician-Scientists While research has expanded our medical knowledge and enabled providers to better prevent diseases, diagnose disorders, and treat people, there is growing con-cern that the number of physician-scientists (e.g., investigators who have medicaldegrees) is declining and that this decline will negatively impact many key futureresearch endeavors. A recent study documenting this decline points to the tremen-dous debt incurred by medical school graduates who have more lucrative optionsoutside of research as a primary cause. See Tamara R. Zemlo et al., The Physician-Scientist: Career Issues and Challenges at the Year 2000, 14 The FASEB Journal221-230 (2000). Also influencing this trend is a decline in mentorship due to a de- crease in the number of physician-scientist faculty in basic science departments andthe increased clinical responsibility currently assumed by such faculty members.AGA views this problem as an immediate and serious threat to the future of bio-medical research generally, and gastrointestinal research in particular. As such,AGA urges Congress to take the following steps: \u2014Increase pre- and post-doctoral research training stipends; \u2014Raise the salary cap for individual grant recipients to the maximum amount al- lowable under the Senior Biomedical Research Service; and \u2014Enact the ''Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1999 '' (H.R. 1798, S. 1813). PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL DEPRESSIVE AND MANIC -DEPRESSIVE ASSOCIATION The National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association is pleased to have this opportunity to submit written testimony in support of fiscal year 2001 funding formental health research supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Na-tional Institute of Mental Health. With nearly 300 affiliated groups in nearly every major metropolitan area, Na- tional DMDA is the nation 's largest patient-directed, illness-specific organization committed to advocating for research toward the elimination of mood disorders; edu-cating patients, professionals and the public about the nature of depression andmanic-depression as treatable medical diseases; fostering self-help; eliminating dis-crimination and stigma; and improving access to care. National DMDA was foundedin 1986 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. A distinguished Scientific Advi-sory Board of nearly 65 members reviews all materials published by NationalDMDA for medical and scientific accuracy and provides critical and timely adviceon important research opportunities and treatment breakthroughs. This Board in-cludes the leading researchers and clinicians in the field of mood disorders.439 THE IMPACT OF MOOD DISORDERS More than 20 million American adults suffer from unipolar or major depression every year. An additional 2.3 million people suffer from manic-depression or bipolardisorder. Women are more than twice as likely as men to experience major depres-sion. Two out of three people with mood disorders do not get proper treatment be-cause their symptoms are not recognized, are misdiagnosed or, due to the stigmaassociated with mental illness, their symptoms are blamed on personal weakness.Depression is the leading cause of suicide in the United States. In fact, the suiciderate is 50 percent higher than the homicide rate in the United States. According to a recent study by the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Harvard School of Public Health, unipolar major depression is the leading cause of disability in the world today and bipolar disorder is the seventh-ranked cause of disability. The economic cost of mood disorders in the United Stateswas estimated in 1996 to be almost $44 billion per year in direct and indirect costsincluding absenteesim, mortality and lost productivity. The fact that mood disorderscarry a higher burden of disease in our society than cancer illustrates the need formore adequate funding in this area for research. We can no longer continue to ig-nore the burden of mood disorders for our society and must focus our research re-sources on better understanding these illnesses, significantly improving treatments,and seeking a cure. PROGRESS IN DIAGNOSIS , PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Depression and manic-depression are highly treatable medical illnesses, if diag- nosed and treated correctly. In fact, their treatment success rates are higher thanfor other chronic illnesses. However, one of the biggest obstacles to expanding accessto services is the historical stigma surrounding mental health treatment, exempli-fied by arbitrary and unfair limits placed on access to mental health services by pri-vate health insurance plans. Access to treatment due to financial limitations is, formany patients, a huge barrier. Increased public awareness and understanding of mood disorders would con- tribute significantly to improved diagnoses and treatment rates for these potentiallyfatal illnesses. Tragically, individuals untreated or undertreated for major depres-sion have a suicide rate in excess of 15 percent. The rate for those with untreatedor undertreated bipolar disorder is over 20 percent. National DMDA is encouraged by the heightened attention being paid to mental illness as evidenced by last year 's White House Conference on Mental Illness and the recent Surgeon General 's Report on Mental Health. Getting people to talk open- ly and publicly about mental illness is an important first step toward reducing thestigma. But there is much left to be done. As the Surgeon General 's report notes, there is a link between research yielding explanations of and effective treatments for mental illnesses and reduction of thisstigma. We know that science destigmatizes. As more and more people come to un-derstand that mood disorders are medical illnesses, not character flaws, and thatthey are treatable, we can make significant reductions in both the human and eco-nomic costs of these illnesses. Research supported by NIMH has already led to many discoveries resulting in im- proved diagnostics, prevention, and treatments, which has saved lives and billionsof tax dollars. For example, more than $145 billion has been saved since 1970 asa result of the development of lithium treatment for bipolar illness \u2014almost $6 bil- lion per year. A study supported by NIMH showed that intervention to prevent de-pression in the workplace resulted in $1,314 per person in increased federal andstate taxes generated over a two and a half year period, with a cost of only $286per person. Finally, it has been shown that every $1 spent on treatment of mooddisorders yields between $3 and $9 in net economic return on employment earnings. NIMH-supported research has led to new and more effective medications for both depression and manic-depression. We also have a better understanding of mood dis-orders and are learning more about their impact on cardiovascular disease, strokeand diabetes. The co-morbidity of depression and alcohol and tobacco use is also be-coming clearer. Research indicates that treating addiction but not depression leadsto failure and relapse and vice versa. GENETICS Current research indicates that there is a genetic predisposition to manic-depres- sive illness and major depression, involving multiple genes. Understanding the ge-netic basis of mood disorders will lead to vastly superior methods of prediction, diag-nosis, treatment and prevention. We support a continued investment in NIH to440 achieve the completion of the human genome sequencing project and applaud the accelerated timetable for completion. Mapping of the human genome will be criticalto uncovering the genetic factors involved in mental illness and clarifying thephenotypes of major mental disorders. We are pleased that NIMH has compiled adatabase of families with mental illness for genetic analysis as the science and tech-nology becomes available in the near future. A high priority should also be the epi-demiology and clinical evaluation of individuals with manic-depression and theirfamily members. Of utmost importance as these projects move forward is respect ofthe privacy of those individuals involved, especially given the continued struggle tofight the stigma of mental illness. Confidentiality is of critical importance in themanagement of all medical records. CLINICAL RESEARCH National DMDA believes that the translation of research from the laboratory to the bench in a rapid and efficient manner is of paramount importance and ispleased to see the Surgeon General 's report and NIH leadership acknowledge the need for increased clinical research. The expansion of NIMH 's Translational Centers program, dedicated to rapidly moving basic science from the lab into the clinical set-ting, is another strong step toward getting new and improved treatments to patientsmore quickly. Requiring third-party payors to support important patient care costsassociated with promising experimental therapeutics would further facilitate com-pletion of clinical evaluation at the earliest possible moment. National DMDA plays an important role in several large NIMH-sponsored clinical trials. Our representatives are members of oversight committees for trials studyingthe effectiveness of treatments for bipolar disorder (STEP -BP), the study of treat- ments for adolescents with depression (TADS), and the study treatment of individ-uals with depression who do not benefit from standard initial treatments (STAR*D).We are also on the advisory board of the trial studying the efficacy of Hypericumperforatum (St. John 's wort), a compound millions of Americans take with very little scientific data available to show efficacy or safety. National DMDA participates inthe oversight of these trials because of its belief that the priority of all clinical trialsmust always be the safety of the patient. We fully support NIMH plans to further expand clinical trials of treatments for mental illnesses, including exploration of depression in young children. We urge asignificant increase in research of mood disorders in child and adolescents with spe-cial emphasis on the efficacy and safety of current treatments, the epidimology ofthese illnesses and improved diagnostic tools. MOOD DISORDERS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS The issue of mood disorders in children and adolescents is of particular concern to National DMDA. Up to 2.5 percent of children and up to 8.3 percent of adoles-cents suffer from clinical depression, which if left untreated is the predominantcause of suicide, the third leading cause of death in males ages 15 to 24. While mood disorders in children and adolescents is a critical area of concern, vir- tually no research about this population exists. As the Surgeon General 's report points out, to be effective, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness must take intoconsideration a variety of characteristics including age. Further, identifying depres-sion in children as well as understanding its causes and how best to intervene dur-ing childhood offers the best hope for preventing many cases of adult mental illness. National DMDA supports the aggressive research agenda NIMH is pursuing in this area, including a study to examine the course and outcome of bipolar disorderwith onset in childhood and early adolescence, and research examining underlyingbioregulatory processes, neurobehavioral system, adolescent pubertal development and their links to major depressive disorder. We are particularly encouraged byNIMH efforts to strengthen the field of children 's mental health research by cre- ating new incentives for experienced investigators to move into studies of mentalillness in children. We are pleased that NIMH will play a lead role in the Surgeon General 's upcom- ing report on youth violence and support the continued coordination between NIMHand Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other agencies to research the relation-ship between mental illnesses \u2014including mood disorders \u2014and suicide and other forms of violence. BIPOLAR DISORDER (MANIC DEPRESSION) The World Health Organization has identified bipolar disorder as the seventh- ranked cause of disability in the world today. Nearly one in 100 Americans suffersfrom manic depression yet research in this area has been seriously underfunded. In441 fact, In 1998, NIMH spent only $39 million on bipolar research and it is expected to spend just $46 million in fiscal year 1999. Congress must continue to increaseits investment in this important area of mental health research. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES National DMDA urges NIMH to pursue genetic research aggressively in collabora- tion with other NIH Institutes, academia, the private sector and by continuing stud-ies of individuals with manic depression and their family members. Other factorsto examine in relation to genetics include building and refining knowledge of riskfactors for mood disorders, developing better predictors of risk, designing and pilot-ing new screening measures, advancing early-intervention strategies for these riskfactors, and studying the role stress and the environment play. Neuroscience advances bring us to the brink of tremendous opportunities to un- derstand underlying deficits in major mental disorders. We know more aboutneurobiology today than ever before and we must support, as a national priority,continued efforts to enable us to more fully exploit our recent advances. Flexibilityof connections in the nervous system underlies many of the adaptive responses ofthe individual to the environment \u2014including response to psychological and physical trauma and the more general processes underlying learning and memory \u2014and such changes in the neural function are central to most mental disorders. The field isnow poised to make deep inroads into the understanding of these critical processes. Other important opportunities include research to better characterize subtypes of depression; to find treatments with fewer side effects and understand thepsychopharmacology of current antidepressants; and studies to close the gap be-tween what is known about treating mood disorders and what is practiced, particu-larly in managed care settings. These are just a few of the research areas wheregreat opportunities exist. FUNDING REQUEST An aggressive research agenda requires sustained funding. While we recognize the Subcommittee 's budgetary constraints, National DMDA supports the effort initi- ated in fiscal year 1999 to double the budget for NIH and NIMH by fiscal year 2003.This will allow us to take full advantage of the many exciting mental health re-search opportunities that exist today. To continue the successes toward achievingthis important goal, we strongly support the fiscal year 2001 funding recommenda-tion of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding of $20.5 billion for NIH.National DMDA supports a corresponding increase for NIMH. Sustained, stable growth in funding for NIH is needed to build upon past sci- entific achievements, address present medical needs, and anticipate future healthchallenges. Dramatic fluctuations can be as harmful to the research enterprise asinadequate growth. We appreciate your past support and look forward to working with you in the fu- ture to ensure a sustained commitment to mental health research. Together we can provide the gateway to new discoveries that will improve access to care and elimi-nate discrimination and the stigma associated with depression and manic-depres-sion. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF NURSING The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) appreciates the oppor- tunity to present this statement on funding recommendations for nursing researchand education programs within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee. AACN rep-resents over 540 baccalaureate and graduate nursing education programs in seniorcolleges and universities across the United States. We thank the Subcommittee members for providing fiscal year 2000 funding to the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) at its full Professional JudgmentBudget level. AACN also appreciates the leadership of Chairman Specter and theSubcommittee over the years in funding nursing and health professions educationprograms to benefit the health and well being of the Nation. Our appreciation ex-tends to the Subcommittee 's leadership regarding the Health Resources and Serv- ices Administration 's (HRSA) Health Profession Programs, particularly the Nurse Education Act (NEA) (Public Health Service Act Title VIII) and Scholarships forDisadvantaged Students (SDS) programs (in PHSA Title VII).442 NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH Mr. Chairman, we thank you and the Subcommittee for NINR 's significant fund- ing increase for fiscal year 2000 at an adjusted level of $89.522 million, an increaseof $19.734 million or 28 percent more than the fiscal year 1999 level. The entirenursing community is grateful for this funding level, which brought the estimatedsuccess rate for NINR research project grants for fiscal year 2000 to 24 percent,compared to the projected average of 31 percent for NIH overall. This is an enor-mous improvement over fiscal year 1999 when NINR 's success rate was only 14 per- cent. Unfortunately the excellent progress made by the Subcommittee last year is threatened by the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 request of $92.524 million, an increase of only $3 million or 3.3 percent for NINR. This is the lowest proposed in-crease of all NIH Institutes and Centers. The fiscal year 2001 request would con-tinue NINR 's disproportionately slow growth rate compared to NIH in general. Since 1986, NINR has received only $75.5 million, or 0.6 percent of the total NIHgrowth of $12.3 billion. In fact, the entire fiscal year 2000 total for NINR is lessthan the increase provided by the Subcommittee in fiscal year 2000 for 10 NIH In-stitutes and Centers. Finally, the Administration 's proposed NINR funding level would plunge NINR 's projected research project grant success rate for fiscal year 2001 to 14 percent compared to the 26 percent success rate projected for NIH over-all. Clearly this would result in missing a significant amount of important scientificopportunities. AACN, supported by the Tri Council for Nursing and the 33 members of the Coa- lition for Nursing Research Funding, urges funding the NINR at $110 million,$17.476 million above the Administration 's request. At this funding level, NINR could conduct significant new research recommended by its Professional JudgmentBudget such as: research on health disparities in ethnic groups, self managementof chronic illness, expanding end of life research to address pain, nausea, weight lossand caregiver issues, and studying telehealth interventions in rural/underservedpopulations. NINR is the lead institute at NIH to coordinate research on end-of-life care that is critically important to our aging population. End-of-life care utilizes many of theskills of nursing such as management of pain, handling of chronic conditions, andfamily counseling. As the American population continues to age, the importance ofthis research both to reduce morbidity and health system costs continues to grow.While 13 percent of the current U.S. population is 65 years of age or older, by theyear 2030 this proportion is projected to be 20 percent. The Subcommittee investment in NINR is well justified as nursing research con- tributes extensively to wellness and health outcomes. The NINR performs a widespan of clinical research, developing and testing interventions to improve patientcare, treat disease, manage chronic conditions and address other concerns. There is growing evidence of advances made possible through NINR research, but we willhighlight just five recent success stories. AACN believes that based on these andnumerous other examples, there is broad agreement that nursing research is mak-ing a difference in health outcomes. For example, NINR research has made a dif-ference by identifying interventions to: \u2014Facilitate early hospital discharges of high risk elderly patients, reducing the length of stays, the hospital re-admission rate and Medicare costs; \u2014Reduce the rate of low birth weight babies among high risk women, as well a reducing the rate of subsequent emergency room admissions of the mothers andtheir babies; \u2014Estimate the (often fatal) improper insertion of feeding tubes with the use of a low cost bedside chemical test; \u2014Reduce high blood pressure in young urban African-American men at high risk for cardiovascular disease and reduce cholesterol levels in minority children;and \u2014Avoid the need for nursing home care of elderly women by controlling urinary incontinence. THE NURSE EDUCATION ACT The Nurse Education Act (Public Health Service Act Title VIII) helps schools of nursing and nursing students prepare for a changing health care delivery system.Reauthorized in 1998, the NEA offers flexibility through expanding specific programinitiatives, including Advanced Education Nurse Grants, Work Force DiversityGrants, Basic Nurse Education and Practice Grants, and an education loan repay-ment program to attract nurses to practice in shortage areas.443 Advanced Education Nurse Grants to schools help educate advanced practice pri- mary care nurse practitioners and nurse midwives. The program also providesgrants to educate master 's and doctoral students as clinical nurse specialists, public health nurses, nurse administrators, faculty (a major shortage exists), nurse anes-thetists, and non-primary care nurse practitioners and includes traineeships formaster 's and doctoral students with a limit of 10 percent of appropriations for doc- toral traineeships. The growing number of elderly, increasing number of individualswith chronic diseases, high infant mortality rates, and rising number of uninsuredand underserved individuals all drive the demand for affordable, cost-effectivehealth care. This need is successfully met by nurses with advanced nursing edu-cation. The Work Diversity Grants program provides funds to increase opportunities for nursing education for disadvantaged students including underrepresented minoritiesby providing scholarships, stipends, pre-entry preparation, and retention activities.In addition to contributing to the preparation of a racially and ethnically diversenursing workforce, this program contributes to the basic preparation of disadvan-taged and minority nurses for leadership positions within nursing and the healthcare community. The minority enrollment in schools of nursing supported by thisprogram is 46 percent compared to the national average of 19 percent. The Basic Nurse Education and Practice Grants can support nursing centers as training and care delivery sites, increase undergraduate enrollments (a nursingshortage looms), provide entry level training for practice within underserved popu-lations, managed care facilities, to develop cultural competence and for other pur-poses. AACN recommends $78 million for Title VIII Nurse Education Act programsin fiscal year 2001, $10.2 million or 15 percent more than requested by the Adminis-tration. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS (SDS) Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) is a PHSA Title VII program that provides funds to disadvantaged and minority health professions students. Federallaw directs 16 percent of the funds appropriated to nursing students in the program-making this the major federal scholarship source for undergraduate nursing stu-dents. The goals of the SDS Program are to increase diversity in the health professions and nursing workforce and improve access to health care. The program providesscholarships to financially needy students from disadvantaged backgrounds who areenrolled in schools of nursing, and in programs of allopathic medicine, osteopathicmedicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, chiro-practic, behavioral and mental health, public health, allied health, and physician as-sistants. The SDS program allows eligible students the opportunity to pursue healthprofessions or nursing education by eliminating or reducing financial barriers thatmight otherwise prevent these students from enrolling. AACN recommends funding the SDS program at $43.7 million for fiscal year 2001, a $5.61 million or 14.7 percent above the fiscal year 2000 level. AACN is amember of and supports the Health Professions and Nursing Education Coalition 's recommendation of $335 million for Public Health Service Act Titles VII and VIII,which support health professions and nursing education programs. AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) The mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is to sup- port, conduct, and disseminate research that improves the outcomes, quality, accessto, and cost and use of health care services. This mission, which focuses on the effec-tiveness and value of health care in daily practice, is unique and complements the biomedical and behavioral research responsibilities of the NIH. The products of theAgency include knowledge that supports decision making to improve health care,and tools that help improve quality and reduce costs. In view of the AHRQ 's signifi- cant contributions to health outcomes, the AACN recommends appropriate increasesfor the AHRQ budget in fiscal year 2001. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AACN applauds the leadership of Chairman Specter and the Subcommittee in the continuing campaign to double the NIH budget in 5 years. The investment in bio-medical and behavioral research has propelled a remarkable transformation in ourunderstanding of the life sciences and has given us a bounty of new ways to pre-vent, treat, and cure disease. Major threats to public health have been reduced,quality of life has improved, and life expectancy has continued to rise. A child bornin the United States today can be expected to live 76.5 years, 3.9 years longer than444 a child born in 1975. AACN joins the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding in recommending a fiscal year 2001 funding level of $20.47 billion for the NIH, a15 percent increase over the fiscal year 2000 level. INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE Mr. Chairman, the Indian Health Services (IHS) provides vital health services to our Native American populations and nursing professionals have been a centralcomponent of the IHS health delivery system since the agency 's inception. The IHS provides direct health care services in 37 hospitals, 61 health centers, 4 schoolhealth centers, and 48 health stations. Tribes and tribal groups, through contractswith the IHS, operate 12 hospitals, 134 health centers, 4 school health centers, and241 health stations (including 168 Alaska village clinics.) The IHS, tribes and tribalgroups also operate 7 regional youth substance abuse treatment centers. AACN rec-ommends increases for the Indian Health Service for fiscal year 2001. HIGHER EDUCATION ACT PROGRAMS \u2014STUDENT FINANCIAL AND GENERAL ASSISTANCE There are several student financial and general assistance programs that are par- ticularly important to the nursing community. The Pell Grant Program helps ensureaccess to post secondary education for low and middle income undergraduate stu-dents by providing grants that, in combination with other sources of student aid,help meet post secondary education costs. The Federal Work Study Program ensuresaccess by assisting needy undergraduates and graduate students in financing postsecondary education costs through part time employment. The TRIO Programs fundpost secondary education outreach and student support services designed to encour-age individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter and complete college.AACN recommends increases for each of these programs over the levels provided infiscal year 2000. SUMMARY OF AACN HIGHEST PRIORITY FISCAL YEAR 2001 FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS [In millions of dollars] Highest AACN priority recommendationFiscal year Fiscal year 2001 AACN recommendation 2000 2001 National Institute of Nursing Research .................................. 89.5 92.524 110 Nurse Education PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEHUMANE SOCIETY We appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee on two funding items of great impor-tance to The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and its 7.3 million sup-porters nationwide. As the largest animal protection organization in the country,The HSUS urges the Committee to address these priority issues in the fiscal year2001 budget. CLASS B RANDOM SOURCE ANIMAL DEALERS The HSUS is grateful for the leadership of Chairman Specter, Ranking Democrat Harkin, and this Committee in raising concerns last year about the problem of ClassB dealers, who acquire the animals they sell to biomedical research facilities froma variety of sources, including ''free to good home '' ads, animal shelters, and outright theft of family pets. Squalid conditions, abusive handling, sickly and under-cared foranimals, and sloppy record-keeping are the hallmarks of Class B dealers. As RobertA. Whitney, D.V.M. and former Director of both the National Center for ResearchResources and the Office of Animal Care and Use at NIH, testified in July 1997,''The continued existence of these virtually unregulatable Class B dealers erodes the public confidence in our commitment to appropriate procurement, care, and use ofanimals in the important research to better the health of both humans and ani-mals. '' Committee Report language accompanying the fiscal year 2000 appropriations en- couraged NIH to consider extending its intramural research practice of using onlypurpose-bred animals (not those obtained from Class B dealers) to the extramural445 research funded by NIH as well. Unfortunately, NIH has taken no clear steps since last year 's legislation to ensure that taxpayer dollars will not be used in the future to support research on animals obtained through Class B dealers. Consequently, weurge the Committee this year to direct NIH, in bill language, not to award grantsfor research projects that utilize random source dogs or cats supplied by Class Bdealers. We commend NIH for its internal research practice, but feel strongly thatNIH should exercise the same caution and concern with respect to its grant recipi-ents. The public deserves to know that animals used in government-funded researchhave not been stolen from their families or obtained through other disreputablemeans commonly employed by Class B dealers. CHIMPANZEE SANCTUARIES We also consider it a high priority for the 106th Congress to enact H.R. 3514, leg- islation to establish a federal chimpanzee sanctuary system for the permanent re-tirement of chimpanzees no longer needed in medical research. This cost-effectiveand humane approach to dealing with the problem of ''surplus chimpanzees, '' who were overbred and languish in laboratories across the country, deserves to be en-acted by this Congress. It will save taxpayers considerable money in the long run,and significantly improve the quality of life for these animals who have served hu-manity but are now simply being warehoused in costly research facilities. Along with the united support of the animal protection community, H.R. 3514 has been endorsed by more than 100 members of the scientific and academic communitywho have particular expertise involving chimpanzees, as follows: Jonathan S.

We would stronglysupport that as a way to ensure enactment of this vital legislation in the 106th Con-gress. We also strongly support efforts in this appropriations bill to address the cri-sis facing hundreds of chimpanzees at The Coulston Foundation in Alamogordo,New Mexico, where recurrent mismanagement and inappropriate veterinary carehave caused several painful and needless chimpanzee deaths. Again, we appreciate the opportunity to share our views and priorities for the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriation Act of fiscal year2001. We hope the Committee will be able to accommodate these requests to allevi-ate some very pressing problems affecting animals across the United States. Thankyou for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of this Subcommittee, thank you for allow- ing us to present testimony on fiscal year 2001 Appropriations for the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) is a science-based, non-profit voluntary health organization dedicated to promoting awareness about the importance of goodsleep, sleep disorders, and the consequences of sleep deprivation. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders the vast majority of which remain undiagnosed and un-treated and another 20 to 30 million suffer intermittent sleep-related problems. AnNSF survey found that fifty-eight million Americans report suffering excessive day-time sleepiness at levels that interfere with their day-to-day activities. Evidencetells us that Americans sleep debt is on the rise, yet numerous studies have con-cluded that the general public and primary care physicians lack the basic sleepknowledge to address these problems. As a result, the toll on human health, safetyand productivity is enormous. NSF and sleep experts like myself take this chronicsleep deprivation very seriously. Lack of adequate amounts of sleep has been associ-ated with significant physical and mental problems. For example, cardiovascular449 disease, gastrointestinal disorders, mood disorders and drug abuse are more preva- lent among shift workers. This problem is more than simply getting a good nightsrest. It encompasses medical problems, lack of education, and the tools required toaddress this public health crisis. Sleepiness, whether the result of untreated sleep disorders or volitional sleep dep- rivation has been identified as a causal factor in a growing number of on-the-jobinjuries. This corresponds directly in lost productivity, personal injuries, medical ex-penses, property and environmental damage due to fatigue, sleep disorders andsleep deprivation and is estimated to exceed $100 billion each year. It is, however,the personal injuries that are the most tragic part of this equation. In my dailypractice, I routinely hear stories of drivers who fall asleep at the wheel and killthemselves, a family member, or an innocent bystander. In the first-ever case-controlled epidemiological study of drowsy driving crashes recently completed by one of our partners, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,work and sleep schedules were strongly associated with involvement in a sleep-re-lated crash. Compared to drivers in non-sleep crashes, drivers in sleep crashes werenearly twice as likely to work at more than one job and their primary job was morelikely to involve an atypical schedule. This characterizes many Americans and yet,represents a crisis in our country that remains to be largely unaddressed except byorganizations like the National Sleep Foundation and AAA. The National Sleep Foundation has taken some small steps to work on lowering the number of injuries associated with sleepiness. NSF, in cooperation with manypartners, has successfully mounted state programs in New York, Arkansas, Cali-fornia, Washington, Oregon and Idaho that target fatigue-related injuries. In NewYork, NSF worked with state and federal agencies and other partners to launch thenations first statewide public information and injury prevention program related tothe dangers of sleep deprivation. Unfortunately, NSF alone does not have the re-sources to continue to mount these state-by-state campaigns. Information gatheredby our sleep polls and work in the states also suggests that the percentage of popu-lation adversely affected by sleepiness is higher than current statistical informationprovides. Let us provide one example that illustrates the problem. The AAA study points out that countermeasures or strategies that drivers typically employ, rolling downthe car windows, turning up the radio, or stopping to stretch are largely unsup-ported by the scientific literature. Yet these strategies were often cited by our driv-ers and are believed by them to be anywhere from somewhat, to very effective incountering drowsy driving. Let us be clear almost all experts agree that the onlytruly effective strategy drowsy drivers can take to prevent a crash is to immediatelystop driving and get some sleep. If this is not possible, drivers should be encouragedto stop, drink some caffeine (the equivalent of two cups of coffee), and take a briefnap before getting back behind the wheel. Traffic safety data is incomplete due to the difficulty in measuring the role sleepi- ness played in an accident investigation. This is in part due to the fact that sleepi-ness is often overlooked when investigating work or traffic related injuries. Thisproblem exists in every area that sleepiness is a problem. Yet we believe, throughwork at the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), we can begin to adequately address this cri-sis, particularly in the area of physician education. In our discussions with CDC it is clear that sleepiness crosscuts many centers. This is not only an issue for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Controlbut also the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the NationalCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the very least. Thecommon question of all these Centers revolves around data collection. It is this firststep we would propose that the Subcommittee consider providing funding for. The NSF has the network of experts in the sleep field. The CDC has links to other health divisions who address at risk patient populations including shift workers andadolescents. We seek support for the development of evaluative research, includingdata collection, through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control atCDC. This would likely include an attempt to validate or improve existing surveysand survey methodologies. It would also evaluate new ways to capture data andvalidate program effectiveness. The data from this research will allow us to developaccurate and informative material and model programs to provide to states as theyaddress these important issues. NSF experts are willing to work with CDC to reach out to corporations and other partners to develop accurate data collection methods to identify the scope of theproblem. One area where more data would be helpful is with the accurate medicaldiagnosis of sleep disorders. A recent study in Walla Walla, Washington concludedthat sleep apnea is significantly under recognized by primary care physicians. The450 study was done through the utilization of primary care physicians who were trained to recognize the warning symptoms of certain sleep disorders. With this training,physicians were able to diagnose and ultimately recommend treatment to hundredsof people for sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. These disorders are not uniqueto Walla Walla, but are believed to affect millions of Americans. Patients are receiv-ing no diagnosis or treatment due to a general lack of training within the physiciancommunity. In this instance, a significant public health problem is identified anda solution established. Accurate data from the health care community along withadditional training would show the extent of the problem and allow us to targetphysicians who are on the front lines of our health care system. Current CDC resources within the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control are allocated for other projects that are of equal importance to the country.It is with this recognition that we ask the subcommittee to increase the overallbudget for this center by $1.2 million to allow the Center to act as the coordinatingbody for the gathering and evaluation of the types of data discussed above. This data will allow the NSF, CDC, and other federal agencies to develop and dis- tribute accurate medically sound information. This information coupled with train-ing for those involved with public health and safety at the state level will begin toturn the tide of injuries and costs associated with sleepiness and sleep disorders. Thank you for consideration of this request. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES Mr. Chairman, my name is Anne Ford and I am the volunteer Chairman of the Board of Directors for the National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD). NCLDis a not-for-profit organization founded in 1977, which seeks to ensure that all indi-viduals with learning disabilities (LD) gain access to research-based knowledge andopportunities to fully achieve their potential. NCLD protects the rights of individ-uals with LD and promotes the widespread implementation of effective research-based instructional methods. As Chairman of NCLD for the past ten years, and asa parent of a child with learning disabilities, I am keenly aware of the need forgreater access to services and increased awareness among parents, early child careproviders, teachers and other professionals about how early recognition and inter-vention can lead to greater success for children in school and beyond. I am pleased to submit this testimony to encourage the committee 's endorsement of a Literacy Early Screening Initiative supported by the National Institute of ChildHealth and Human Development (NICHD), in partnership with NCLD. The focusof the initiative is to assure that parents, early child care providers, teachers andother professionals have a research-based, easy-to-use tool to screen preschool-agechildren for behaviors that place them at risk for reading failure, and the informa-tion, training and support to implement screening on a nationwide basis. BACKGROUND The impetus for this early reading screening initiative comes from the conver- gence of data from a number of sources. Studies of early learning (Ramey, et al,1985), patterns of early care in families (Hofferth, 1996), the efficacy of early in-struction and intervention (Snow, et al, 1998), the benefits of quality child care(Phillips, et al, 1987), early brain development (Huttenlocher, 1995), and the bene-fits of early identification of risk factors in young children (Fletcher et al, 1994) allsupport the initiative 's premise that learning difficulties identified early in a child 's life can circumvent the longer-term consequences of school failure. Due in great part to longitudinal studies conducted by NICHD, there is already a considerable body of evidence regarding the specific aspects of young children 's physical, cognitive, and social behaviors that are most predictive of later learningdifficulty, particularly in the area of early reading and related literacy skills (Na-tional Reading Panel, 2000). Studies have shown that learning to read is a processthat begins very early in development, well before children enter formal schooling.There is a strong and critical relationship between the amount and quality of earlylanguage, literacy interactions and experiences, and the acquisition of linguisticskills necessary for reading (Lyon, 1999). NEED FOR RESEARCH -BASED SCREENING A number of complementary efforts are underway to ensure that the United States becomes a nation of readers. The America Reads Challenge, the Reading Ex-cellence Program and the creation of the National Institute for Literacy are a fewexamples of major efforts through which commitments have been made by the fed-451 eral government. These programs are working to enable all citizens, both young and old, with and without special educational needs, to develop strong reading and otherliteracy skills. These and other successful programs show how government and pri-vate organizations are working to assure universal school readiness to all our na-tion's youth. There is a shared vision among parents, early care providers, educators, and pol- icy officials to develop strong reading and other literacy skills in our nation 's chil- dren. However, there has been no coordinated effort to date that addresses the needof parents and early care providers to identify children who show signs of early lit-eracy difficulties and, in particular, to provide research-based information and sup-port. This initiative will provide parents and early care providers with an under-standing of these findings, an ability to screen children for behaviors that placethem at risk for reading failure, and the information needed to take effective stepstoward assuring all children early success in learning to read. THE INITIATIVE Through the Literacy Early Screening Initiative, NCLD, under the direction of NICHD, will direct the development of a research-based screening tool. This toolwill reflect the most current knowledge on reliable early predictors of reading suc-cess and early identification of literacy problems in the preschool and early elemen-tary grades. The initiative will create and support a development team of nationalexperts to design the screening tool. An advisory committee will also inform the on- going collaborative relationships upon which the implementation of the initiativewill be based. As a leading not-for-profit organization committed to the well being of all children, including those with learning disabilities, NCLD is ideally suited to work withNICHD and launch a collaborative initiative of this nature. In May 1999, NCLDhosted a national summit on research in learning disabilities in partnership withthe U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP)and the National Institutes of Health, NICHD. With our partners, NCLD releasedsyntheses of 20 years of study and convened over 400 national leaders to proposeways to shorten the distance between research and classroom practice. In the first phase of the project, NCLD will take the following steps to launch the initiative in Kentucky and Mississippi: \u2014Establish a nationally recognized Development Team to assess the research evi- dence and select key predictors for the core of the tool. \u2014Establish an Advisory Committee of nationally recognized experts to provide on- going expertise and guidance. \u2014Engage a Project Director to manage the work. \u2014Identify successful strategies to reach target audiences. \u2014Design and pilot test the screening tool. \u2014Confirm partnerships in key states for roll out. \u2014Develop content and infrastructure on NCLD 's Web site and other information sources. \u2014Conduct outcome evaluation activities. \u2014Develop a plan for national roll out. IMPLEMENTATION Once the screening tool is developed, training, dissemination, and marketing ac- tivities will be carried out in Kentucky and Mississippi in partnership with earlychildhood education, child care, and family support organizations as well as withprofessional organizations whose activities focus on the well-being of young childrenand their families. Local and national partners may include: \u2014American Library Association \u2014National Association for the Education of Young Children \u2014National Association for Family Childcare \u2014National Center for Family Literacy \u2014National Head Start Association \u2014National Institute for Literacy \u2014National Parent Teachers Association \u2014Reach Out and Read \u2014WGBH/Between the Lions \u2014Yale University Bush Center/21st Century Schools \u2014University of Louisville \u2014University of Southern Mississippi/Center for Literacy and Assessment Working in partnership, we will use select media conduits and other methods known to be effective in reaching specific groups of individuals such as parents of452 preschool-age children, early childhood educators, health care professionals, and other information and service providers. Based on its own research and marketing strategies, the project will ensure exten- sive use of the tool by promoting its 'user friendliness ' and utility for non-expert users through its own and other organizations ' Web sites. Opportunities for volun- teer marketing through food, toy and clothing manufacturers will also be explored,as will ways to incorporate information about the screening tool in corporate em-ployee assistance programs and human resource services. Of special interest will beopportunities to promote the use of this early screening tool through relationshipswith major PBS outlets. Mr. Chairman, by supporting this project, you have the chance to bring our collec- tive investment in research to the next level. It 's an exciting challenge and oppor- tunity. Together, we can help parents and others vested in our children 's success have direct access to an easy-to-use tool that can determine whether to seek earlyintervention and professional assessment to prevent reading failure. By spending alimited amount of time and money early in a child 's life, we can help prevent spend- ing hundreds of thousands later. Perhaps we can stop the heartache and frustrationthat comes from wondering what could have been done if we had only known. Let 's take action with the reliable science available to us and give young children anearly chance at success in school and in their lives. Thank you for your consider-ation and support. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL FOR CHEMICAL RESEARCH Issue .\u2014The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), is one of the largest funders of syntheticchemistry \u2014the heart of advances in medicinal chemistry. While the Administra- tion's requested fiscal year 2001 budget for NIH contains a 5.6 percent increase, it fails to meet the 7 percent needed to reach the congressional goal of doubling federalspending on research in ten years. POSITION The Council for Chemical Research (CCR) endorses the congressional goal of dou- bling the total federal spending on research within a decade. To achieve this endrequires an average increase for NIGMS of 7 percent each year for ten years. Forthis reason, the CCR applauds the commitment Congress made to NIH with the ap-proval of a 14.2 percent increase for fiscal year 2000. The Council believes that inthe present, strong economy it would not be prudent for the NIH -NIGMS budget to increase at a rate less than the 7 percent average needed to reach our mutualgoal. Therefore, the CCR strongly supports increasing the federal investment inNIH beyond the Administration request to further strengthen the national invest-ment in basic research, since discoveries in biomedical research are very highly de-pendent progress in chemistry and chemistry related sciences. Moreover, increasingour investment in research will lay the basis for the future continuation of ourstrong economy. RATIONALE NIGMS provides the enabling research and training for the biomedical community that underpins the advances and discoveries of other NIH institutes. This Instituteis responsible for generating basic knowledge and new technologies which is thespring from which discovery in the biomedical field pours. NIGMS supports threecrucial aspects of chemical research: \u2014Basic research in chemistry provides the foundation of many biomedical ad- vances. It has led to combinatorial chemistry methods and rational drug design,which allow for the more efficient development of pharmaceuticals having great-er potency, higher selectively, and fewer side effects. \u2014The single most important element of any research program is the presence of well-trained, talented, and dedicated investigators. Training programs atNIGMS develop the multi-disciplinary skills demanded by modern biomedical and pharmaceutical research. Well-trained researchers not only increase pro-ductivity for the rapidly expanding biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and diag-nostic industries, but also help maintain the world leadership of these indus-tries in extremely competitive markets. Moreover, to maintain this strong poolof researchers the first priority in allocating NIH budget increases should be tosupport more investigator-initiated research grants and to fund this increased453 number of proposals at the appropriate levels needed for their successful execu- tion. \u2014Basic research requires access to modern instrumentation ranging from com- puters to high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers, laser sys-tems, x-ray light sources, and mass spectrometers. Emphasis on high perform-ance computing applications in basic biomedical studies is a particularly timelyuse of resources. These instruments enable researchers to directly observe thefundamental chemical and biomedical processes involved in life and to gainmuch-needed insight into the workings of the chemistry of living organisms.Through continued modification and refinement, research instruments often de-velop into clinically important tools. Thus, instrumentation supported by theNational Center for Research Resources (NCRR) plays a crucial role in pro-viding the underpinning for biomedical research. Research in chemistry supported by NIGMS and NCRR provides the strong foun- dation necessary to ensure progress in the quest for improvements in health andthe quality of life. The CCR supports strengthening NIH since it provides trainingfor new scientists, stimulates the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries \u2014 both of which contribute positively to the balance of trade \u2014leads to reduced healthcare costs, healthier lives, and, ultimately, makes the United States a worldleader in biomedical research. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER INTRODUCTION Mr. Chairman, I am Dr. Gordon Weir, Chief of Section on Islet Transplantation and Cell Biology and former Medical Director of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Bos-ton, Massachusetts. I am here today to request for full funding of the first year rec- ommendations of the report issued by the Congressionally mandated Diabetes Re-search Working Group. BACKGROUND Diabetes Research Working Group .\u2014The Diabetes Research Working Group was established by this Subcommittee and its Senate counterpart through the fiscal year1999 Conference Agreement, House Report 105 -635. The charge to the Diabetes Research Working Group called for the development of a comprehensive plan for all NIH-funded diabetes research efforts, including therecommendations of future diabetes research initiatives and directives. The Con-ference Agreement language specifically instructed the DRWG to include overallcost estimates to accomplish its recommendations in the final research plan. Thefinal report was provided to the Appropriations Committees in mid 1999. Fiscal year2001 will be the first year the Congress can act on the funding recommendationscontained within the DRWG Report. The Chairman of the Diabetes Research Working Group, C. Ronald Kahn, M.D., a distinguished researcher, is the former Executive Vice President and Research Di-rector and now President of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Fiscal year 1999 base funding for the categories addressed in the DRWG report totaled $442.8 million. The DRWG recommended increment for the first of five yearsover the fiscal year 1999 base was $384.5 million, for a total recommended fundinglevel of $827.3 million. H. Res. 325 .\u2014On November 16, 1999, in the closing days of the First Session of the 106th Congress, H. Res. 325 was considered and approved by the House 414 - 0. Every Member of this Subcommittee, and every Member of the Full Appropria-tions Committee, voted YEA on the passage of H. Res. 325. A similar resolutionpassed the Senate 93 -0. In voting for H. Res. 325, you individually and collectively approved the principles underlying the recommendations for funding that were contained in the report sub-mitted by the Diabetes Research Working Group. The first component of H. Res. 325 expresses ''the sense of the House of Rep- resentatives that: \u2014the Federal Government has a responsibility \u2014to continue to increase research funding, as recommended by the Diabetes Re- search Working Group, so that the causes of, and improved treatment and curefor, diabetes may be discovered . . . '' Fiscal year 2000 funding resulted in an increase for diabetes research of approxi- mately 15 percent above the fiscal year 1999 funding level.454 FISCAL YEAR 2001 FUNDING The fiscal year 2001 Budget for NIH, and specifically NIDDK, requests increased funds for NIH research, though not at the level recommended by the Diabetes Re-search Working Group. We realize that funding constraints represent a significantobstacle to reaching the diabetes research levels the DRWG recommends for fiscalyear 2001. If the Committee is unable to increase the diabetes research rec-ommendations with the DRWG of an increase of approximately $350 million, thereare immediate priorities that we would urge you include within funding for fiscalyear 2001 appropriations. Dr. Kahn, Chairman of the DRWG, has indicated that, absent full funding at $827.3 million for diabetes research in fiscal year 2001, the following categories rep-resent the highest priority among the DRWG recommendations. While we still re-quest the full increase recommended by the DRWG, the following four categoriesrepresent the most urgently requested activities, which total $79 million, in in-creases above the fiscal year 2001 President 's Budget: \u2014Create new Comprehensive Diabetes Research Centers to provide enhanced in- frastructure support, and enhance the effectiveness of existing Diabetes Centers(DERCs and DRTCs) by significantly increasing their funding levels and ex-panding their mission ($6 million); \u2014Create new regional centers with advanced technologies required for metabolic and functional imaging studies, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMC),positron emission tomography (PET), and related technologies, which are re-quired for contemporary diabetes research, and provide ongoing support ($5 mil-lion); \u2014With regard to Autoimmunity and the Beta Cell ($30 million): Define the immunological basis of type 1 diabetes and develop methods for pre- vention of the disease; Advance research on islet cell transplantation for treatment of diabetes; andDevelop methods to stimulate beta cell growth and regeneration; and \u2014With regard to Cell Signaling and Cell Regulation ($38 million): Complete the dissection of hormone signaling pathways, particularly the path- ways of insulin action, and define their alterations in diabetes, including insu-lin resistance; Define mechanisms regulating beta cell function and their alterations in type 2 diabetes; and Allow metabolic staging of diabetes and identify the mechanisms of complica- tions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to present the views and rec- ommendations of Joslin Diabetes Center for diabetes research funding through NIHin fiscal year 2001. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE LOVELACE RESPIRATORY RESEARCH INSTITUTE Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I appreciate the opportunity on behalf of the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) to endorse andelaborate upon the written testimony of Dr. Clyde B. McCoy from the Universityof Miami School of Medicine (UMSM), with whom we are collaborating for our pro-posed Minority Health Tobacco Research Center (MHTRC). IMPACT OF SMOKING Nicotine is a drug. It is a highly addictive drug that is unregulated. It is also a drug that appears to have profound inhibitory effects on the mammalian immunesystem. The delivery system of choice for this drug is the cigarette. There is nodoubt that the use of tobacco products causes untold human injury and suffering. What is less well studied is the effect of secondary smoke (and by inference the delivery of nicotine to non-smokers) on the health of family members and co-workersof addicted users of these products. We propose the creation of a Center designedto study the physiology and behavioral medicine of secondary smoke combining theunique capabilities of two leading complementary research institutions: the Univer-sity of Miami School of Medicine and its Drug Abuse Research Center and theLovelace Respiratory Research Institute in New Mexico. Extensive experience in health research at UMSM in minority substance abuse and minority health will be linked to the world class physiology, cell and molecularbiology and toxicology expertise present at LRRI to model the role of secondarysmoke on the biology of the individual using cellular and rodent models followed by455 studies of family members of smokers. Medical and behavioral interventions will then be developed based on the resulting data. THE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE MINORITY POPULATION Surgeon General David Satcher reported in a March 23, 2000 news release that there is an increase in tobacco use, especially among teens from African American,American Indian and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and His-panic communities. This increase in use will lead to an increase in cancer, heartdisease, emphysema, stroke and other diseases among minorities. In addressing thisincrease, the Surgeon General noted, ''Unless they are reversed, these increases in tobacco use are a time-bomb for the health of our minority populations . . . If to-bacco use continues to increase among minority adolescents, we can expect severehealth consequences to begin to be felt in the early part of the next century. '' ''This new report clearly shows tobacco 's increasing grip on racial and ethnic mi- norities \u2014the fastest growing segments of the American population, '' said HHS Sec- retary Donna E. Shalala. ''This new report underscores the need for Congress to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation this year based on the President 's five key principles that include a significant price increase and plans to dramatically reduceyouth tobacco use. '' Of particular relevance to this proposal to fund the MHTRC, were the following major conclusions: \u2014''Cigarette smoking is a major cause of disease and death in each of the four population groups studied in this report . . . Differences in the magnitude ofdisease risk are directly related to difference in patterns of smoking . . . \u2014No single factor determines patterns of among racial/ethnic minor- ity groups . . . These patterns are the result of complex interactions of multiplefactors, such as socio-economic status, culture characteristics, acculturation,stress, biologic elements, targeted advertising, price of tobacco products, andvarying capacities of communities to mount effective tobacco control initiatives. \u2014Rigorous surveillance and prevention research are needed on the changing cul- tural, psychosocial, and environmental factors that influence tobacco use to im-prove our understanding of racial/ethnic smoking patters and identify strategictobacco control opportunities. The capacity of tobacco control efforts to keep pace with patterns of tobacco use and cessation depends on timely development of ap-propriate community-based programs to address the factors involved. '' (emphasis added) Please note that the report went on to call for more research into the effects of tobacco use among the groups, and called for studies to determine the health effectsof exposure to secondhand smoke. Given the concentration of the Native American population in New Mexico, the focus of the MHTRC will also include American Indians. The Surgeon General foundthat ''Nearly 40 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native adults smoke ciga- rettes, compared with 25 percent of adults in the overall U.S. population. They aremore likely than any other racial/ethnic minority group to smoke tobacco or usesmokeless tobacco . . . American Indians . . . were only one of the four major U.S.racial/ethnic groups to experience an increase in respiratory cancer death rates in1990 -1995. '' (www.cdc.gov/tobacco) The bad news continues. The need to focus on the minority population is even more significant given the underutilization of the health system by the population.This disturbing fact is documented in a recent study produced by the Common-wealth Fund and published on February 18, 2000. The report discovered that His-panics account for an alarming one-quarter of the nation 's 44 million uninsured peo- ple. According to the report, ''Nearly 40 percent of Hispanics under the age of 65 do not have insurance. Despite their increasingly vital contribution to the nation 's economy. '' Hispanics are twice as likely as the general population to go without cov- erage. ''Overall, 18 percent of the population under age 65 has no health insuranc e... Among whites, one of seven lacks insurance; among blacks, one of four lacks insurance; and among Hispanics, nearly two of five is uninsured .... '' (bkb@cmwf.org) LRRI AND UMSM ARE UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO ADDRESS TOBACCO AND HARMFUL SUBSTANCE ADDITION IN THE MINORITY POPULATION As Dr. McCoy points out, the University of Miami School of Medicine researchers have significant expertise and experience in the treatment of tobacco-related diseaseincluding the evaluation of Florida 's Tobacco Pilot Program. LRRI has also gained a national reputation for its research work in the areas of prevention and cure ofrespiratory disease.456 Because of LRRI 's unique capabilities to perform basic science research, LRRI and UMSM bring their strengths to the formation of the MHTRC. LRRI has undertakensome of the leading studies of animal models of smoking and the role of nicotinein immune function. It is one of the few research organizations capable of under-taking complex inhalation exposure protocols with appropriate animal models thatpredict human physiological responses. BOTTOM LINE LRRI will undertake experimental protocols investigating the role of second hand smoke on neonates, children and adults. These models determine the preciseimmunological defects that result from these exposures. This data will then be com-pared to the cellular immune function of newborns, older children, and family mem-bers of minority subjects. UMSM will use its experience with understanding the unique cultural and social systems found in these minority populations, and as preserved in their unique data-base, to tailor medical and behavioral interventions to treat and prevent this ter-rible disease, not only on those who choose to smoke, but more importantly, on thosewho are exposed, yet have no choice. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) represents more than 14,000 physicians involved in cancer research and treatment. ASCO is the leading voiceamong medical professional societies concerning issues of cancer clinical research.The Society is pleased to have the opportunity to comment on fiscal year 2001 ap-propriations for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other issues related tothe mission of NIH. These matters are of great importance to clinical researchersand their patients. FISCAL YEAR 2001 APPROPRIATIONS FOR NIH AND NCI ASCO applauds the commitment of this Subcommittee to doubling the budget for NIH between 1999 and 2003. This panel 's leadership has been essential to ensure predictability and stability in the NIH appropriation and allow scientists to pursueexciting new research endeavors. We believe the biomedical research effort of thiscountry is as strong as it has ever been, in no small part because of the unwaveringsupport of Congress. In order to sustain progress toward the goal of doubling the NIH budget by 2003, a funding boost of 15 percent is necessary in 2001. We strongly support a 15 percentincrease for NIH. In addition, we recommend that funding for the National CancerInstitute (NCI) be enhanced in accordance with the Bypass Budget. Funding NCIat a level of $4.1 billion will allow the Institute to fund promising and innovativeinvestigator-initiated research proposals and facilitate research that capitalizes onimportant advances in molecular biology. ASCO believes the Bypass Budget in-cludes a persuasive rationale for boosting the NCI budget to $4.1 billion, and weurge the Subcommittee to begin the new millennium by implementing the BypassBudget recommendation. CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY SECTION If promising basic research advances are to have meaning for Americans, they must be translated into medical practice. This translation process can only be ac-complished through clinical research. Unfortunately, investigator-initiated clinicalresearch proposals have historically not fared well at NIH because they have beenreviewed by basic researchers who are not well versed in clinical research. ASCOhas maintained that allowing basic researchers to dominate the review of cancerclinical research proposals is inequitable, a position endorsed by several blue ribbonpanels charged with oversight of the NIH peer review process. Furthermore, accord-ing to recent reports, physician scientists ' success in obtaining NIH funding for in- vestigator-initiated research has a significant impact on their willingness to remainin the field. Therefore, the research review process has a significant impact on to-day's research and on the future of clinical research. ASCO has previously brought the issue of peer review of cancer clinical research to the attention of this Subcommittee, and the panel has supported efforts to im-prove the grants evaluation process. As a result of Subcommittee directives to theNIH, the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) appointed a special emphasis panel toreview clinical oncology research proposals. The special emphasis panel is composedof clinical researchers who have the expertise and experience to evaluate cancer457 clinical research proposals. The early reports from the special emphasis panel have been positive. ASCO believes this model for review has been successful and shouldbe made a permanent study section. We believe this would result in a system of fairand informed review of clinical oncology research. We are concerned, however, that CSR has announced plans to reinstate a system in which clinical oncology research proposals will be evaluated by panels in whichas few as one-third of the members will have clinical research expertise. This situa-tion\u2014where basic researchers dominate the review of clinical research proposals \u2014 is one that external NIH advisors recommended be avoided. ASCO urges the Sub-committee to renew its directive to NIH officials to maintain a peer review systemthat has clinical researchers reviewing cancer clinical research proposals. ASCO be-lieves that a rigorous and fair peer review system is fundamental to a strong clinicalresearch effort and urges the Subcommittee to ensure that clinical researchers willreview clinical research proposals. CLINICAL TRIALS COVERAGE ASCO has worked for several years for enactment of the Medicare Cancer Clinical Trials Coverage Act, which would require Medicare to reimburse the routine patientcare costs for those enrolled in cancer clinical trials. More recently, we have beenactively involved in efforts to ensure clinical trials coverage provisions in the Pa-tients ' Bill of Rights. Although coverage for routine patient care costs is not tech- nically a matter for this Subcommittee, assurance of such coverage is critical to theefficiency of the research enterprise and is therefore surely a concern for this panel.Only if treatments can be tested in clinical trials can clinical researchers determinetheir effectiveness. If reimbursement denials or the fear of such denials slow accrualto clinical trials, this will adversely affect the ability of researchers to answer ques-tions about new treatments. ASCO believes it is absolutely necessary that barriersto enrollment in clinical trials, including possible reimbursement uncertainties ordenials, be eliminated. ASCO appreciates the opportunity to submit its views on NIH funding and clinical research. On behalf of oncologists and their patients, we urge Congress to continueits strong support of NIH. We also recommend that special attention be paid to theclinical research enterprise to ensure that basic research findings are promptlybrought to the patient bedside. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER COALITION Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services and Education Appropriations, the National Prostate Cancer Coalition(NPCC) is a vital organization that includes, on its board of directors, representa-tives from the American Foundation for Urologic Disease, the Cancer Research In-stitute, CaP CURE, the Huntsman Cancer Center and Us TOO! International.Other coalition partners include the American Urological Association, B 'nai B 'rith International and Men 's Health Network. NPCC supporters are also thousands of survivors and their families, researchers and health professionals. Mr. Chairman, the NPCC strongly urges you and your colleagues to make appro- priations to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Cancer Insti-tute (NCI) such that $324.4 million will be available to carry out the fiscal year2001 commitment to the NIH five-year investment strategy for prostate cancer re-search. This funding will give hope to the nearly 200,000 men who learned theyhave prostate cancer in 1999. And it will bring closer the day when the coalitionno longer has to cite the chilling fact that nearly 40,000 American men lost theirlives to prostate cancer last year. The amount required for NIH is an increase of 15 percent over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. We also request full funding of the NCI director 's professional judgment, or ''bypass, '' budget at $4.1 billion. As you know, the bypass budget goes directly to support badly needed investiga- tions that will hasten new treatments and cures for cancer. The 15 percent increaseto NIH is necessary to fulfill Congress 's 1998 bipartisan commitment to double the NIH budget within five years. Reaching that funding target will allow NIH to pur-sue research opportunities that will make a difference in the lives of every familyfighting a dread disease, including those facing cancer. Mr. Chairman, in addition to asking for your support of prostate cancer research, the men and their families of the NPCC also congratulate you and the members ofthis committee. You took a dramatic step to improve the nation 's biomedical re- search capabilities when you committed to double the NIH budget between fiscal458 year 1999 and fiscal year 2003. Last year, you showed how serious you were when you provided NIH with about $2.0 billion more than it received in fiscal year 1999. And you also took specific action on behalf of prostate cancer research. Your hear- ing, in June 1999, brought together oncologist Christopher Logothetis, M.D., SenatorBob Dole, Michael Milken and Yankees ' great Joe Torre to discuss the near-term promises for prostate cancer research. As a product of that hearing, NIH presentedits five year investment strategy for prostate cancer research, recognizing that fund-ing in this important area has fallen far short of meeting the disease 's challenges. Prostate cancer has been the number one diagnosed non-skin cancer in the coun- try. It has accounted, on average, for 15 percent of all cancer cases and 15 percentof cancer deaths among men. Yet, until you and your colleagues acted, an averageof only 5 cents of every federal cancer research dollar had been allocated to find acure for this disease. While recent increases in prostate cancer research funding are vital, Mr. Chair- man, the unfortunate truth is that they still fall far short of the need \u2014and they alone are not sufficient to fund all of the most promising paths to treatment andcure. The NPCC 's Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee \u2014which includes some of the nation 's leading prostate cancer researchers and clinicians \u2014has already iden- tified more than $500 million in promising research that has not received funding.Missed opportunities cost lives. The NPCC believes we must accelerate treatmentopportunities by providing the resources to fund all promising research on the hori-zon. We have a strong working relationship with NIH and NCI and applaud the agen- cies' leadership and their intramural and extramural researchers for the tremen- dous work they have done to help prostate cancer patients and their families. We 've worked hard for NIH 's five-year prostate cancer research strategy. But, because we must remain attuned to opportunities, we must revisit that strategy next year. Theprogram 's budget was based on conservative projections. We believe that new treat- ments could be available soon, but they call for rapid acceleration of commitmentsto translational and clinical research. We must end the bottlenecks in drug develop-ment to allow agents to move quickly from the laboratory bench to the patient 's bed- side and medical clinics, where they can end the toll that prostate cancer takes onAmerica 's families. We support NCI 's existing innovative programs in translational and clinical pros- tate cancer research, particularly its RAID and QuickTrials projects. We would liketo see these expanded \u2014and married to innovative collaborations among public and private funders and providers of prostate cancer research. We also appreciate NCI 's commitment to increase the number of prostate cancer Special Programs of Re-search Excellence (SPOREs) and other opportunities that mobilize interdisciplinaryresearch talent and accelerate institutional collaborations. Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by stressing to the committee that an invest- ment in cancer research really is an investment, one that will yield dividends bothin lives saved and in dollars and cents. It may seem shocking to think that, in the past five years, more than one million men in the United States learned they had prostate cancer. But the real shock isthat we 've seen just the tip of the iceberg. The American population is aging. Between 1996 and 2014, the 76 million mem- bers of the baby boom generation \u201431 percent of our American population \u2014turn fifty years old. Those born before 1957 are turning fifty at the rate of one everyseven seconds. Because the risk of cancer increases after this milestone, more andmore Americans will battle cancer \u2014including prostate cancer \u2014in the coming years. Cancer care already costs this country more than $100 billion annually. With the graying of the baby boomers, THE MARCH Research Task Force had estimated, in1998, that, if unchecked, the cost of cancer will jump to more than $200 billion with-in a decade. Even if Congress 's commitment to cancer research continues to grow at its current rate, we will still be spending 20 times more on care than cure. In 2000, one American man in every six is at risk of prostate cancer; one cancer diagnosis in every seven will be prostate cancer; and one male cancer death in everyeight will be prostate cancer. Some clinicians note that the number of men in theirforties and fifties who are battling prostate cancer is increasing, and they reportseeing more aggressive forms of the disease in younger men. Mr. Chairman, in the face of these daunting facts and as you consider the future investments in NIH and NCI research, NPCC asks you and your colleagues to bemindful of the impact of prostate cancer on the country as a whole. While advancing research in these important programs costs federal dollars, we ask you to remember the greater costs involved in any further delay to the cure ofprostate cancer.459 General Norman Schwarzkopf, a very wise military leader and himself a prostate cancer survivor, recently discussed cancer research in the context of military strat-egy. He put the issue this way: ''There always comes a time when you must get on with the battle. You cannot sit back and do nothing, because you 'll never have per- fect intelligence on the enemy. Base your battle plan on the best information youhave and be ready to modify your strategy and line of attack. The important thingis just to get on with it. '' Thank you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CANCER LEADERSHIP COUNCIL The Cancer Leadership Council (CLC) is a forum of national advocacy organiza- tions addressing public policy issues in cancer. CLC participants include organiza-tions representing patients and their caregivers. We are pleased to have this oppor-tunity to submit comments to the Subcommittee regarding funding for the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We areparticularly concerned about clinical cancer research and have recommended specialactions that must be taken to protect clinical research and ensure that basic re-search findings are rapidly translated into improved therapies. FISCAL YEAR 2001 NIH FUNDING The CLC commends the Subcommittee for its leadership in securing substantial increases in funding for NIH in fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000 and ensuringsteady progress toward a goal of doubling the NIH budget between 1999 and 2003.Because of the commitment of the Subcommittee to biomedical research, NIH hasexperienced a period of predictability and stability in its funding, and the researchenterprise has benefitted greatly. The CLC wholeheartedly supports increasing NIH funding by 15 percent in fiscal year 2001, a boost that is necessary to ensure movement toward the year 2003 fund-ing goal. We also urge that Congress fund the NCI according to the Bypass Budget,or at a level of $4.1 billion. The Bypass Budget outlines promising research opportu-nities that could be funded if NCI receives that level of funding. CLC believes thatimportant cancer research projects are being abandoned because of funding con-straints, and Congress could ensure that good science is funded if it meets the By-pass Budget funding recommendation. COVERAGE FOR CLINICAL TRIALS In order to move basic research findings to the patient bedside, they must be test- ed in clinical trials. The optimal clinical trials system is one that enrolls patientspromptly and tests therapies rapidly to answer questions about the best possibletreatments. Unfortunately, there are a number of barriers that prevent individualsfrom enrolling in trials and therefore slow the clinical trials process. CLC and others in the cancer community have worked diligently to remove bar- riers to patient enrollment in clinical trials, and our efforts have focused on guaran-teeing that third-party payers reimburse the routine patient care costs of those en-rolled in cancer clinical trials. In this Congress, we are seeking passage of the Medi-care Cancer Clinical Trials Coverage Act and inclusion of a clinical trials coverageprovision in the Patients ' Bill of Rights. Although Medicare and other third-party payer policies are not in the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee, they are vitally important to the health of the clinical researcheffort. If researchers face obstacles to enrolling patients in clinical trials due to realor perceived difficulties in reimbursement, the speed and efficiency of clinical trialswill be adversely affected and the translation of basic research findings into newtherapies will be slowed. The CLC urges your support for efforts to guarantee third-party reimbursement for those enrolling in cancer clinical trials. This coverage is a necessary componentof the biomedical research enterprise and is of utmost concern to cancer patientsand their caregivers. CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY SECTION In the past, CLC has asked the Subcommittee to direct NIH to revise the peer review process to ensure that cancer clinical research proposals receive a fair eval-uation. Cancer clinical research proposals have historically been reviewed by basicresearchers, and several advisory groups to the NIH have concluded that this re-sults in inequitable review of clinical research because basic researchers are notwell versed in clinical research and the challenges associated with it.460 This Subcommittee previously directed NIH to alter its peer review process, and the NIH finally responded by establishing a Clinical Oncology Research Special Em-phasis Panel. This panel represented a significant advance because it provided forthe review of clinical cancer research proposals by clinical researchers. Regrettably,the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) has indicated that it will reinstitute a systemin which basic researchers will review clinical research. We urge you to direct theNIH to retain the Special Emphasis Panel and abandon plans for a system in whichcancer clinical research will again be reviewed by basic researchers. The CLC is pleased to have the opportunity to submit comments to the Sub- committee. This panel 's steadfast advocacy for biomedical research is very important to the CLC, and we lend our enthusiastic support to your efforts to enhance NIHfunding. We request your special consideration of our proposals to protect and fosterclinical cancer research.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE LYMPHOMA RESEARCH FOUNDATION Chairman Specter and Members of the Subcommittee: My name is Neil Ruzic and I have lymphoma, cancer of the lymph system. So do 600,000 other Americans. Thiscountry is suffering a lymphoma epidemic. The incidence of lymphoma is increasingthe second fastest of all cancers, the fastest of cancers that cannot be prevented.That is, unlike melanoma (the fastest growing) and unlike lung cancer, you can 't prevent lymphoma by staying out of the sun or stopping smoking. The cause is un-known. Another 87,000 or more Americans will contract lymphoma this year. Our chil- dren are getting it \u201460 percent of childhood cancers are lymphoma or the related disease of leukemia. Our men are dying from it \u2014lymphoma is the fourth leading cause of death by cancer. Our women are dying from it at almost the same rate. The Lymphoma Research Foundation of America does what it can to help these people. It funds research projects mostly of young PhD or MD scientists. It is thenation 's primary organization dedicated to providing information and support to lymphoma patients and their families. On behalf of the Lymphoma Research Foun-dation, I want to thank Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Harkin and the Sub-committee for being instrumental in the NCI 's convening a Progress Review Group on lymphoma later this year. Panels of prominent scientists will review NCI 's lymphoma research portfolio and recommend a plan of action that will speedprogress, helping ensure that limited resources are used optimally. These are impor-tant steps . . . but there could be more. A year and a half ago, following surgery to remove my spleen that had grown four times too large, I was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma. This is the deadliestof the lymphomas, whose victims have an average time from diagnosis to death ofthree years. Despite the lack of a cure, oncologists at five leading institutions ad-vised me to take aggressive chemotherapy. Nothing else, they said at the end of1998, was proved and ''probably would not work. '' They admitted that chemo would only ''buy time, '' and in the long-run \u2014if there was one \u2014would work for shorter and shorter times until it destroyed my immune system. Instead of taking chemotherapy, I immediately stopped the book I was working on and devoted my time to learning about lymphoma by reading scientific papersand visiting the nation 's medical research centers. After 18 months of looking, I can tell you that the cures are there, in the brains and experiments of the medical re-searchers. These discoveries are in their infancies and require much more researchand testing, but they are there \u2014right now \u2014in the laboratories of the United States. I am one of the lucky ones, at least so far. Without treatment of any kind, my lymphoma for unknown reasons not only remains indolent but seems to be sub-siding. That is, the lymph nodes or glands in my abdomen, once the size of golf461 balls, now are the size of grapes, and some have shrunk to normal size (the size of a pea.) I am not sick. I have no symptoms. Why? I approached a team of creative gene researchers at UCLA, and together with the Lymphoma Research Foundation and the Mantle Cell Group (an e-mail informationassembly of patients), sponsored a project to try to answer that question. The ideawas that if we could render lymphoma quiescent, or indolent, it would be almostas good as finding a cure. The project, now underway, is a small part of the suddenrevolution in genetics and molecular biology. New therapies are being tested everyday, even faster than the completion of the human genome project, which alreadyis of enormous benefit to cancer research. There are good scientific reasons why funding should be increased immensely for lymphoma research. Lymphoma is to the lymph system what leukemia is to theblood system. The liquid lymph contains white blood cells that produce antibodieswhich, in turn, fight infection and filter out pathogens. Because lymph cells movefreely between the lymph and blood systems, an actual and comprehensive cure forlymphoma must begin with a basic understanding not only of the interplay betweenthese systems but also of how the immune system works, how the chromosomes andgenes function, how the very molecules of the cells work together. Because of thissystemic nature of lymphoma, any actual cure would be applicable to lung, colon,breast, prostate, and other kinds of cancer. As important as is the study of lymphoma to curing all cancers, lymphoma re- search constitutes a mere 2.2 percent of the budget of the National Cancer Institute!And the NCI 's budget for all cancer research, even now that it has been increased, is only $3.3 billion. That satisfaction with the status quo is wrong when human lives are at stake. For the first time in history, lymphoma and other hopeless diseases are suddenlyand uniquely vulnerable to a massive, coordinated attack by government and uni-versity laboratories. There has never been a better time than right now. Significant breakthroughs in previously unrelated fields of engineering, chemistry, biology, and physics have been quietly maturing \u2014remarkably at the same time \u2014 and everything at last is finally coming together. Computer technology, for instance,finally has merged with gene engineering so that we actually can put DNA on amicrochip and isolate genes that are broken, or determine the pathways of genesresponsible for specific diseases. Common wisdom says that cancer is not just one, but hundreds of diseases \u2014 lymphoma, leukemia, lung, breast, prostate and other organ cancers, and so on \u2014 leading you to believe that curing cancer requires an equal number of hundreds ofdifferent approaches. That assumption is no longer true. All cancers have in com-mon uncontrolled cell growth, and for that to occur a series of mutations in thegenes which control cell growth and behavior must take place. Tremendous progressin the understanding and manipulation of genes has been made in just the past year or so. Yet genetics researchers such as Dr. Jonathan Braun, Dr. Phillip Koeffler, and their teams at UCLA, who are at the front lines in this battle, lack funds for a trulylarge expansion of their programs and can test only a small number of their ideas.Typically these labs employ 10 to 20 scientists and technicians. They could expandto 100 or 200 workers, effectively, without wasted effort, and thereby hasten the re-search payoff . A novel approach pioneered by Dr. Judah Folkman at Children 's Hospital in Bos- ton that stops angiogenesis or ''blood growth '' that feeds tumors has caused scores of new compounds to be tried. Dr. Parkash Gill and his group at the University ofSouthern California, for instance, have found ways to alter the genes to cut offtumor blood supply. These researchers and others at Northwestern University havewiped out cancer in near-death patients who have had metastasized cancers all overtheir bodies. But Dr. Gill, chronically underfunded, lacks the means to pursue allbut a few animal studies. Like others in small labs, he must take valuable researchtime to seek the funding he needs. (The average project leader in this field spendsa third of his research time writing proposals or otherwise seeking grants.) As new therapies begin to replace outmoded, often-harmful chemotherapies, we must speed up testing and clinical trials of other techniques, even as the more fun-damental, ultimate, solutions such as gene therapy are being refined. For instance,antibodies made from human cells and cloned to produce large numbers of themnow are targeted to kill cancer cells specifically, instead of killing all cells that grow,normal or diseased (as does chemotherapy.) These monoclonal antibodies also arebeing combined with radioisotopes to be even more effective. Another new technique applicable to all cancers is the stimulation of the body 's own ''T cells, '' our immune system 's most effective killers of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The problem is that cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to hide them-462 selves from T cells. It 's like having an Air Force armed with one-ton bombs ready to destroy an army of invaders but not bombing the enemy troops because you can 't find them. Dr. Carl June and co-workers at the University of Pennsylvania have dis-covered that by stimulating two different receptors they can get the T cells tolaunch an immune response. In fact, the T cells are so sensitive to co-stimulationthey also secrete chemical messengers that work to make even more T cells. Nownot only can we use those one-ton bombs, but they are multiplied! This project hasreceived private funding from many sources, including the author 's. But with the massive governmental spending increase envisioned here, other labs could replicatethe results and help push it to the hilt. Vaccines \u2014not to prevent but to cure \u2014are being grown from patients ' tumors and customized to kill lymphomas in those lucky enough to get into the right protocol.Human trials run by such pioneers as Dr. Ronald Levy at Stanford and Drs. LarryKwak and Wyndham Wilson at the NCI include only hundreds instead of hundredsof thousands of cancer patients. Most of these and other potential new cures began with research into lymphoma, but they are applicable to all cancers! In addition there are the important basic research projects of hundreds of bright, mostly young medical scientists which have had to shut down before hardly gettingstarted for lack of funding. Individuals and foundations contribute at least as muchas the government, but most of those funds go for education and prevention. Phar-maceutical companies add another $4.8 billion annually for research \u2014almost double that of the government \u2014but little of this sum is spent on untargeted basic research The 10,000 universities in this country are among America 's greatest assets. Let 's use them to the hilt. These institutions not only educate the brightest of our youngmen and women but also attract the best foreign students who earn advanced de-grees and often stay to work in the U.S. All graduate students in science do basicresearch. It is this constant probing into fundamental knowledge in molecular andeven atomic biology, immunology, genetics, and into even seemingly unrelated re-search in bioengineering, chemistry, and computer technology that will cure cancer.The research freedom at the universities and peer reviews to decide on worthy ideasare good practices that should not be changed. Instead, the government should seekopportunities to expand the existing system and infrastructure massively. The key question is whether the new money could be spent profitably so that real cancer cures will be in use in ten years. Here are five spending steps that occurto me, which I am sure can be improved upon by university and NCI scientists: Massively increase funding for non-targeted basic research, using the majority of the funds. \u2014Here are two examples of how basic research, which when undertaken was not directed toward curing any specific disease, but now is leading to specificcancer-fighting studies: The 1953 discovery that earned the Nobel Prize for Watsonand Crick, showing that the double helix shape of DNA contained subunits of nu- cleotides, led directly to the current sequencing of more than 100,000 genes on our23 pairs of chromosomes. Dr. Gunter Blobel of New York 's Rockefeller University recently was awarded a Nobel Prize for his discoveries into how proteins locatethemselves in cells and how environmental mutations in the process lead to disease. Ask every university cancer project leader which of them could gear up to handle- effectively and efficiently \u201410 or 20 times their present funding. \u2014If their answers make sense, fund them. That may not be the most cost-effective method of fundingin the short run, but any money wasted on the way to the greater goal will palein comparison to the overwhelming financial benefit of a cancer-free economy. Wecan not afford to let research funding remain a zero-sum game where spending addi-tional money on, for instance, breast cancer, detracts from, say, lymphoma research. Proselytize young people into following scientific careers in medicine, medical engi- neering, immunology, genetics, and related fields, both at the professional and tech-nical-support level. \u2014Yes, education takes time. But these new people will be needed in the massive fight against cancer, and the sooner they start the sooner they willcontribute. We should offer full economic assistance for students to enter such ca-reers, and for graduate students to earn combined MD and PhD degrees. Such fund-ing will relieve professors from having to pay their graduate students out of theirresearch grants, thereby also making them more productive. Such a program shouldbe publicized widely to attract the most creative people from throughout the world. Create a dozen more big cancer centers of excellence throughout the country, letting the universities compete for the new sites. \u2014Encourage competition by funding post- doctoral researchers and by endowing chairs in medical research laboratories. It isthrough competition, the engine of progress, that enormous goals are realized. Bio-technology is the ''dot com '' of the new decade. The U.S. has benefited profoundly from the internet change relative to other countries because of the technological in-frastructure already in place. Intensifying the infrastructure and career develop-463 ment in bioscience for cancer breakthroughs is a role that government plays well, and industry does not. Coordinate the research results of the NCI, universities, and others by instituting a worldwide central data base and ultrafast communications system. \u2014The recent in- auguration of PubMed Central and the database of the National Library of Medicineare welcome steps, but the effort is still terribly underfunded. Researchers need tobe informed instantly of discoveries elsewhere that may bear upon their work. Onecan picture a thousand information experts at their computers alerting universityresearchers to meaningful experiments. It is important that the government avoidplaying the role of director of this War on Cancer; the government should be thecoordinator. If, in providing for such an expansion, the Congress voted for a dramatic and im- mediate increase for the NCI of some $30 billion \u2014with the majority of the money going for basic research \u2014the returns would begin to pour in almost right away. They would build to a flood in a few years. They would race to a crescendo by theend of the decade. Is it worth the money?Yes, in terms of misery and death avoided. Yes again, in economic terms. The an- nual cost of cancer to the U.S. alone currently is $107 billion, including direct andindirect costs. According to economists Kevin Murphy and Robert Topel at the Uni-versity of Chicago, if all forms of cancer were eliminated the economic value to theUnited States would be $46.5 trillion, which is more than all U.S. assets! The eco-nomic and humanitarian benefit to other nations also would be overwhelming. Whata fantastic tool of foreign policy, the exportation to other countries of the cure forcancer! Elimination of death by cancer would usher in a new era of worldwide health and prosperity, removing misery, and rendering human life more productive andhappier. Progress in the various sciences is rushing steadily toward the cure of can-cer. From the viewpoint of government appropriations, whether that cure arrives inten years or in fifty years, or somewhere in-between, is only a matter of money. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL NUTRITIONAL FOODS ASSOCIATION Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to present public witness testimony on behalf of the National Nutritional Foods As-sociation (NNFA). My name is Patrick Toomey. I am President of NNFA, a tradeassociation representing 3,000 independent health food stores and 1,000 manufac-turers, distributors and suppliers of natural health products, including organic andnatural foods, natural ingredient cosmetics and dietary supplements. In addition to being the President of NNFA, I also own a small natural foods store, Toomey 's Natural Foods in Milford, Ohio. I have been an industry retailer for 25 years and for the past ten years I have served on both national and regionalboards of the NNFA. CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE MIRRORS CITIZEN DEMAND National interest in access to reliable information on safe and effective vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary supplements has grown steadilysince the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) unanimouslypassed the House and Senate to become the law of the land in 1994. Approximately 158,000,000 Americans are taking dietary supplements, spending, by some estimates, as much as $14.5 billion a year in health food stores alone.Americans are looking to safe, natural alternatives to prescription drugs to treatand prevent disease, and to maintain good health by supplementing inadequatediets with vitamins and minerals. NUTRIENTS CAN PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE We are entering a new era of recognition of the value of natural pathways to good health. For example, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy ofSciences, which devises Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for nutrients for the Food and Drug Administration, has issued the first of a series of reports presentingrevised nutrient intake guidelines. Originally introduced in 1941, RDAs were in-tended to prevent classical nutrient deficiency diseases nearly extinct in the U.S.today, such as scurvy, beriberi and rickets. Now, these reports are revising and ex-panding RDAs to reflect compelling evidence, which supports the use of nutrientsto help prevent chronic disease, such as osteoporosis. We agree with the Chairman464 of the Food and Nutrition Board, who characterized this approach as ''. . . a major leap forward in nutrition science. '' Similarly, the report of the President 's Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels endorsed continued research on the benefits of dietary supplements in health pro-motion and disease prevention. The Commission hailed the increasing research-based documentation of the benefits of dietary supplements in maintaining healthand preventing chronic disease and other health-related conditions, and called forcontinuation of this welcome trend. NNFA continues to endorse the Commission 's recommendation that, ''. . . the public interest would be served by more research that assesses the relationships between dietary supplements and maintenance ofhealth and/or prevention of disease. '' HERBS AND BOTANICALS ARE BENEFICIAL AND COST -EFFECTIVE In addition to supporting these kinds of exciting new findings on the health bene- fits of nutrients, NNFA urges the Committee to continue to support research on me-dicinal herbs and botanicals, also classified as dietary supplements under theDSHEA. The results of a study on ginkgo biloba, published recently in the October22, 1997 Journal of the American Medical Association, indicates that administration of this herbal extract, recognized for centuries in Chinese medicine for its ability tostimulate and improve blood circulation in the brain, could delay the onset of Alz-heimer 's Disease for up to six months. This could represent tremendous savings of lives and dollars from a disease, which costs society approximately $90 billion ayear. Other studies show saw palmetto more effective than prescription medicine atreducing benign prostate enlargement, with far less expense and no reportable sideeffects. In 1998, Harvard University completed a 14-year study of 80,000 nurses,concluding that large amounts of vitamin B6 and folic acid could prevent heart at-tacks by an astounding 51 percent. Millions of Americans are turning daily to herbal remedies and seeking primary health care from the alternative, holistic providers who prescribe them. There is anurgent need for a dramatic increase in support for research on herbs and botanicals,justified by consumer demand and the Congressional intent expressed in DSHEA.The Dietary Supplement Commission report recommends that, ''. . . Federal agen- cies continue to support off research on the health benefits and safety of dietarysupplements. Research should be expanded beyond the traditionally supported areasassociated with vitamin and mineral supplements and include research on some ofthe more promising botanical products used as dietary supplements. '' NNFA whole- heartedly agrees. Ours is one of the few cultures in the world for whom the prevention and treat- ment of disease with non-prescription herbal medicines is the exception rather thanthe rule. This is largely due to the fact that foreign research oftentimes is deemedunacceptable by the Food and Drug Administration for use in justifying healthclaims for herbs and botanicals. We urge the Committee to provide the adequatefunding for research on the safety and benefits of medicinal herbs. NIH'S OFFICE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) was established at the National Insti- tutes of Health by DSHEA, to stimulate, coordinate and disseminate the results ofresearch on the benefits and safety of dietary supplements in the treatment andprevention of chronic disease. It is my understanding that ODS will receive its au-thorized level of $5 million for fiscal 2000. NNFA requests a further increase forthis office in fiscal 2001. NNFA agrees with the President 's Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels that if fully-funded, '' . . . ODS could play a valuable role in providing consumers with information about dietary supplements . . . including [the] promotion of sci-entific studies on potential roles of dietary supplements in health promotion and dis-ease prevention. Appropriations as authorized by DSHEA are essential if ODS is tomeet [the] mandates of the Act. '' ODS now has the capacity to provide useful infor- mation to consumers whereby meeting the Congressional mandate of the Office. We also urge continued funding for the botanical research initiative which began in fiscal 1999 at the ODS. ODS has recently funded two botanical research centerslocated at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Universityof Illinois at Chicago (UIC). ODS expanded the botanical research center initiativeby releasing an additional request for application for a botanical research center atthe end of 1999. ODS ' long-term goal is to expand the initiative and obtain botanical research centers throughout the country. NNFA supports this goal.465 NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLIMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE In 1992 Congress directed the National Institutes of Health to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine with the expressed task of assuring objective, rigorous re-view of alternative therapies to provide consumers reliable information. In fiscal1999 the Office of Alternative Medicine was elevated to a Center with its own grantmaking capabilities. Funding for the Center has grown along with its increased au-thority from $2 million in fiscal 1992 to $50 million in fiscal 1999 to $68.8 millionin fiscal 2000. I thank the Committee for its support of NCCAM. NNFA supportsincreased funding for this important Center in fiscal 2001. This has given alter-native research a well-deserved boost and is more in line with the health choicesof most Americans. A 1998 Newsweek study states that some 83 millions Americans, about 40 percent of the adult population, are seeking alternative medical treatment. Also, findingsfrom the ''National Survey of Alternative Medicine Use, '' published in the January, 1993 New England Journal of Medicine, reveal that Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to alternative medical therapy providers in 1990, exceeding the338 million visits made to all U.S. primary care providers that year. The survey alsoshowed that out-of-pocket expenditures associated with alternative therapies totaled$10.3 billion in 1990, approaching the $12.8 billion in out-of-pocket expenses in-curred for all U.S. hospitalizations during the same period. It is crucial for thehealth and security of all Americans that objective, scientific research is done to de-termine the effectiveness of complementary and alternative therapies. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AT AHRQ AND HFCA The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is often directed by the Committee to pursue projects designed to research the cost-effectiveness attendantto novel approaches to the treatment and/or prevention of illness. The time is rightfor investigation of the worthiness of certain dietary supplements, based on well-de-signed, cost-effectiveness research. Every year, treatment of chronic conditions and illnesses \u2014from flus and colds to hypertension to dementia and Alzheimer 's disease \u2014generates enormous publicly and privately funded health care expenditures. There exists an opportunity to trimsuch burgeoning costs through prevention and/or treatment of these chronic ail-ments \u2014or delay of their onset \u2014with safe, effective, low cost dietary supplements. NNFA is confident that basic research at NIH can lead to appropriately structured,cost/outcome research at AHRQ which would demonstrate the value of dietary sup-plements in comparison to contemporary medical intervention. This evidence can, inturn, lead to Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) projects to determineif a policy of reimbursement could be established. Despite the growing popularity and demand for herbs and nutritional supple- ments, and their widespread use for prevention and intervention of chronic illness,precious few large-scale outcome studies on American populations are available togive health professionals the information they need to make decisions on alter-natives to contemporary medical approaches. Echinacea has been shown to be effec-tive in preventing and treating colds and flus; folic acid has been shown effectivefor neural tube defects and also homocysteine levels in cardiovascular disease; herb-al/nutritional combinations have been shown to provide control for hypertensionwithout the side effects which cause many patients to stop using their prescriptionmedicine; and the use of glucosamine sulfate for joint function. NNFA believes thata sufficient body of botanical and nutrient research may exist in certain instances,to whet AHRQ 's appetite and to warrant Congressional consideration of cost-effec- tiveness studies in this area. NNFA urges the Committee to consider directing AHRQ to work with the Office of Dietary Supplements and the National Center of Complimentary and AlternativeMedicine to review the existing outcome research on dietary supplements. TheAHRQ could then investigate the feasibility, under appropriate protocols, of devel-oping cost-effectiveness projects designed to compare the value of herbs and otherdietary supplements in the treatment and prevention of chronic illness to typicalmedical approaches. The areas I have mentioned are but a few of the many possi-bilities which urgently present themselves for research and evaluation. Once thenecessary biomedical and cost-effectiveness research have been completed, NNFAurges the Committee to direct HCFA to investigate the potential reimbursement forpromising alternative therapies and treatments involving nutritional supplementsand herbs.466 A SOUND INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH AND WELL -BEING OF ALL AMERICANS Science and experience ably demonstrate a wealth of benefits attendant to the regular use of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, herbs and botanicals \u2014all classified by DSHEA as dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are allowing mil-lions of American consumers to take charge of their own good health by safely andeffectively preventing and treating a host of illnesses and conditions. The body ofresearch supporting use of these products is impressive, but sorely requires imme-diate and dramatic expansion. NNFA urges the Committee to endure the Congres-sional mandate expressed in DSHEA by investing in the scientific research whichholds the key to our knowledge of the remarkable importance and value of dietarysupplements. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NYU S CHOOL OF MEDICINE I want to begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman, and members of this Sub- committee for your continued support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).You clearly recognize the importance of a strong Federal investment in medical re-search and that today 's investments may represent tomorrow 's treatment and cures for many disorders and diseases. This Subcommittee has been a leader in ensuringthat our nation remains a leader in the field of medical research, and on behalf ofthe NYU School of Medicine, I thank you. The NYU School of Medicine takes pride in a history that goes back to 1837 and includes the initiation of and the participation in many of the major events in Amer-ican medicine through two centuries. The School annually graduates 150 physicians,and it employs 3,000 individuals including more than 800 faculty members. For 150years the School has provided high quality patient medical services and medical su-pervision to Bellevue Hospital Center, New York City 's premiere municipal hospital. The mission of the School is threefold: the training of physicians, the search for newknowledge, and the care of the sick. These three missions must be carried out simul-taneously for they are wholly dependent upon each other, not only for inspiration,but for their very means of success. At the School of Medicine, we recognize thatin order to excel in these three missions, we must be responsive to the major eventsand trends that are shaping medicine in our time. These include: the revolution inmolecular biology and medical technology; the societal imperatives imposed by risinghealth care expectations and the finite limits on resources; the explosive growth inbiomedical information; and the increasing role of the patient in the decision-mak-ing process. In my opinion, there has never been a more exciting time to enter medicine. Enor- mous breakthroughs have allowed great advances in our understanding of diseaseand our ability to devise new therapies. We know with certainty that this explosionof knowledge will continue. With continued federal support for basic, cutting edgeresearch supported through the NIH, we will continue to move closer to our goalof translating the promise of scientific discovery into an improved quality of life forall Americans. As we enter this century, we must continue to provide the resourcesand investments necessary to seize upon these tremendous opportunities. The NYUSchool of Medicine supports the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group for MedicalResearch Funding, a coalition of nearly 200 patient and voluntary health groups,medical and scientific societies, academic and research organizations, and industry,of $20.5 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2001. This $2.7 billion (15 percent) increaserepresents the third step toward fulfilling the bipartisan goal of doubling the NIHbudget by fiscal year 2003. As the volume of NIH research increases, we must address the need for upgraded, state-of-the-art facilities to carry out this federally-supported biomedical and behav-ioral research. A 1998 National Science Foundation (NSF) study on the status of sci-entific research facilities at U.S. colleges and universities identified an estimated$11.4 billion in deferred research construction and repair/renovation projects, aswell as a decrease in new construction of health research facilities across an arrayof institutions. Adequate laboratory space and research instrumentation are nec- essary to obtain the best data from NIH research dollars. For this reason, I urgeyou to provide $250 million for extramural facilities construction at the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH) in your fiscal year 2001 bill. In addition to providing significant funding increases for NIH \u2014including in- creased funds for extramural research infrastructure \u2014I thank you for raising the salary cap imposed on extramural researchers from Executive Level III to ExecutiveLevel II ($141,000) in last year 's bill. The higher salary level will allow many insti- tutions, such as the NYU School of Medicine, to attract and retain the best inves-467 tigators in their respective academic research programs. However, under the Senior Biomedical Research Service (SBRS) program on the NIH campus, the NIH can payits senior investigators up to $151,000 \u2014roughly equal to what the salary cap on academic researchers would be if it were indexed for inflationary increases over thepast decade. To seek a level playing field with intramural NIH researchers, we seekyour support in raising the current salary cap to Executive Level I in the fiscal year2001 bill. Over the past decade, several trends in the health care marketplace and fiscal stewardship of the public-private partnership have destabilized research institutionsand the pool of specially trained personnel necessary to continue to push the fron-tiers of medical research. For this reason, the medical center supports the proposalthat the NIH establish a Flexible Institutional Support for Health Research(FISHR) program. This peer-reviewed, three-year grant program will provide insti-tutional resources to meet evolving needs in research in the range of $25,000 to$300,000 a year for deans of medical, public health, nursing and dental schools. Wesuggest a funding level of $60 million in fiscal year 2001 for this competitive, renew-able pool of accountable resources which will help modify the impact of the recentstresses experienced by research and academic institutions and will serve to main-tain the integrity of our national research enterprise. I would like to highlight an exciting initiative at the School of Medicine. The School of Medicine is developing a comprehensive Program in Women 's Cancer (PWC). This program will be an integral component of the Comprehensive CancerCenter (CCC). The PWC will encompass the full spectrum of clinical services, ad-vanced training, fundamental and translational research into those cancers that ex-clusively or primarily affect the female reproductive tract. The components of thisprogram include: etiology and biology; and rehabilitation; and psycho-social support. PWC will as a multi-departmental entity with on-site clinical serv- ices provided by the Departments of Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology (Ob/Gyn),Pathology, Radiation Oncology, Radiology, and Surgery. The physicians from thesedepartments will be supported by a team of social workers, physical and occupa-tional therapists to ensure continuity between in-patient and out-patient care. The School is seeking the Subcommittee 's support to expand its PWC. The School is requesting $5 million in support through the Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration 's Health Facilities Construction account in your fiscal year 2001 bill. Thank you again, Chairman Specter, for your attention to these important issues. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE TEXAS NEUROFIBROMATOSIS FOUNDATION The Texas Neurofibromatosis Foundation is pleased to submit testimony in sup- port of funding for the National Institutes of Health and for neurofibromatosis inyour fiscal year 2001 bill. The Texas Neurofibromatosis Foundation was established in 1981 and is com- mitted to meeting the needs of people challenged with NF by providing care, com-fort, support, information, education, funding, and other resources for the treatment,prevention, and eventual cure of this disease. With offices in Dallas and Houston,the Foundation coordinates support groups, organizes fundraising events and edu-cational symposiums, and assists with NF clinics across the state that serve themore than 5,000 individuals with NF in Texas. Dedicated volunteers form the heartof the organization, giving their time and talents to increase public awareness andraise the money necessary to support patient programs and research projects. Advo-cates from around the country look to the Texas NF Foundation as a model whenestablishing new a NF organization in a state. Texas is also home to some of themost exciting NF research described below. NF, incorrectly but commonly known as elephant man disease, involves the un- controlled growth of tumors along the nervous system which can result in terribledisfigurement, deformity, deafness, blindness, brain tumors, cancer and/or death. Itis the most common neurological disorder caused by a single gene. While not all NFpatients, like myself, suffer from the most severe symptoms, all of us live our liveswith the uncertainty of not knowing whether we too will be severely affected be-cause NF is a highly variable and progressive disease. Approximately 100,000 Amer-icans have NF, and it appears in approximately one in every 3,500 births. It strikesworldwide, without regard to gender, race or ethnicity. There are two types of NF;type 1, which is the more common of the two and NF2 which primarily involvesacoustic neuromas causing deafness and balance problems as well as other types oftumors such as schwannomas and meningiomas.468 With your continued support and a relatively small Federal investment, NF has become one of the great success stories in the current revolution in molecular genet-ics. Because of the enormous advances that have been made, one leading NF re-searcher has stated that more is known about NF genetically than any other dis-ease. Accordingly, many NF researchers believe that NF should serve as a modelto study all diseases. The future promise of NF research is based upon these suc-cesses. Let me highlight for you some of the advances in NF research that have oc-curred since 1990: \u2014The discovery of the NF1 and NF2 genes and gene products; \u2014Determination of the close connection between NF and cancer, brain tumors, learning disabilities, heart disease, and other neurological disorders; \u2014Determination and understanding of the functions of the NF1 and NF2 genes and gene products including the discovery of new pathways impacted by the NFgenes and gene products; \u2014Development of advanced animal models; \u2014Development of drug and gene therapies; \u2014Commencement of clinical trials at NCI; \u2014Establishment of an international consortium of NF researchers and patients; \u2014Rescuing learning deficits in animal models with NF1; \u2014Substantial increase in the number of NF researchers The enormous promise of NF research \u2014and its potential to benefit tens of mil- lions of Americans in this generation alone \u2014has gained increased recognition from Congress and the NIH. This is evidenced by the fact that five Institutes at NIH arecurrently supporting NF research (NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NICHD, and total NF research portfolio increased from $11 million in 1995 to approxi- mately $18 million in 2000. The National Institute on Disability Research and Re-habilitation (NIDRR) within the Department of Education has also expressed an in-terest in pursuing NF research in the learning disability area since 35 -60 percent of children with NF suffer from learning disabilities. For fiscal year 2001, the Sub-committee 's continued support will be critical to build upon the basic and clinical research described below which is essential to moving us closer to a treatment andcure for this disease. Since the discovery of the NF gene, researchers have established the connection between NF and the following diseases and disorders: Cancer .\u2014Dr. Samuel Broder, former Director of the National Cancer Institute, stated that NF was at the ''cutting edge '' of cancer research. Studies have inves- tigated the connection between the ras oncogene, which is critical to control growthand development in healthy cells (and when mutated contributes to the formationof tumors), and the NF1 gene which is a tumor suppressor. The studies showed thatras activity can be inhibited by the NF1 protein neurofibromin. Since elevated rasactivity is involved in 30 percent of all cancers, the inhibition of ras by neurofibromin may result in a cure, not only for NF, but also for many of the mostcommon forms of cancer. Learning disabilities .\u2014In addition to NF 's connection to cancer, NF also provides a unique opportunity to begin to uncover a molecular basis for cognitive impair-ment, and it holds the prospect of possessing a radiologic marker for brain dysfunc-tion. Specific learning disabilities are the most common neurological complication inchildren with NF1. The reported frequency of learning disabilities in children withNF ranges between 30 -65 percent. Uncovering the molecular and cellular causes for the learning deficits caused by NF should also reveal important clues on whatcauses and how to cure tumors in NF1 patients, because the same molecular mecha-nisms underlie both tumor formation and learning disabilities. For example, recentresearch on mice with the same mutation that causes NF1 in humans (NF1 mice)has shown that treating the mice with a drug (farnesyl transferase inhibitor) thatdecreases ras function (the same ras that causes cancer and tumors) CURES theirlearning disabilities. Studies on fruit flies have also demonstrated that the proteinmade by the NF1 gene is part of the c-AMP pathway, the pathway which is knownto control learning and memory. Deafness .\u2014Leading NF researchers believe that the science has progressed to the point when a gene therapy for NF2 can be developed and tested. Unlike other ge-netic forms of deafness, in which mutation leads to a development or structural ab-normality in the ear for which it would be difficult to envisage a treatment in theadult, NF2-associated deafness is potentially preventable or curable if tumor growthis halted before damage has been done to the adjacent nerve. NF2 accounts for ap-proximately 5 percent of genetic forms of deafness. It is also related to other typesof tumors including schwannomas and meningiomas, as well as being a major causeof balance problems.469 Heart disease .\u2014Recently published research has also demonstrated the relation- ship between NF and heart disease. Researchers have demonstrated that mice com-pletely lacking in NF1 have congenital heart disease that involves the endocardialcushions which form in the valves of the heart. This is because the same ras whichcauses cancer and learning disabilities also causes heart valves to close andneurofibromin suppresses ras, thus opening up the heart valve. Errors in valve for-mation account for a large percentage of congenital heart disease in humans, and congenital heart disease is the most common type of congenital defect. Researchersbelieve that further understanding how an NF1 deficiency leads to heart diseasemay help to unravel molecular pathways affected in genetic and environmentalcauses of heart disease. This finding opens up a new area for future research in con-genital heart disease. In addition, the role of NF1 in neural tube closure suggeststhat NF1 research may bear on the understanding of causes of Spina Bifida, a com-mon birth defect. NF research is on the precipice of many major discoveries that will have broad and significant implications for Americans suffering from many disorders and dis-eases. For example, NCI is currently conducting clinical trials on NF patients in-volving the use of farnesyl transferase inhibitors in pediatric patients with refrac-tory solid tumors. Other areas of research opportunity include: \u2014Further clinical trials; \u2014Expansion of drug and genetic therapies for NF and related disorders; \u2014Further development of NF animal models; \u2014Maintenance and expansion consortium of NF clinical researchers and pa- tients; \u2014Further determination of the connection between NF and cancer, tumors, heart disease, learning disabilities, deafness, bone and other disorders; \u2014Further determine function of the NF genes and gene products; \u2014Expansion of pool of NF researchers This Subcommittee recognizes that our goal should be to translate the promise of scientific discovery into an improved quality of life for all Americans. To accomplishthis goal, we must, as a nation, continue to invest in medical research at the NIH.Sustained, stable growth in funding for the NIH is needed to build upon past sci-entific achievements, address present medical needs, and anticipate future healthchallenges. Volatility and dramatic fluctuations in funding can be as harmful to theresearch enterprise as inadequate growth. Towards this end, I encourage the Sub-committee to support the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Re-search Funding, a coalition of over 200 patient and voluntary health groups, medicaland scientific societies, academic and research organizations, and industry, whichcalls for a fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $20.5 billion for the National Institutesof Health (NIH). In addition to providing increased funding for the NIH as a whole,this Subcommittee has recognized the promise of NF research and has included lan-guage in your fiscal year 2000 Report encouraging NCI, NINDS, NICHD, NIDCD,NHLBI, and NIDRR at the Department of Education to increase their NF researchportfolios through the use of: Requests for Applications, Program Announcements,the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Group Program, and Small Business Inno-vation Research Grants, as appropriate. I urge the Subcommittee to continue to en-courage these Institutes to continue this trend. In closing, I will end with a statement that appeared in an edition of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 's newsletter which focused on major breakthroughs in NF re- search: ''the hope is that the day may come when doctors can flip critical switches to repair the broken circuits in each of these disorders and diseases. Such life-changing therapies will be the reward for years of enthusiastic basic research. '' I be- lieve, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, that with your continuedsupport, that day will soon be here. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER I would like to begin by thanking the members of this Subcommittee for their con- tinuous support of and tireless efforts to increase funding at the National Institutesof Health. You have all been leaders in helping to advance science to ensure thattoday 's discoveries translate into tomorrow 's treatments and cures for millions of Americans. Your leadership has also helped to ensure that America remains a lead-er in the field of medical research. The Wake Forest University Baptist MedicalCenter stands behind your goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutesof Health (NIH) by the year 2003. As you have stated so eloquently many times,Chairman Porter, there are more opportunities in basic and clinical research thanever before. And as we enter this century, we must provide the resources and in-470 vestments necessary to seize upon these opportunities. The medical center supports the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding 's fiscal year 2001 request of $20.5 billion for NIH. This $2.7 (15 percent) increase represents the third step toward ful-filling the bipartisan goal of doubling the NIH budget by fiscal year 2003. As the volume of NIH research increases, we must also recognize the need for up- graded, state-of-the-art facilities to carry out this federally-supported biomedical andbehavioral research. A 1998 National Science Foundation (NSF) study on the statusof scientific research facilities at U.S. colleges and universities identified an esti-mated $11.4 billion in deferred research construction and repair/renovation projects,as well as a decrease in new construction of health research facilities across anarray of institutions. Adequate laboratory space and research instrumentation arenecessary to obtain the best data from NIH research dollars. For this reason, I urgeyou to provide $250 million for extramural facilities construction at the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH) in your fiscal year 2001 bill. In addition to providing significant funding increases for NIH \u2014including in- creased funds for extramural research infrastructure \u2014I thank you for raising the salary cap imposed on extramural researchers from Executive Level III to ExecutiveLevel II ($141,000) in last year 's bill. The higher salary level will allow many insti- tutions to attract and retain the best investigators in their respective academic re-search programs. However, under the Senior Biomedical Research Service (SBRS)program on the NIH campus, the NIH can pay its senior investigators up to$151,000 \u2014roughly equal to what the salary cap on academic researchers would be if it were indexed for inflationary increases over the past decade. To seek a levelplaying field with intramural NIH researchers, I am seeking your support in raisingthe current salary cap to Executive Level I in the fiscal year 2001 bill. Over the past decade, several trends in the health care marketplace and fiscal stewardship of the public-private partnership have destabilized research institutionsand the pool of specially trained personnel necessary to continue to push the fron-tiers of medical research. For this reason, the medical center supports the proposalthat the NIH establish a Flexible Institutional Support for Health Research(FISHR) program. This peer-reviewed, three-year grant program will provide insti-tutional resources to meet evolving needs in research in the range of $25,000 to$300,000 a year for deans of medical, public health, nursing and dental schools. Wesuggest a funding level of $60 million in fiscal year 2001 for this competitive, renew-able pool of accountable resources which will help modify the impact of the recentstresses experienced by research and academic institutions and will serve to main-tain the integrity of our national research enterprise. There are many exciting initiatives under development and underway at the med- ical center. This year, we are seeking support from this Subcommittee to completetwo floors in the Center for Research on Human Nutrition and Chronic Disease Pre-vention facility to expand research in the area of prostate cancer and women 's health. Specifically, we are seeking $5 million in the Subcommittee 's fiscal year 2001 bill through the Health Resources and Services Administration 's Health Facili- ties Construction Program for this important project. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men. Nationally, one in nine men will, during theirlifetime, be affected with prostate cancer. Given the high incidence (28 percent),high prevalence (41 percent), and low mortality (7 percent) of prostate cancer, theneed for better diagnosis, prevention, treatment and supportive care is compelling.North Carolina and the Southeast have pockets of the highest incidence and mor-tality of prostate cancer in the country. Areas of South Carolina and eastern NorthCarolina have an exceedingly high incidence of the disease. One North Carolinianwill die from prostate cancer every 7.3 hours. Explanations of this high incidencehave included the typically Southern high fat diet as well as exposure to agricul-tural pesticides. These epidemiologic associations, however, are still inconclusiveand more research is needed. Further, strategies to prevent prostate cancer by alter-ing dietary habits or environmental exposures have been incompletely developed.African American men are particularly prone to prostate cancer for a number of rea-sons. Incidence of prostate cancer is higher in African Americans than in Cauca-sians and African Americans are diagnosed at later stages of the disease. The Com-prehensive Cancer Center at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center hasa long history of achievement in the area of minority population research as it re-lates to cancer, and this program will build on this strength. This program initiativewill integrate basic, clinical and population science research. In this decade, most women can expect to live 30 years or more beyond meno- pause. Several critical health issues and chronic conditions begin to emerge duringthis stage in a woman 's life, yet we are just beginning to examine and understand these conditions. This program will build upon the nationally-recognized work of in-471 vestigators at the Medical Center in the area of postmenopausal women. The Med- ical Center is already recognized as a world leader in research concerning the roleof hormone therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.The goal of this program is to establish a well-integrated primary clinical care pro-gram for women in their post-menopause years as well as expand the research inthis area. Developing and testing multiple models to understand the complex rela-tionship between estrogen and other estrogen-related products and various systemsin women will be a major focus of this program. Thank you, Chairman Specter for considering these important issues. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FDA-NIH C OUNCIL INTRODUCTION The FDA-NIH Council appreciates the opportunity to submit testimony con- cerning the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the world 's largest and most dis- tinguished organization dedicated to maintaining and improving health throughmedical science, and we consider investment in medical research to be our greatesthope for a healthy future. To that end, the FDA-NIH Council joins the medical re-search advocacy community, the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research, in supportingan appropriation of $20.47 billion for the NIH in fiscal year 2001, with the goal ofdoubling the Agency 's budget within five years. We believe that it is an important priority for the Congress to continue its commitment to double the budget of theNIH, and the Council is indebted to the Committee for keeping the NIH a prioritywithin the Congress. The FDA-NIH Council is a broad based coalition comprised of patient advocates, academic scientists, health professionals, and medical research-based corporations.These partners in the process of medical discovery and innovation have come to-gether to seek common ground in addressing the complex challenges and enhancingthe noble missions of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the NIH. Medical research and innovation aim to improve health and the quality of life by finding better ways of diagnosing and treating, and preventing and curing disease.Breakthroughs come from a process of innovation, each advance building upon theone that preceded it. From research in academic, government and industry labora-tories, and from the accumulation of clinical experience in managing disease, ourinformation about the mechanisms of disease and innovation in medicine are contin-ually developed. We welcome the opportunity to address the unique contributionsof the government in this regard as it is the national commitment to the NIH whichlays the foundation for our ability to bring research discoveries from the laboratoryto the patient. Together with its partners in medical discovery and innovation \u2014academia, bio- medical research industries, voluntary health foundations, health professionals andconsumers \u2014the work funded by the NIH and subsequent product development with its partners has jettisoned the United States into international preeminence in thisarea. All of the partners in the process of medical discovery are interdependent,each contributes a critical piece to the puzzle. The success of our national enterpriseis not possible without each piece remaining vibrant and strong. A healthy partner-ship between government, industry, academia and non-profit foundations is criticalto maintain the U.S. position as the world leader in medical research and innova-tion. Most importantly, the millions of Americans afflicted with catastrophic, acuteand chronic diseases are the REAL beneficiaries of this partnership. Breakthroughssuch as the development of antibiotics and organ transplantation, life-extending andlife-saving cancer therapies, the identification of the AIDS virus and the drugs totreat AIDS, have given the American public a glimpse into the potential offeredthrough the rapid advances in medical science. But, we must take these ''half-way '' technologies all the way to the finish line by continuing our strong funding commit-ments to research breakthroughs. The FDA-NIH Council supports the research themes advanced by the NIH, in- cluding: To Exploit Genomics by accelerating the human genome project; expanding work on model animal systems; learning to gather and use complex biological information;and building bioinformatics. To Reinvigorate Clinical Research by recruiting, training, and retaining clinical investigators; strengthening clinical research centers; supporting clinical trials, net-works, and databases; and developing partnerships with managed care organiza-tions, foundations, industries, and other Federal agencies.472 To Harness the Expertise of Allied Disciplines, such as chemistry, engineering, computer science, mathematics, optics, and physics in order to work with medicalscientists in, for example, designing new drugs; imaging molecules, chromosomes,cells, and organs; developing biomaterials; and analyzing bioinformatics and clinicaldata. To Reduce Health Disparities at Home and Abroad through research and training, testing interventions, and building international research capacity. We are now on the threshold of the next great revolution in modern medicine, gene therapy. With the identification of the genes responsible for a large numberof our normal functions and the genetic abnormalities that cause many diseases, wegain greater understanding into disease and keys to unlock the future of medicinalresearch. Each time researchers discover a gene, they open the door to a new ther-apy or cure. Today, when we talk about our medical research enterprise, we speakfrom the standpoint of great success and even greater opportunities. The health of our nation is dependent upon a strong national commitment to med- ical research. As we enter the new millennium, we have attracted some of the bestscientific minds to our national enterprise, and initiated ground-breaking programsthat have already yielded critical knowledge, and improved patient care and qualityof life. However, we are confronted with the extraordinary challenge of how to main-tain the integrity of our research efforts, and rapidly and cost-effectively translatethat research and development into use by health professionals and consumers, inboth the public and private sectors. The FDA-NIH Council would like to draw your attention to the growing capacity of our national research enterprise and the need to sustain its long term health asit undergoes the transformation required to meet the challenges of this century. \u2014Investigator-initiated Research. \u2014The support of basic medical research through competitive, peer-reviewed, and investigator-initiated research project grantscontinues to be among the highest of funding priorities. As new knowledge isdiscovered, it is vitally important for the NIH to support early patient-orientedresearch to determine the application of laboratory advances to persons withdisease. Further, training and educational programs require adequate resourcesto ensure that the next generation of clinical scientists is in place to continuethe rapid translation of research from the bench to the bedside. \u2014Eliminating Health Disparities. \u2014A key component to eliminate health dispari- ties among populations in the United States is medical research and researchtraining. We need to ensure that multidisciplinary collaborations take place tounderstand the causes of health disparities; develop new and improved preven-tion strategies, diagnostics, and treatments to reduce health disparities; and en-hance communication of research results to scientists, health professional, af-fected communities, and the public. \u2014Clinical Research. \u2014To take full advantage of rapid research advances, the NIH is planning to initiate new pilot and early-phase clinical trials, thereby speedingthe testing of new therapies. Further, the NIH has expanded the national clin-ical trials database, and made it more accessible to the public through theInternet (ClinicalTrials.gov). The early research conducted through the NIH isimperative prior to the maturation and full exploitation of advances in the mar-ketplace. \u2014Research Facilities. \u2014The sophistication of the research initiatives requires an ever-increasing sophistication in the physical plants and research laboratories.Research facilities, equipment and instrumentation, and animal facilities mustbe state-of-the-art in order to fully exploit our research potential. The FDA-NIH Council recognizes the inherent difficulties in terms of weighing the available resources and supporting numerous worthy federal programs. We rec-ognize and are extremely grateful for the support that this Committee has providedto the NIH in the past. However, we also believe that the functions of the NIH arevital to our economy as well as the health and welfare of our citizens and urge yoursupport for continued strong funding. The FDA-NIH Council thanks the Committee for the opportunity to submit testi- mony. We appreciate the support of this Committee. The members of the FDA-NIH Council are: the A-T 's Children Project; Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation; Allergy and Asthma Network \u2014Moth- of Asthmatics, Inc.; for Aging Research; Pfizer, Inc.; American Veteri-nary Medical Association; Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; Amer-ican Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; American Academy of Pediatrics; Na-tional Multiple on Alco-holism; Theracom; Parkinson 's Action Network; Academic Contract Research Orga-473 nization; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; Bermuda Biologi- cal Station for Research; and the Cancer Research Foundation of America. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR EYE AND VISION RESEARCH My name is Mike Veeck. I am the owner and operator of five professional baseball franchises. My daughter, Rebecca, has a blinding retinal degenerative disease calledcone-rod dystrophy. I appreciate the opportunity to present this written testimonyon behalf of the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research (NAEVR), an um-brella organization of thirty professional, lay advocacy and industry organizationsdedicated to expanding our national capacity to address eye and vision research op-portunities. I am an active member of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which isan active participant in the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. I would like to begin by thanking you, Chairman Specter, and members of this Subcommittee for your continuing commitment to medical research supported by theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Eye Institute (NEI). Mr.Chairman, you and your colleagues have been tremendously supportive of pushingthe frontiers through unprecedented support of the NIH. We know that you havemany difficult decisions with regard to funding priorities in your Appropriations Billand we appreciate the strong support that you have provided NIH. Without thissupport we would not be on the verge of many new treatment breakthroughs forblinding eye diseases. Due to the amazing advances in basic and clinical science, weare beginning to reap the benefits of our research investment. However, more andmore we are forced to prioritize what areas of research to support because we donot have the funding available to support all of the opportunities that exist. Thisis true in all areas of vision research, and in the public and private sectors. The written testimony that follows focuses on three specific issues:\u2014Fiscal year 2001 funding request for the NIH and NEI \u2014Scientific opportunities in eye and vision research \u2014Why eye and vision research is so important to me personally FISCAL YEAR 2001 FUNDING REQUEST The National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research urges your continued commit- ment to the campaign to double the budget for NIH by fiscal year 2003, referredto as the NIHx2 campaign. We strongly support the recommendation of the Ad HocGroup for Biomedical Research Funding calling for a $2.7 billion, or 15 percent, in-crease for NIH in fiscal year 2001, which is the level necessary to pursue a doublingof the NIH budget. Within the context of the NIH budget, the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research seeks your strong support for the NEI professional judgement budget call-ing for a 20 percent increase in fiscal year 2001. The priorities identified in thisbudget were a part of long range strategic plan, Vision Research \u2014A National Plan: 1999 -2003, in which the entire extramural research community participated. This funding level would provide $90.5 million above current year levels resulting in anNEI budget of $543 million in fiscal year 2001. This level of increase for eye andvision research is called for as a result of previous disparities which have disadvan-taged NEI in the NIH priority setting and funding allocation process. Historically,the NEI ranks among the lowest Institutes relative to the percentage increase infunding provided by the Congress. As you know Mr. Chairman, the professional judgement budget reflects the fund- ing necessary to continue ongoing research initiatives and pursue new scientific op-portunities that have resulted from the nation 's investment in eye and vision re- search. I would like to discuss some of the exciting research opportunities that willbe pursued with this level of investment to assure you that an investment in eyeand vision research will be a wise and cost-effective investment. SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITIES IN EYE AND VISION RESEARCH Neurodegeneration Research. \u2014Research on neurodegeneration and the rescue and regeneration of neural cells is an area of tremendous opportunity with applicationto many neurological diseases and conditions, and to cases of traumatic injury, in-cluding: \u2014Rescue of Photoreceptor Cells in Retinal Degenerative Diseases diseases such as macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and Ushersyndrome affect more than six million Americans of every age and race. NEIfunded scientists have already developed several promising experimental treat-ments for preventing or dramatically slowing vision loss from these blinding dis-474 eases. Pharmaceutical and neurotrophic agents, retinal cell transplantation, and molecular and genetic technologies have shown therapeutic value in laboratoryanimals. Further laboratory research is needed to advance these promisingtherapies to clinical trials. \u2014Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells in Glaucoma .\u2014Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can be studied in culture conditions, providing a special opportunity for inves-tigating signaling mechanisms that normally promote survival and how thesemechanisms are altered by injury. Protection of Nerve Cells in Glaucoma .\u2014Researchers have found elevated levels of nitric oxide synthase in the optic nerve heads from human eyes with glaucomaand animal models of glaucoma. By pharmacologically inhibiting the production ofnitric oxide in these animals, scientists found that axons of the optic nerve were pro-tected from neurodegeneration. Resources for Research on the Visual System .\u2014In order to better understand the molecular and genetic basis for inherited diseases of the eye, it is essential that re-search be conducted to identify and sequence genes that are expressed in the visualsystem and to identify disease-causing genetic mutations. There are a number of re-search projects, which could be pursued more aggressively with additional NEIfunding. This genetic information will be collected from ocular tissues that arequalitatively and quantitatively representative of the genes expressed in the visualsystem and optimized to detect rare or unique sequences. It is anticipated that thiscatalogue of genes expressed in the visual system will be publicly available in aneasily accessible and retrievable format to facilitate research on eye diseases withthe goal of improving treatment or preventing their occurrence. Control of Angiogenesis. \u2014Diseases that affect retinal blood vessels are among the major causes of visual disability and blindness in this country. These include dia-betic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, neovascular glaucoma, and age-re-lated macular in which the proliferation of abnormal new blood vesselscan result in the rapid and irreversible loss of vision. Scientists have discovered thatinhibitors of certain growth factors and enzymes are ideal candidates for the treat-ment of these diseases. Bioengineering and Advanced Instrumentation. \u2014NEI is pursuing the development of advanced assistive devices for the visually impaired, adaptive optics and other im-aging techniques to improve non-invasive examination of ocular tissues for both re-search and disease diagnosis, instruments to analyze the biomechanics of the eye,and instruments to analyze visual performance. NEI is continuing research on thefurther development of laser-targeted dye delivery systems which could revolu-tionize the visualization of blood vessels in the retina and the treatment of eye dis-orders; and optical coherence tomography and confocal scanning laser polarimetryfor quantitative measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Clinical Research and Health Disparities. \u2014Research in this area will enhance our understanding of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and myopia incorporating studiesof comorbidity, natural history, and genetics with special emphasis on populationsat increased risk. For example, rates of blindness from glaucoma are six times high-er in African-Americans than in Caucasians, however age-related macular degenera-tion is rare for African-Americans as compared to Caucasians. Low Vision .\u2014A related area of concern is low vision, or vision impairment which is not correctable by glasses or contact lenses. As many as 12 million Americans suf-fer from visual impairments which affect their ability to read, drive, work, and per-form many everyday activities we all take for granted. The most common eye dis-eases that cause visual impairment in adults are AMD, cataract, glaucoma, diabeticretinopathy, and optic nerve atrophy. Even more serious are eye diseases that causevisual impairment in children. These include certain forms of retinitis pigmentosa,Stargardt and Best disease, retinopathy of prematurity, cortical visual impairment,and coloboma. Low vision in children often affects their development and results inthe need for special education, vocational training, and social services throughouttheir lives. The cost of these impairments is more than $22 billion each year. Under the auspices of the National Eye Health Education Program (NEHEP), NEI has developed and is initiating a program directed at low vision in order to increasepublic awareness about visual impairment and the impact it has on everyday life.The Low Vision Traveling Exhibit will be displayed in shopping malls around thecountry during the next five years and was recently launched in Birmingham, Ala-bama. The program provides information about low vision services and the devices,which are currently available to assist those with visual impairments. This effortis directed at those suffering from visual impairments and also to medical profes-sionals, eye care specialists, managed care organizations, and family members.NAEVR supports this public education partnership and urges the Committee to sup-port it as well.475 MY PERSONAL INTEREST IN EYE AND VISION RESEARCH Mr. Chairman, I am in a race against time. Each day, my eight-year old daughter, Rebecca, loses more of her vision to a blinding retinal degenerative disease called cone-rod dystrophy. Retinal degenerative diseases are slowly robbing the vision ofmore than six million Americans of every age and race. Vision researchers workingin NEI funded laboratories across the country have already developed several prom-ising therapies that dramatically slow vision loss in animal models. Although mywife, Libby, and I are excited about this progress, we also live in fear that sight-saving treatments won 't happen fast enough. With increased support for the NIH and NEI, we can speed these experimental treatments to clinical trials while my Re-becca can still see. Conclusion .\u2014Mr. Chairman, the members of the National Alliance for Eye and Vi- sion Research are supportive of an increased research focus on eye and vision dis-orders, such as those outlined above, and hope that the Committee will allocate a20 percent budget increase to the NEI to allow these critically important researchefforts to continue and expand. As we enter the 21st Century, we must ensure thatwe are doing our best to find ways to prevent and treat eye and vision disorders,and are providing quality eye care services and devices for those who are alreadysuffering from visual impairment. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, the American Society of Trop- ical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) is pleased to have the opportunity to presentits views on fiscal year 2001 funding priorities to the Subcommittee. The ASTMH,founded in 1903, is a professional society of approximately 3,500 researchers andpractitioners who are dedicated to addressing the growing global threat of tropicalinfectious diseases. The collective expertise of our members is in the areas of basicmolecular science, medicine, vector control, epidemiology, and public health.ASTMH is the principal voice for tropical medicine research within this country. The staggering burden of tropical and infectious diseases and the impact on global health confronts us on a daily basis. Poor health and the spread of infectious diseaseacross borders has profound impacts on the social and economic development andstability of nations around the globe. With the enormous volume of travel and tradetoday, and with the expanded deployment of American troops, infectious diseasescan impact populations around the globe within 24 hours. The globalization of infec-tious disease has brought an increased realization that infectious diseases representnot only a humanitarian concern but also a bona fide threat to the health and na-tional security of the United States. In June 1996, President Clinton issued a Presidential Decision Directive calling for a more focused U.S. policy on infectious disease. The State Department 's Stra- tegic Plan for International Affairs lists protecting human health and reducing thespread of infectious diseases as U.S. strategic goals, and Secretary Albright in De-cember 1999 announced the second of two major U.S. initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS. The unprecedented UN Security Council session devoted exclusively to thethreat to Africa from HIV/AIDS in January 2000 is a measure of the internationalcommunity 's concern about the infectious disease threat. Furthermore, the CIA 's National Intelligence Council issued a hard-hitting report this past January entitled ''The Global Infectious Disease Threat and Its Implica- tions for the United States. '' The report concludes that infectious diseases are likely to account for more military hospital admissions than battlefield injuries. The reportassesses the global threat of infectious disease, stating ''New and reemerging infec- tious diseases will pose a rising global health threat and will complicate U.S. andglobal security over the next 20 years. These diseases will endanger U.S. citizensat home and abroad, threaten U.S. armed forces deployed overseas, and exacerbatesocial and political instability in key countries and regions in which the UnitedStates has significant interests. '' Now more than ever, we must continue to be vigilant in our efforts to control and eradicate infectious diseases through prevention, treatment, and continued surveil-lance. As we enter the 21st century, we must marshal the efforts of government,industry, international organizations and private foundations if we are to protectour national security against biological and chemical attacks and protect Americansagainst infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance.476 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH Mr. Chairman, the Society thanks you and members of the Subcommittee for your strong leadership in the area of biomedical research and for pursuing budget in-creases that will effectively double the NIH budget by fiscal year 2003. As a resultof the 15 percent increase provided to the NIH in fiscal year 2000, new scientificand research opportunities are being pursued that hold the potential to prevent andcontrol tropical and infectious diseases around the world. Your actions reflect theextraordinary importance of biomedical research to our national interest and arealso helping to attract growing numbers of young scientists to the fields of academiaand basic and clinical research. The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene requests your continued support for the NIHx2 campaign by providing a $2.7 billion, or 15 percent, increasefor NIH in fiscal year 2001 as advocated by the Ad Hoc Group for Biomedical Re-search Funding. An appropriation of $20.5 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2001 willallow promising research avenues to be pursued, including the development of newvaccines and treatments for diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, cholera, diar-rheal diseases, HIV/AIDS, and a myriad of other viral bacterial, fungal and parasiticdisease agents. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES The NIH 's tropical disease research program is funded primarily by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and there are several importanton-going issues relating to NIAID 's research efforts that we would like to highlight. Malaria. \u2014Globally, infectious diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for 1 -3 times the mortality and morbidity resulting from heart disease, cancer and stroke combined. Of these infectious diseases, malaria continuesto be the most devastating with a World Health Organization estimate of nearly 500million clinical cases and up to 2.7 million deaths annually. Every 30 seconds achild somewhere dies of malaria. Even in the U.S., over 1,000 cases of malaria arereported every year, with local transmission being documented by the Center forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Society commends the NIH and NIAID for their continued leadership and focus on malaria. We strongly support the NIAID research agenda which has mademalaria vaccine development a high priority and has involved collaborative researchefforts with private sector partners, including the Malaria Vaccine Initiative. Weurge the Subcommittee to strongly support these efforts. Malaria is a complex dis-ease and its control will require a significant research effort in therapeutics as wellas in vaccine development for improved disease treatment. We encourage an equallyvigorous effort in development of new antimalarial drugs. Tropical Medicine Research Centers. \u2014The three centers overseas are most impor- tant in facilitating the NIAID 's international tropical infectious disease research col- laborations in areas endemic for these diseases. The research in the center is carried out in the endemic area by U.S. and local scientists. These centers are critical forthe advancement of our scientific understanding and preparedness for emerging, re-emerging and other tropical infectious disease threats. The awarding of these cen-ters is highly competitive. The Society strongly urges that the Subcommittee expressits continued support for these unique research opportunities. Challenge Grants. \u2014The Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene would like to thank the Subcommittee for its support of the new NIH Challenge Grants that werefunded through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund in fiscalyear 2000. This initiative was created to promote collaborative research and devel-opment efforts between NIH, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device in-dustries to reduce the impact of infectious disease both nationally and worldwide.This unique investment in research and development will facilitate greater industryparticipation in the global effort to combat tropical and infectious diseases while atthe same time leveraging private sector resources through the program 's dollar for dollar matching requirement. The Society is pleased to note that NIAID has identi-fied priority areas where the agency believes successful product research and devel-opment efforts could make a significant impact. The areas identified are malaria,tuberculosis, influenza, and emerging and resistant infections. The Society stronglyurges the Subcommittee to provide continued support for the NIH Challenge Grantprogram in fiscal year 2001. The Society commends Congress for its leadership in combating infectious disease and encourages this Subcommittee to work with your colleagues and the Adminis-tration to create additional incentives that encourage public-private partnerships inthe battle against tropical infectious diseases. We strongly endorse efforts such asthe President 's Millennium Vaccine Initiative and legislation pending in the House477 and Senate that provide a catalyst for research, development and production of vac- cines and drugs, and make these products accessible in developing countries hard-est-hit by infectious disease. If we hope to win the war against new and re-emergingtropical and infectious disease we must engage the collective resources of the privateand public sector \u2014both at home and abroad \u2014in order get infectious disease under control until we can effectively conquer and prevent it. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER The Fogarty International Center (FIC) is a unique component of NIH with a mandate to support training in biomedical research on behalf of the developing na-tions of the world. The ASTMH wishes to acknowledge the significant contributionsof the FIC in overall support of tropical disease research of direct vital importanceto American travelers, servicemen, missionaries, Peace Corps volunteers, and for-eign service officers, among others. Less obvious are the indirect benefits of trainingin tropical disease research for our foreign biomedical counterparts. The Society supports the continued focus by the FIC to establish appropriate eth- ical standards relevant to internationally-based research. A delicate balance mustbe achieved between the need to facilitate vaccine and drug development and the testing of new products on human subjects in developing countries. The Society ispleased that the FIC has identified ethical principles and practice in patient-ori-ented research as one of four priorities it pursues in establishing research capabili-ties in developing nations. The Society encourages the Subcommittee to be sup-portive of FIC collaborations with its counterparts abroad and with international or-ganizations in the pursuit of a broad ethic to be applied to internationally-based re-search initiatives. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) The ASTMH appreciates the Subcommittee 's past support for the CDC 's infectious diseases program and requests your support for at least the President 's fiscal year 2001 request of $202 million for these critically important public health initiativesIncreased funding will help support the development of a national electronic diseasesurveillance network that will enable State and local health departments to respondto infectious disease outbreaks and share information about infectious disease emer-gencies and trends. The President 's funding request will also increase the invest- ment in the CDC 's Food Safety Initiative, expanding the ability to more rapidly identify and track disease-causing bacteria including E. coli and Salmonella, andShigella Sonnei, and provide for the implementation of a national prevention andcontrol plan for hepatitis C. CONCLUSION As we enter the 21st Century, we must aggressively pursue the battle against tropical and infectious diseases, that undoubtedly will intensify in the years ahead.We must have adequate surveillance systems and modern infrastructure, coupledwith scientific expertise in both basic and clinical research, if we are to develop thetools necessary to rapidly respond to, and control, the threats posed by tropical in-fectious diseases. The Society greatly appreciates your support for our nation 's investment in infec- tious disease research, control, and prevention activities. We urge you to continueyour efforts to double the NIH budget over the next five years and towards this endwe request a 15 percent increase for the NIH budget in fiscal year 2001. We alsorequest that the Subcommittee support the Administration 's proposed increase of $26 million for the CDC 's infectious disease activities. The Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene appreciates the opportunity to ex- press our views and for your consideration of these requests. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SOCIETY OF TOXICOLOGY The Society of Toxicology is pleased to have this opportunity to present its views concerning research in toxicological sciences and its strong support for the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH), and specifically for the National Institute of Environ-mental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The Society of Toxicology is a professional organization that brings together over 5,000 toxicologists in academia, industry, and government. The Society of Toxicologyis dedicated to supporting research in toxicological sciences that leads to sound sci-entific information that can be employed to reduce uncertainties in assessing risksto human health and the environment. Enhancing science-based risk assessment478 benefits everyone through improved decision-making that protects the health of peo- ple and their environment while at the same time providing for a more rational useof our limited financial resources, i.e., a win-win situation. FUNDING REQUEST First, the Society of Toxicology would like to thank you, Chairman Specter, and thank your colleagues on this Subcommittee for demonstrating tremendous leader-ship in the area of biomedical research by providing a 15 percent increase to theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) in both fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Your com-mitment to the campaign to double the budget for NIH by fiscal year 2003 providesgreat hope to Americans afflicted with disease and disabling conditions and ensuresthat we will continue to unlock the mystery of disease, including diseases that maybe attributable to causal agents in the environment. Mr. Chairman, the Society of Toxicology strongly supports you in this goal and urges that you continue the NIHx2 campaign in fiscal year 2001. We urge the Sub-committee to support the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group for Biomedical Re-search Funding calling for a $2.7 billion, or 15 percent, increase for NIH in fiscalyear 2001. We also urge the Subcommittee to support the professional judgementbudget recommended by the NIEHS calling for a 19 percent increase in fiscal year2001, given its important role in increasing our understanding of how the environ-ment potentially affects our health. Whether it is exploring asthma incidence in chil-dren, testing for the toxic potential of chemicals, or better understanding the genet- ics underlying environmental risk factors, NIEHS supported research is leading theway in bridging the gap between public policy and environmental health science. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES Basic research focused on discerning the mechanism or mode of action of a par- ticular agent of interest is of fundamental importance to society. It provides thebasis on which we make reasonable estimates as to whether or not harm mightoccur to people or the environment under realistic conditions of exposure. Further-more, as we explore mechanisms by which chemical and physical agents mayproduce toxicity we learn more about basic biology; thus, toxicology is one of thebasic biomedical sciences. The quality of life in our Country has improved markedly over the past century. For example, life span was approximately 45 in 1900 and today it is 75 years. Indeed, much of the good life that many of us enjoy is attributable directly to theproper use of chemicals, including medicines, to benefit people. Research in toxi-cology, including the use of animals, has and continues to play a key role by defin-ing the conditions of use under which we may employ chemicals for good causes thatbenefit society. Yes, there have been some problems/mistakes made; however, impor-tantly, we are striving to improve and research focused upon the key aspects of riskassessment (outlined below) will permit us to continue to make progress. The scientific basis of risk assessment can be enhanced by the development of im- proved test systems and improved means for interpretation of results. Key aspectsof any risk assessment include an emphasis on: (1) selection of doses used for test-ing and extrapolation, e.g., there should not be an emphasis on the use of excessivedoses; (2) dose-response relationships, including extrapolation from high to lowdoses, e.g., effects that occur at high doses do not necessarily occur at low doses;(3) species-to-species extrapolation; and (4) exposure assessment, e.g., we need totake into consideration the relationship between doses used in testing as comparedto the amounts that people might actually encounter. It is important to define condi-tions under which chemicals may be used, beneficially with a high degree of safety,and to identify those situations when a chemical 's use should either be restricted severely or it should be banned. This entails hypothesis-driven research and it isconsistent with the notion that it is the dose which makes the poison. Members ofthe Society of Toxicology believe strongly that our investment in biomedical researchmust be increased and sustained over the long-term if we are going to take advan-tage of the many exciting research opportunities that exist in environmental healthsciences. We support the research agenda and priorities identified by NIEHS Direc-tor Dr. Kenneth Olden. These can further the development of the science that isnecessary to provide a basis for sound decisions leading to both improved protectionof human health and the environment. NIEHS research on the Environmental Genome Project will help us to better un- derstand why some people might be more susceptible to environmental exposuresleading to disease development than others. This area of risk assessment is onewhich we know the least about. In this context, it is important to understand thatexposure assessment, as noted above, is a key aspect of risk assessment. In order479 to be credible, a risk assessment must be based upon realistic data concerning expo- sure. The Society of Toxicology commends NIEHS for its planned interagency col-laboration with the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the En-vironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to improve the technological sophistication ofexposure assessment and the use of exposure assessment in developing disease pre-vention strategies. The Society of Toxicology supports the partnership between the NIEHS and the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a national network of Children 's En- vironmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Programs to study children 's health issues that might be linked to the environment, such as pediatric asthmaand other respiratory diseases. These illnesses have lifelong adverse health implica- tions for children and consume substantial health care dollars. Furthermore, basicresearch is required in order to learn whether or not there is a difference in thesusceptibility of children as compared to adults with regard to the toxic potentialof particular chemicals. A strong investment in NIEHS will continue the study of the potential adverse effects of chemicals that might be able to disregulate endocrine activity. It is impor-tant to ascertain whether or not these compounds, often referred to as endocrinedisrupters, actually contribute to human disease at the levels they are found in theenvironment. The Society is especially pleased that NIEHS is moving forward witha number of studies to examine the possible linkage between exposure to allegedendocrine disregulating chemicals and disorders affecting both male and female re-productive health. We applaud the NIEHS for spearheading the NIH research effort in collaboration with the FDA and industry and academia, to develop biomarkers for the efficacyand safety of new drugs. It is imperative that promising therapeutics move from thelaboratory to the patient in a more timely manner with a high level of assuranceconcerning their efficacy and safety. You can be sure that the Society of Toxicologywill continue to promote this important research collaboration. Under Dr. Olden 's direction, NIEHS has taken a leadership role with regard to encouraging partner-ships involving government, academia and industry to work on environmentalhealth-related issues. NIEHS continues to play an important role in the multi-agency effort to identify the research needs on the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines. Of the approxi-mate 2,000 herbal products in use, only a few have been adequately tested for effi-cacy and toxic potential. As the use of these alternative therapies becomes morewidespread, there is the need for scientifically valid information about both the ben-efits and risks of their use. SUPERFUND HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM The Society of Toxicology also wants to express its strong support for the Super- fund Hazardous Substances Basic Research Program. This program is administeredby NIEHS although it is funded through a pass through from the EPA to NIEHS.The Superfund Hazardous Substances Basic Research Program is the only scientificresearch program focused on health and cleanup issues for Superfund hazardouswaste sites. It represents an important collaboration between EPA and NIEHS, andit should ensure that environmental cleanup decisions are based on sound environ-mental health science. The Superfund Hazardous Substances Basic Research Program supports univer- sity and medical school research to understand the public health consequences oflocal hazardous waste sites, as well as to develop better methods for remediation.It is important to note that this is the only university-based research program thatbrings together biomedical and engineering scientists to provide the science andtechnology base needed for making accurate assessments of human health risks anddeveloping cost-effective cleanup technologies. The primary purpose of Superfund Hazardous Substances Basic Research Pro- gram is to provide the scientific basis needed to make accurate assessments of thehuman health risks at hazardous waste sites. In addition, research data is used todetermine which contaminated sites must be cleaned up first, to what extent cleanup is needed, and how best to clean up contaminated sites in the most cost-effectivemanner. The Society of Toxicology is disappointed that the President 's budget re- quest reduces funding for this important program by $11.5 million. We hope Con-gress will consider restoring funding for this program to its fiscal year 2000 levelof $60 million. We understand that this funding matter is not under the jurisdictionof this Subcommittee. With that said, we urge the Members of the Subcommitteeto engage in the necessary discussions with the VA -HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure that these resources are continued.480 CONCLUSION Once again, thank you for continued leadership in the area of biomedical research and for considering the funding priorities outlined above. The Society of Toxicologylooks forward to working with you to continue the campaign Congress initiated twoyears ago to double the NIH budget by 2003, and to continue the pursuit of themany promising research opportunities at hand as a result of the nation 's invest- ment in biomedical research. Under Dr. Olden 's leadership, the NIEHS is taking a leadership role with regard to enhancing the scientific basis that is necessary inorder to make better decisions concerning our environment. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN LOUIS STOKES Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I respectfully submit the fol- lowing testimony on my own behalf. As a former member of the House Sub-committee for Labor-HHS, I am so very proud of the work this Subcommittee andits House counterpart has accomplished in providing the vision and the leadershipthat has led to tremendous strides in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment ofdisease and disabling conditions and has greatly enhanced the quality of educationand training opportunities for all Americans. As you know, while serving in theHouse I shared your interest in developing programs and strategies to protect thosemost vulnerable in our society. I am continuing to pursue this interest by servingas a member of The Pew Environmental Health Commission. This Commission isan independent panel of representatives from the health field, industry, govern-ment, academia and the nonprofit community. Launched in May 1999, and chairedby my colleague, former three-term senator and governor of Connecticut, LowellWeicker, Jr., the Commission 's charge is to provide leadership, vision, and visibility for strengthening the country 's defenses against environmental threats. My interest and passion for these issues brings me here today to discuss opportu- nities for this Subcommittee to once again exercise leadership by strengthening thefederal investment in our public health infrastructure. I submit to you that if ournation 's best and brightest researchers and public health officials had the tools nec- essary to develop meaningful disease prevention strategies, we would witness ex-traordinary achievements in health outcomes and in reducing the nation 's health care costs. For more than a quarter century, we have made enormous strides in protecting our air and water quality and preserving areas of natural beauty and biological di-versity essential to a healthy environment. Last month, Governor Ryan from thestate of Illinois awarded over $950,000 to plug 148 abandoned oil and gas wells inClinton and Lawrence counties and to clean up and restore a waste crude oil sitein Saline County. The state of New York is successfully restoring the Hudson River,and California is doing a tremendous job of revitalizing its brownfields. Despite theprogress made in cleaning up and preserving the environment around the country,we have lost our focus on protecting our children from health hazards arising fromexposure to environmental contaminants. The Pew Environmental Health Commission is issuing a series of reports on chil- dren 's health, including a report on birth defects which was released this past No- vember and a report on childhood asthma which will be released later this Spring.As part of the birth defects report, entitled Healthy from the Start: Why AmericaNeeds a Better System to Track and Understand Birth Defects and the Environ-ment, the Commission has called for a national approach for monitoring exposureslinked to the environment and building the capacities and strategies for monitoringand evaluating chronic disease. Birth defects are the nation 's leading cause of infant death in the United States, resulting in approximately 6,500 deaths annually. However, a major analysis of na-tional data on birth defects and the environment has found unexplained increasesin certain birth defects and related conditions that point to the need for strength-ening the public health system. Even though birth defects are the nation 's leading cause of infant death, one-third of the states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico\u2014with a total population of nearly 59 million \u2014fail to track birth defects, and 25 more states have systems that need improvement. Without this data, publichealth officials are literally working in the dark. This makes it much more difficultto identify emerging disease clusters and tackle environmental threats that maycause sickness and death in our children. As many of you know, I took an active role in mitigating the effects of lead and protecting the health of Americans from lead exposure during my service in Con-gress. Congressional intervention, coupled with the efforts of CDC, EPA, and other481 private and public partners, has resulted in the reduction of the percentage of chil- dren in the U.S. with elevated blood lead levels from 88.2 percent in the late 1970 's to 4.4 percent in the early 1990 's. This is a prime example of how having good public health data can significantly improve our environmental decision-making process. When the EPA decided to phase out lead in gasoline in 1973, Congress received considerable pressure to reverse the regulation. While lead was a well-knownneurotoxin, with children being most vulnerable to permanent neurological damage,it had been widely used in gasoline to prevent engine ''knocking. '' EPA 's theoretical models suggested that a ban on lead would result in only minimal changes inhuman lead levels, but health data from the CDC saved the day by showing dra-matic decreases in human lead levels, persuading Congress that EPA 's restrictions on leaded gas were appropriate. Unfortunately, CDC does not routinely monitor thelevel of dangerous pollutants in the American population despite important past les-sons during the great debate over leaded gasoline. If there is no significant changein our data collection system, we will be apt to make many costly mistakes. We have just been reminded of such a mistake with another fuel additive, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, or commonly referred to as ''MTBE. '' The federal Clean Air Act Amendment requires MTBE to be used for reformulated gasoline in an effortto reduce air pollution. Shortly after the beginning of its widespread use in the gasoline supply, commu- nities around the country began complaining about health problems \u2014including headaches, eye, nose, and throat irritation, nausea, and disorientation \u2014linked to MTBE. Yet before its widespread use we never investigated nor gave the money toCDC to track Americans ' exposure to this chemical \u2014despite having the technology. Since then, CDC has been given limited funding to study levels of MTBE in hu-mans, but at this point \u2014despite the numerous complaints and public outcry \u2014popu- lation exposure to this compound cannot be evaluated. We have not paid appropriateattention to the health problems. Instead, we waited until leaks in storage tanksled to contaminated water supplies. If we had focused on health, we could be savingourselves millions of dollars in clean up. This was a lesson learned from lead. This is why we need a modern public health system that readily tracks the health of Americans. In order to develop ways of testing whether people have been exposedto hundreds of carcinogens and toxic substances, we need an increase in environ-mental health funds. The President 's budget request for the CDC 's National Center for Environmental Health would more than double the $10 million given to the Fed-eral Government in fiscal year 2000, and would enable the CDC to move towardmonitoring human exposures to more than 100 potentially toxic substances, up fromthe current 25. This is a positive first step, but it is just a start. The Pew Environmental Health Commission recommends a broader national ap- proach to biomonitoring that will encompass tracking all environmental health haz-ards that science suggests have a linkage to chronic and infectious diseases. It is estimated that the cost, about $275 million, or $1 for every man, woman, and childin America, would develop the monitoring capacity to identify and protect againstagents in the environment that pose great risk to the public 's health. This is a mod- est price to pay to prevent the many chronic and infectious disease killers whichscience suggests are linked to environmental causes and extract billions of dollarsin health care costs each year. A $275 million investment in the CDC 's National Center for Environmental Health will put real teeth into our nation 's effort to pro- tect the public from environmental hazards and preventable disease. Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, I know you realize the time has come to renew our investment in a public health system that will prevent the chron-ic diseases and disabilities that afflict millions of Americans. While medical sciencehas advanced to conquer many infectious and chronic diseases, preventing chronicillness through public health programs has failed to keep pace. As you know, the President has also proposed to provide a $20 million increase to the CDC 's emerging infectious disease program to develop a national electronic disease surveillance network to assist local and state public health officials in re-sponding to disease outbreaks. Again this is a start, however it too represents apiecemeal approach. The President 's plan does not seize on the opportunity to pro- vide a comprehensive, integrated strategy to the public health burden of chronic andinfectious disease. While infectious disease remains important, chronic disease is now the no. 1 kill- er, responsible for three of every four deaths in the U.S. annually \u2014about 1.8 million Americans \u2014and a yearly economic cost of $325 billion. And the numbers are rising! I am, by no means, suggesting that infectious disease is not important. But whileit is important to remain vigilant in protecting against infectious disease, we shouldalso focus on causes and prevention of chronic disease and disability. These health482 problems might be preventable if only we knew more about the complex interactions among the social, biological and environmental factors that affect us. In 1995, health studies estimated that of the 30 years added to Americans ' life expectancy since 1900, only five years on average are due to improvements in clin-ical medicine. The majority, 25 years, are attributable to public health programs.The steepest decline in mortality resulted from improvements to environmental con-ditions that prevented the spread of infectious disease, such as treatment of drink-ing water and removal of wastes, and better nutrition and food handling practices. When it comes to resources, our nation rightly spends billions of dollars to mon- itor the impact of the environment on plants and animals. However, as a nation,we do little to monitor the impact of the environment on our public health. At the turn of the 20th century, our nation faced the tremendous challenge of in- fectious disease by marshaling the resolve and the resources to conquer these kill-ers. Now at the turn of the 21st century, it is chronic diseases \u2014such as birth de- fects, asthma, and cancer \u2014that are taking an immense toll on our public health. Our country needs to have a strong public health system. I am asking you to joinme in supporting the following: \u2014An investment of $275 million for a comprehensive national biomonitoring pro- gram that will alert us to hazards in our communities that pose serious, butpreventable, health risks. \u2014A renewed commitment to the public health infrastructure that mirrors the strength of our national commitment to biomedical research. It is time for CDC to step up as a leader in disease prevention. It is with your help that we can make the investment to get them there. We must rise to this chal-lenge by utilizing the best research, treatment, and tracking tools to win the waragainst health threats and disease that cause enormous human pain and suffering. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE KENNEDY KRIEGER INSTITUTE Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to sub- mit testimony for your consideration in the fiscal year 2001 budget for programsunder your committee jurisdiction. THE KENNEDY KRIEGER INSTITUTE The Kennedy Krieger Institute is an independent research institution located ad- jacent to Johns Hopkins University. The mission of the Institute is to focus solelyon disorders related to the brain and central nervous system. Brain related dis-orders effect one in four adults and one in ten children at a cost to society of $400billion per year. The overall goal of research at the Kennedy Krieger Institute isto understand the developing central nervous system through the study of relation-ships between genes, the brain and human behavior. While the Institute has specialexpertise with regard to children, the research scope includes studies of changes inthe brain and the CNS across the lifespan. Our Institute integrates cutting edgeneurobiological research efforts into a comprehensive program which includes inpa-tient and day treatment services; outpatient services; home and community services;and school programs for children with disorders of the brain. The Institute is well-known for its strong interdisciplinary research and care in many fields includingmedicine, psychology, education, physical and occupational therapy, audiology,speech and language therapy, social work, child development, nutrition and nursing.In our statement to the Committee, we will highlight the efforts of three federalagencies under your jurisdiction and the important work that they do to strengthenthe capacity of Institute 's, such as ours, to make progress in this important area. BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH We are currently experiencing an unprecedented appreciation of the benefits to health and life quality that can result from biomedical and behavioral research. Ofparticular note is the most welcome present and predicted increase in public sectorfunding for basic research and the dramatic, if not explosive, private sector invest-ment in biology. With such appreciation and tangible support comes the responsi-bility to organize the scientific enterprise so as to produce effective interventions.And, our challenges are many. Many children with developmental disabilities and neurological diseases display severe behavior problems. The mission of our basic and clinical research, clinicalcare and educational programs is to improve the quality of life for these childrenand their families through a variety of mechanisms including: providing advanced483 and comprehensive treatment services; promoting the widespread dissemination of effective interventions; and improving treatment technologies through basic andclinical research. With that said, we support treatment and research initiatives in-cluding but not limited to behavior programs, pediatric feeding disorders,neuroimaging, basic and clinical research efforts and training. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke support a number of im-portant initiatives with regard to brain biology; neurobehavioral assessment andprotocol development; translation studies related to cognition pathways of learningdisorders from a developmental perspective; molecular sciences to further under-stand the molecular basis of many developmental disabilities; brain mapping; and other basic and clinical programs which are at the core of the programs conductedat the Kennedy Krieger Institute. Further, the National Center for Research Re-sources (NCRR) supports important neuroimaging studies for neuroscience, meta-bolic and other research. We have support from the NCRR for our General ClinicalResearch Center (GCRC) in which we are conducting studies related to functionalimaging. We believe it is important for the Committee to consider an NIH NationalImaging Network for Clinical Research which will enable NCRR to provide the re-sources to create links between the GCRC to the imaging center. This sort of infra-structure would be vitally important to facilitate and integrate research networks. We are very excited regarding planning underway at the NICHD with regard to pediatric trauma. While injuries and violence are, respectively, the first and thirdmost frequent causes of death in children 5 to 18, many clinical treatments are tai-lored to the adult population. NICHD is planning a multi-disciplinary, collaborativeprograms under the egis of its National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research.This program will enable the development and assessment of therapies specificallytargeted to the physical, emotional and social needs of children through a series ofbasic and clinical research initiatives. Mr. Chairman, this initiative marks the firstsuch federally-funded program of its kind. The NICHD should be applauded for itsefforts in this regard. We urge the Committee to continue its efforts in support of the NIH. The Ken- nedy Krieger Institute endorses the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group for Med-ical Research Funding for fiscal year 2001 which recommends a 15 percent increaseto double the budget of the NIH by 2003. EDUCATION Our approach to severe behavioral problems in many children with developmental disabilities and severe behavior problems is multi-focused. The Severe Behavior Pro-gram provides comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, parent training and schoolconsultative services. The linkage to the child 's school and school district is impera- tive to develop and effectively implement effective strategies to deal with the behav-ioral problems many of our patients present with. This initiative is complementedby inpatient and outpatient behavioral management services for children who dis-play severe destruction behavior. The Institute 's Lower and Middle Schools, recipients of the U.S. Department of Education 's National Blue Ribbon Awards in 1996 and 1997, respectively, are recog- nized models in special education. Their track record includes: innovative models ofeducation based upon current scientific understanding of brain functioning; creativeintegration of technology in the classroom; comprehensive curriculum tailored tounique needs of the student; and training in the field of special education. We arein the process of opening a high school which will serve as a national model of acomprehensive approach to school-to-work transition for youth with serious learn-ing, emotional, neurological, and developmental disabilities. Our high school has aschool-to-work curriculum. The Career and Technology High School is unique inthat it will be the only program in the area to make career training the foundationof, and not merely a supplement to, the school 's core curriculum. Drawing on the most current educational, work-readiness, and industry standards, the high schoolstaff develop partnerships with business and community groups to develop a state-of-the-art model that will result in economically and personally rewarding employ-ment for youth with disabilities. The Career and Technology High School will takestudents challenged by severe learning, emotional, traumatic brain injury, and de-velopmental disabilities and provide a school-to-work instructional model that ad-dresses the needs of students with serious disabilities with the skills to undertakemeaningful employment. Students will leave the school with the knowledge andwork and social experience they will need for successful post-secondary employmentin a specific career clusters including: Information Technologies; Hospitality; Construction and Manufacturing; Business and Finance; Arts and Graphics;484 and Communications. Programs supported by the Department of Educations, includ- ing the Star Schools Program and the Technology Innovation Challenge Grant pro-gram are critical to enable cutting edge programs such as our to fully develop ourcapacity to create model systems which can be applied nationwide. The strong sup-port that this Committee has provided to these programs in the past have been aworthwhile investment and we urge your continued support. NATIONAL CENTER FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH IN CHILDREN AND YOUTH We, at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, believe that the time is right to build on our leadership in behavioral research and are establishing a National Behavior Cen-ter to address such problems as teenage smoking, substance use and abuse, schoolfailure, violence, teen pregnancy and other behavioral problems of children and use which have similar causes and solutions. The National Behavior Center will: (1)study the causes of these behavior problems from multiple perspectives (e.g. family,society, environmental toxins, neuro-developmental, etc.); (2) design, evaluate andimplement prevention and intervention programs for these problems; (3) train otherprofessionals to significantly impact these important child and adolescent behaviors;and (4) serve as a national resource for other institutions of higher learning andgovernment agencies. The National Behavior Center will expand the Institute 's efforts from a primary focus on brain related disorders to the broad spectrum of child and youth behavior.We expect that it will have a national impact in terms of understanding children 's behavior and how to identify and prevent the dramatic problems we see on the newsevery evening that every parent fears. As adults in society we have become all too painfully aware of behavior and health problems that our children are facing. Data demonstrates that serious atten-tion must be paid to behavior problems of children and youth to address many soci-etal challenges. School students are being directly exposed to unprecedented levelsof violence: 80 percent of the children surveyed report witnessing threats and actualassaults, and 50 percent of students believe that violence like we saw in Litteton,Colorado could happen in their school. Tragically 50 percent of students in large cityand rural schools know someone their age who has committed suicide. But our concerns for our children should not stop with issues related to violence. Only 58 percent of high school dropouts are employed, and one-third of major U.S.corporations spend $250 billion annually to provide basic academic skills trainingfor employees, such as reading and math. Drug use has a strong link to the useof tobacco as a ''gateway '' drug. One million youth start smoking each year, 3,000 every day. One million also begin to use smokeless tobacco. As few as 3 -5 cigarettes a day can increase the risk of mental retardation of an unborn child by 25 -30 per- cent. The use of alcohol by children and youth causes automobile, pedestrian, and cy- clist accidents, interpersonal violence, drowning and burns, suicides, fetal alcoholsyndrome, alcohol poisoning, and alcohol dependence and abuse. In terms of inter-personal violence alone, alcohol contributes to 16 percent of all child abuse as wellas to over a third of all robberies, assaults, rapes and murders. The estimated costto society is $60 billion annually. One out of every ten women become pregnant at least once before they reach the age of 20. One million teenagers each year have an unwanted pregnancy with ayearly cost to society for medical care, foster care, decreased work productivity, wel-fare, and the like of some $7 billion. Further, an unwanted pregnancy often initiatesa cascade of problems. Children of teenage mothers have lower birth weights, aremore likely to perform poorly in school, and are at greater risk for abuse and ne-glect. Sons of teenage mothers are more likely to end up in prison and daughtersare more likely to become teenage mothers themselves. Most unmarried teenagemothers end up on welfare. Mr. Chairman, a research and public education collaboration between the federal agencies you have identified is necessary if we are to get handle on the best ap-proaches to the rapidly escalating problem of destructive behavior in youth in oursociety. It is of paramount importance to establish a comprehensive and multidisci-plinary initiative that will enhance our understanding of why children become ag-gressive, why they commit violent acts, why they are unable to control their behav-ior, or why children choose to engage in risky behaviors. Efforts need to focus onidentifying the varied roots of child and adolescent behavior and violence by ad-dressing an array of potential influences, including social and cultural variable, fam-ily relationships and family violence, peer influences, child temperament and health,genetic influences, neurological processes and biological risk factors. We need tobegin to apply what we have learned in the field of neurobiology, brain mapping,485 and behavior analysis in the developmentally impaired individual to the broader population of children and youth demonstrating behavioral problems. A coordinated national science agenda addressing the problems of behavior in children must include these components: enhance research, ranging from basic andto clinical, from genes to behavior, related to the behavior of children and youth;employ 21st Century technology for reliable behavior change; and establish a net-work to coordinate disciplines and delivery systems. Mr. Chairman, Members of theCommittee, we applaud your efforts in this regard and look forwarding to workingwith the agencies involved in this important initiative. Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION THE COULSTON FOUNDATION AND THE CHIMP ACT (H .R. 3514) The Society for Animal Protective Legislation (SAPL) urges the Subcommittee to support the efforts of the House Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Servicesand Education Subcommittee, led by Chairman John Porter, to find short and long-term solutions to ensuring the humane treatment of chimpanzees at The CoulstonFoundation. The Coulston Foundation, a private biomedical research facility located in Alamogordo, NM, currently houses the largest chimpanzee colony in the world withover 650 chimpanzees and hundreds of other animals at the facility. The CoulstonFoundation is the only research facility to be officially cited three times by the U.S.Department of Agriculture for violations of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). TheAWA violations are based on numerous negligent deaths of chimpanzees and mon-keys over the past seven years. In fact, the USDA has completed six formal inves-tigations of the Coulston Foundation and is currently in the middle of its seventhinvestigation in as many years. The sixth investigation ended with an unprece-dented agreement between The Coulston Foundation and the USDA where TheCoulston Foundation agreed to divest itself of 300 chimpanzees by 2002. Sadly, an-other six chimpanzees have died since the August 1999 USDA settlement. We haveincluded six of the deaths reported at The Coulston Foundation: (1) Terrance, Muf-fin and Holly died from the well-known side effects of a drug that was later testedin children; (2) Donna, a former Air Force chimpanzee, died on November 9, 1999due to carrying a large, dead fetus inside her womb for up to two months. TCF vet-erinarians removed one liter of pus from her abdomen during a belated C-sectionand reported seeing the skull of her decomposed fetus through the ruptured wallof her necrotic uterus; (3) Another chimpanzee died during a drug study after losing29 per cent of his body weight in just 2 -4 weeks (three other chimpanzees lost simi- lar life-threatening amounts of weight). Responding to the FDA 's citation of these violations, TCF actually told the agency that the lab had ''anticipated '' this fatal weight loss. In August 1999, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators documented more than 270 violations of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations at TheCoulston Foundation on just three studies reviewed. According to the FDA, GLPregulations exist to ensure data integrity and human safety. The FDA confirmedmany of the USDA 's findings, and identified new violations of animal welfare laws. On 12/22/99, the FDA issued a rare Warning Letter, finding the conditions at TCFto be ''serious violations '' with ''wide spread consequences '' for data integrity and human safety, and stating ''that there will be no further studies conducted that are subject to the FDA GLP regulations until corrections are made and verified. '' We understand that the National Institutes of Health may be working on its own solution to the problem at The Coulston Foundation, yet no such plan has been pre-sented, and the situation at The Coulston Foundation has continued to worsen. Theproblems at The Coulston Foundation are not new. In fact, circumstances at the lab-oratory have been deteriorating for several years. Meanwhile, NIH has done littleto alleviate the situation but provide continued financial support to this non-compli-ant laboratory while the USDA and the FDA have filed several charges against thelaboratory for hundreds of violations of federal law relating to human safety andanimal welfare. Now is time for Congress to step in and put an end to the abuseand financial waste at this laboratory. NIH has spent over $30 million on TheCoulston Foundation over the past 7 years while nothing has been done to ensureanimal care or data integrity on the research. The only long-term solution to ensure the well being of the Coulston chimpanzees and all chimpanzees used in federal research is the passage of legislation creatinga national chimpanzee retirement sanctuary. Legislation has already been intro-486 duced in the House that would create such a system (Chimpanzee Health Improve- ment, Maintenance and Protection Act \u2014H.R. 3514). The Act will create a network of federal/private-supported sanctuaries to which chimpanzees formerly used in re-search will be retired. This approach is not only morally and ethically responsible,but will save the taxpayers several million dollars a year. A critical component of a chimpanzee retirement sanctuary, which we would like to address, is that of permanent retirement, the cornerstone of a chimpanzee sanc-tuary. Unfortunately, NIH has expressed concerns with this component, reportedlyfearing that there might not be a sufficient number of chimpanzees to use in re-search, should an emergency arise which might warrant wide use of the species forresearch purposes. To address this concern, we wish to present the following details designed following the recommendations presented in the 1997 NIH requested andfunded National Research Council (NRC) Report, Chimpanzees in Research: Strate-gies for Their Ethical Care, Management and Use. The NRC report specifically rec-ommends that NIH maintain a core population of chimpanzees in case of just suchemergencies. However, the report further states that the current chimpanzee popu-lation is above and beyond the number necessary both for current research needsand anticipated emergency use. It therefore concludes that several hundred ''excess '' chimpanzees should be retired to sanctuary facilities. The report suggests that todo so makes financial and moral sense. The sanctuary system would only apply tochimpanzees clearly no longer needed for research. It would not prevent the use ofchimpanzees in research, nor would it prevent NIH from maintaining a ''reserve '' of chimpanzees in case of an unforeseen public health emergency. In addition, oncea chimpanzee is no longer needed for research, the respective research facility hasthe sole authority to retire the chimpanzees, not the animal welfare community.This is especially important because there are currently several research facilitiesready and willing to retire chimpanzees. The creation of a permanent retirementsanctuary system has the broad support of primate specialists including Dr. JaneGoodall, Dr. Frans de Waal, Thomas Insel, M.D., Thomas Gordon, Ph.D. and Mi-chael Kastello, D.V.M., Executive Director, Research Resources, Merck & Co., Inc.to mention a few. We hope this information will satisfy any concerns NIH may haveregarding permanent retirement of chimpanzees. Former National Academy of Science official and supporter of national sanctuary system Thomas Wolfle, was correct when he said that the NIH is ''morally respon- sible '' for caring for the chimpanzees it paid to breed and infect. It is time to live up to our moral obligations, first by providing alternative care for the chimpanzeesat The Coulston Foundation, and then by creating a sanctuary system to providepermanent retirement to the Coulston chimpanzees and the hundreds of other chim-panzees who remain warehoused in laboratories. STOLEN AND FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED FAMILY PETS ARE BEING USED IN TAXPAYER FUNDED EXPERIMENTS Approximately 100,000 dogs and cats are used for research purposes in the United States each year. The majority of these animals are obtained from breeders whoraise the animals under controlled conditions and have extensive information on thehealth status and genetic background of the animals. Other dogs and cats are ob-tained directly from municipal pounds or the animals may come from breeding stockwithin the research facility. Unfortunately, despite extensive documentation strongly discouraging the prac- tice, some research facilities are still purchasing dogs and cats from random sourcedealers. These dealers, with a Class B license designation by USDA, are notoriousfor selling animals to laboratories that have been acquired through theft or fraudand for their widespread failure to comply with the minimum requirements underthe Animal Welfare Act. Recognizing the severity of the problem, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in- creased its enforcement efforts at the premises of Class B dealers approximatelythree years ago. Stronger enforcement drove some of the random source dealers outof business, but it has not solved the problem. These dealers continue to fail tomaintain the legally mandated records identifying where they are getting the dogsand cats they sell to laboratories for hundreds of dollars each. The records are not completed (and traceable to a legitimate source) because these animals are being purchased from illegal sources (people who have not bred andraised the animals and/or did not willingly give them up for research purposes). Forexample, the inspection report from a USDA-licensed dealer in Iowa cited the fol-lowing apparent violation, ''Records indicate that 290 dogs were sold to research, but only 83 animals exhibit required acquisition paperwork by this licensee. Fully 207adult dogs are not accounted for via the release forms paperwork. Also, the dealer487 is listing himself as the source of animal acquisition, when this dealer is actually acquiring animals from a variety of individuals. . . . '' This dealer has allegedly supplied more than one thousand dogs for experimen- tation that he acquired through fraud. Further, it is alleged that the individualswho bred and raised the animals were deceived by the dealer into believing thattheir dogs, former racing greyhounds, were being adopted to good homes. This situa-tion became public this month, since then the dealer has disconnected his home andbusiness telephone service. Now he is under investigation by USDA and the Wis-consin State Division of Gaming. As is usually the case, it is too late to rescue anydogs since all of the animals the dealer sold to laboratories have been euthanizedfollowing their use in experimentation. Meantime, the National Institutes of Health continues assuring Congress and the public that they are ''committed to ensuring the appropriate care and use of animals in research. '' NIH has left the decision of whether or not to use dogs and cats from Class B dealers ''to the local level on the basis of scientific need. '' NIH acknowledges ''Class B dealers provide biomedical researchers with animals that may not be avail- able from other sources, such as genetically diverse, older, or larger animals. '' In fact, the animals needed are available from other sources; genetically diverse, olderor larger animals could be acquired directly from those pounds that choose to supplyanimals for experimentation. The distinction between non-purpose-bred animals from pounds versus Class B dealers needs to be made and emphasized. By using Class B dealers instead ofpounds, researchers are contributing to the problem. In their search to fill research-ers demands for ''genetically diverse, older, or larger animals, '' random source deal- ers are stealing pets from backyards and farms or they are acquiring animalsthrough fraud by collecting animals offered ''free to a good home. '' Following is a statement recently circulated on the web from a gentleman in Jonesboro, Arkansas: ''I am no animal rights activist \u2014I am a neurosurgeon, an avid hunter, conservationist, dog lover, horseman and all- 'round country boy. I was brought up to believe in caring for the animals that we own and I love my 4 yearold black Lab, Rebel, second only to my kids. He was stolen from my home on Dec.18, 1999. I have solid information that he was taken by (or for) a nearby 'buncher ' who sells dogs to research facilities. . . . As a neurosurgeon, I support animal re-search for worthwhile purposes when the data cannot be acquired any other wayand when the animals are properly procured and properly cared for \u2014but not when they are our pets that have been stolen. '' Each year as NIH and the researchers it funds fail to take action, more com- panion animals are stolen and the numbers of distraught and outraged pet ownerscontinues to grow. This taxpayer financed supply, which has continued for decades,desperately needs to stop. Last year the Subcommittees in both Houses of Congress provided report lan- guage reflecting their regarding Class B dealers. We greatly appreciate the interestof this Subcommittee in this issue. Unfortunately, we must report that the problemscontinue and no action has been taken. We therefore respectfully request the Sub-committee include the following language in the appropriations bill: ''None of these funds shall be used for research which utilizes dogs and/or cats obtained from ran-dom source Class B dealers. '' Implementation of this policy will allow research utilizing dogs and cats to con- tinue \u2014unhindered by the dark shadow currently cast by Class B dealers and their illegal practices. NIH NEEDS TO REDO THE ANIMAL CARE AND USE SECTION OF ITS REGULATORY BURDEN REPORT In the fiscal year 1998 budget, the House Committee on Appropriations requested an effort by NIH to streamline and rationalize duplicative and unnecessary federalregulations that govern extramural scientific research. The report drafted by NIHfailed to focus on the internal regulatory burden that NIH has the power to address.Instead, the report is being used as a vehicle to assault the federal Animal WelfareAct by those who wish to dismantle it. The use of animals in research includes a weighty responsibility to ensure the best possible care and treatment for these animals whose lives will be sacrificed fol-lowing experimentation. Animals who are treated well will produce more sound re-search results with a lower variance. The Animal Welfare Act is the chief federallaw ensuring proper treatment of laboratory animals and due consideration of alter-natives. The Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments to the Animal Wel- fare Act were adopted in 1985 following widespread public concern and extensive488 documentation of the need for legislation and of the failure of institutions to self- regulate, hearings in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and carefulconsideration and negotiation. Many researchers and the lobbyists who representedthem fought against this law, as those before them fought against the LaboratoryAnimal Welfare Act of 1966 (later renamed the Animal Welfare Act). Having lostthat battle, opponents fought against regulations for enforcement of the law untilweakened regulations were finally adopted nearly six years later. Now, we are facedwith an effort to dismantle the remains. NIH should take an introspective look at ways in which it can reduce the regu- latory burden to researchers and better streamline the process. For example, fol-lowing is a review of site visits: There is great usefulness in the current system that mandates, at minimum, bi- annual inspections by the IACUC (self-regulation), but augmenting this with theunannounced inspections by USDA veterinary inspectors. Law mandates annual in-spections by USDA. Review of USDA inspection report forms provides powerful evi-dence of the utility and great need for these compliance inspections. USDA has re-ported that it finds noncompliance with the minimum requirements under the Ani-mal Welfare Act at 45 percent of the facilities it inspects. Perhaps NIH can do away with their site visits since this is not an activity that they undertake with regularity. In those instances where a registered research facil-ity receiving NIH funds is not in compliance with the law, perhaps it is a USDAinspector, already familiar with inspection of the facility, who should be sent in toconduct an unannounced inspection, rather than a team of individuals organized byNIH who make a scheduled visit. This is but one example of the usefulness and practicality of the Animal Welfare Act. And an example of the need for NIH to pay particular attention to ways it maybe able to improve the process internally. Thank you very much for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL SOCIETY , INC. Mr. Chairman, it is a great pleasure to submit this testimony to you today. My name is Daniel Paul Perez, of Lexington, Massachusetts, and I am testifying today as President & Chief Executive Officer of the Facioscapulohumeral Society(FSH Society, Inc.) and as an individual who has this devastating disorder. As a chief patient activist for the tens of thousands of individuals living with Facioscapulohumeral Disease (FSHD) in the United States, I will continue to arguethe case of wanting to live life free from disease. My testimony is about the profound and devastating effects of a disease known as Facioscapulohumeral Disease which is also known as FSH Muscular Dystrophyor FSHD and the urgent and immediate need for NIH funding for research on thisdisorder. In past years (1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999) and again this year we willsubmit testimony before both House and Senate Committees which states that theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) and Congress could help bring about a signifi-cant research and scientific discovery program which, with modest investments,would benefit hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. The FSH Society has previously informed the members of this Committee of the United States Congress on the need and rationale for research on FSHD. We haveupdated you on the most recent developments in clinical medicine with respect toFSHD, kept you abreast of the latest breakthroughs in the molecular genetics of thedisease and given you insight into the difficulty of living a lifetime with this disease. Thanks largely to your efforts, Mr. Specter, NIH research funding continues to grow to its current level of $17.793 billion annually up two billion from 1999. Ourgratitude fuels our hope for promising research solutions for FSHD. Ironically, Imust in all candor express our frustration that promising FSHD research support and programs have yet to appear from the NIH, even in light of Congressional man-dates and report language for such. While NIH has seen a tremendous increase infunding in the past decade, FSHD research through the NIH has not benefited atall. In fact, research funding has gone significantly down, not up. Since the FSHSociety first testified before Congress in 1994, FSHD research has decreased frombetween $300 -500,000 to between $100 -250,000. During this time, Congressional directives to NIH regarding the state of FSHD research have been either ignoredor responded to in an untimely manner. We have met with NIH officials, testifiedbefore the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee and taken the path indicated toput forth our goals and the situation has only gotten worse.489 THE FSH SOCIETY , INC. The FacioScapuloHumeral (FSH) Society, incorporated in 1991, solely addresses specific issues and needs regarding facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy(FSHD). The Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) of the Societyare comprised of the top medical and research experts in neuromuscular and muscledisease several of whom are past and current NIH grant recipients, employees ofthe Howard Hughes Medical Institute and serve on the prestigious Institute of Med-icine (IOM) at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). We provide public aware-ness of FSHD by providing information, referral, education, and advocacy on FSHD.Additionally, the FSH Society offers assistance and support to patients, families,physicians, and other professionals. The Society publishes a newsletter with infor- mation about advances in research, political action effecting FSHD research andprofiles of people with FSHD. We have awarded $500,000 in grants toward the pre-vention, cause and treatment of FSHD for research projects, post-doctoral and re-search fellowships and provided training support to institutions and fellowships toindividuals in the field of FSHD research worldwide. The FSH Society promotes col-laborative research and collects and disseminates research information. The Societyorganizes and sponsors annual international and national Scientific meetings onFSHD as well as annual international and national patient network day meetings. THE CLINICAL PICTURE OF FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (FSHD) FSHD is a neuromuscular disorder that is inherited genetically and has an esti- mated frequency of one in twenty thousand (1/20,000). FSHD affects 12,500 -37,500 persons in the United States. The major consequence of inheriting this disease isthat of a clinically unpredictable and progressive and severe loss of skeletal muscle,with the usual pattern of initial noticeable weakness of facial, scapular and upperarm muscles and subsequent developing weaknesses of other skeletal muscles. Ret-inal and cochlear disease can often be associated with FSHD although the patho-genesis and causative relationship to FSHD remains completely unknown. FSHDwastes the skeletal muscles and gradually but surely brings weakness and reducedmobility. Many with FSHD are severely physically disabled and spend the last 30years of their lives in a wheelchair. The toll and cost of FSHD physically, emotion-ally and financially is enormous. FSHD is a life long disease that has an enormouscost-of-disease burden and is a life sentence for the innocent patient and involvedpersons. Clinically FSHD is quite variable. It can be very extreme causing dev-astating incapacity at an early age or it can be barely detectable in very old age.Often, the patient lives with the certainty and anxiety that the course of their dis-ease will be reliably unpredictable and totally uncontrollable. FSHD can happen toanyone of us. NEW FRONTIERS DISCOVERED IN HUMAN GENETICS THROUGH FSHD RESEARCH . The FSHD gene was linked to the distal end of chromosome 4, a location known as 4q35, in 1990 by scientists in the Netherlands. At that time it was assumed thatgenetic testing would be imminently achievable and that the identification of the ab-normal gene product(s) would soon follow. Genetic testing is now available thoughwith reservation for certain patients with complicated novel genetic presentations.A decade of progress has led to the discovery of a novel genetic phenomena of cross-over of subtelomeric DNA between chromosomes (4 and 10) in both normal individ-uals and diseased individuals and to the discovery that facioscapulohumeral mus-cular dystrophy may be the only human disease caused by a deletion-mutation caus-ing a position effect variegation (PEV). PEV causes DNA in one part of the genometo affect DNA in other parts of the genome. In FSHD, DNA at the very end of thechromosome (telomere) interferes with DNA upstream towards the center (proximal)of the chromosome. Despite remarkable genetic insight and immense progress by asmall team of scientists worldwide, the nature of the gene product(s) remain enig-matic and the biochemical mechanism and cause of this common muscle disease re-mains absolutely unknown and elusive. In the meantime, during the past decade, the genes and gene products for a sig- nificant number of other myopathies, most of which are rarer than FSHD, havebeen identified and classified. Although great progress has been made in these othermyopathies and muscle diseases, our ability to intervene, treat and cure these dis-eases is rare. Ironically, FSHD research has not led to the identification of thegene(s) and the corresponding protein(s) encoded by the FSHD deletion-mutationcausing FSHD. Instead, it has led the scientific community to discover a novelhuman genetic phenomenon that challenges the entire view and understanding ofMendelian genetics. In essence, FSHD has produced the anomaly that forces the sci-490 entific community to question the paradigm of Mendelian genetics. This finding will begin a whole scientific revolution in human genetics that will have far greater im-plications for medical genetics that will extend far beyond the study of FSHD. RESEARCH DOLLARS ALLOCATED DIRECTLY TO FSHD AS WELL AS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY ARE MINIMAL . The Subcommittee members need consider and rationalize the following numbers. Neuromuscular and muscle disease has one of the highest cost-of-disease burdensin the U.S. economy. Yet, of $17.793 billion annually given to NIH, $16.5 millionis spent on Muscular Dystrophy and, of that amount, conservatively $250,000 isspent on the third most prevalent and third largest dystrophy FSHD. That makesnine hundred twenty one-thousandths (920/1000) of one percent (1/100) of the totalNIH budget Muscular Dystrophy and fourteen one-thousandths (14/1000) of onepercent (1/100) of the total NIH budget for FSHD. Clearly, the Muscular Dys-trophies as a class of disease are more than significantly under-funded by NIH. Sec-ondly, FSHD research funding by NIH is woefully disproportionate given its rankingand severity. Thirdly, at best, $16.00 and at worst, $5.33 is spent on each personliving with FSHD. The numbers on FSHD and Muscular Dystrophy research are ap-pallingly and inexplicably low. Furthermore, muscular dystrophy is frequently overlooked and of no interest to the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology industry and Wall Street. No privatelyor publicly owned company is currently pursuing FSHD research. FSHD is not Alz- heimer 's, Parkinson 's disease or breast cancer with hundreds of millions of research dollars from the NIH supplemented by the enormous investments of hundreds ofmillions of dollars from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. We have no-where to go in the private sector and cannot even possibly go lower at the NIH. Weare ostensibly at zero funding. The NIH has failed and is failing in its public respon-sibility to the muscular dystrophy and FSHD citizen by not carrying through on itspublic health responsibility. CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN AND IS REPEATEDLY IGNORED BY THE NIH . It should be noted that the FSH Society has given twelve (12) Congressional testi- monies in seven years and has succeeded in three successive years in incorporatingreport language on Facioscapulohumeral Disease (FSHD) in both U.S. House andU.S. Senate Appropriations Committee Reports accompanying the budget. We havehad over one hundred and fifty meetings and interactions with the three NIH Insti-tutes primarily responsible for FSHD: The National Institute of Neurological Dis-orders and Stroke (NINDS/NIH), The National Institute of Arthritis, Musculo-skeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS/NIH) and the Office of Rare Disease (ORD/NIH). We have the distinct honor of working with the prestigious and talented Di-rectors and Staffs of all three of these Institutes since 1992. NIH is seriously out of compliance with previous Congressional Directives. NIH has not responded and is responding very slowly to the past three years of ReportLanguage. Four (4) calendar years have passed and the NIH has still not conveneda research planning conference. NIH is just now convening a research planning con-ference on Tuesday, May 9, 2000 responding to your directive three years too late.We await the results and plan that comes from that meeting. We request that yourCommittee ask for and receive the results of that planning conference in an imme-diate and timely manner. The Report Language for 2000 has been responded to in an untimely manner and mainly ignored. The status of action on Report Language for fiscal year 2000 willbe ''current year items not done ''. The 2000 Report Language is as follows: ''The Committee is concerned that NIH has not responded to a previous request to de-velop a plan for enhancing NIH research into Facioscapulohumeral (FSH) disease.The Committee urges NIH to promptly convene a research planning conference andto establish a comprehensive portfolio into the causes, prevention, and treatment ofFSH disease through all available mechanisms, as appropriate. The Director is re-quested to be prepared to testify on the status of this initiative at the fiscal year2001 appropriations hearing. '' (House Report 3037, p. 81 for NINDS, p. 97 for NIAMS.) The status of fiscal year 2000 Report Language is as follows: Not done in the ma- jority. Plan not created and no comprehensive research portfolio exists. NIAMS hasno R01 or P01 grants grant on FSHD. Intramuralresearch on FSHD is non-existent at NIH. The Report Language for 1999 has been ignored and the status of the Report lan- guage for fiscal year 1999 is not done. The 1999 Report Language is as follows: ''The Committee encourages the Institute to continue and expand research efforts focused491 on aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of FSHD. '' (House Report, NINDS Section, p. 103.), and, ''The Committee was pleased with the Institute 's response to last year's request which encouraged NIH to stimulate research in the area of facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD). However, the Committee notes that NIAMShas not responded in developing a plan for enhancing FSHD research, and has notaddressed the question of whether an intramural program in this area would bebeneficial. Therefore, the Committee urges NIH to conduct a research planning con-ference in the near future in order to explore scientific opportunities in FSHD re-search, both intramurally and extramurally. '' (House Report, NIAMS Section, p.120 - 121.) The status of 1999 Report Language is as follows: Not done. Plan not created and research portfolio is not expanding. NIAMS has no R01 or P01 grants on FSHD.NINDS has one R01. Intramural research on FSHD is non-existent at NIH. The Report Language for 1998 has been ignored and the status of Report lan- guage for fiscal year 1998 is not done. The 1998 Report Language is as follows: ''The Committee has heard compelling testimony about facioscapulohumeral (FSH) dis-ease, which causes progressive and severe loss of skeletal muscle. FSHD researchincludes aspects such as molecular genetics, neurological function and muscular dys-trophy involving multiple NIH Institutes. The Committee encourages NIH to takesteps to stimulate research in this area and requests NIH to develop a plan for en-hancing NIH research into FSH disease (FSHD), including an assessment of wheth-er an intramural research program in this area would be beneficial. '' (House Report, p. 101.) The status of 1998 Report Language is as follows: Not done. Plan not created and no FSHD specific initiatives are undertaken to stimulate research. NIAMS has noR01 or P01 grants on FSHD. NINDS has one R01 grant for the majority of the year.Intramural research on FSHD is non-existent at NIH. NIH STILL LACKS PRESENCE IN THE AREA OF FSHD RESEARCH . NIH has not funded any new grants to ''establish a comprehensive portfolio into the causes, prevention, and treatment of FSH disease '' even though the previous two years of report language request that this happen. The Committee has asked NIHseveral times ''to establish a comprehensive portfolio into the causes, prevention, and treatment of FSH disease through all available mechanisms, as appropriate. '' And still, at the time of this testimony not one new P01 or R01 grant will have beenissued on FSHD in the entire past year. NIH has not implemented or announced any new mechanisms to enhance funding on FSHD research in the last year despite the fact that last year 's language re- quests that NIH do this ''through all available mechanisms, as appropriate. '' NIH continues to inexplicably reject grant applications on FSHD. On March 8, 2000 a second submission within this year of a major grant application from a worldrenowned researcher was left unscored by the Center for Scientific Review (CSR)study section Brain Development and Child Neurology 3 (BDCN 3). Additionally,other grants in FSHD have not been funded within the last year. REVIEW OF THE NIH TRACK RECORD ON FSHD AND CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVE ON FSHD NIH has ignored and is responding slowly to three (3) and now four (4) years of Congressional Directives. NIH has been slow and unorganized in convening the research planning con- ference and in developing the research plan on FSHD called for in the last three(3) years Report Language. NIH has not even begun to establish a portfolio in the causes and treatment of FSHD as called for in the past two years of House and Senate Report Language.A comprehensive portfolio has not even been initiated. NIH has not established ''a comprehensive portfolio through all available mecha- nisms, as appropriate '' as called for in last years Language. No new funding mecha- nisms have been announced. NIH has not funded any new R01 or P01 projects in FSHD.There is a complete disconnect between the fact that Institute Directors state that FSHD is a priority in long range planning papers, Congressional testimonies beforethe Committee, in their responses to questions raised by the Committee and in per-sonal communications and yet NIH continues to inexplicably reject grant applica-tions on FSHD. NIH has not yet responded to Congressional questions asked of the Director of NIH, Dr. Ruth Kirchstein, on February 15, 2000 and of the Director of the NINDS,Dr. Gerald Fischbach, on February 29, 2000 by the U.S. House Appropriations Com-492 mittee, Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education (Hon. Randy ''Duke '' Cunningham). NIH is far from the $5 -10 million needed to accelerate efforts in the area of FSHD. In 2000 to date, NINDS has only one issued grant in its portfolio that is for FSHD. In 2000, to date, NIAMS has no grants presently issued with FSHD in theirtitle. That is correct, in 2000 NIAMS currently has funded $0 (zero) on FSHD re-search projects. NIAMS and NINDS state that they are beginning the process of or-ganizing the research planning conference for May 9, 2000 and, less than four weeksbefore the conference, we still do not have a final roster for planning panel partici-pants. NIH must understand that FSHD requires their attention. Although FSHD research may have benefited indirectly from NIH funding of the Human Genome Project, direct funding of FSHD research by the NINDS and theNIAMS at NIH has been minimal. The total NIH funding for directly titled FSHDresearch currently for the fiscal year 2000 (fiscal year 2000) to date is approximatelytwo hundred-fifty thousand dollars. FSHD researchers express incredulity with the lack of funds and rejection of grants submitted by the top laboratories in the world. WE IMPLORE THE COMMITTEE TO ACT IMMEDIATELY Mr. Chairman, we know that the Committee is overwhelmed in hearing from pa- tient groups such as ours. We know that you trusted that the Institute of Medicine(IOM), the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) and the NIH would set their prioritiescorrectly. The truth is that we have come before Congress to testify year after year,given testimony in a wheelchair from the back of the room at the IOM as it wasnot wheelchair accessible, worked hard to have NIH take a more active, deliberateand responsible role and yet the NIH is not listening to the Congress, the scientificcommunity and the patients on this issue. Mr. Chairman, this is a clear and disturbing trend regarding NIH 's disregard for Congressional Report Language and for the scientific and medical opportunitiespresent in FSHD research. There presently is very little funding of FSHD from NIH \u2014perhaps two hundred- fifty thousand dollars. I re-iterate, this is clearly inadequate given the recent ad-vances and the high likelihood of making significant progress in the very near fu-ture. With a budget of $17.793 billion dollars, NIH is spending a miniscule amounton FSHD research. This tiny amount is utterly unconscionable and defies logic andreason given the prevalence of FSHD and the cost of doing molecular genetics re-search in 2000. Mr. Chairman, we ask the Subcommittee to earmark a dollar amount to FSHD research. We request that an amount of not less than five (5) million and not morethan ten (10) million dollars be earmarked for FSHD research. We know that thisCommittee does not approve of earmarking. However, the record of six years indi-cates that NIH ignores Congressional direction as well as scientific opportunities.Earmarking appears to be the only way to get NIH attention. The FSHD community demands that the Congress of the United States of Amer- ica take action on funding research on FSHD. We are asking today for a promiseto people living with FSHD which commits to funding FSHD research in the fol-lowing areas: \u2014Cloning the gene, characterizing the nature of mutations in the gene, \u2014Launching a major effort to understand the normal function of the FSHD gene and how its alteration causes the disease, \u2014Conducting natural history studies to provide a baseline for future therapeutic techniques, and \u2014Developing therapies based on information in 1, 2, and 3 above. Additionally, the FSHD community is requesting that Congress ask NIH to re- search and make recommendations on the following: \u2014Creating a Center of Research Excellence (CORE) for FSHD research, \u2014Enacting intramural NIH programs for FSHD research immediately, \u2014Extramural contract programs for FSHD, and \u2014Programs to attract and expedite extramural grant applications. The men, women and children who live with the daily consequences of this dev- astating disease are your friends, neighbors, fellow taxpayers and contributors tothe American way of life. With an historic 88 percent employment rate and an aver-age educational achievement level of 14 years, we personally bear our burden of thehealth care costs and training expenses to prepare for and maintain financial andpersonal independence. We appeal to you today to take our hard earned tax dollarscommensurate with our numbers and valuable contributions to American Society.493 We urge the United States Government to allocate a proportion of our tax burden toward research on FSHD. This is the United States of America, and in a country as great as ours with all of its technical means and ability it should be absolutely clear that the number onepriority for individuals with FSHD and the one absolutely commanding imperativefor the Federal Government is to initiate and accelerate in any way possible, re-search on FSHD. With modest funding and a clear direction from Congress to the NIH to support research on FSHD significant progress can be made in conqueringand eliminating this and other devastating diseases. Mr. Chairman and members of this Committee, let us remember that as the Con- stitutional Convention at Philadelphia drew to a close in 1787, James Madisonnoted some concluding remarks by the elder statesman, Benjamin Franklin. Frank-lin's observations had to do with a sun painted on the back of the chair of the pre- siding officer. He said, ''often and often in the course of the Session, and the vicissi- tudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, I looked at that behind the Presidentwithout being able to tell whether it was rising or setting. But now at length I havethe happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun. '' Our founding forefathers toiled, fought and worked for Liberty and Freedom from oppression. They fully recognized that if their partial liberty gave way to full fledgedoppression, the opportunity for freedom would be lost for a long time and that lib-erty threatened can be recovered. Living with a lifelong progressive and chronicneuromuscular disease imposes the same thoughtful consideration. In the same way as our forefathers, before the founding of this great country, I too, lose my physical Liberty every day as naturally and eventually as the sun risesand sets. My liberty is in constant decline and my happiness and courage sometimesis setting as the sun to the West. Everyday I choose to fight on, I am curious toknow about what the next day will bring, simply curious. Despite the full fledgedconstant decline of my liberty, I live for the rising sun and have the faith that thiscountry is great enough and powerful enough to enact change where it is needed.My liberty will surely be lost in my life time if I do not find it within me to fightfor the recovery of my liberty and freedom from my natural born oppression. It ismy duty and my obligation, as a citizen of this country, to act as my ancestors andtheir fathers did to ensure that the government acts responsibly carrying out itsduty to uphold the public trust. Mr. Chairman, we trust your judgement on the matter before us. Please remem- ber, we need your help to ensure that the sun is rising on FSHD. Mr. Chairman, again, thank you for providing this opportunity to testify before your Subcommittee. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SCLERODERMA RESEARCH FOUNDATION The Scleroderma Research Foundation appreciates the opportunity to submit this written statement urging Congress to become our partner in pursuit of a cure forscleroderma. As we have in past years, the Scleroderma Research Foundation asks for a part- nership that combines the strengths of the private, academic and public sectors inseeking a cure for this debilitating, often fatal disease, which strikes half a millionAmericans. Scleroderma is a chronic, degenerative disorder that leads to the overproduction of collagen in the body 's connective tissue. The overabundance of collagen hardens the connective tissue (scleroderma means ''hard skin '') and damages the organs in- volved. About eighty percent of scleroderma patients are women. In approximatelyhalf the cases, the primary organ involved is the skin, which hardens and scars,often causing severe pain and disfigurement. The other half of patients suffer fromsystemic sclerosis which hardens internal organs, such as the heart, kidneys andlungs. Almost seventy percent of patients with systemic sclerosis die within sevenyears of initial diagnosis. The Scleroderma Research Foundation was established to fill a virtual void in re- search on this awful disease. From scratch, the Foundation has built an effective,respected, progressive research program dedicated to finding a cure for scleroderma.We have made astounding progress, to the point that our team of advisors and sci-entists agree that scleroderma is now a solvable problem. The researchers at ourtwo centers \u2014t University of California San Francisco and at Johns Hopkins Univer- sity\u2014ave made great advancements in understanding the key processes in the fibro- sis and vascular problems of scleroderma. In other groundbreaking investigations,researchers have found several key antibodies that are unique to scleroderma. Thiswork clearly points the way to identifying the environmental factors which lead to494 disease development, as well as helping isolate genes involved in its predisposition. Remarkably, these breakthroughs have been accomplished almost exclusivelythrough funding from private donations. The lion 's share of donations are contrib- uted by individuals, many who are scleroderma patients, their family and friends,and many who have lost loved ones to this disease. At a time when we have renewed hope for a cure, we need help to reach our goal. The breakthroughs we have achieved have advanced our understanding ofscleroderma and brought us closer to a cure. There is a surge of interest from sci-entists in related fields in opportunities to collaborate on this research. The rightpeople and technology now exist to cure this disease. It is only a question of pro-viding the resources necessary to get the job done. What is needed is your timelysupport in bringing the vast resources in science and technology to our mission.Clearly, there is a life saving opportunity here. Your partnership is vital if we areto continue to progress. PROPOSAL FOR PARTNERSHIP Specifically, the partnership we are seeking is a collaboration with our research centers at University of California San Francisco and at Johns Hopkins University.Our request is not for a gift; we are requesting a match. We ask Congress to allocatefunds to match what we, private individuals across the country, have given to fundour research centers. Since 1987, the Foundation has invested $4.874 million in re-search projects. With this match, we can strengthen our highly regarded ''cure advo- cacy'' approach to research, maximizing the efficiency and progress of our programs. Cure advocacy brings together scleroderma experts and top scientists from all basic scientific disciplines to analyze where we stand in the science of sclerodermaand to identify the most promising research opportunities. Our team comprises sci-entists from Johns Hopkins University Medical Center, the National Institutes ofHealth, Stanford Medical Center, the University of California San Francisco, theUniversity of Maryland, and Ohio State University. They participate in a trulyinterdisciplinary, multi-institutional environment, working together, sharing re-sources and ongoing research information with one common goal \u2014to find a cure for scleroderma. Through cure advocacy the Scleroderma Research Foundation, in partnership with the private and academic sectors, is able to direct and manage the science on behalfof the patients. The Foundation is, in other words, driving the science in the direc-tion of a cure. Now, we ask you to join this partnership in support of well-focused,results-oriented, disease-driven research, and in support of the hundreds of thou-sands of scleroderma patients awaiting a cure. We are also requesting your partnership in launching a new and innovative post doctorate program that will bring the efforts of the best and brightest new scientiststo bear on finding a cure for scleroderma. Our goal is to create a program that fo-cuses scientists in the field of scleroderma research at the beginning of their career,when they can devote their work early and exclusively to saving lives. Here again,the Scleroderma Research Foundation is working to raise funds for the post doc-torate program from private donations. Our request is for a match of our fundingat $1 million (five scientists located at five laboratories for a three-year period each). CONCLUSION As a private medical research foundation, we have attempted, repeatedly, to cre- ate a public/private partnership. Year after year, there has been no response. Whatmore can we, as an organization dedicated to an important and singular mission,do in terms of educating Capitol Hill and raising awareness of the urgency of find-ing a cure for scleroderma. There is still, after all, no known cause or cure for thedisease. There are still no FDA-approved therapies. There are still hundreds ofthousands of Americans, mostly women, suffering \u2014nd dying \u2014rom scleroderma. We cannot do this alone. From its beginnings, the Scleroderma Research Foundation has maintained a sharply focused program to insure no time is wasted in reaching our goal of savinglives. We have accepted this challenge, and extend the challenge to Congress, to theNational Institutes of Health, and to the medical research community in this coun-try: To channel today 's incredible technologies into helping people and advancing science that is driven by saving lives. We ask Congress to participate in our missionby matching our efforts and speeding our progress to a cure. Thank you for providing us the opportunity to present this statement. The Scleroderma Foundation welcomes any questions Members of the Committee mayhave.495 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the subcommittee, I am Dr. Virginia Hinshaw, Dean of the Graduate School and Senior Research Officer at the Univer-sity of Wisconsin-Madison. I write today to provide several perspectives on research,because I 've been fortunate to serve in different capacities during my own research career. For 25 years, I worked as a scientist and my research, specifically on influenza viruses, was made possible by the funding I received from the National Institutesof Health. So I certainly recognize the value, as well as the highly competitive na-ture, of obtaining such funding. Currently, I serve as a university administrator with the goal of facilitating re- search efforts of others. I certainly recognize the fact that the University of Wis-consin-Madison, as a major research institution, is highly dependent on NIH fund-ing in that over 50 percent of our federal funding comes from NIH. Also, I am pleased to represent the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of 61 public and private research universities across the U.S. andCanada. I currently serve as president of the Association of Graduate Schools, agroup within AAU. Many of you have AAU institutions within your States. We arejoined in this statement by the American Council on Education, the Council of Grad-uate Schools, and the National Association of State Universities and Land-GrantColleges. You have heard over the past several weeks from many organizations and individ- uals advocating increases in NIH funding \u2014patient groups, scientific societies, and research institutions. I speak on behalf of research institutions, whose faculty trans-late NIH research grants into findings that improve human health and well-being.This is a great time to be in research \u2014there is so much we can do and so much that needs to be done. A number of exciting, new areas being investigated by facultyat UW-Madison include genomics, chemical biology, nanotechnology, biomedical en-gineering, bioinformatics and many more. These are just a few examples of the kindof cutting-edge science that is going on all over the United States, due to this na-tion's wise investments in biomedical research at NIH. This investment is improving our lives and the lives of future generations. I also know that many of these advances depend on efforts in many other fields of science, including physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and engi-neering. For example, lasers evolved from mathematicians and physicists studyinglight waves, and, because of those efforts, lasers are now common tools in medicine.A decade ago, cataract removal represented major surgery with substantial recuper-ation time; today, this is done with lasers as outpatient surgery with rapid recov-ery\u2014that is progress through research by both physical and biological scientists. We hope that NIH, as well as the other science agencies, will be provided with the re-sources needed to support these other scientific fields that I can attest are criticalto the success of biomedical research. Past investments in biomedical research have paid off for human health and for the American economy. For example, recombinant DNA research at our universitiesin the 1970 's opened the door for today 's multi-billion dollar biotechnology industry. It also allowed us to begin the human genome project, which is now nearly com-plete, again through a partnership between the Federal Government and researchuniversities. This achievement is the next step in the genetic revolution which couldprofoundly alter our approaches to preventing, treating, and curing disease. Otherexamples include the tremendous progress NIH-supported researchers have made indiscovering ways to reduce the tragedy of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV. AsNIH has reported, a 1994 study indicated that zidovudine (AZT) could reduce therate of transmission by two-thirds, and once these findings were widely dissemi-nated, the number of AIDS cases from mother-to-infant transmission in the U.S. de-creased dramatically \u2014by 43 percent between 1992 and 1996. Advances in cancer treatments enable many of us to be here today, including my- self. I 'm a breast cancer survivor and thriver. My father has had prostate cancer and is still active and vital at 83. So I have a strong personal, as well as profes-sional interest, in seeing advances in our understanding of cancer which leads toimproved treatments and hopefully prevention. Along with the subcommittee, Iwant our granddaughters and grandsons to be free of those threats to their health.That will only happen through research. Even with the great successes in research, I think it is important to remind our- selves that research is not an investment with guaranteed outcomes. We are seekinganswers to questions with unknown answers. That means there are wrong turnsand dead-ends as we search for those answers. I always tell students to rememberthe ''re'' in research which means that we search and then we search again and496 again to determine if our direction is the correct one. I surely believe that research is a wonderful adventure into the unknown, but that adventure also involves hard,repetitive, exhaustive work and requires patience in getting to the long term bene-fits. We need your steadfast support to make that adventure productive in the longterm for the whole of society. This subcommittee has charted us on a bipartisan course to double NIH funding, which will enable us to continue making progress like this into the future. The asso-ciations I represent here, as well as my faculty colleagues, are tremendously grate-ful to Senator Specter and Speaker Harkin, and all the members of the Sub-committee, for having provided 15 percent increases in each of the last two fiscalyears. We hope that the subcommittee will be able to repeat that success in the fis-cal year 2001 bill as the third step on the path to double NIH funding by 2003. Asyou know, NIH makes grants for multiple years, and therefore needs stable support.As an investigator myself, I know the challenge and the stress of maintaining sup-port for an active laboratory group \u2014that responsibility keeps most of us awake at night, busy writing more grants to ensure continuity of our research personnel andprograms. The President 's Budget for fiscal year 2001 is a good start, but its 5.6 percent in- crease after two years of 15 percent increases would not even allow NIH to fundthe same number of new grants in fiscal year 2001 as the year before, sending aterrible message back through the biomedical research enterprise. The effects of theextraordinary funding increases this subcommittee has been able to provide are al-ready producing positive results in the research community, where researchers aremore likely to be able to get their innovative ideas funded and graduate studentscan again see biomedical research as a promising career choice. I want to under-score the fact that research universities are the educational homes for graduate stu-dents who are our nation 's future researchers \u2014we must keep that future strong. To accomplish that, we need to keep the momentum going, instead of reverting to theold boom-and-bust cycles that characterized NIH funding in the past. Some have asked whether there are enough good research ideas to be able to wisely spend a 15 percent increase. The simple answer is yes; there are truly awealth of great research ideas yet to be pursued. The current state of research inso many fields abounds with promise. Advances in basic research in genetics, cellbiology, and biochemistry, as well as in clinical applications for cancer, infectiousdisease, and aging, put us on the brink of discovery in a wider array of disciplinesthan ever before. Staying the course by providing another 15 percent increase willenable further research advances in these areas to the benefit of all Americans inthe future. We recognize that the Subcommittee is faced with enormous challengesin finding sufficient funds to keep NIH on the path toward doubling, while ade-quately funding other important programs in the bill, given the constraints on dis-cretionary spending. We hope that an agreement will be reached again this year to continue investing in basic research to support investments that are vital to thelong-range health of the nation. Within biomedical research, several areas are particularly important to note. Sup- port for clinical research remains vital if laboratory advances are to be translatedto the bedside. Likewise, support for research infrastructure is critical for continuedadvances. As research funding increases, additional resources must be invested inrenovating outdated facilities, financing state-of-the-art instrumentation, and pro-viding new informational and computer technologies \u2014all are critical and connected priorities. Great research ideas are constantly being generated by our faculty, staffand students but pursuing those ideas requires modern facilities and equipment,along with the analytical and communication tools rapidly emerging through com-puter technology. Let me conclude with a few words about federal student aid programs. The asso- ciations I represent encourage increased support for student financial aid programsfunded by this subcommittee. My efforts are primarily directed at graduate stu-dents, but I know that many of them could never pursue graduate degrees withoutthe support of student aid at the undergraduate level. An increase in the maximumPell grant of $400, and additional support for the Supplemental Educational Oppor-tunity Grants (SEOG), the Perkins loan program, Federal Work Study, theLeveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships (LEAP) and TRIO programs are es-sential to assist needy students in accessing higher education without the accumula-tion of excessive debt. It is important to note that high debt loads are a substantialdeterrent to our minority and low income student populations in pursuing graduatedegrees. To have full participation of all students in the educational process, wemust work to reduce that financial barrier. In addition, I encourage, on behalf of these organizations, continued and increased support of the graduate education programs authorized under Title VII of the High-497 er Education Act. The Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need and Jacob Javits Programs support graduate students with financial need in the sciences, arts,humanities and social sciences. These programs reduce loan dependency, shortenthe time to degree and create incentives to enter essential but not particularly lu-crative careers, such as teaching and research. And finally, I encourage support forthe Title VI International Education Programs which are so important to the par-ticipation of students and faculty in today 's global community. Today, as I ask for your support, I also want to assure you that research institu- tions recognize their responsibilities in receiving such support by being accountableand responsible in the use of these funds. We take that responsibility very seriouslyand we know that this government-university partnership demands that we meetthose responsibilities. Thank you for this opportunity to express our views about funding for biomedical research and federal student aid programs, and I hope that the subcommittee col-leagues will be as successful in supporting these areas as it has been in recentyears. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE POPULATION ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND THE ASSOCIATION OF POPULATION CENTERS Thank you, Mr. Chairman for this opportunity to present the position of the Popu- lation Association of America (PAA) and the Association of Population Centers(APC) to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Educationon fiscal year 2001 funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), specificallythe National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development (NICHD). You are a long-standing friend of both organiza-tions and we want to emphasize how grateful we are for your appreciation and sup-port of demographic research. As you know, PAA is a scientific and educational society of professionals working in demographic research. APC is a consortium of 27 leading American populationresearch centers. In addition to their academic roles, members of both organizationsprovide federal, state and local government agencies, as well as private sector insti-tutions, with data and research to guide decision-making. Demographic research covers many issues important to our nation, such as retire- ment, minority health, disability and long term care, child care, immigration, laborforce participation, worker retraining, family formation and dissolution, and popu-lation forecasting. The United States is undergoing far-reaching shifts in its demo-graphic composition and distribution. Such changes often are not recognized or un-derstood until they confront society with new and immediate needs \u2014often requiring federal and state expenditures. Incorporating demographic, social and behavioral re-search into long term policy discussions allow such changes to be tracked and antici-pated in a manner that promotes more coherent and efficient planning and policyimplementation. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provide primary support for demographic re-search. We would like to take this opportunity to share with you information con-cerning aging, the effects of welfare reform on children and families, profiles of legalimmigrants, and changes in fatherhood. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (NICHD) NICHD has a well-established, successful population research program. NICHD is currently funded at $859.3 million with approximately $58.6 million of that budg-et dedicated to research funded through the Demographic and Behavioral SciencesBranch in fiscal year 1999. Among the many areas of demographic research sup-ported by NICHD are families and household composition; marriage and familychange; fertility and family planning; teen pregnancy; mortality; HIV prevention;and population movement, distribution and composition. NICHD also funds a highlyregarded population research centers program. Population research centers providea critical core of professionals who conduct research in a cost-effective manner. Fur-ther, the centers ' training programs are an essential source of population scientists who bring fresh perspectives, ideas and improved methodologies to demographic re-search. NICHD-supported demographic research provides important, ongoing information critical to policymakers. We are pleased to provide information in this testimonythat focuses on the Fatherhood Initiative, the effects of welfare reform on childrenand families, profiles of legal immigrants, and the Family and Child Well-Being Re-search Network.498 Fatherhood The decline of the incidence of marriage weakens the ties of men to women and children, with a resulting burden to the welfare system and to women and childrenthemselves. Thus, it is important to understand the conditions which help to sustainmen's participation in their family 's lives. NICHD, in conjunction with the Federal interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and the National Center on Fa-thers and Families, launched a Fatherhood Initiative to review the capacity of thefederal statistical system to conceptualize, measure and gather information frommen about how they became fathers and how they provide economic and emotionalsupport to their children. Among the results of this effort are the inclusion of men in the National Survey of Family Growth and the development of a father 's component in the Early Child- hood Longitudinal Survey and the inclusion of basic research on fathers in the EarlyHead Start Research and Evaluation Project. NICHD is also supporting research tounderstand factors leading to stable unions among unmarried fathers and mothers. The roles fathers play in the lives of their children are strongly affected by the father 's relationship to the mother: the access of fathers to their children is highest when parents are living together. In cases of divorce, a NICHD grantee has shownthat many fathers have enormous desire to maintain contact with their children,and with intervention can continue to be major influences in the lives of their chil-dren even after the divorce. Welfare Reform Effects on Children and Families The 1996 welfare reform act and the subsequent changes in the welfare programs of nearly every state constitute the greatest shift in social policy for low-income fam-ilies with children since the Social Security Act of 1935. Since the passage of welfarereform legislation, welfare caseloads have dropped 40 percent. Yet we know very lit-tle about how these changes will affect these children and families. Both positiveand negative scenarios can be constructed. The positive scenario is that leaving welfare for a job will make a mother feel more self-sufficient, raise her self-esteem, bolster her parenting behavior and pro-vide a better role model for her children to emulate. Critics point to the challengesof combining employment and parenting for single parents with few economic re-sources. Jobs are difficult to find, low paying, and often do not provide health insur-ance. Good and affordable child-care may be difficult to obtain. The risk for childrenis increased parental distress, poorer parenting, inadequate childcare and greatereconomic hardship. We simply do not know which scenario will prove most accurate over time. NICHD is supporting several projects to study the effects of welfare reform on chil-dren and families. The NICHD supported studies in several cities should provide uswith a clearer understanding of the ways that children and their families are af-fected by this momentous change in social policy. These in depth community basedstudies will examine the impact of support from family, community networks, andpublic programs in helping families make the transition to self-sufficiency while as-sessing the impact on child health and development. Research on Immigration Understanding the trends in immigration and the characteristics of immigrants is vital for making informed policy decisions. NICHD, the Immigration and Natu-ralization Service (INS), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the NationalInstitute on Aging (NIA) have cooperatively funded a New Immigrant Survey PilotStudy (NIP). This study will provide immediate policy relevant information on im-migrants in the U.S. and also serve as the foundation for long-term research on im-migrants. Much of the conventional wisdom on immigrants has been repudiated in recent NICHD supported studies. For example, legal immigrants are better schooled, onaverage, than the native born; the proportion with postgraduate education is almostthree times larger than among the native born, at the same time, there is also asubstantial group without a high school education. Overall, however, the quality oflegal immigrants entering the U.S. is improving. Influenced by changes in immigra-tion laws and changing economic conditions, the skill composition of immigrants tothe U.S. has risen. Family and Child Well-Being Research Network We would also like to bring you up-to-date on NICHD 's Family and Child Well- Being Research Network \u2014an interdisciplinary data system focusing on child- and family-related research that relies on cross-agency cooperation. This year the net-work has been renewed and expanded. The new network is comprised of scientists499 from nine universities collaboratively working with federal officials from NICHD, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, of the Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS), the Administration of Children and Families of HHS, theCensus Bureau and the Department of Education. This network currently addressesa variety of questions about the interrelations between parent characteristics, familystructure and organization, neighborhood attributes and different forms of socialsupport. The network is committed to increasing the visibility of basic research find-ings to those involved in formulating public policy. Projects such as the Family andChild Well-Being Research Network perform the important task of helping syn-thesize research into sensible policy solutions. The Network, in cooperation with federal statistical agencies and the research community developed a comprehensive set of indicators of child well-being. The in-formation from these indices are compiled annually in the report America 's Chil- dren: Key National Indicators of Well Being. This report provides a much improvedinformation base that summarizes the changes in the overall well-being of Americanchildren and families on an annual basis. PAA and APC enthusiastically support initiatives such as NICHD 's Family and Child Well-Being Research Network that provide quick access to data and are effi-cient and effective resources for time sensitive policy-related research in cross-dis-ciplinary fields. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING (NIA) The NIA also has a well established and widely respected demographic research program, which provides crucial information on the implications of an aging of theAmerican population for our country. Currently, the NIA is funded at $687.8 mil-lion, with approximately $39.6 million of that budget dedicated to demographic re-search \u2014training, career development, and demographic, economic and epidemiolog- ical research. As the U.S. population ages and Congress contemplates sweepingchanges in Medicare and Social Security, the demography of the elderly steadily be-comes more important. The NIA has a strong history of supporting the collectionof data, which allows demographers to study questions of concern to policymakers.Chief among these is the NIA-supported studies, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and its auxiliary survey, the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest-Old(AHEAD) study. You have been a solid supporter of these studies over the years,Mr. Chairman, and we would like to express our gratitude for your support. Health and Retirement Study The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) was launched in 1992 with baseline interviews for a representative sample of persons born between 1931 and 1941.These respondents were interviewed again in 1994, 1996 and 1998. The most recentround of data collection, HRS2000, is now in the field. Starting in 1993, the HRSwas augmented by the AHEAD (Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest-old \u2014 those born before 1924). The AHEAD respondents were interviewed in 1995, 1998and the survivors are being contacted now as part of HRS2000. In 1998, samplesof two other cohorts were added, those born between 1924 and 1930, the so-calledchildren of the Depression, and those born between 1942 and 1947, or the ''early baby-boomer cohort ''. With the addition of these cohorts, HRS is nationally rep- resentative of the population over age 50. Since 1998, the entire study is now re-ferred to at the HRS. The original HRS focused on mid-life work and health dynamics. Biennial data are now available for all respondents on health, disability, work, health insurance,pensions and retirement plans, and transfers to and from family. Using the originalHRS data, researchers have been able to explore issues related to health, work andretirement; prospects for economic security; cognitive changes, health insurance cov-erage and use of health care services. Researchers have long known that persons with higher levels of wealth and in- come have better health and live longer. The reasons for this relationship are notwell understood. Is it that income and wealth cause better health through betteraccess to health care? Or is it that poor health causes lower levels of wealth andincome by decreasing work, reducing earnings, and increasing health care expendi-tures? HRS panel data are shedding some light on these difficult questions. Aneconomist from RAND has recently shown, for example, that out-of-pocket healthexpenses account for only a small share of the reductions in wealth after an adversehealth event. Furthermore, those with health insurance have just as large a declinein wealth as those without health insurance. Subsequent to a major health event,middle-aged persons tend to reduce their work hours or retire completely and usetheir accumulated savings in place of earnings. These results have important impli-500 cations for spend-down to Medicaid eligibility and old-age poverty, especially for older women who tend to outlive their spouses. Education also is linked to health as well as wealth and income. Analyses of HRS by researchers suggest that education appears to have an enduring effect on healthdecisions. Among respondents who suffered a heart attack between the first twowaves of the HRS, 90 percent of college graduates quit smoking compared with only10 percent of those with less than high school education. Related HRS research alsoshows that, among middle-aged diabetics, education raises their health investmentin managing their disease through diet. Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest-Old (AHEAD) The companion survey of HRS, AHEAD, provides unique information on the dy- namics of health, economic resources and health care services. The study providesbadly needed data on the costs and burdens of chronic disease and the consequencesfor the extended family. AHEAD provides data on how families redistribute theirresources across generations, and how these flows interact with public sector trans-fers. AHEAD informs policy decisions on initiatives such as Medicare/Medicaid cov-erage for community long-term care and prescription drug benefits. In addition to economic factors, sustained activity, such as part time work and volunteering, are thought to affect the well-being and health of the very old.AHEAD data indicate that there is a beneficial effect of volunteer work on cognition,health and survivorship. Volunteer work also is associated with higher educationand wealth suggesting that social activities may be yet another pathway by whichsocio-economic status affects health, even in advanced old age. AHEAD data also corroborate improvements in old age health, respondents have shown little overall decline in basic cognitive functioning. Higher education is pro-tective of cognitive ability in old age. Finally, PAA and APC are interested in and support the current efforts to strengthen the Federal Forum on Aging Related Statistics that coordinates dataacross federal agencies. The forum is an example of NIA 's interest in supporting NIH's innovative endeavor of streamlining federal databases and making data ac- cessible to researchers from varied fields. CONCLUSION PAA and APC would like to thank you for the opportunity to present this informa- tion. Demographic data and research are important tools for policymakers that canboth save public funds and promote more informed decision-making. If this vital re-search is to continue producing relevant and timely information, adequate fundingand Congressional support are needed. The Population Association of America andthe Association Population Centers support an increase in the range of 15 percentto sustain the momentum of demographic research in the National Institutes ofHealth as part of the broadly based support to double the funding for the NIH overthe next 5 years. However, the increases that NIH has enjoyed have not been evenlyapplied amongst the various institutes; in particular, budgetary growth at NICHD,while significant, has not kept pace with many of the other institutes. PAA and APCalso support a more even distribution of any increase in funding for NIH. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PARKINSON 'SACTION NETWORK I am one of a million Americans afflicted with Parkinson 's disease and related dis- orders. I also am President of the Parkinson 's Action Network, which was created in 1991 to give a voice to our community in the effort to speed research deliveringbreakthroughs and a cure for this dreadful disorder. I have the job today of focusing your attention on the particular needs of my com- munity, and to convince you that the 2001 budget of the Labor-HHS Appropriationmust \u2014yes, must \u2014include a substantial increase for Parkinson 's-focused research funding. Why am I so emphatic?\u2014Because the current federal policy on Parkinson 's wastes billions in public and private dollars coping with its effects, when millions would produce a therapythat would restore function, and bring us back into the world. \u2014Because the disparity in funding attributable to variations, invisibility or polit- ical clout cannot continue. Parkinson 's\u2014the disorder .\u2014Parkinson 's is a movement disorder caused by the de- generation of brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurochemical controlling motorfunction. By the time 80 percent of those cells stop functioning, symptoms of stiff-ness, tremor and slowness of movement begin to emerge.501 The conventional treatment for Parkinson 's is a 30-year-old drug commonly known as ''L-dopa '' which attempts to replace the missing dopamine with an artifi- cial substitute. It usually restores function to a certain extent and it may seem atfirst like a miracle drug. But it works inefficiently, it produces side-effects, andeventually it does not work at all. As the dopamine cell degeneration advances, itstrips away automatic movements needed to walk, talk, swallow, even move at all. Despite the common myth that Parkinson 's only affects the oldest sector of the country, in fact the average age of symptom onset is 57, with a third of all victims ' symptoms starting in their 20 's, 30 's and 40 's. As a result, Parkinson 's-caused early retirements and forced disability are the norm. Some lose their jobs simply due tothe stigma. The financial impact is enormous. In my case, as a practicing lawyer and now running am advocacy organization for our community, these are my daily struggles: worrying about getting to a morningmeeting and wondering when my first dose of medication will ''kick in, '' enabling me to function; needing to make a phone call, but not being able to hold the tele-phone still with a shaking hand; seeing others put off by my lurching gait, or mytrembling hand. The impact on daily functioning .\u2014At some point the symptoms become an impos- sible hurdle, as the tiny number of dopamine neurons left functioning just can 't team up with the medication any more, and are complicated by drug side-effects.At that point, the swing between too little and too much movement is just too muchto manage in the outside world. We may continue living for a long time, but we dropout of sight. As a consequence, we have been neglected. For decades, NIH funding of Parkin- son's research has languished far behind many other diseases, and far short of the level warranted by the research promise. Estimated 1999 Parkinson 's-focused spending totaled less than $45 million, or $45 per patient. Although the NIH reportshigher figures, independent analysis of the actual projects NIH classifies as ''Parkin- son's research '' shows that only about one third of funding supports research actu- ally focused on understanding or curing the disease. This is a serious ongoing con-cern and I hope Congress will take steps to ensure more accurate accounting of NIHresearch funding. There is another important reason the Congress must increase Parkinson 's fund- ing in 2000. As federal taxpayers, we are owed a rational health spending policy.That requires spending money to cure us rather than just care for us. The cost to America .\u2014The cost of Parkinson 's in America is massive. In testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging in 1995, Dr. Ole Isacson of Harvardestimated the cost to be in excess of $25 billion. The Network 's surveys of the costs Parkinson 's disability incurs on the country \u2014in treatment, physical therapy, hos- pitalization, disability payments, lost productivity, and assisted living \u2014indicate an equal or greater amount, which translates into a massive burden on public sourcessuch as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security disability. The cost is so high because we typically live in a disabled state for a long time, and the battle against loss of function is ongoing, and expensive. Parkinson 's medi- cation alone is very expensive, probably costing Americans well over a billion dol-lars. The largest costs can be due simply to losing the ability to work or care foroneself, which is absorbed by the government through higher Social Security, Medi-care and Medicaid spending. This takes a huge toll on the American families hitby Parkinson 's, but it also burdens the society and hits the taxpayer. This massive financial waste will rise steeply if Parkinson 's is not cured before my generation of ''Baby Boomers '' hits the years when Parkinson 's symptoms are most prevalent. Imagine the additional burden of lost tax revenue, medical care anddisability from Baby Boomers with Parkinson 's. The scientific promise .\u2014An examination of the scientific promise of this disorder shows that an investment in Parkinson 's research would return many-fold. The Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives describes Parkinson 's as ''one of the brightest spots in brain research. '' There is no doubt that huge, revolutionary breakthroughs are coming, and they will drive breakthroughs for many other neurological and non-neurological disorders \u2014Huntington 's, ALS, Alzheimer 's, spinal cord injury, diabetes and more. Consider: \u2014Neural growth factors, animal studies have shown growth factors are capable of reviving dormant cells and producing dramatic symptomatic improvement.Further research, including human clinical trials, is needed. \u2014Neural cell transplantation, from a variety of sources, has shown that sympto- matic improvement results from the flourishing of transplanted dopamine neu-rons. A few patients are now symptom-free without medication.502 \u2014Advances in evidence and understanding of the links between Parkinson 's and environmental factors and chemical compounds such as heavy metals, herbi-cides and pesticides. \u2014Steady increase in insights into the exact disease process, in which the cells ap- pear to self-destruct after assaults from one or more of those causative factors. But without question, these discoveries are coming in slower than they need to. Many scientists describe immense frustration with the slow pace of working onthese breakthroughs because of the tiny research investment. That translates di-rectly into a breakthrough deferred into the future. According to testimony before the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Sub- committee last year by NINDS Director Dr. Gerald Fischbach, a focused and ade-quately funded research agenda could produce new Parkinson 's treatments or even an effective therapy or cure within 5 to 10 years. According to a study by Dr. RogerKurlan of the University of Rochester, even a 10 percent slowing of progression willsave $327 million per year. In recognition of both the current costs and tremendous scientific potential of Par- kinson 's disease, Congress requested the NIH develop a Parkinson 's-focused re- search agenda including professional judgment funding projections for the next 5years. The NIH held a 2-day interdisciplinary workshop that included a cross sec-tion of some of our nation 's top scientists, clinicians and advocates. This broad, interdisciplinary approach to evaluating the current state of Parkinson 's research must be continued to stimulate new ideas and ensure that the limited federal fund-ing is supporting the best, most promising research. Although this research agenda is a good first step and acknowledges the need for substantially increased federal research investment, it is not a complete and com-prehensive plan. For example, while the NIH research agenda calls for a $71.4 mil-lion increase in Parkinson 's research in fiscal year 2001, the Parkinson 's Action Net- work has worked in concert with the scientific community to identify $244 millionin research projects that could and should be funded in 2001. The NIH needs towork in close consultation with the research community, clinicians and patient ad-vocates to expand, revise and update the research agenda in order to remain rel-evant and identify the most promising areas of research. Congress should encourage the NIH to expand its use of innovative funding mech- anisms such as accelerated review, targeted research, research supplements andyoung investigator awards to attract a new generation of researchers into the field. And the resources are available to implement this increase. I applaud the hard work Congress has done the past two years to put the NIH budget on track to dou-ble over five years because of the benefits to all categories of medical research, andalso because it allows for the needed expansion in Parkinson 's-focused research. Conclusion .\u2014The human suffering that results from Parkinson 's is immense and incalculable. That alone is a good reason to invest in a cure. The fiscal drain com-pels it. At the request of Congress, the NIH has produced an initial plan to pursuea Parkinson 's cure. Congress must now follow through by providing the increase called for \u2014at least and additional $71.4 million in fiscal 2001 \u2014to capitalize on the unprecedented scientific opportunity. This directed increase for Parkinson 's is a small fraction of the projected overall NIH increase, and it would bring us one stepcloser to relieving the enormous burden Parkinson 's places on individuals, families and our nation as a whole. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CURE FORLYMPHOMA FOUNDATION Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin: Thank you for this opportunity to participate in the fiscal year 2001 process. I am a survivor of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma \u2014the second fastest rising cancer in the United States. I am also the founder and President of the Cure For Lymphoma Foundation (CFL), a nationwide, not-for-profit organization dedicated to funding research and supporting those whoselives have been touched by Hodgkin 's disease and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma. While other cancers are on the decline, non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma is one of two cancers where mortality rates continue to increase. The number of persons diagnosed withnon-Hodgkin 's lymphoma has doubled since the early 1970 's. Despite exceptional breakthroughs in understanding the biology of lymphomas, the causes remain un-known. Therefore, as the baby boomer population ages, this disease is expected todramatically increase. For this reason, CFL asks for your assistance in increasingfunding for lymphoma research so that we can find a cure for lymphoma before itbecomes a national epidemic.503 YOUR CONSTITUENTS WANT MORE LYMPHOMA RESEARCH Last year, in order to help heighten lymphoma awareness in Congress, CFL launched ''CAMPAIGN 64,000 ''\u2014a national letter writing campaign. In response, hundreds of advocates sent letters to you and your colleagues asking to makelymphoma a national priority. Patients from more than 31 states shared their hopesfor new research, as highlighted below: Susan of Wallingford, Pennsylvania .\u2014''I am writing to urge your support for mak- ing Hodgkin 's disease and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma cancers of the lymphatic sys- tem\u2014a national health priority. I care very deeply about breakthroughs in lymphoma research because I am the sister of a person with low-grade lymphoma. '' Patricia of Iowa City, Iowa .\u2014''My brother was recently diagnosed with non-Hodg- kin's lymphoma and currently there is only a 51 percent survival rate after 5 years. More money for biomedical research will bring us one step closer toward finding acure for lymphoma . . . and Washington .\u2014''I . . . urge your support for disease and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . . . a national health priority. I am a spouse of a survivor. My husband received chemotherapy in 1995, which severely damagedhis heart. Plus the chemo failed. He got into a clinical trial in 1996 and remainedin total remission until his death in January 1999, which was from heart failurecaused by the chemotherapy. Had the clinical trial drug (now FDA approved) beenavailable at the time he went through chemotherapy he would still be with metoday. '' LeVonia of Orange, Texas .\u2014''I have been fighting lymphoma for the past three years. When lymphoma strikes someone, her entire family is affected; it really takesa toll on the family \u2014physically, emotionally, financially. It is my hope that you . . . will work toward funding resources for finding better treatments and, ultimately acure for lymphoma. '' Marvin of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin .\u2014''Personally, I am 75 years old and have been in remission for the past ten months with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma which has no known cure. It is only because of a caring oncologist . . . and the professionalstaff that I have a new chance and outlook on life. It is most likely that the cancerwill return. My second oldest son, 48 years of age, has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma/lymphomcetic leukemia, which according to authorities is not hereditary. His case is far worse than mine. Your support for the much neededfunds will be greatly appreciated not only by researchers but by the thousands ofpersons searching for a cure. '' Patricia of Phoenix, Arizona .\u2014''My father was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma (low-grade, B-cell) in 1992 and has undergone various treatments overthe past 7 years. Fortunately, he has been able to take advantage of some of thenewly developed and approved treatments and medications, which have prolongedhis life. He 's been lucky in that respect, but there is no cure yet. Please take the next step by making finding the cause and cure for lymphoma a national priority! '' Earl of Los Altos, California .\u2014''I am a survivor (so far). The follicular type I have is currently incurable, and I have suffered with it for over 12 years. There are veryexciting new possible treatments such as antiangiogenisis inhibitors and other ap-proaches that offer hope of real cures. Increased funding would offer new hope forfinding a cure before I die. '' INCREASED NCI FUNDING HAS IMPROVED THE LIVES OF LYMPHOMA PATIENTS As Dr. Richard Klausner, Director of the NCI shared in his written testimony sub- mitted to your subcommittee in March, increased funding for the NCI led to the de-velopment of a new tool, called the ''Lymphomachip. '' This will assist doctors in identifying which patients will respond to chemotherapy and which patients shouldconsider instead alternative therapies like bone marrow or stem cell transplant.Thanks to this new tool, many patients will not have to undergo unnecessary chem-otherapy treatment as they have in the past. With your encouragement the NCI has taken an important initial step towards ''identifying disease specific priorities '' by undertaking a Progress Review Group (PRG) on Lymphoma, Leukemia and Myeloma, this fall. The PRGs are importantbecause they are comprised of researchers, health professionals, industry and advo-cates who together (1) assess the state of knowledge, (2) identify scientific oppor-tunity and need and (3) chart a course for further research. We are hopeful thisPRG will help outline and prioritize a national research agenda for these three hem-atologic malignancies.504 YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE HAS TWICE ENDORSED LYMPHOMA REPORT LANGUAGE \u2014IT IS TIME TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP Your Subcommittee endorsed lymphoma-specific language last year that was adopted as part of Senate Report 106 -166 and the previous year as part of Senate Report 105 -300. This year we ask that you continue your support in funding the research essential to improving treatments and finding a cure for lymphoma. Spe-cifically, we ask you: \u2014To encourage the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institute of Envi- ronmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion (CDC), Department of Defense (DOD), Veterans Administration (VA), aswell as other key agencies to develop a national agenda for lymphoma and toexpand research into lymphoid malignancies; \u2014To ensure funds are available to support new research opportunities; and \u2014To further investigate potential environmental, bacterial and viral factors asso- ciated with development of lymphoma. Finally, we thank you for your consideration in this matter. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. PREPARED STATEMENT OF MENDED HEARTS , INC. My name is Warren Greenberg. I am a professor of health economics and of health care sciences at The George Washington University. I am married and havea 25-year-old daughter. I advocate an increased appropriation for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood In- stitute. I am a victim of heart disease and as a beneficiary of the efforts of medicalresearchers to overcome this disease. I might also add that I am a member of Mend-ed Hearts, Inc., a support group of 24,000 members throughout the United States.I have been appointed lobbying and legislation chairperson of that group \u2014a volun- teer position. I am 57 years old. I was born with aortic stenosis, a narrowing of the heart valve. Throughout my entire life I have lived with heart disease, often incredibly severe. When I was in my early teens, my physicians did not allow me to play high-school inter-mural sports, although I was a fine young athlete. At the age of eighteen Iwas told not to play ball under any circumstances. In my early 20s I was told toclimb no more than two flights of stairs. By my early and mid-thirties I began toclimb steps more and more slowly, often pausing to rest. I never carried an attache \u00b4 case home from work. It was too heavy. I would often balance a large book on my hips, rather than carrying it outright, in order to blunt the weight. I would walktwo or three blocks on a level street to avoid going up three or four steps at theend of particular blocks. I could barely lift my newborn child; I could not help mywife take in the grocery bags. On May 7, 1982, at the age of 39, I had open-heart surgery at the Cleveland Clin- ic to replace my diseased valve with the valve of a pig. After my six-week recuper-ative period I was amazed to find that not only was I able to walk, but was alsoable to play tennis, to jog, and to exercise. I was able to live a normal life. By August 1988, however, my new valve had failed. On August 31, I again had cardiac surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to replace the failed pig valve with an artifi-cial plastic valve, known as the St. Jude 's valve. I am again able to live a relatively normal, very productive life. And I am deeply thankful for it. I still take a blood-thinning medicine, coumadin, which helps prevent clots on my new valve. At the same time, because of the medicine, I must be cognizant and care-ful of excessive bleeding. In 1983 I contracted bacterial endocarditis, an infection ofthe heart valve, from dental surgery which kept me in the hospital for six weeks.Whenever, I have dental work, I now get intravenous penicillin to protect meagainst such infections. I realize that my valve, as a mechanical device, may failat any time in the future. For nearly 18 years, thanks to the fruits of medical research, I have been able to travel abroad at least once a year, to jog in the park, to be a productive authorof many scholarly articles and a number of books on the health care economy. I have been quoted often on my views of the U.S. health care system and have made manytelevision appearances. If it were not for the advances in research leading to im-proved techniques in open-heart surgery, I would not have seen my fortieth birth-day. I would not be able to look forward to a life of many rewards and enjoyments. As an economist. I observe continually the link between monetary resources and the development of innovation and technology. Health care research, and cardio-vascular research in particular, is no exception. I also understand as an economistthat there are always competing uses for appropriated monies. However, cardio-505 vascular diseases last year killed more than 950,000 Americans, more than 151,000 of whom are under age 65. Despite advances in medical research, these diseases re-main the number one killer in the United States and a leading cause of disability.From my personal perspective and for those in Mended Hearts Inc. and others inthe United States who have heart disease or will get it in their lifetime, consistentwith congressional resolutions for the National Institutes of Health, I ask for a dou-bling of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute budget by year 2003. To reachthis funding goal, I advocate a fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $2.330 billion forthe NHLBI to help reduce further the incidence and degree of heart disease. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ERINBOSCH I am submitting this testimony because I am convinced that together we can make a difference. I submit this testimony on behalf of the almost one million Amer-icans that are living today with consequences of congenital heart disease in our na-tion. For the last four years I have worked as an advocate for the American HeartAssociation and during that time I have seen the difference that being a public ad-vocate can make in people 's lives. Since my diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at age eight, I have been through many procedures, both for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, includ-ing open heart surgery at the Mayo Clinic. I have had numerous doctor and hospitalvisits and I will take medication every day for the rest of my life. I will never com-pete in athletics again, which I dearly loved. I face the possibility of many more pro-cedures during my lifetime. Clearly, the success of additional research could makemy adult years more hopeful. I anticipate that when the day comes for me to beara child of my own, I will be able to say with certainty he or she will be born freeof heart disease. Most people know that heart disease is the number one killer and a leading cause of disability in adults, but few recognize that congenital heart defects are the mostcommon defect in new born babies. Every year thirty two thousand children areborn with a congenital heart defect. I was one of them. Twenty one hundred of thesechildren will die before their first birthday. I am one of the lucky ones. I am confident these statistics can be changed. I have addressed the Committee for the last three years about the importance of continued research for heart diseaseand every year you have come through with critical research dollars. It was fundingthat this Committee provided that has allowed for the successful research and de-velopment of surgical procedures, pacemakers and intracardiac defibrillators thatmyself and other children depend on. Other devices and procedures are in thethrows of development as we speak which depend on the continuance of these re-search dollars. I have great faith in the determination of our scientific researcherswho work day and night to find new treatment methods for those who suffer withillness and disease. I also have great faith in you as the doorkeepers of govern-mental funding to continue to provide the necessary funds for children who havebeen born with heart defects. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CORE F OUNDATION KEY ISSUES FOR HIV /AIDS We are at a critical point in the care of patients with HIV/AIDS. We have achieved major goals in our basic science understanding of the course of HIV diseaseand have applied this understanding to the care of patients. Recent breakthroughsin drug therapies give reason to be hopeful for the successful treatment of HIV/AIDS. Throughout the country, we have witnessed a steady decline in the number of hospital admissions for AIDS care and outpatient clinics are experiencing a dra-matic increase in the demand for out-patient care and services. These successeshave led to increased numbers of AIDS patients surviving longer and once again be-coming productive members of society. Although science has taken big steps towardmaking AIDS a long-term manageable disease, by no means do we have a cure forthe largest public health crisis of the century. These favorable trends can be attributed in part to advances in opportunistic in- fection prevention and to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). There areover 200 potent combinations of antiretroviral treatments that can be used in the506 1Centers for Disease Control HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, June 1998.fight against HIV/AIDS. For each of these different regimens and drug combina- tions, there is a wide variation in a patient 's adherence. With the hectic pace of the development and release of new drug treatments and care regimens for HIV/AIDS patients, it can be difficult even for specialty-care pro-viders, and much more so for community-based care providers, to keep abreast ofthe most recent advances in care and medication usage. Without the ability to keepup with new drug developments, disease management is difficult, if not impossible,for community-based providers and patients. While the technology exists to implement sophisticated education networks for HIV/AIDS, there is no successful system in place that provides caregivers and pa-tients the education and scientific tools needed to ensure that they make the mostof the advances in care. Additionally, recent research has shown that the disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among inner-city, minority populations is due in large part to low ratesof adherence and lack of effective community-based, comprehensive, health edu-cation and training systems for providers and patients. Lack of access to up-to-date information also hinders the ability of patients to fully understand the importance of adhering to their prescribed therapy. Unfortu-nately, incomplete adherence with medication regimens greatly increases the risk ofthe emergence of strains that are resistant to the newest therapies thus increasingthe likelihood of the spread of HIV/AIDS. Low rates of adherence can most often be attributed to the following:Cost. \u2014The cost for HAART therapy is enormous, as much as $10,000 -$15,000 per patient per year. Although the federal program, AIDS Drug Assistance Program(ADAP), is designed to provide financial assistance for uninsured or underinsuredHIV/AIDS patients in purchasing required medications, it has been unable to keep up with the increasing demands; Testing. \u2014Many individuals are still hesitant to be tested for HIV and often go without a diagnosis. As a result, patients go without care until the symptoms be-come evident and they are in need of immediate services. Delays in testing resultin patients who are much sicker when they present for therapy. Education .\u2014Many HIV infected patients are unable to get timely clinical care or to adhere to complex and difficult drug regimens. Often patients have little or nounderstanding of newer therapies and their potential benefit, resulting in low levelsof adherence and decreased health status. Disparities among inner city, minority populations are also evident in the effec- tiveness of HAART therapies. While there have been dramatic new developmentsin HIV care due to these new and more powerful medications, including a 42 per-cent decrease in the death rate from AIDS, 1the outcomes have not been as positive for minority populations. This disparity in opportunistic infection trends between population groups most reflects differences in access to the full range of new therapies now available. It isalso indicative of a lack of targeted outreach, education and adherence enforcementefforts aimed at high risk populations and at those lifestyles which contribute sig-nificantly to the transmission of HIV. The treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS in Chicago and other urban areas is made more difficult by the large number of patients receiving care and the largenumber of potential patients whose infections have not been diagnosed who will ulti-mately need care. Specialists alone are not able to provide primary care for all affected patients, es- pecially those in underserved communities. This means that other providers needto be trained in the complicated care of patients with HIV/AIDS to insure that thenew HIV medications are used appropriately and to the greatest benefit for all pa-tients. To be effective, these community providers must have current medical data and protocols at their fingertips. They must be able to access immediate expertise to en-sure the most accurate interventions and care for patients. Today, due to the lackof use of computerized clinical information systems in health care, especially forHIV/AIDS care, they are often unable to access this type of critical information orfeedback in a timely fashion. 21ST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY FOR EDUCATION AS THE KEY While many piecemeal technology based health education systems for HIV/AIDS exist throughout the United States, there are none that are taking full advantageof today 's cutting-edge scientific landscape.507 The adoption of computerized clinical information systems in health care lags be- hind the use of computers in most other sectors of the economy. There is no HIVeducational system that provides care, clinical assistance and interactive education,while integrating the patients and community-based providers into the care givingand decision-making process. Especially given today 's technological advances, this is a striking deficiency in health education systems for HIV/AIDS. At this critical time in the evolution of the long-term treatment of HIV/AIDS, it is important that we focus on the creation and implementation of comprehensiveprovider and patient education and training systems. This focus will: \u2014Improve ability to manage disease and related conditions; \u2014Improve treatment and prevention efforts; \u2014Increase the rate of the early detection of HIV; \u2014Increase the rate of treatment adherence; and, \u2014Decrease the spread of HIV. The Department of Health and Human Services has recognized that effective edu- cation of providers and patients as well as adherence management programs are theonly way to prevent those behaviors that lead to the spread of resistant strains ofHIV. It is critical that the Federal Government continue to focus its resources oncreating comprehensive HIV education and training systems that fully integratespecialists, community-based providers and patients and evaluate the outcomes ofthose systems. The CORE Center believes that the most effective educational system is one which uses today 's state-of-the-art technology and creates interactive networks of education that provide real-time feedback and enables providers to optimize care forHIV/AIDS patients. Thus, the Center has proposed the Community and Minority Education and Training Initiative (COMET) for HIV/AIDS which maximizes the Center 's extensive technological resources and care expertise to create and implement a unique, re-gional HIV/AIDS education and training network for HIV/AIDS providers and pa-tients in community based settings, especially minority communities. THE COMMUNITY AND MINORITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING INITIATIVE To address this significant health crises in the minority communities specifically, the African American community, The CORE Center in Chicago, Illinois, proposesthe implementation of its ''Community and Minority Education and Training (COMET) Initiative ''. This initiative will demonstrate the significant improvements in care, prevention and education services through the use of a regional computernetwork. COMET will expand upon existing technology at the CORE Center to pro-vide computer assisted patient shared decision making and HIV/AIDS education,training and care feedback to providers and patients in the Chicago metropolitanarea. This demonstration project will create a national model of a technology-based edu- cation and training system for specialty and non-specialty, community-based HIV/AIDS care providers as well as the education of HIV/AIDS patients. It will addressan existing national need in minority communities for the effective integration ofeducational programs to enhance provider performance and improve provider and patient ability to manage disease. It will improve patient response and adherenceto treatment regimens and place emphasis on the incorporation of patients into ashared decision making process. The Community and Minority Education and Training Initiative will result in sev- eral key outcomes including: \u2014Improve non-specialist and patient access to the most current information on HIV/AIDS care, treatment, and drug protocols \u2014Provide critical and, as of yet non-existing, access to immediate feedback for providers to proposed patient care regimens \u2014Facilitate the supervised integration of community-based providers into the care of HIV/AIDS \u2014thus expanding patient access to care for HIV/AIDS \u2014Provide a model for computer assisted patient shared decision making \u2014Improve physician 's and patient 's ability to manage HIV/AIDS and related in- fectious diseases. \u2014Improve patient adherence to complex care regimens \u2014Improve surveillance and response efforts at the local, state and federal levels \u2014Increase providers ' ability to identify population specific treatment and care issues \u2014Reduce the emergence of additional resistant strains of HIV/AIDS508 \u2014Provide nationally relevant outcomes data that will be useful to cities across the United States as they grapple with issues of access, adherence, and cost andquality of care. Through the implementation of a community-wide HIV education and training network, this initiative will provide nationally relevant outcomes data which will beuseful to cities across the United States as they grapple with issues of access, adher-ence, and cost and quality of care. The CORE Center, with its location in the heart of an inner-city, minority neigh- borhood, its single-site location for comprehensive HIV outpatient services, screen-ing clinic, and its state-of-the-art information system, is uniquely positioned to im-plement this technology-based provider and patient education initiative. Addition-ally, because the Center 's population is predominately African American and Latino, it will provide a unique model for improving the quality, efficacy and cost of carefor minority populations through the use of a technology based education system forproviders and patients of HIV/AIDS care. Project COMET will demonstrate the efficacy of the technology-based education and training system in the following areas: Education .\u2014Demonstrate the ability of a technology based educational system (or distance learning system) to update and educate specialty and community-basedproviders and to educate and involve patients in a shared decision-making process. Early Intervention .\u2014Demonstrate the effect of a technology based educational sys- tem on the ability of the community-based and specialty care providers to targetHIV screening of inner-city populations with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),so that advances in HIV care will be made available as early as possible in thecourse of HIV disease and prevent risky behaviors that result in the spread of theHIV and related infectious diseases; Adherence .\u2014Demonstrate the ability of the system to enable non-specialty and community-based care providers to implement an aggressive adherence program toensure the application of sound treatment principles and protocols, medication ad-herence and clinical follow-up of inner-city, minority patients; and, Outcomes Research .\u2014Collect and analyze data to measure patient outcomes, the cost of care by different specialty and community-based providers as well as patientand provider adherence. In addition, this initiative will disseminate these findings. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony for the record. We very much appreciated your support in fiscal year 2000 in securing the initial $1.25 million for this important initiative. We look forward to working with you tosecure the remaining $8.75 million in federal funding to complete this nationallysignificant initiative that will thoroughly examine the effectiveness of a technologybased educational system on the improvement of care and treatment of HIV/AIDS.Lessons learned from this important initiative will be beneficial not only to the Fed-eral Government as it endeavors to develop appropriate HIV/AIDS policy, but to cit-ies across the nation as they grapple with this very complex issue, especially as itpertains to minority communities where the epidemic is expanding most rapidly. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PINON COMMUNITY SCHOOL BOARD , INC. Thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony regarding the fiscal year 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education budget. We are pleased with thelong-overdue emphasis that has been placed on Indian programs in the proposed fis-cal year 2001 budget. The critical needs of Indian Country 's educational system in particular rise above partisanship, recognized by leaders on both sides of the aisleas a pressing concern worthy of renewed attention by the U.S. Congress. With thisin mind we ask that, at a minimum, your committee fully support the direct andindirect funds for services to Indian students contained in the Administration 's re- quest, including the following: \u2014$115.5 million overall for Indian Education \u2014$10 million for continuation of the Indian Teacher Corps program \u2014$5 million to create an American Indian Administrator Corps \u2014$2.7 million to support comprehensive Federal research on Indian education \u2014$20 million for Special Programs for Indian Children \u2014$50 million earmark for Title I grants to 119 LEAs with at least 50 percent of their students residing on Indian lands \u2014$200 million earmark under the School Modernization Bonds proposal for ren- ovations and repairs to Indian schools \u2014$175 million for Indian Head Start programs \u2014$460 for bilingual education including Native language instruction materials.509 Our community of 11,000 is comprised of Pinon and seven other Chapters of the Navajo Nation. While we have made much progress in recent years, our communitysuffers many of the same problems that plague tribal communities nationwide. In1990, more than one-third of all Indian children ages 5 to 17 were living below thepoverty level. The high school completion rate for Indians ages 20 to 24 is 12.5 per-cent below the national average. The problems we face are deeply entrenched andwill not change overnight, but your full support for budget increases in the areaslisted above will represent a critical step toward empowering tribal schools in ourefforts to confront and reverse these troubling statistics. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Indian Education. \u2014The Administration 's request for $115.5 million for Indian Education in fiscal year 2001 represents an important step toward addressing long-time shortfalls in this area. We urge you to fully support this request and relatedfunding to benefit educational efforts in Indian Country. We strongly support the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 request for $92.8 mil- lion in Grants to LEAs for activities to improve the educational achievement of In-dian students. The proposed budget also contains $20 million for Special Programsfor Indian Children, a much-needed increase for which we also ask your full sup-port. American Indian Teachers and Administrators. \u2014We are particularly excited about the Administration 's request for funding to recruit, train, and provide in-serv- ice professional development for American Indian teachers and administrators. Insupport of the President 's 1998 Executive Order on Indian Education, the proposed budget includes $10 million for continuation of the Indian Teacher Corps programand a new $5 million initiative to create an American Indian Administrator Corpsto recruit, train, and provide professional development for American Indians in thefield of school administration. We strongly support this request. HEAD START A critical element in any effort to raise the academic achievement level of stu- dents in Indian Country must be high-quality early childhood education programs.There is overwhelming evidence that programs like Head Start lay the groundworkfor developing effective learning skills that can have a lifelong impact on a child 's education. Therefore, we urge the Subcommittee to take the following actions withrespect to Head Start: \u2014Fully fund the Administration 's fiscal year 2001 budget request of $6.3 billion for the Head Start program, including at least the requested level of $175 mil-lion for Indian Head Start programs \u2014Prioritize the construction of badly-needed tribal Head Start facilities; and, \u2014Encourage the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allow tribal organizations to administer Head Start programs under Public Law 93 -638 self- determination contracts. Program Access for More Eligible Children. \u2014At the Pinon Community School, we see regular, concrete evidence that children who have attended Head Start are moreprepared to learn when they graduate to our school. Unfortunately, the currentfunding level does not allow us to serve all of our area 's Head Start-eligible children. The Pinon Head Start program serves 20 children, plus another 30 children thoughhome-based instruction. That said, at least 391 children are eligible for comprehen-sive Head Start services, but we lack the funding and facilities to expand our pro-gram. They are falling through the cracks, and there is no second-chance at thesecritical learning years. We want every child in our community to have the early educational attention they deserve. We strongly support the Administration 's long-range goal of increasing Head Start enrollment to one million. If the Subcommittee fully funds the Adminis-tration 's fiscal year 2001 budget request of $6.3 billion, nearly 950,000 children can be reached by Head Start, and 54,000 toddlers could reap the benefits of Early HeadStart. These are not just numbers, they are each individual lives being shaped,someone 's child that will have a better chance at fulfilling their dreams in life. We ask your support for these children at the onset of their educational journey. Replacement Facility Construction. \u2014Without funding to build new \u2014and safe \u2014fa- cilities, the goal of increasing Head Start enrollment to one million will be meaning-less to Pinon. Currently, our Head Start program is located in a 20-year-old class-room that only accommodates 20 students. In order to expand services to even afraction of the 391 children who are eligible for Head Start in our area, we will needan additional building. Other areas suffer similar facilities constraints on their pro-grams. We ask you to allocate a specific portion of the fiscal year 2001 Head Start510 appropriation for facility needs to break down this barrier to access for additional eligible children. Tribal Administration of Local Head Start Programs. \u2014Section 102 of the Indian Self-Determination Act (Public Law 93 -638) directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with tribes to operate federally-funded programsfor their members. DHHS, however, has interpreted this provision narrowly to re-quire contracting only of programs ''operated for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians. '' Thus, only Indian Health Service programs are deemed contractible by DHHS. We would like to be able to contract to administer Head Start programs as a di- rect grantee under the American Indian Programs Branch of the Head Start Bu-reau. The Pinon Community School Board has successfully contracted educationprograms since 1988 and has continually improved student services during this timeperiod. The Board believes that administering a tribal Head Start program througha self-determination contract would be beneficial to the community and the partici-pating children. It would decrease the amount of federal bureaucracy that we mustnavigate by allowing us to receive all of our funds directly from Head Start usingone funding document and would give us the flexibility to run our local programsto meet local needs. Currently, we receive our funding from the Chinle Agency,which in turn receives the funding through the Navajo Nation, Division of DineEducation, Department of Head Start. We ask you to consider including report language in the fiscal year 2001 LHHS- Ed Appropriations bill that would encourage the Secretary to work with tribes tofully implement the Indian Self-Determination Act so that tribal organizations maycontract Head Start. BILINGUAL EDUCATION We urge your Committee to provide the full $460 million requested for Bilingual and Immigrant Education. In addition, we ask that you take steps to ensure fundingwithin this budget for the dissemination of instruction materials in Native lan-guages. In 1994, Congress authorized the Secretary of Education to provide grants to de- velop, publish, and disseminate instructional materials in Indian, Native Hawaiian,Pacific Islander, and outlying territories languages. This program has never beenfunded. We urge the Subcommittee to include report language instructing the Sec-retary to allocate fiscal year 2001 funding for this purpose. At Pinon, 86 of our students are considered to have Limited English Proficiency. It is our goal to provide these children with comprehensive bilingual education sothat they can learn English and meet challenging academic standards while main-taining a knowledge of and respect for their native language. To meet this goal, itis critical that we have funding to train personnel and develop innovative bilingualeducation programs at the local level. CONCLUSION Thank you for considering our concerns and comments. The Pinon Community School appreciates the funding that the Subcommittee has provided in the past toprograms of concern to our school, and we look forward to your continued support. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELMIRA COLLEGE , ELMIRA , NY Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony for the record regarding Elmira College 's proposed Technology Enhancement Initiative. Today, unlike any other time in history, we have a substantial opportunity to apply the information age technologies to schools that are so effective outside theclassroom for educational purposes. For schools to make the most of this oppor-tunity, they must rethink education from the ground up. The power of information technologies to reshape education is already becoming unmistakable. In scattered locations around the country, schools are using state-of-the-art technologies and interactive multi-media to engage students more actively in learning and to teach them skills they will need to thrive in an information basedworkplace and world. This is particularly true with non-traditional students whohave little if any access to traditional classrooms and educational services. As information age infrastructure is developed, more and more students and teachers will gain access to a global web of information and exchange ideas, servicesand education globally.511 The Internet and other information technologies are bringing interactive instruc- tion to schools in our cities and suburbs. Importantly, the past several years havewitnessed a stronger focus on providing those information technologies in ruralareas of the country. These technologies are allowing students to build ''commu- nities '' with their counterparts around the world and create lifelong beneficial links between schools and the communities around them. Taking advantage of this new capability will require profound changes in the roles of teachers, students and schools. Instead of being the repository of knowledge,teachers will be guides who will help students navigate through electronically acces-sible information. They will use the new technologies to build networks with eachother, with parents and students, with academic and industrial experts and withother professionals. In order to ensure that students (K -12, undergraduate, graduate, continuing edu- cation or professional development students, students in rural areas) receive the fullpotential of the technology age, the technological access must exist in flexible loca-tions and provide continuous access to their extended communities. Equally as im-portant, teachers must receive extensive training in how to use existing and emerg-ing information technologies and how to design and implement appropriate cur-ricula for a state-of-the-art 21st Century classroom. To make technology a viable instructional and professional development tool re- quires schools to have enough computers to provide full easy access for all studentsincluding students with disabilities. Institutions of higher education are central to the national effort to ensure that all students and teachers are equipped to take full advantage of the technology era.By providing education, training, and technical assistance these institutions canwork in partnership with local school districts, human service agents and profes-sionals to address problems associated with the rapid onset of the information age,including: educational, economic and social infrastructure of their surrounding com-munities. Elmira College is an institution of higher education that accepts that responsi- bility willingly, recognizing the benefit to its students, students in surroundingschool systems and community colleges, and individuals in nearby communities inneed of continuing education or professional development. As such, it is imple-menting its ''Technology Enhancement Initiative '' to address its own and regional educational and technology training needs. THE ''TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVE '' AT ELMIRA COLLEGE As it approaches the 21st Century, Elmira College, in Elmira New York, stands at an important crossroads in the development and expansion of its educational re-sources. To ensure its continued strength as a four-year institution of higher edu-cation the College is proposing the implementation of its ''Technology Enhancement Initiative '' to relocate and improve its technology infrastructure. This initiative will address the ever-growing need in the southern tier of New York and northern tier of Pennsylvania for access to higher education, teacher tech-nology education and training and professional development services. It will providethe College the opportunity to expand its technology resources and to meet its own and regional technological and services demands. Elmira College proposes to establish a partnership with the Federal Government that will: \u2014Relocate, consolidate and improve all student and administrative computing services from McGraw Hall, which is handicapped inaccessible, to the Gannett-Tripp Library which is handicapped accessible; \u2014Upgrade existing ''hub'' hardware to state-of-the-art technology which will be able to meet and manage the demands of the upgraded system; and, \u2014Wire every dormitory, classroom and administrative meeting room as well as every faculty, academic, and administrative office building for direct access tothe Gannett-Tripp Library, the Steele Memorial Public Library and an interfacewith the local public library system and with the Internet. As a result of the improvement to its technological infrastructure, Elmira College will have the opportunity to expand existing and implement several new educationaland training programs in partnership with local school systems and human serviceagencies. Specifically, the initiative will enable the College to: \u2014Offer access to higher education courses in 12 rural and underserved counties and 21 K -12 school districts (58,308 students), 8 community colleges and a vari- ety of community sites via distance learning;512 \u2014Offer access to Elmira College library resources, including the federal depository at the College, at a variety of community sites via distance learning to under-served counties; \u2014Provide teacher technology education and training both on and off campus; \u2014Provide expanded professional development and technology education and train- ing services; \u2014Provide leadership and technical assistance to local K -12 systems in the devel- opment of state-of-the-art technologically advanced classrooms and prepare itsEducation students (future teachers) and regional teachers to teach effectivelyin this technologically advanced era. In addition to the obvious educational benefits that the Elmira College ''Tech- nology Enhancement Initiative '' will have for the College and its students, there are several significant benefits for teachers in the regional community. As a result of the Technology Enhancement Initiative, Elmira College will have the opportunity to work in partnership with regional school systems to address theeducation and training needs of their teachers and staff. Elmira College will work to identify technology education and training expertise in the region and the nation and work with local school districts to develop criticalprofessional linkages needed for the local school system to take full advantage ofthat expertise for their students. In addition, as part of its own curricula, Elmira will provide expanded in-depth technology education and training for students in its Masters of Education pro-grams. The Technology Enhancement Initiative will provide Elmira College the ability to offer these teacher education and training courses through any of its distance learn-ing capabilities to teachers in the classroom, on-site at their own schools, at locallibraries, community colleges or even in the home. Graduate students at Elmira willcontinue their training within the local schools, but will have an increased abilityto conduct classroom observations, information exchanges and training as a resultof the Technology Enhancement Initiative. To do so, the College will expand existing and implement new education, training and professional development programs, including courses such as Computers inEducation, Interactive Media for Educators, The Internet for Educators, Video Pro-duction for Educators, and Microcomputer Applications for Educators. Finally, itwill provide the College with the opportunity to play a leading role in improvingthe social and economic infrastructure of the region. The Technology Enhancement Initiative will create an expanded opportunity for cooperation in the provision of higher education courses between Elmira College andlocal community colleges. It will help those institutions to provide timely and rel-evant programming at the same time it helps to prevent unnecessary duplicationof academic programs and/or courses at Elmira or the community colleges. As it is proposed, the relocation, expansion, and consolidation of all computing functions at Elmira College will provide three methods of distance learning in thefuture, including: \u2014Computer Based Research \u2014Internet Conferencing \u2014Compressed Video Students and professionals in the field will have the ability to access education, training or professional development from home (if the connection exists) from li-braries, other designated community sites or from any of the eight sites where El-mira currently provides minimal Elmira College will have the ability to share faculty experiences across institu- tions and establish partnerships on select courses with regional community colleges,including general education courses, courses to support selected major requirements,and coursework providing a valuable supplement to existing offerings. Elmira Col-lege currently holds articulation agreements with three regional community collegesthat will be expanded as a result of the Technology Enhancement Initiative. Thoseinstitutions include: \u2014Tompkins Cortland Community College \u2014Corning Community College513 \u2014Broome Community College To enable the completion of this important initiative, Elmira College is seeking $3,399,000 million in federal support. To date, the College has invested $500,000 incampus infrastructure in preparation for the implementation of this initiative (thesedollars are not counted as part of the official project cost, but are calculated intothe College 's contribution). The College is firmly committed to the completion of the project and the implementation of this important and enabling technology infra- structure and therefore will contribute an additional $1 million towards the totalcost of the initiative. Total project cost is $5,923,680 million. Mr. Chairman, this initiative is critical to the long-term economic viability of El- mira College as well as the regional the K -12, undergraduate, graduate, continuing education and professional development systems in the southern tier of New Yorkand the southern tier of Pennsylvania. We look forward to working with you to se-cure the final phase of funding for this very important initiative in fiscal year 2001. Again, thank you for the opportunity to present this testimony for the record. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NORTHWEST REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL LABORATORY My name is Dr. Ethel Simon-McWilliams, and I am the CEO and Executive Direc- tor of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (NWREL), in Portland, Or-egon. I take this opportunity to share with you the need for trained Retired andSenior Citizen Reading Tutors; and, a program that the NWREL has proposed fortraining these citizens so that they can serve more effectively as reading tutors forchildren, youth and adults. America now enjoys not only the largest and fastest-growing group of older adults in our history, but the healthiest, most vigorous, and best educated. According toa 1999 survey of older Americans, engaging in community service is an importantpart of the retirement plans of most seniors. More than half of older Americanspolled have volunteered within the past year in their communities, and workingwith children and youth has been a top priority for their time and talent. At the same time, school districts are struggling to meet the needs of low per- forming students to increase their reading achievement. Local school districts acrossthe nation are faced with restricted budgets, larger class sizes and reduced servicesfor students with special needs. Thirty-eight percent of fourth-graders read belowbasic level and lack even partial mastery of reading skills needed for proficientgrade-level work. By 12th grade, 23 percent of students remain below basic level.These struggling readers are disproportionately from families living in poverty. The experience of the federal America Reads Challenge in 1998 and 1999 clearly showed that adults who are effectively prepared to be reading tutors can have apositive effect on students ' achievement. The Northwest Regional Educational Lab- oratory has provided a range of supports to volunteer service programs since 1995,and in 1998 -1999 was selected by the Corporation for National Service as the na- tional provider of training and technical assistance to education-focused senior pro-grams. The Northwest Laboratory examined reading tutor programs across thecountry and found, among other things, that the success of a tutoring program rideson the abilities, energy, and commitment of its volunteer tutors, as well as a strongschool capacity and support for tutors. One-on-one tutoring is clearly shown to be the most effective use of retired and senior volunteers. Senior tutors provide children with an important caring adult andan intergenerational presence that is often missing in today 's mobile society. Our research shows that volunteers are more likely to continue volunteering if they feel that their efforts are well-utilized. Well-trained senior volunteers, armedwith research-based skills and strategies, offer an important boost toward helpingchildren learn to read and gain academic and social success. There are many successful tutoring programs in schools across the nation. We know with some confidence the elements of these programs that make them success-ful, or on the other hand, what lacking elements cause them to be less successful. Therefore, I urge the support of a demonstration program, funded through the U.S. Department of Education 's Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE), that will validate the combination of elements of a model tutoring program that effec-tively taps the human resource pool of senior citizens. At the same time, such ademonstration project will result in the necessary resources to assist and guidestates and schools across the nation implementing the model: a guide for statewideimplementation for use by state education agencies, a tutor training package, anda project resource kit for schools. The Northwest Regional Educational Laboratoryhas the unique combination of experience and capabilities in technical assistance toschool-based tutor programs, training of seniors as tutors, and evaluation of effec-514 tiveness of tutor programs to conduct this demonstration program in collaboration with school districts and senior volunteer organizations in Alaska, Oregon, andWashington. Our analysis of 61 effective volunteer reading tutoring programs across the coun- try has shown that, to be successful, they must have: \u2014A clear definition of the roles, responsibilities, and accountability \u2014A plan for sustainability and capacity building \u2014A pro-active, well-qualified program director and an effective advisory com- mittee \u2014Strong school and teacher commitment \u2014Effective and sustainable tutor recruitment \u2014Access to groups of tutors via universities, civic organizations, businesses, etc. The operation of effective senior reading tutor programs needs to include:\u2014Consistent onsite supervision of tutors \u2014Tutoring sessions that support district curriculum and classroom instruction \u2014Tutor commitment It is critical that tutor training be provided, based on a clearly defined, research- based training model. Training must accommodate tutors ' varying expertise, learn- ing styles, and schedules, and ongoing training and onsite support should include:(1) tutor consultations with a seasoned tutor, reading specialist, or teacher; (2) sup-port and guidance for tutoring session planning; and (3) recognition and apprecia-tion of tutors. Reading tutor programs must utilize high-quality materials, program-specific handbook and resource library for tutors, tutor-training manual,materials that support school standards, and record-keeping and assessment tools. The benefits of effective tutoring programs in schools is well documented. In gen- eral, tutoring: \u2014Increases students ' mastery of academic skills \u2014Improves self-esteem and self-confidence \u2014Improves students ' attitude toward school and reduces dropout rates, truancies, and tardies \u2014Breaks down social barriers and creates new friendships \u2014Adds emotional support and provides positive role models It is also clear that seniors who are tutors receive: (1) a sense of pride and accom- plishment for having helped someone else, (2) increased self-esteem, confidence, andsense of adequacy as a result of being a tutor, (3) new or increased sense of respon-sibility and awareness for what teachers must do to transmit knowledge to students,and (4) empathy for students for whom learning may be much more of a struggle. The Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory has trained senior program staff in supporting and training reading volunteers, reading tutoring strategies, andpartnering effectively with schools. Utilizing these experiences and capabilities inconducting a demonstration program on seniors tutoring students in reading withfederal support provided by the U.S. Department of Education 's Fund for the Im- provement of Education will be an important step to implementing effective seniortutoring programs in schools across the country. I urge the Members of the Subcommittee to provide $1,000,000 in the fiscal year 2001 Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill for the Northwest Regional Edu-cational Laboratory to carry out this program to train Retired Senior volunteers inOregon, Washington and Alaska to serve as reading tutors in the most needyschools according to reading scores. The resulting model will be shared with otherstates. Thank you for your affording me this opportunity to share the details of the NWREL 's proposed retired and senior tutor training demonstration project. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FEDERATION OF BEHAVIORAL , PSYCHOLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, my name is Patrice O 'Toole. I am the Assistant Director of the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and CognitiveSciences. I am testifying today on behalf of the scientific societies that comprise theFederation, the American Psychological Association, the Society for Research inChild Development, and the Consortium for Social Science Associations. Our organi-zations represent most of the scientists who carry out the nation 's educational re- search and many of the scientists who carry out its health-related research. My tes-timony will, therefore, be directed at the funding requests for those two areas of re-search. I want to begin by thanking Senator Specter for his support and efforts on behalf of the scientific community. During his entire tenure in Congress, Mr. Specter has515 been a champion of biomedical and behavioral and social science research. The American people are healthier today because of the basic and applied research Mr.Specter 's work has made possible. OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT The Office of Educational Research and Improvement has been profiting from the leadership shown by Assistant Secretary Kent McGuire. The quality of peer review,which has been a concern both to Congress and to the scientific community has in-creased markedly, and further strengthening is taking place. Dr. McGuire has beengiving direction and form to the initiatives of OERI. We are particularly pleasedthat the second round of proposal solicitations for the Interagency Education Re-search Initiative has just begun. One of the problems in educational research hasalways been that there has not been enough money to carry out research on large-scale applications. The combined funding of OERI, the National Science Foundation,and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is helping tomake such research a possibility. The funds available even from three sources hard-ly approaches the funds that go into clinical trials of new pharmaceuticals, but thisprogram is a big step in the right direction. As you know, NICHD was not able tocontribute funds to the first round of grants. NICHD 's requested funding for this effort for fiscal year 2001 is still less than that contributed by the other partners.We ask that NICHD 's contribution be raised to $20 million to make it an equal part- ner in this important undertaking both in terms of intellectual effort and in termsof funds. NICHD and OERI are also cooperating in an initiative to identify the factors that lead to acquisition of English reading and writing skills for children whose first lan-guage is Spanish. The statistics that reflect the difficulty Spanish speaking childrenencounter in school are well known. We think the OERI/NICHD partnership to im-prove this situation are to be welcomed and fully supported. We also believe OERI is on track with its implementation of Comprehensive School Reform Demonstrations and its general effort to measure the impact ofschool reforms. It has so often been the case in education that new approaches areimplemented with little concern for the research base supporting them and even lessconcern about evaluating outcomes. There are some positive signs that OERI ishelping to change that, and these efforts need to be encouraged. Before the last reauthorization of OERI, one of the most glaring omissions from OERI 's research programs was a robust program of field-initiated research. We have been delighted to see the gradual change that has occurred over the years of thecurrent authorization. From less than $1 million before the reauthorization, thefield-initiated research program has grown to about $15 million. It is a smallamount when compared to the amounts NSF, and NIH spend on research whosesubject matter has been determined by researchers rather than by federal direc-tives, but again, the steps have been in the right direction. While we believe that much more emphasis is needed on basic, applied, and devel- opment research to improve teaching and learning, we are strongly supporting therequested $30 million funding increase for research and statistics by OERI. Spacedoes not permit a thorough treatment of the value of the statistics gathering workof the National Center for Education Statistics. It is this work, however, that tellsus enough about teaching, learning, and their lifelong effects to make it possible todevise evidence-based public policies that address real problems in effective ways.These statistics have been valuable precisely because they are measures of the stateof education and learning. We have been concerned for years that NCES has beenbrought into the effort to design national tests. Our concern has been and remainsthat NCES 's involvement in development of high-stakes testing will undermine the ability of NCES to be perceived across the nation as an objective, impartial eval-uator of the state of education in the country. There is room to debate the wisdomof national tests. It is unfortunate, however, that we have been unable so far tokeep that divisive issue from endangering the ability of NCES to keep its finger onthe nation 's educational pulse. Finally with respect to OERI, we are disturbed that the Department of Education has chosen to present its request for OERI research programs as a single line item,a move that is consistent with the design for OERI being proposed in OERI 's reau- thorization draft, but that is inconsistent with the current structure. There areitems of the proposed reauthorization with which we take issue. We support theoverall request, but note that it is out of place to make assumptions in the budgetpresentation about the future structure of OERI before an authorization has beenpassed in either house.516 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH The administration is requesting a $1 billion increase this year for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This would increase NIH 's budget to nearly $19 billion. This is an increase that is substantially lower than needed to stay on track to dou-bling the research budget over five years. We are asking Congress to stay on tracktoward doubling the budget by increasing the budget by 15 percent which wouldbring the fiscal year 2001 budget to $20.5 billion. Beyond the expressed commitmentof many in Congress to accomplish this doubling, we also base our recommendationon several observations. (1) Fulfilling NIH 's priorities for fiscal year 2001, which include increased atten- tion to health disparities research, requires the increased funding. (2) Solid funding has increased the pace of discovery across the health sciences, and nothing shouldslow that momentum. (3) Health care costs have become unbearable for millions.The best way to control those costs is to keep people healthy. The ultimate purposeof health research, including health research in the behavioral and social sciences,is to make the citizens of this country healthier throughout their life span. Let me mention just a few of the uses to which the funding increase would be put. NIH has established a working group, led by NIH Acting Deputy Director Yvonne Maddox and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director AnthonyFauci, to examine health disparities. In addition, NIH 's fiscal year 2001 budget con- tains a request for $20 million to establish within the Office of Research on MinorityHealth (ORMH) a Coordinating Center for Health Disparities. We support this re-quest. The Human Genome Project is expected to complete human gene sequencing by this summer. Already NIH has been at the forefront of research in genetics and neu-roscience. That research is helping us understand many diseases including Parkin-son's, Alzheimer 's, drug addiction and diabetes. With sequencing nearing comple- tion, we are poised for an explosive growth in discoveries in the years ahead. Scientific advances in knowledge about brain disease have been possible because of new methods for the study of the nervous system, such as neuroimaging. Identi-fying the molecules that guide the formation of the brain and increasing under-standing of how the processes occur are allowing neurobiologists to visualize howthe developing nervous system organizes itself, to explain complex behaviors, andto describe neurological and psychiatric diseases with a new level of precision. How-ever, equally important is the role that behavioral, psychological, socio-cultural, andenvironmental factors play in health. Our beliefs, our emotions, our behavior, ourthoughts, our family and cultural systems, our socio-economic status, as well as theenvironmental context in which we live, are all as relevant to our health as our ge-netic inheritance and our physiology. The emergence of cross-disciplinary collaboration has been a major component in the fast-paced research developments in these arenas. Across the NIH-supportedsciences, the growing tendency for scientists from many disciplines to come togetherto solve research problems has shown significant results. AIDS has not been cured, but research has shown how a mixture of treatments can ward off the worst effects of AIDS, for many years. These treatments involvethe use of a variety of drugs in combination and they involve a demanding level ofdiscipline on the part of the patient to take the medications properly \u2014a discipline that can be trained by application of techniques developed through behavioral re-search. Similarly, recent NIH-supported behavioral research has produced useful new knowledge, including a better understanding of basic behavioral and social processesand how they interact with biological processes. This understanding is coming frommany lines of research: studies of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, the desire andability to maintain exercise or medication regimens, psychological functioning, andinfluences of one 's social and cultural environment on behavior. All these lines of research converge to give us a picture of the factors that can affect an individual 's ability to remain healthy or to recover from disease or to func- tion well despite a chronic condition. And that knowledge leads to treatments andother interventions to maintain health throughout the life span. NIH's Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR), created in 1995 has been pivotal in supporting these studies and translating the findings into effec-tive prevention and treatment strategies. OBSSR, under the purview of the Officeof the Director of NIH, coordinates all the institutes and centers in marshaling theirindividual resources to collaborate on behavioral and social sciences research.OBSSR 's congressionally mandated primary mission is to foster the development of cross-disciplinary communication and research collaboration among behavioral and517 social sciences and between the behavioral and social sciences and biomedical sciences. OBSSR, under the auspices of its first Director, Norman Anderson, has achieved great success in its short existence. We believe it can accomplish a great deal morewith the continued support of Congress and the necessary resources to do so. A keyrole for OBSSR has been assuring that development of effective behavioral interven-tions is keeping pace with technological advances. OBSSR has been successful, yet continues to operate with a small staff and a small budget. Last year, Congress approved a $7 million increase for OBSSR to con-tinue its efforts to encourage cross-institute collaboration and research in the behav-ioral and social sciences. This money is being used to fund a trans-NIH initiativeon adherence to medical and behavioral interventions across a number of diseasesand conditions. OBBSR is also funding a trans-NIH initiative seeking effective inter-ventions to curb youth violence. And as episodes of violence between childrenmounts, the need for these programs is critical to reducing the overall level of vio-lence. More research is needed on children and youth at risk. We need a richer un-derstanding of the social, environmental, psychological, developmental and biologicalfactors involved in risk as well as a deeper understanding of how the factors inter-act. Despite the pressing need for this research, the President 's request for fiscal year 2001 provides no increase for OBSSR 's budget. OBSSR 's current budget is $19.86 million. The Federation supports an increase of ten percent for OBSSR, bringing itsbudget to $21.84 million for fiscal year 2001. This increase would significantly aug-ment OBSSR 's ability to continue coordinating research across institutes. This is an efficient use of resources and a beneficial mode of operation, because it links areasof related knowledge that might otherwise remain separated. A prime example of benefits of behavioral research has been the identification of factors that aid in protection from disease and that promote recovery from illness.They include certain personal attributes such as optimism, effective strategies forcoping with stress, and meaningful sources of social support and affiliation. NIH funding has permitted us to use research wisely, that is, in the combinations that will be most efficient in reaching solutions to typically multifaceted healthproblems. To continue successful biomedical and behavioral research at this level re-quires Congress ' ongoing commitment to finding resources for expanding NIH 's budget. With increased support, the current pace of discovery and collaboration can be sustained. The largest per person expenditures for health care occur near the endof life. One goal of research is to understand what interventions through the lifespan will have the greatest promise of assuring that the period of great illness be-fore the end of life is minimized. As more of the U.S. population reaches advancedage\u2014the number of Americans aged 65 and older is expected to double by the year 2030 to nearly 68 million \u2014it becomes increasingly vital to the health of our entire society that we age well. Many of the problems that accompany aging, especiallychromic diseases, stem from behaviors that place individuals at risk of negative out-comes. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) con- ducts research on human growth and development from conception through birth,infancy, childhood, adolescence, reproduction, and through maturity to old age. Assuch, NICHD addresses some of the most important health and development prob-lems facing our children and families. Based on this broad spectrum of research, we believe that NICHD 's fiscal year 2001 budget should be increased by 23.9 percent, bringing its budget to $1,064,800.Historically and chronically, NICHD has been one of the lowest funded instituteseven though it conducts research that has immediate, proven and successful applica-tions through behavioral intervention. We urge the subcommittee to press for higherfunding of NICHD. Behavioral research has a large role to play in contributing to the nation 's health, because controllable choices and behaviors in life have a heavy impact on the qual-ity of life. Obviously, such behavioral choices as to smoke or not to smoke, whatfoods and quantities of food to consume, and how regularly one exercises are amongthe most important choices we make in determining our health. But each of usknows how difficult it is to do the right thing. Behavioral researchers in cooperation with nutritional researchers, neuroscientists, epidemiologists and a host of other specialists are working to findways to make it easier for people to make the right choices about their health. Thepayoff for finding solutions to these problems will be not only a healthier population,but also the shrinkage of health care costs to a manageable size without sacrificing518 the well-being of the country 's citizens. Through research it is becoming possible to maintain good health and keep health care costs down at the same time. We strongly urge the Subcommittee to recommend a 15 percent increase for NIH because the investment in knowledge will result in healthier citizens and healthcare cost savings that far exceed the research investment. Slighting research willassure that rising health care costs will remain among our most serious nationalcrises. We thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to present our views. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNITED NEGRO COLLEGE FUND Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is William H. Gray, III and I am President and Chief Executive Officer of the United Negro CollegeFund (UNCF). I thank you for the opportunity to bring UNCF 's fiscal year 2001 rec- ommendations for higher education programs before you. UNCF is America 's oldest and most successful black higher education assistance organization, representing 39 private, four-year historically black colleges and uni-versities with either independent or religious affiliations. UNCF has been com-mitted to increasing and improving access to college for African Americans since1944. The organization remains steadfast in its commitment to enroll, nurture, andgraduate students who often do not have the social and educational advantages ofother college bound populations. Since its inception, the fundamental mission of UNCF has been to raise critical operating funds for member institutions and their students, faculty, and staff. Mr.Chairman, I am proud to say that over the years, this mission has broadened toinclude over 450 successful scholarship programs, internships, research and studyabroad opportunities for all historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs),Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), Tribally-controlled colleges, and majority insti-tutions. We also provide technical assistance to our trustee programs such as thefiscal and strategic technical assistance program (FASTAP) and faculty training, forinstitutions both domestic and abroad. UNCF is committed to educating tomorrow 's workforce. America 's markets are growing more diverse, and demographic trends indicate that early in the 21st Cen-tury, African Americans and other racial and ethnic minority groups will constitutea major part of the workforce. The more than 55,000 students enrolled at UNCF institutions are from diverse backgrounds. Our schools mirror the mosaic that is America; we are African Amer-ican, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American. While our student body consistsof varied economic backgrounds, approximately 34 percent of all UNCF studentscome from families with incomes below $25,000 (compared with 17 percent of stu-dents attending four years colleges nationwide). Approximately 90 percent of UNCFstudents require some form of financial assistance. Forty percent are the first intheir families to attend college compared with the national average of 35 percent. In spite of these challenges, UNCF students and members institutions have ac- complished much. They are noted for their consistent standards of excellence andoutstanding achievements. HBCUs are the major source of African American collegegraduates and black professionals in America. In fact, 16 Members of Congress arealumni of HBCUs. HBCUs contribute significantly to the production of AfricanAmerican baccalaureate degree holders in the sciences. HBCUs also graduate themost African American doctoral degree recipients. In addition, more than 50 percentof the nation 's African American public school teachers and 70 percent of African American dentists and physicians earned degrees at HBCUs. These are but someof the extraordinary roles HBCUs have played in educating minority Americans. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, the impressive achievements that I noted have an even greater significance at UNCF institutions in that ourschools have accomplished all this for a fraction of the cost compared to that of ma-jority institutions. The average cost of attending a UNCF institution in 1997 -1998 was $13,368, which is substantially below the average cost of $21,424 at four-yearprivate colleges nationwide. In fact, UNCF 's tuition increased only 43.5 percent over the last decade compared to a 51.6 percent increase at all private, four-year collegesduring the same period. However, this cost still remains above the financial meansof most of our students and their parents. Furthermore, keeping the costs of a col-lege education down while educating ''at-risk '' students comes at a financial price for UNCF member institutions. Consistent with our commitment to providing access to higher education to eco- nomically disadvantaged, first generation students, we applaud federal efforts tomake college affordable for all. As you know, students from low-income back-519 grounds, when compared to all other students attending four-year colleges and uni- versities, are more likely to drop out and less likely to earn a degree. In fact, accord-ing to a recent survey of beginning postsecondary students released by the U.S. De-partment of Education, 42 percent of students from the nation 's poorest families (with incomes less than $20,000) received a bachelor 's degree within five years while 35 percent \u2014a significant portion of similarly situated students \u2014had dropped out entirely. Additionally, students have increasingly turned to borrowing in order to manage rising education costs. More full time undergraduate students are also workingwhile enrolled. The burden of borrowing and working plays a significant role in howstudents pay for their education and whether they graduate. Clearly, students with adequate financial resources have an increased chance of obtaining a degree over those without access to similar means. However, most re-search on the subject indicates that simply increasing financial aid to low incomestudents does not appear to have any particular significance in determining success-ful outcomes (i.e., improving the chances of staying in college and graduating). Weknow that a freshman or sophomore, low-income student may choose to leave collegerather than face the prospect of assuming loan debt. Mr. Chairman, Congressshould recognize that certain types of aid actually serve as a disincentive for thenation 's neediest students! Congress should be mindful that what is important is the type of aid low-income students receive; when it is given; and what other serv-ices are afforded to them. For these reasons, UNCF strongly supports increased student financial assistance. Specifically we support the funding recommendations of the Student Aid Allianceof which UNCF is a member. Most important to our students is increased PellGrant aid, preferably awarded to a student in their earlier years of college, with amaximum award of $3700 in fiscal year 2001. Moreover, we support the Administra-tion's proposal to enhance college persistence and completion through the College Completion Challenge Grant. This is a new program supporting a comprehensiveapproach to increasing minority retention and completion rates through such activi-ties as a pre-freshmen summer program, support services, and increased grant aidto students. This program would be funded at $35 million and operated under thesuccessful TRIO program, which UNCF also recommends receive an increased $70million in overall funding for fiscal year 2001. Other student financial assistanceprograms we advocate higher funding for are: SEOG ($731 million); LEAP ($100million); Perkins Loans ($200 million); and the Federal Work Study Program ($1.1billion). Mr. Chairman, it is important to note, for the record, that growing debate about making college affordable and providing a means to a college education centers onthe premise of providing tax credits for students and their parents. Findings, how-ever, support the position that, while such tax credits benefit middle income and affluent families, low-income families are better served by grant and scholarshipaid. UNCF firmly believes that a better of use of tax dollars to achieve access tocollege would be to provide more grant support in the manner that I recommendedearlier. In terms of institutional support, UNCF strongly recommends increasing Title III, Part B, section 323 to $175 million and Title III, Part B, section 326 to $40 million.These programs have been the mainstay of UNCF schools through the years. Formany UNCF institutions in particular, Title III grants are the only form of institu-tional assistance received from the Federal Government. These grants are used foracademic program enhancement, faculty development, student services, and the con-struction, maintenance, and renovation of buildings. We also support increases tothe other institutional aid programs under Title III. Mr. Chairman, at a time when the education of tomorrow 's workforce tops agen- da's nationwide, minorities are underrepresented in numerous professions across the board \u2014science, engineering, law, teaching. Thus, UNCF strongly supports the Administration 's proposed new Dual Degree Programs at Minority Serving Institu- tions initiative that addresses this very issue. This program complements existingcurricula at HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions and channels studentsinto careers in which minorities are underrepresented. Funding for this new effortis $40 million. Several other programs provide critical institutional support toUNCF member institutions that educate a preponderant number of minority profes-sionals while addressing these shortages. Accordingly, UNCF recommends increasesfor these initiatives, including the Minority Science and Engineering ImprovementProgram (MSEIP) to $40 million, Title VI International and Graduate Programs to$82.5 million (and the Institute for International Public Policy/IIPP), the ThurgoodMarshall Legal Education Opportunity Program $5 million, and Teacher Quality520 Enhancement Grants to $140 million. UNCF also stands firmly behind increased funding for the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights at $78.605 million. Minorities are also underrepresented in the international arena while our country competes increasingly in a global marketplace. To counteract this trend, UNCF be-lieves Congress should increase its support of IIPP to $2.5 million in fiscal year2001. Currently, entering its fifth year, IIPP will serve more minority students withmore programs than ever before. However, this program is increasing its impact with only a 2 percent increase in its funding since the program 's creation in 1992. Surely, there is a need to have a diverse cadre of international professionals in thisglobal community. Mr. Chairman, it is clear that UNCF member institutions leverage federal dollars to the maximum potential. Even though we have smaller endowments and a greaterpercentage of students needing financial aid, UNCF institutions capitalize on ourfederal partnerships in extraordinary ways to address national concerns. Currently,like the rest of the nation, UNCF is facing the digital divide challenge, a problemthat is greater in higher education than it is among the nation 's households. A great many of the programs I have mentioned today help us address this challenge \u2014par- ticularly the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program. This impor-tant program provides a critical resource for baccalaureate granting institutions likeUNCF member schools that miss out on the majority of federal dollars allocated toscience, engineering, and related areas, since funds are traditionally targeted to ma-jority research-performing institutions. Consequently, our schools are hamperedearly on in their ability to qualify and compete for funds \u2014even though we con- tribute so much. For this reason, it is imperative that Congress show leadership byfunding those proven programs that are designed to not only increase access andopportunity for African American students and the HBCUs they attend, but alsothose programs that have demonstrated a capacity to have considerable impact onthis nation 's future. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the United Negro College Fund member institutions, I thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on the fiscal year 2001 appro-priations for higher education programs and look forward to working with you toensure strong alliances between our schools and the Federal Government. PREPARED STATEMENT OF FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and the Members of the Subcommittee for this opportunity to present testimony before this Committee. I would like to takea moment to briefly acquaint you with Florida State University. Florida State University is a comprehensive Research I university with a liberal arts base. The University 's primary role is to serve as a center for advanced grad- uate and professional studies while emphasizing research and providing excellencein undergraduate programs. Faculty at FSU have been selected for their commit-ment to excellence in teaching, for their ability to perform research and creative ac-tivities, and for their commitment to public service. Among the faculty are numer-ous recipients of national and international honors, including four Nobel laureatesand eight members of the National Academy of Sciences. Our scientists and engi-neers do excellent research, and often they work closely with industry to commer-cialize their results. Florida State ranks third this year among all U.S. universitiesin revenues generated from its patents and licenses, trailing only Columbia Univer-sity and the entire University of California system. Having been designated as aCarnegie Research I University several years ago, Florida State University cur-rently exceeds $100 million per year in research expenditures. With no agriculturalor medical school, few institutions can match our success. Florida State attracts students from every county in Florida, every state in the nation, and more than 100 foreign countries. The University is committed to highadmission standards that ensure quality in its student body, which currently in-cludes some 192 National Merit and National Achievement scholars, as well as stu-dents with superior creative talent. We consistently rank in the top 25 among U.S. colleges and universities in attracting National Merit Scholars. At Florida StateUniversity, we are very proud of our successes as well as our emerging reputationas one of the nation stop public universities. Mr. Chairman, let me tell you about a project we are pursuing this year involving the U.S. Department of Education and distance learning. Florida State Universityis pioneering the use of distance education to provide access to baccalaureate de-grees for students with Associate of Arts degrees who, due to family or work situa-tions, may not be able to relocate to a college or university to complete their degreework. FSU is currently offering three programs entirely on line for students to re-521 ceive their baccalaureate degree: Computer Science, Information Studies, and Soft- ware Engineering. A new program in Social Science will begin in Fall 2000 withother undergraduate programs to be developed. This 2 2 program is being offered in cooperation with 18 community colleges in Florida, which provide computer labsand proctored testing facilities where needed. Florida State University 's distance learning initiative has focused not only on a quality course development modelbased on that of the British Open University, but has placed a major emphasis onstudent support for the distance education teaching and learning environment. Thisranges from having all major student administrative services available on line, topartnering with Blackboard, Inc. in the development of Course Info Enterprise Edi-tion for course development and delivery of courses. Students can do everything online from applying, getting their dial up e-mail account, registering in courses,checking grades, to getting a copy of their transcript. But most important for student support and student success is our use of mentors in addition to the faculty teaching the course. Mentors take a proactive stance to-ward the students, contacting them on a regular basis to see if they can providehelp with any problems the student is having, and are available electronically atany time to deal with students questions and concerns. Student support is a keyfactor in insuring student motivation to complete distance courses and do well. This program can be scaled up to constitute a model of effective distance learning anywhere at the undergraduate level. Our focus has been on Florida, though wehave a small number of out-of-state students in our distance degree programs. Withadditional support, more majors can be added, and the program can be expandedto serve a wider range of students geographically. Front-end development activitiesare essential for quality courses and require significant expenditure to add majors,train mentors and offer degree programs on a larger scale. Granting such front-endfunds will have a major pay off in terms of providing access to a college degree tomany place-bound individuals who represent a significant and diverse part of ourpopulation. Florida State as a research university is heavily invested in new technologies and learning ideally positioned to provide further leadership in student supported highquality distance learning. The University was recognized in 1999 as one of the 100most wired campuses in America and the U.S. Department of Education has se-lected FSU as one of its 15 demonstration projects on distance learning and finan-cial aid. We are seeking an appropriation of $2 million within the Department of Edu- cation 's Higher Education account for this activity in fiscal year 2001. Mr. Chairman, this is just one of the many exciting activities going on at Florida State University that will make important contributions to solving some key prob-lems and concerns our Nation faces today. Your support would be appreciated, and,again, thank you for an opportunity to present these views for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TULSA It is proposed that the Department of Education support an information tech- nology center for the University of Tulsa. We are seeking $15 million for buildingand equipment needs. THE UNIVERSITY OF TULSA CENTER FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY It is a reality that economies are increasingly linked to technology. In February 2000, Oklahoma Governor Keating hosted a round table discussion of technology,educational, and commerce leaders in Tulsa. As a result of that meeting, a Centerof Excellence in Information Technology and Telecommunications was formed. Par-ticipants in the Center include the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University-Tulsa, the University of Oklahoma 's Tulsa operations, Oral Roberts University, Tulsa Community College and Tulsa Technology Center. The University of Tulsa is poised to help ensure that the Center of Excellence in Information Technology and Telecommunications meets the needs of industry andfulfills its mission of advancing the industry through research and educational pro-grams. However, we are in need of a state of the art technology center to optimizeour educational and research opportunities. There are a number of significant benefits that will flow to the State of Oklahoma and the Tulsa community from an investment in a TU Center for Information Tech-nology (IT). These include: \u2014Attracting and retaining quality students \u2014Enhanced educational opportunities \u2014Research opportunities for both faculty and students522 Attracting and Retaining Quality Students TU is committed to quality education. The University of Tulsa faculty is nation- ally recognized. For example, last year the Carnegie Foundation honored two Uni-versity of Tulsa professors for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning. One wasnamed a Carnegie Professor of the Year and one was named a Pew Scholar. In thepast five years, The University of Tulsa, MIT and Stanford produced an equal num-ber of Goldwater Scholars, tying for seventh place in the nation. The TU Center forIT would provide the infrastructure to maximize the potential of integrating thesequality students with quality faculty. However, the Center would prove beneficialeven before students arrive on campus. The recruiting competition for quality stu-dents is fierce. Students judge the technology infrastructure of a college or univer-sity when selecting an institution of higher learning. Students often make the deci-sion to stay at a college or university based on opportunities for access to state ofthe art technology. TU wants to educate the technology knowledge workers to enterthe digital economy work force and the Center would allow us to nationally recruitquality students to Oklahoma. Enhanced Educational Opportunities The TU Center for Information Technology will enhance educational opportunities in three areas: \u2014by providing tools/resources to enhance learning in all academic areas and dis- ciplines, \u2014by providing an infrastructure for technology based program students (such as management information systems, computer information systems, and computerscience) students to complement in class learning by applying their classroomlearning, and \u2014by enabling TU to deliver education to a broader range of constituents \u2014stu- dents in divers geographic regions. It will also enable TU to reinforce the life-long learning we encourage our alumni to pursue. Research Opportunities The TU Center for Information Technology will provide resource opportunities for both University of Tulsa faculty, and graduate/undergraduate students. Due to thenumber of industry leaders located in Tulsa, TU researchers have access to a signifi-cant volume of relevant subjects and data. TU 's research program for undergraduate students (known as TURC \u2014the Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge) is na- tionally recognized and acclaimed. Students have won a variety of national scholar-ships and grants from prestigious organizations such as the National Science Foun-dation and the Department of Energy. The enhanced research labs available in theTU Center for IT would further enhance the success of this program. In summary, the combination of quality professor, students, and technology infra- structure will result in a win-win proposition for students of higher education inOklahoma and the Oklahoma economy. PREPARED STATEMENT OF FIGHT CRIME : INVEST IN KIDS Littleton, Paducah, Springfield, and Mount Morris. In the wake of each of these tragedies, the American public has clamored for solutions. No one can say with certainty how each particular terrible tragedy could have been prevented. But a great deal is known about how to sharply reduce the inci-dence of school and youth violence. That is why it is frustrating to those of us whorepresent law enforcement and victims of violence when public officials wring theirhands and pretend they can do nothing to prevent the next tragedy. Law enforce-ment is virtually unanimous about the steps that can help prevent future incidents,and have issued a 4-point School and Youth Violence Prevention Plan that calls onpublic officials to: \u2014Assure all kids access to after-school programs that connect them with caring adults during the peak hours of violent juvenile crime; \u2014Assure all families access to quality early childhood development programs; \u2014Prevent child abuse and neglect and help heal those who have been abused and neglected; \u2014Assure that troubled kids get early, effective help. Our members, more than 700 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, leaders of police organizations, and crime survivors, know that this committee 's decisions will have a profound impact on juvenile crime rates in the years to come. As a first step towards implementing our School and Youth Violence Prevention Plan, we urge that you provide for fiscal year 2001 at least:523 \u2014$6.3 billion for Head Start, so that the program can expand to serve more eligi- ble children, and further strengthen its quality. \u2014$2 billion for an Early Learning Trust Fund so communities can fund par- enting-education programs and quality child development services to childrenunder five. \u2014$7.5 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, maintaining ap- propriate set-asides for quality, infants and toddlers, school-age care, and re-source and referral agencies. The discretionary portion of these funds should beincreased by at least $818 million to be made available October 1, 2000. \u2014$1 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers to expand after- school programs that provide constructive activities and connect kids with car-ing adults during the peak hours of violent juvenile crime. \u2014$2.38 billion for the Title XX Social Services Block Grant. Recent drastic cuts in this program have shortchanged child care (15 percent of state spendingunder the block grant), child abuse prevention, removal and placement ofabused children, drug treatment, and other critical crime-prevention invest-ments. \u2014$10.5 billion for Title I \u2014Education for the Disadvantaged. \u2014$250 million for Title V of the Juvenile Justice Act for local delinquency preven- tion programs. Those on the front lines of the battle against crime know that these investments are among our most powerful weapons against crime. That 's why over the last year, virtually every major national law enforcement organization \u2014including the Major Cities [Police] Chiefs Organization, the Police Executive Research Forum, the Na-tional Sheriffs ' Association, and the National District Attorneys ' Association \u2014have all adopted forceful calls for boosting critical crime-prevention investments, such aseducational child care and after-school programs, preventing child abuse, and pro-viding intensive services to help troubled kids get back on track. A recent poll of police chiefs conducted for Fight Crime by George Mason Univer- sity professors Scott Keeter and Steve Mastrofski showed that nearly nine out often of police chiefs agreed that ''expanding after-school programs and educational child care programs like Head Start would greatly reduce youth crime and violence. '' Nine out of ten agreed that if America fails to make greater investments in theseprograms now, ''we will pay far more later in crime, welfare and other costs. '' Police chiefs picked these investments as ''most effective '' in reducing youth violence by a margin of four to one over such alternatives as trying more juveniles as adults orhiring more police officers, and by seventy-to-one over installing more metal detec-tors. Collectively, the four steps mentioned in our School and Youth Violence Preven- tion Plan would dramatically reduce violent juvenile crime. There are no substitutesfor loving parents, but, government 's fundamental responsibility is to protect the public safety, and it can 't meet that responsibility by pointing fingers and saying parents should do a better job. The evidence is clear that well-designed programs for kids can dramatically re- duce crime and violence, and keep kids from becoming criminals. But these pro-grams remain so under-funded they reach only a fraction of the youngsters whoneed them. For example: \u2014In a five-city study, half of a group of at-risk high-school kids were assigned to participate in the Quantum Opportunities after-school program. The boys leftout of that program were six times more likely to be convicted of a crime intheir high-school years. Yet roughly seven million youngsters under twelve, andmillions more teens, lack after-school programs that put them in touch with car-ing adults providing supervision and constructive activities. \u2014A High/Scope Foundation study at the Perry Preschool in Michigan randomly chose half of a group of at-risk toddlers to receive a quality Head Start-stylepreschool program, supplemented by weekly in-home coaching for parents.Twenty-two years later, the toddlers left out of the program were five timesmore likely to have grown up to be chronic lawbreakers, with five or more ar-rests. Yet inadequate funding for Head Start and the Child Care DevelopmentBlock Grant leaves millions of at-risk children without critical early childhoodservices. \u2014A Montreal study showed that providing disruptive first- and second-grade boys with social skills training and counseling cut in half the odds that they wouldlater be in special classes, rated highly disruptive by a teacher or by peers, orhave been required to repeat a grade in school \u2014all signs that the risk of future violence has been sharply reduced. \u2014The Prenatal and Early Infancy Project randomly assigned half of a group of at-risk mothers to receive visits by specially trained nurses who provide coach-524 ing in parenting skills and other advice and support. Rigorous studies show the program not only reduced child abuse by 80 percent in the first two years, butthat fifteen years after the services ended, these mothers had only one-third asmany arrests, and their children were only half as likely to be delinquent. Many of our members are conservatives who believe we should, in the long run, be able to cut taxes. Our experience and hard scientific evidence prove, however,that boosting investments in children now will save lives and tax dollars, leavingfar more money for tax cuts, paying down the debt, and preserving social securitydown the road. For example: \u2014Economist Steven Barnett found that the High/Scope Foundation 's Perry Pre- school study saved $150,000 per participant in crime costs alone. Even aftersubtracting the interest that could have been earned by investing the program 's funding in financial markets, the project produced a net savings of $7.16 \u2014in- cluding more than six dollars in crime savings \u2014for every dollar invested. \u2014A study by Professor Mark A. Cohen of Vanderbilt University estimated that for each high-risk youth prevented from adopting a life of crime, the countrywould save between $1.7 million and $2.3 million. \u2014A Rand Corporation report showed that, even without counting the savings to crime victims and society, the resulting savings to government alone from effec-tive early childhood programs exceeded by two to four times the cost of the pro-grams. Yet these dollars savings do not measure the greatest savings of all.One child was killed in Mount Morris, 12 in Littleton. In an average week, 40 children are killed in America by violence. About 98 percent of these killings takeplace outside of school. That 's over 150 Littletons a year if we do nothing. The Fight Crime: Invest in Kids School and Youth Violence Prevention Plan will not prevent every incident of violence, but it can save thousands of lives \u2014whether from school shootings or the out-of school tragedies that take an even more massivetoll on our children \u2014in the years ahead, all the programs for which we are calling for funding increases are consistent with our School and Youth Violence PreventionPlan. The programs for which we are calling for increased investments are consistent with the recommendations made by the Bi-Partisan Working Group on Youth Vio-lence. Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt created the working groupto examine the evidence on measures to curb youth violence and to recommend aplan of action for Congress to take. Not surprisingly, the working group 's conclu- sions to cut you violence echo the recommendations of law enforcement and crimesurvivor leaders: \u2014''Effective federal programs must be fully funded to achieve the largest impact on early childhood development and, ultimately youth violence. Studies have es-timated that for every dollar invested in quality early education, about sevendollars are saved in later costs. '' \u2014''Congress should increase funding for high quality effective early childhood pro- grams, evaluate all federally-subsidized early childhood programs, and identifyareas for improvement and where new areas could be implemented. '' \u2014''The subgroup recommends that Congress provide increased support for a range of prevention and early intervention strategies targeted toward at-risk youthand their families, including school-based and after-school programs. '' \u2014''Congress needs to take steps to ensure that every child has access to high quality after-school activity. . . . We agree with the nation 's police chiefs that after-school programs for youngsters are a more effective way to fight crime. '' \u2014''We need to make sure that child protective services staff have sufficient re- sources to identify and treat abused and neglected children. We must also actbefore children are hurt by expanding programs proven to reduce cases of abuseand neglect. '' Speaker Hastert promised that the working group 's recommendations ''which are legislative in nature would follow the normal committee process but be addressedpromptly. '' Now it is time to act.(A copy of the report can be found on Jennifer Dunn 's website http://www.house.gov/dunn/workinggroup/wkg.htm.) We hope that you choose to put Congress this year on a path to full implementa- tion of our School and Youth Violence Prevention Plan and of the recommendationsof the Bi-Partisan Working Group on Youth Violence. Following this path willproduce massive cuts in crime and violence. Thank you for your consideration.525 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY ASSOCIATION NMFA and the families we represent are grateful to this Subcommittee and to the United States Senate for its actions on behalf of military children and the Im-pact Aid Program. We thank all the Congressional supporters of Impact Aid, espe-cially the members of the House and Senate Impact Aid Coalitions, for securing an-other increased appropriation for the program for fiscal year 2000. Your continuedsupport of this program translates into better education for approximately 550,000military children and several million of their civilian classmates in school districtsacross the country. THE MILITARY CHILD NMFA presents this statement on behalf of military families, or more specifically on behalf of military children: \u2014Military children move every 2 to 4 years and attend an average of six different schools. Less than 20 percent of these children attend Department of DefenseSchools; the overwhelming majority of military children attend civilian schoolsdependent on Impact Aid. \u2014Military children bring a wealth of cultural experiences gained from living in many parts of the world to their new schools. They also frequently come withgaps in their education that their new teachers must quickly fill while movingthe rest of the class ahead. Sometimes they are far ahead of their new class-mates, adding boredom to the list of reasons why they hate moving to yet an-other new school. \u2014Because of varying course standards, school schedules, and state graduation re- quirements, they sometimes lose credits needed for graduation or they musttake state accountability tests on subject matter they never learned. A changeof schools at any time is traumatic, but a change in the middle of the schoolyear is especially so. A mid-year transfer can place some children so far behind,they cannot catch up the rest of the school year, especially if a district does nothave the resources for a good transition program. \u2014Because of the high operations tempo of today 's military, the military child often has to adjust to the new school, face that week of standardized tests, fightfor the spot on the newspaper staff, play the basketball game before a crowdof strangers all without the support of their military parent. Worry about thesafety of a parent in a place far from home where people are shooting at eachother makes for a powerful distraction from the business of education. Military families want to be involved in their children 's education and list edu- cation as one of their top quality of life issues. While a concern about the qualityof their children 's education is rarely the sole reason military members leave the service, the stress caused to a child by one-too-many moves, the special services notreceived when needed, or the prospect of an assignment at an installation where theschools have a poor reputation may be enough to convince a service member thatit is time to leave the military. WHY IMPACT AID ? THE FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY Military families understand that the Impact Aid program supports basic edu- cation services provided by their local school districts. They understand the impactthe federal presence has on the tax base of these local districts and their states.They understand the impact their children and the transient military lifestyle canhave on their local schools. \u2014Children living on Fort Belvoir, Virginia attend the Fort Belvoir Elementary School, operated by Fairfax County. In school year 1998 -1999, the school 's high- est enrollment was 1,320 students. During the year, the school experienced aturnover rate of over 50 percent. Not counting the summer rotations, 706 stu-dents came in and out of the school. Think of the records that must be pre-pared, the evaluations and testing for special programs that must occur, thechildren unable to concentrate because another best friend has moved away, theanxiety faced when the newcomers don 't know anyone who will eat lunch with them! \u2014The average soldier at Fort Hood, Texas deployed 120 -160 days in fiscal year 1999. The average airman at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska deployed over120 days. Think of the Parent-Teacher conferences missed, the volunteers un-available to support school activities, the families stretched too thin. Researchshows that involved parents promote academic achievement. Deployment makesthat involvement more difficult both for the deployed servicemember and thespouse trying to keep things together at home.526 Military families hold the government, and the citizens they have sworn to serve and protect, accountable for living up to their promise to provide a quality educationfor their children. The districts have accepted the responsibility to educate militarychildren; the Federal Government must provide the resources it has promised tosupport that education. \u2014The intent of the original Impact Aid legislation (Public Law 81 -874) was ''to provide financial assistance for those local educational agencies upon which theUnited States has placed financial burden. '' It originally provided an ''in-lieu- of-tax '' payment equal to the local per-pupil costs for students whose military parent both lived and worked on a federal installation (these students were des-ignated A students) and one-half of the local per-pupil cost for students whose military parent worked on a federal installation but lived in the civilian commu-nity (B students). \u2014It costs an average of over $6,000 to educate a child in the United States today. But the current average Impact Aid payment for an A child is approximately$2,000; the average payment for a B child (now set at only .10 of the amountfor the military A students) is $200, nowhere near the original intent or actualcost of educating a child. Once again, NMFA thanks this Subcommittee for its continued funding of Impact Aid for the military children who live off the installation, the ''military Bs. '' Al- though military families living in the civilian community pay property taxes to helpsupport local schools, they often do not contribute to other sources of educationfunding. States provide an increasingly larger share of local districts ' funding. Many military members pay no state tax on their military income. They also shop in mili-tary exchanges and commissaries, thus paying no sales tax. Under the provisionsof the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Relief Act, they are often exempt from paying personal property taxes or license fees for automobiles if they are on military orders awayfrom their home state. \u2014The local tax base for the Bellevue, Nebraska school district that educates the children living on or near Offutt Air Force Base generates only $12 million ofthe district 's $54 million annual budget. Each year the county loses $5 million in license plate fees because military members stationed at Offutt may licensetheir vehicles in their home states rather than Nebraska. \u2014The Copperas Cove Independent School District serves children whose parents are assigned to Fort Hood, Texas. All but about 100 of the district 's 2,700 mili- tary children live in the civilian community adjacent to Fort Hood and approxi-mately 30 percent of the district 's budget comes from Impact Aid. If funding for military B students was discontinued, district officials estimate they would haveto raise property taxes 51.3 cents per $100 of valuation. \u2014As the military services look to the civilian community to provide more housing for military families, the number of B students will increase, thus raising theburden on districts charged with educating them. FIX THE SCHOOLHOUSE For a newly-arrived family in a military community, the sight of a well-main- tained, safe, child-friendly school building can calm many anxieties about their lat-est move. Unfortunately, too many military children must deal with those anxietiesin a school facility that has seen better days. \u2014Although Impact Aid provides much of a heavily-impacted district 's working capital, it cannot be stretched to fund the facility maintenance and improve-ments old school buildings need. Military families at many installations voiceconcerns about the repairs needed for these buildings and the lack of availablefunds. At Grand Forks Air Force Base, for example, parents with children atthe combined elementary/middle school note the work needed. The district onlyrecently allocated funds to meet accessibility laws. The building has no handi-capped-accessible bathroom, entrance or exit ramps, or lift or elevator to thesecond floor. Designed as an elementary school, the building has no adequategym space for middle school programs and needs a new boiler. It has windowsthat are boarded up and frosted over or, as described by one military spouse,''windows that have been re-caulked so many times there is more caulk than window sill. '' \u2014NMFA remains concerned about the upgrade and maintenance needs of school buildings owned by the Department of Education. The Waynesville R -VI School District, for example, operates seven buildings owned by the Department ofEducation on Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Although one school has been re-cently renovated, the district estimates that it needs approximately one milliondollars per school to bring the rest up to standard. The district used its own527 funds to wire the Department of Education buildings for the Internet so that the military children attending these schools would not fall behind their peersin district-owned buildings. In addition to facing pressing maintenance and ren-ovation needs, the district is also coping with the addition of 600 Army childrenit received from units moved to Fort Leonard Wood following the closure of FortMcClellan, Alabama. To a district with only 5,100 students in old school build-ings, an additional 600 children becomes a strain on the system. ONE CHILD , MANY SCHOOLS The education of a military child is a continuum. As the military child moves from school district to district \u2014from a school receiving Impact Aid in Texas, to another Impact Aid school in Virginia, to a Department of Defense school in Germany to an-other Impact Aid school in Illinois \u2014the quality of education she receives in each school will affect the education she and her classmates receive in the next. Childrenwhose schools are unable to provide the necessary educational services could easilyfall behind their peers in other districts. Schools serving these children could facedifficulties in maintaining accreditation as tough new standards are implementedin many states. A smooth transition into their next school, whether across the stateor across the country, benefits military children, their classmates, and their commu-nities. The Impact Aid program enables districts affected by the presence of a military installation to offer not only a quality basic education program, but also the supportservices needed by military children as they transition from school to school. \u2014Over 50 percent of the 3,783 students in the Indian River Central School Dis- trict in New York are military children whose parents are stationed at FortDrum. Because of Impact Aid, the district can afford the Reading Recovery pro-gram to help first graders master important reading skills to reach grade level.At the high school level, the district is developing a remediation system to helpnewly-transferred students prepare for the New York Regents exams, which willsoon be required for graduation. Impact Aid funds help buy stringed instru-ments for the district 's orchestra program. They provide for the support sys- tem\u2014the counselors, psychologists, and social workers \u2014often needed by chil- dren when their military parent deploys. The 10th Mountain Division recentlyreturned to Fort Drum after its deployment to Bosnia. While the school admin-istration was initially concerned about a flight from the community during thedeployment, it found that most military families chose to remain in the area.The strong assistance system at Fort Drum and the community support as evi-denced in the school programs funded through Impact Aid persuaded familiesto stay. \u2014School districts serving military children recognize their interdependence and their shared responsibility for the education of those children. They are increas-ing their communication with each other to ease the transition of military chil-dren in and out of different school systems. \u2014Recognizing that service members view quality education as an important qual- ity of life factor and a retention issue, the military services have stepped uptheir efforts to establish partnership programs with local schools, to train in-stallation school liaison officers, to provide better information to families aboutlocal schools, and to study the problems faced by military children as theymove. They are working across the services on common issues and are reachingout to military-related and education organizations, such as NMFA, the Na-tional Association of Partners in Education, and the Military Child EducationCoalition. Military parents view the partnerships between their schools and the military services \u2014from the unit adopting the local elementary school to the presence of serv- ice and DOD leadership at annual educational conferences on ''Serving the Military Child ''\u2014as progress toward relieving some of the anxieties about their children 's education. The educational focus of these efforts is a legacy of a successful, well-funded Impact Aid program. When the Federal Government fulfills its responsibilityto provide funding for basic education to districts serving military children, theschools can concentrate on providing a high-quality education program for all stu-dents. We thank you, the Members of this Subcommittee, for your leadership in thispartnership for the education of military children. We ask you to continue this roleby fully funding Impact Aid.528 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INDIAN IMPACTED SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION The National Indian Impacted Schools Association represents public school dis- tricts which contain Indian trust land and Alaska Native lands. The Impact Aid pro-gram provides federal funds for public school operations that would have otherwisebeen provided by local tax revenues but for the presence of federal property \u2014in our case, primarily lands held in trust by the federal government for Indian tribes. Approximately 90 percent of Indian and Alaska Native elementary and secondary students nationwide attend public schools. Most of the remaining 10 percent of stu-dents attend Bureau of Indian Affairs-system schools whose operating budgets comethrough BIA appropriations. Summary of Request. \u2014We ask the Subcommittee to recommend the following with regard to the fiscal year 2001 Department of Education budget: \u2014Impact Aid Basic Support Payments .\u2014$818 million for Impact Aid Basic Sup- port payments under Section 8003(b) of the Impact Aid statute. This is thesame as the request of the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools(NAFIS) and is 10.9 percent over the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. \u2014Impact Aid Facility Repair .\u2014$25 million under the authority of Section 8007 of the Impact Aid statute for payments for facility repair, renovation and construc-tion. This is the same as the request of NAFIS and compares to the fiscal year2000 enacted level of $10.1 million and the Administration 's request of $5 mil- lion. While this is termed a ''construction '' account in the authorizing statute, the funds are distributed by formula to schools, making the amount individualschool districts receive so miniscule that it cannot make a significant impact onfacility construction needs. In fiscal year 2000, $3 million was earmarked byCongress for three specific schools. \u2014Forward Funding of Impact Aid. \u2014Impact Aid is one of the few major federal education programs which are not forward funded. Even if we were not experi-encing delays in distribution of Impact Aid funds as we are now, it would beenormously helpful for planning and budgeting purposes for the program to beforward funded. The Impact Aid Program in Indian Country. \u2014For Indian country, the Impact Aid program is a vital element of the public policy of providing every child a free publiceducation. Signed into law in 1950, the Impact Aid program is one of the oldest fed-eral education programs. Simply put, it provides federal funds for public school op-erations that would have otherwise been provided by local tax revenues but for thepresence of federal property \u2014in our case, lands held in trust by the federal govern- ment for Indian tribes. One of the great attributes about the Impact Aid programis that it provides flexible funds to school districts. Because Impact Aid funds areactually in lieu of a property tax base, it is logical that they are not geared towardspecific program use. The Impact Aid program is an example of the U.S. government carrying out its trust responsibility \u2014in this case, for education \u2014for Indian and Alaska Native peo- ples. Some facts about the Impact Aid program in Indian Country: \u2014There are over 600 school districts throughout the country which receive Impact Aid funds for Indian lands schools. \u2014Funds for Indian lands students represent nearly 50 percent of the federal Im- pact Aid appropriation. \u2014The Indian Country land base that generates Impact Aid funds consists of 53 million acres of Indian trust land in the lower 48 states and 44 million acresincluded in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. \u2014The Impact Aid program provides a formal link between tribal governments and public schools, providing for school district consultation with Indian tribes andtribal communities. This is especially important because public schools areState institutions, but located within tribal boundaries. School districts mustconsult with tribes and the Indian community to develop Indian Policies andProcedures (IPP). Tribes and parents of Indian students are able to commenton whether Indian students are equal participants in educational programs andschool activities, and to request modifications in school programs and materials.Tribes also have administrative appeal rights under the statute. The Level of Impact Aid Effects Student Performance \u2014the Santee School Experi- ence. \u2014We would like to give you an example of how increased Impact Aid funds re- sulted in dramatic academic improvement for the students of the Santee School Dis-trict. On March 17, 1999 the House Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families held a hearing on reauthorization of the Im-pact Aid program at which Chuck Squier, Superintendent of the Santee School, tes-tified. The Santee School District in northeast Nebraska is made up of entirely In-529 1GME stands for Grade Means Equivalency.dian trust lands and its students are Santee Sioux. Superintendent Squier testified about the impressive student gains which have been made since his school districthas received an increase in Impact Aid funds. Prior to 1995 the school district had been receiving only 60 to 70 percent of the amount of Impact Aid for which it was eligible. Reading scores had dropped duringthe previous three years: 1st grade scores dropped from 1.8 to 1.2 GME; 18th grade scores dropped from 7.4 to 5.9 GME, and 11th grade scores dropped from 10.2 to9.4 GME. In an effort to reverse this trend, the school district formed a CurriculumCommittee composed of school staff, parents and other community members. Theyreviewed current research on ways to improve student reading and decided on aplan of action which included teacher training, a reading management system, mul-tiple copies of books, a daily focus on reading and ninth hour tutoring. Specific pro-grams included reading recovery, accelerated reader, school at the center, fossscience, and project read. However, the recommendations of the Curriculum Com-mittee were not able to be implemented because of lack of money. But when the Impact Aid program was re-authorized in 1994, Impact Aid funding increased for the Santee Sioux school. The school district was able to use thatmoney to leverage additional grant dollars for teacher training and research-basedreading programs and the rest of the plan recommended by the Curriculum Com-mittee. The plan was implemented. Students are tested in the fall and in the spring,and the results have been very impressive. Last year, 28 percent of the studentsin grades 3 -12 increased their reading level two grade levels. Another 25 percent of students raised their reading level 1.5 or more grade levels, and 36 percent ofstudents raised their reading level 1 or more grade levels. Particularly gratifyingwas the 9th grade results, as this class had declining scores for the previous threeyears. Expansions of the school-wide reading program are planned for next year,along with rewriting the math/science studies/language arts curriculum \u2014financial resources permitting. The Santee School District program is shared through the Nebraska Native Amer- ican consortium, which serves 98 percent of all students in Nebraska living on triballands. The Impact Aid Program Should Be Forward Funded. \u2014We urge Congress to take the long overdue step of providing appropriations to forward fund the Impact Aidprogram. Other major education programs, e.g., Title I, Individuals with DisabilitiesEducation Act, and Bureau of Indian Affairs school operations, are forward funded.Public school administrators in heavily impacted districts must make very difficultand risky program and personnel decisions for the upcoming school year or the nextschool year without knowing how much Impact Aid funding they will be receiving.For many Indian lands schools, Impact Aid is the primary source of school oper-ations funding and the schools would close without it. While school administrators cope with this system, it makes much more sense for a school administrator to know 6 -12 months prior to the beginning of the school year what its budget will be. For example, in Minnesota we are required to signcontracts for tenured teachers by April 15th for the upcoming school year. For non-tenured teachers, we must sign contracts by June 1 for the Fall term. Because Im-pact Aid is not forward funded, we must sign contracts for tenured teachers 4 12 months prior to the knowing the amount of money we will receive \u2014and that is under circumstances when we have a Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations billwhich is signed by October 1st \u2014a rare occurrence, as you know. When the government shut down several years ago, Impact Aid schools had to borrow money just to stay open and had to pay large amounts of interest \u2014tens of thousands of dollars for some schools \u2014for which they were not reimbursed. Some Impact Aid schools are in the position now of having to borrow money because ofproblems at the Department of Education resulting in chronically late Impact Aidpayments. We know that Congress understands this problem because it has mademost federal education programs forward funded. Impact Aid is a program of basicsupport for schools \u2014it hires the teachers, pays the utility bills, transports students, etc. and this makes it all the more urgent for it to be forward funded. We realize that the first year of forward funding will strain the appropriations process as Congress would have to make available two years worth of funding. Onthe other hand, we have a budget surplus and there is support from the Administra-tion and both parties in Congress for increased federal education funding. If the Impact Aid program cannot be forward funded in total, we suggest that the Basic Support and the Disabilities portions of the program could be forward fundedor Congress could look at the possibility of a phased-in approach to forward funding.530 1The college is owned and operated by five federally-recognized tribes situated wholly or in part in North Dakota \u2014Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, and Turtle Mountain Bandof Chippewa. Control of the institution is vested in a ten-member board of directors comprisedof elected Tribal Chairpersons and Tribal council members.School Facilities. \u2014School facilities construction and renovation, including making facilities ready for education technology, is a high priority for our organization. Weurge you to appropriate at least $25 million for school facility repair as authorizedunder Section 8007 of the Impact Aid law. Ultimately however, we need more thana band aid approach to school construction needs. NIISA has and will continue to work with Congress on pending school construc- tion proposals to make them responsive to the needs of our schools \u2014Indian lands public schools. School construction bills have been introduced in a steady streamduring the last two Congresses and also the current Congress. We have seen inthese bills a growing recognition that there needs to be accommodation for publicschool districts which have little, if any, bonding capacity (including those schoolsin the Bureau of Indian Affairs system). For instance, there are now bills whichwould allow a state to issue school construction bonds (not just the LEA) and whichwould require the state application to explain how they will assist schools that lackthe fiscal capacity to issue bonds on their own. This could be helpful to some schooldistricts with Indian lands. To the extent that a school district has limited abilityto generate revenues because of a federal presence (e.g., the existence of Indiantrust land or federal property in the school district), there is a clear federal responsi-bility toward the education of the children attending those schools. The condition of public and Bureau of Indian Affairs school facilities has been doc- umented in General Accounting Office (GAO) surveys. Because the GAO surveys didnot report data specific to Indian lands public schools, our organization, in October,1996, undertook a survey of school districts which receive Indian lands Impact Aidfunding. Some of the findings from the survey, which we have previously reportedto this Subcommittee, are: \u201465 percent of buildings are over 20 years old, including 38.2 percent over 30 years old; \u2014$6,872,000 is the average estimated costs necessary for repairs, renovations, modernization and construction to put schools in overall good condition; \u2014the average cost per student to make school buildings meet health and safety standards is $1,947; \u2014to accommodate expected increased enrollment over the next 5 years, the schools responding to the survey will need 13.1 percent more space. Within 10years, the space needs are expected to increase by 27.9 percent; \u201471 percent of school districts have had no school construction bond issued since 1985, and 23 percent of school districts have never had a bond issued; \u2014Of schools with 70 percent LOT MOD and higher, the need for construction, renovation, and repair funding is two thirds higher per pupil than in the otherrespondents to the NIISA survey. (Note: LOT MOD is a Department of Edu-cation measure of need of school districts affected by the presence of federalproperty); \u201442 percent of respondents have unhoused students; \u201459 percent of school buildings have inadequate laboratory science space; \u201463 percent of schools are not well served for before/after school care. Thank you for your interest in the need of our public schools which educate chil- dren from Indian country. We ask you to always keep in mind the trust responsi-bility for the education of Indian and Alaska Native children and the federal respon-sibility regarding school districts which contain Indian and federal property. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNITED STRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE Summary of Request. \u2014For thirty years United Tribes Technical College1(UTTC) has been providing postsecondary vocational education, job training and family serv-ices to Indian students from the Great Plains and throughout the nation. UTTC wasassisting Indian people in moving from public assistance to economic self-sufficiencylong before the 1996 welfare reform act. We have a sustained placement rate of wellover 80 percent. Our request for fiscal year 2001 funding for tribally controlled post-secondary vocational institutions as authorized under Carl Perkins Vocational andApplied Technology Act is:531 \u2014$5 million, or $400,000 over the fiscal year 2000 enacted level and the Adminis- tration 's request. This funding is essential to our survival as we receive no state-appropriated vocational education monies. \u2014Committee Report language asking for the report required of the Department by the Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act regarding training, fa-cilities and housing needs of the tribally controlled postsecondary vocational in-stitutions. (20 USCA \u00a72327(g) (2) and (3). This report should be undertaken in close collaboration with the affected institutions. Attached is the statutory pro-vision. Funding Authority. \u2014Section 117 of the Carl Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1998 authorizes funding for trib-ally controlled postsecondary vocational technical institutions. Under this authorityfunding is currently provided to UTTC and one other tribally controlled postsec-ondary vocational institution, the Crownpoint Institute of Technology. The Adminis-tration 's fiscal year 2001 request is $4.6 million, the same as the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. There is a glitch in the Perkins Act in that it caps funding for TriballyControlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions at $4 million instead of ''such sums as may be necessary '' in the out years as is the case for other vocational education programs. This was inadvertent and we ask for a technical correction to provide for''such sums as may be necessary '' for fiscal year 2000 and the out years. A Unique Inter-Tribal Educational Organization. \u2014United Tribes Technical Col- lege is the only inter-tribally controlled, campus-based, postsecondary vocational in-stitution for Indian people. Our campus is the site of the Fort Lincoln Amy Post,an 110-acre area near Bismarck, North Dakota. We currently enroll 367 studentsfrom 32 tribes and 14 states. And we serve 159 children in our pre-school programsand 148 children in our elementary school, for a direct services population of 654. Educating Students and Placing Them in Jobs. \u2014We are proud of the education, skills and services provided by UTTC for our students and their families. And weare proud that this education is taking place in a setting they where can maintainand strengthen their tribal heritage. We have had a sustained job placement rateexceeding 80 percent over the last 10 years. This success is all the more gratifyingin light of the background of our students, most of whom come from tribal areaswhere poverty and unemployment are the norm. Many of our students are from the14 tribes in the Dakotas, where unemployment among Indian people is chronic. BIALabor Force data reports the percentage of potential Indian labor force on and nearreservations in the Aberdeen Area who are jobless is 71 percent. Of those personswho are employed 33 percent are still living below the poverty guidelines. (Source:Interior Department 1997 Labor Market Information On the Indian Labor Force.) UTTC New Course Offerings. \u2014We offer 9 Certificate and 15 Associate of Applied Science degree programs (see attached list). We are very excited about the recentadditions to our course offerings, and the particular relevance they hold for Indian communities. The modest increases in our Department of Education funding hashelped make these new programs possible. These new programs are: \u2014Injury Prevention \u2014Dietetics Technician \u2014Tribal management, including gaming management \u2014Computer Science Technology \u2014Distance Learning programs for the Denver Indian Community Dietetics/Diabetes. \u2014Through collaborative efforts with the American Diabetes As- sociation, UTTC will develop the only accredited Dietetics Technician 's Degree pro- gram in the state. We will meet the challenge of fighting diabetes through edu-cation. As this Subcommittee knows, the rate of diabetes is very high in Indiancounty, and with some tribal areas experiencing the highest incidence of diabetesin the word. About half of Indian adults have diabetes ( ''Diabetes in American Indi- ans and Alaska Natives, NIH Publication 99 -4567, October, 1999). Injury Prevention. \u2014Through our Injury Prevention Program we are addressing the injury death rate among Indians which is 2.8 times that of the U.S. population(Source: IHS fiscal year 1999 Budget Justification). We received assistance throughthe IHS to establish the only degree-granting Injury Prevention program in the na-tion. Distance Learning. \u2014We are bridging the ''digital divide '' by providing critical com- puter and Internet skills from our North Dakota campus to American Indians resid-ing in the Denver area. Technology training allows all American Indians an oppor-tunity to overcome barriers such as geographic isolation and access to information.Through technology partnership programs, UTTC is meeting the challenge of pro-viding technology skills and training to Indian country. UTTC has been, in addition, a member since 1994 of the Interactive Video Net- work of North Dakota 's colleges, universities and tribal colleges. This allows for ar-532 ticulation agreements with other college and universities, expanding the educational opportunities for our students. Job Training and Economic Development. \u2014UTTC is a designated Indian Minority Business Center serving Montana and the Dakotas. We also administer a WorkforceInvestment Act program and an internship program with private employers. And weare assisting tribes and tribal members in the Aberdeen Area with rebuilding buf-falo herds. Coordination with State Welfare-to-Work Efforts. \u2014UTTC is working in cooperation with the state of North Dakota on welfare reform. We are serving state-referredTemporary Assistance for Need Families (TANF) recipients who are able to partici-pate in our Cooperative Education internship program with private employers. Byattending UTTC, these TANF recipients can meet their work, training and volun-teer requirements. And we are providing child care for 20 children of state-referredTANF recipients. In North Dakota, only 30 percent of state TANF recipients are allowed schooling as a work activity. And we also take exception to the 12-month statutory limit onthe length of time a TANF recipient can be enrolled in a vocational education courseand still be eligible for TANF. This limits TANF recipients to taking one-year cer-tificate courses at UTTC. Our experience shows that the students who graduatefrom a two-year, rather than a one-year, course have significantly higher earningpower. Many of our students come to UTTC planning to take a one-year course, andthen, finding themselves in a supportive environment and seeing the economic ben-efit of the longer course, decide to work for the two-year degree. Serving Families Contributes to Education and Job Placement. \u2014We believe that a primary reason for UTTC student success is that we serve the students ' social, academic and cultural needs. Many of our students are the first generation in theirfamily to attend college, and for many it is their first experience in living away fromhome. Many students are on public assistance and many have families of their own.Some of our services are: \u2014Early childhood services for 145 children, ages birth to five years and an addi- tional 15 elementary children for extended care; \u2014Theodore Jamerson Elementary School serving 148 Indian students; \u2014A health clinic whose services includes immunization, health education, eye and dental exams, and referrals to other health care providers; \u2014Family housing and dormitories for solo parents and for students without chil- dren; \u2014A local transportation system for students for school activities and necessary appointment e.g., (doctor appointments) outside the campus. Most UTTC stu-dents do not have cars. UTTC Seeks Non-Perkins Funds. \u2014UTTC is aggressive in seeking non-Perkins funding for special needs, e.g., we combined Department of Agriculture, Economic Development Administration and state Community Development Block Grant fundsand replaced our aging water, sewer and gas systems in 1997. Our elementary school received a Department of Education grant for computer technology, and was one five BIA-system schools to receive this funding. We alsoreceived a Kellogg Foundation grant to develop buffalo management skills for thetribes and their members throughout the Aberdeen Area, as they attempt to rebuildherds of buffalo decimated more than 100 years ago. And this year we received a$75,000 grant from U.S. West to assist us in developing a series of distance learningclasses at the Indian Center in Denver. Additionally, our Injury Prevention Programhas been assisted through a grant from the IHS. The above mentioned grants are highly competitive, restrictive, one-time grants, and they cannot provide for day-to-day operations. We cannot survive without thebasic operating funds which come through the Perkins Act. Facility Study/Current Needs. \u2014We are dismayed that the Department of Edu- cation has paid no attention to the requirement in the 1998 Perkins Act Amend-ments to undertake a study of our housing, facility, and training needs. Discussionswith the Department shows that it is not even on its radar screen. Such a studywould certainly be of benefit to us in planning and in seeking funds. Below are someof our financial needs of which we want you to be aware: \u2014Housing .\u2014We need new and rehabilitated campus housing so that we can in- crease student enrollment. Many of our buildings are of historic importance.The College occupies the old Fort Lincoln Army Post, and many people visit ourcampus to see these buildings. Other than the more recently constructed skillscenter and the community center, UTTC 's core facilities are 90 years old. Esti- mates for new facilities total over $12 million, according to a 1993 Dept. of Edu-cation report.533 \u2014Salaries. \u2014We were able to provide a cost-of-living increase for our employees last year. However, our faculty still receive salaries that are lower than in anystate college system. \u2014Emergency Repair. \u2014We need funding for emergency repair on student housing and instructional facilities. Funding is also needed for maintenance and repairrelated to damaged caused by inclement weather, including blizzards, highwinds and extremely low temperatures. \u2014Course Offerings/Student Services. \u2014We want to change some of our courses to better meet new market demands, e.g, training to increase the number of stu-dents in the allied health professions, updating of technology. We also need toexpand our diagnostic capabilities in tribal-specific areas and in the areas of lit-eracy and math-science background. And we want to make improvements in ourstudent follow up, career development, and job market research efforts. Thank you for your consideration of our request. RELATED AGENCIES/GENERAL TESTIMONY PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY BROADCASTERS Thank you for providing me the opportunity to submit testimony to this Sub- committee regarding the appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB). As the President and CEO of the National Federation of Community Broad-casters I speak on behalf of 150 community radio stations across the country. NFCBis the sole national organization representing this group of stations which provideservice in the smallest communities of this country as well as the largest metropoli-tan areas. Nearly half of our members are rural stations and half are minority con-trolled stations. In summary, the points we wish to make to this Subcommittee are that NFCB:\u2014Supports the CPB request of $365 million for fiscal year 2003; \u2014Requests the Subcommittee to ensure that CPB utilizes digital funds it receives for radio as well as television needs; \u2014Supports CPB activities in facilitating programming services to Latino and Na- tive American radio stations; \u2014Supports CPB 's efforts to help public radio stations utilize new distribution technologies and requests that the Subcommittee ensure that these technologiesare available to all public radio services and not just the ones with the greatestresources. Community radio fully supports $365 million for the Corporation for Public Broad- casting in fiscal year 2003. \u2014Federal support distributed through the CPB is an es- sential resource for rural stations and for those stations serving minority commu-nities. These stations provide critical, life-saving information to their listeners. Yetthey are often in communities with very small populations and limited economicbases so that the ability of the community to financially support the station is insuf-ficient without federal funds. In larger towns and cities, sustaining grants from CPB enable community radio stations to provide a reliable source of noncommercial programming about the com-munities themselves. Local programming is an increasingly rare commodity in a na-tion that is dominated by national program services and concentrated ownership ofthe media. In the last year, CPB has increased supported to rural stations and committed resources to helping public radio take advantage of new technologies. We commendthese activities but want to be sure that the smaller stations with more limited re-sources are not left out of this technological transition. We ask that the Sub-committee include language in the appropriation that will ensure that funds areavailable to help the entire public radio system utilize the new technologies, particu-larly rural and minority stations. NFCB would like to commend CPB for the leadership it has shown in supporting and fostering the programming services to Latino stations and to Native Americanstations. Sate \u00b4lite Radio Bilingu \u00a8e provides 24 hours of programming to stations across the United States and Puerto Rico addressing issues of particular interest tothe Latino population. In the same way, American Indian Radio on Satellite(AIROS) is distributing programming for the Native American stations, arguablythe fastest growing groups of stations. There are now over 30 stations controlled byand serving Native Americans, primarily on Indian reservations. CPB plays a very important role for the public and community radio system. They are the convener of discussions on critical issues facing us as a system. They sup-port research so that we have a better understanding of how we are serving lis-534 teners. And they provide funding to programming, new ventures, expansion to new listeners, and projects that improve the efficiency of the system. This is particularlyimportant at a time when there are so many changes in the radio and media envi-ronment with new distribution technologies and media consolidation. Finally, community radio supports funding for conversion to digital broadcasting by public radio and television. \u2014While public television 's needs are more immediate, the Federal Communications Commission is now in the process of identifying astandard for digital radio transmission. We expect that there will be funds availablefor radio conversion as well as television conversion. More immediately, the tele-vision conversion process is already having an impact on public radio stations. Astelevision stations increase the space they need on their towers to accommodateboth analog and digital signals, radio stations that rent space on TV towers are los-ing their leases and being forced to move to other towers \u2014sometimes with very short notice. This situation will only get worse over the next three years as we ap-proach the FCC deadline for television conversion. We would like to see emergencyfunding to help public radio stations who lose their tower space do the necessaryengineering studies and move to new tower locations. We appreciate Congress ' direction to CPB that it utilize its digital conversion fund for both radio and television and ask that you ensure that the funds are used forboth media. Congress stated, with regard to fiscal year 2001 digital conversionfunds: ''The required (digital) conversion will impose enormous costs on both individual stations and the public broadcasting system as a whole. Because television andradio infrastructures are closely linked, the conversion of television to digital willcreate immediate costs not only for television, but also for public radio stations (em- phasis added). Therefore, the Committee has included $15,000,000 to assist radiostations and television stations in the conversion to digitalization . . . '' (S. Rpt. 105 - 300) This is a period of tremendous change. Digital is transforming the way we do things; new distribution avenues like digital satellite broadcasting and the Internetare changing how we define the business we are in; the concentration of ownershipin commercial radio makes public radio and particularly community radio, moreunique and more important as a local voice than we have ever been. During thistime, the role of CPB as a convener of the system becomes even more important.And the funding that it provides will allow the smaller stations to participate alongwith the larger stations who have more resources, as we move into a new ear ofcommunications. Thank you for your consideration of our testimony. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FOSTER GRANDPARENT PROGRAM We are pleased to submit this testimony in support of fiscal year 2001 funding for the Foster Grandparent Program (FGP), the oldest and most well-known of thethree programs known collectively as the National Senior Volunteer Corps, whichare authorized by Title II of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, as amend-ed (DVSA) and administered by the Corporation for National and Community Serv-ice (CNS). NAFGPD is a membership-supported professional organization whose roster in- cludes the majority of more than 350 directors who administer Foster GrandparentPrograms nationwide, as well as local sponsoring agencies who support the work ofFGP. THANK YOU Senator Specter, before we begin our testimony, we must first thank you for the courage and leadership you showed during the fiscal year 2000 appropriations proc-ess in preserving the original mission and purpose of the Foster Grandparent Pro-gram: to enable seniors living on incomes less than 125 percent of the national pov-erty level to serve as Foster Grandparents and contribute to their communities.Your clear direction to the Corporation for National and Community Service \u2014that funds appropriated by Congress may not be used to pay a non-taxable, non-incomepayment to individuals whose incomes exceed 125 percent of the national povertylevel \u2014has preserved our program for those low-income seniors for whom it was originally intended. Again, thank you for your leadership.535 FGP: AN OVERVIEW Established in 1965, the Foster Grandparent Program was the first federally funded, organized program to engage older volunteers in significant service to oth-ers. From the 20 original programs based totally in institutions for children withsevere mental and physical disabilities, FGP now comprises nearly 350 programs inevery state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. All pro-grams are now primarily based in community volunteer sites \u2014where most special needs children can be found today \u2014and are administered locally through a non- profit organization or agency and an Advisory Council comprised of community citi-zens dedicated to FGP and its mission. FGP represents the best in the federal part-nership with local communities, with federal dollars flowing directly to local spon-soring agencies, which in turn determine how the funds are used. There are cur-rently 28,500 Foster Grandparent volunteers who give over 24 million hours annu-ally to more than 180,000 children. The Foster Grandparent Program is unique. We are one of only two volunteer pro- grams in existence that enable seniors living on very limited incomes to serve theircommunities as volunteers by providing a small non-taxable stipend and other sup-port which allow volunteers to serve at little or no cost to themselves. Our volun-teers provide intensive, consistent service \u201420 hours every week, usually four hours every day. FGP provides extensive pre-service orientation and at least 48 hours ofon-going training annually to keep volunteers informed on how to work with chil-dren who have special needs. And our volunteers provide one-to-one service to theirassigned children, exactly what is required to help prepare our nation 's neediest children to become self-sufficient adults. The rapidly growing number of older people living at poverty-level incomes across the country represent a virtually untapped resource that must be utilized to helpaddress the serious problems of today 's children. In order to continue to provide these cost-effective services in even more local communities the Foster GrandparentProgram requires more volunteers, and more locally-based programs. We need fund-ing levels that will enable us to keep pace with the ever-increasing number of in-come eligible seniors \u2014currently 6,000,000, a number will grow to 13,200,000 by the year 2030 \u2014and the countless number of at risk children who will need the one-to-one attention of an older person with the time to help show them the wayto independence and productive adulthood. THE ADMINISTRATION 'S FISCAL YEAR 2001 REQUEST FOR FGP Unfortunately, in a budget which requests increases in excess of 23 percent ($100 million) for AmeriCorps and related programs, the Administration has, for the sec-ond year in a row, proposed an increase of $1.79 million (1.87 percent) for the FosterGrandparent Program \u2014again, for the second year in a row, the smallest increase requested for any of the programs administered by CNS. Rather than investing fed-eral funds in increasing the number of FGP volunteers serving nationwide, the Ad- ministration 's request appears to set as a priority a 67 percent increase for senior demonstration targeted mainly to make grants to national organizations which havenothing to do with FGP or the other two senior volunteer programs. The largest,oldest and most well-known of the three senior volunteer programs \u2014the Foster Grandparent Program \u2014is virtually ignored in this budget, as it was in the Adminis- tration 's fiscal year 2000 budget. In addition, by way of a never-before-used interpretation of Section 225 of the Do- mestic Volunteer Service Act of 1993 (Programs of National Significance, or PNS,grants), which was enacted in 1989, the Administration fails to designate at leastone-third of the fiscal year 2001 increase requested for FGP for PNS expansiongrants for existing programs. The intent of Sec. 225 when enacted was to ensurethat at least one-third of any increases would be made available to current FGP,SCP, and RSVP projects to expand the number of volunteers in their communities.In fact, since 1989 the one-third PNS set-aside has been the ONLY mechanism bywhich current programs have been able to expand their volunteer numbers andmeet their communities ' needs. CNS even held fast to the one-third PNS set-aside in fiscal year 1997, when the increases received by the three programs representedonly a restoration to fiscal year 1995 levels after the programs experienced appro-priations cuts in fiscal year 1996. This new interpretation is whimsical and unac-ceptable, and will establish a dangerous precedent for the use of future appropria-tions if allowed to stand. The Administration 's budget also fails to request funds to increase the non-tax- able, non-income stipend provided to our low income volunteers. While the stipendhas not increased since January, 1998; the increase in the cost-of living since thenhas caused the costs of volunteering to escalate dramatically, especially the price536 of gasoline and other costs associated with daily transportation. We believe that the current stipend of $2.55/hour is no longer adequate to cover the costs associatedwith volunteering. THE ADMINISTRATION 'S FISCAL YEAR 2001 REQUEST FOR SENIOR DEMONSTRATION Although fiscal year 2000 appropriations conference and bill language has effec- tively stopped the payment of a non-taxable, non-income stipend to people whose in-comes exceed the income eligibility requirements set in the DVSA for FGP and SCP,the administration is again requesting demonstration funds to continue to payRSVP Leaders in fiscal year 2001, using the rationale that RSVP has no statutoryincome requirements for its volunteers. We are very aware that Congress intendedto exclude from those receiving a non-taxable, non-income stipend all FGP, SCP andRSVP volunteers whose incomes exceed the income requirements set in the DVSAfor FGP and SC (125 percent of the national poverty level). Both NAFGPD and theNational Association of RSVP Directors believe the Administration 's request is a fla- grant violation of the intent of Congress as expressed in fiscal year 2000 appropria-tions law, and should not be funded. The Administration also requests demonstration funds for grants to national orga- nizations to develop plans to use more senior volunteers to further their missions.We believe that these challenge grants will be used by the national organizationsto implement programs that will, in essence, be the beginning of a 4th senior volun-teer program that will use non-federal funds to continue the practice of paying non-taxable, non-income stipends to people meeting no income eligibility requirements. NAFGPD is not opposed to demonstration efforts which will improve the way FGP, SCP, or RSVP deliver services, or which will help to test innovative programand volunteer activities which will improve the existing programs. We are opposedto demonstration activities that will be used to start a 4th \u2014and totally unneces- sary\u2014senior volunteer program, especially one designed to pay volunteers who can afford to volunteer without a financial enabler. We are also opposed to using scarcefederal dollars to fund efforts that will in no way improve the three existing seniorvolunteer programs. In fact, this new 4th program will actually duplicate the serv-ices performed by the 25 year old RSVP program, which now engages nearly 12mil- lion volunteers who serve without any payment at all! The federal demonstrationdollars requested by the Administration for national organizations are better in-vested in FGP to enable low-income seniors to serve. NAFGPD 'S FISCAL YEAR 2001 REQUEST FOR FGP AND SENIOR DEMONSTRATION Given the growing number of eligible low-income seniors and the staggering num- ber of troubled and challenged children in America today, we believe that the Ad-ministration 's request does not invest adequately for the future in the Foster Grand- parent Program, and actually diverts funds which could be invested in FGP intodemonstration activities we cannot support. We ask that you (1) adopt a differentfiscal year 2001 funding allocation for FGP, one which will more properly addressthe important role our programs must play in engaging more of our nation 's low- income elders in addressing serious community needs in more communities nation-wide; and (2) refrain from appropriating any federal dollars to senior demonstration.Our fiscal year 2001 request is as follows: [In millions of dollars] Foster Grandparent Program ......................................................................... 107.177Senior Demonstration ..................................................................................... .................. This request represents an $11.189 million increase over FGP 's fiscal year 2000 level. We also request that the Committee include report language accompanyingthe fiscal year 2001 funding measure which supports and specifies the following al-location priorities for use of the fiscal year 2001 increase: First, for the Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion Programs, increase the stipend which enables low income volunteers to serve from $2.55/hour to $2.65/hour.Funds should be available to pay for the additional $.10 per hour for non-federallyfunded volunteers for one year; Second, award an administrative cost increase of 3 percent to each existing FGP in order to maintain quality and sustain the work already being done by programs; Third, allocate funds for the $1.1 million requested by the Administration to allow programs to increase their technological capabilities to meet standards set by CNS; Fourth, in accordance with the Domestic Volunteer Service Act (DVSA), use 1/3 of the increase over the fiscal year 2000 level to fund Program of National Signifi-cance (PNS) expansion grants to allow existing FGP programs to expand the num-537 ber of volunteers serving in areas of critical need as identified by Congress in the DVSA; areas which may not be limited to America Reads activities, and with nominimum or maximum grant size specified by CNS; Finally, begin 20 new Foster Grandparent Program projects in geographic areas currently unserved. This funding proposal will generate opportunities for more than 4,000 new low- income senior volunteers contributing in excess of 4.1 million hours of service annu-ally to more than 15,900 additional children. In addition, 20 more communities willreceive the multifaceted services of FGP, a small step toward NAFGPD 's fiscal year 2000 goal of beginning 100 new Foster Grandparent Programs nationwide by 2004. A New York Times article (March 21, 1999) on volunteers and retirement stated that ''. . . Thousands of older people are on the waiting list for the Foster Grand- parent program, in which 25,000 older adults whose income is below the povertyline receive a small stipend for volunteering 20 hours a week to be grandparentsfor disabled or disadvantaged youngsters. Many young people need mentors and fos-ter grandparents, but lack of money precludes more participation. '' Our experiences strongly support this statement. In communities that already have a Foster Grand-parent Program, unfilled requests from local organizations for more Foster Grand-parents are the rule, not the exception. And when Congress provided funds for 25new Foster Grandparent Programs in fiscal year 1998 \u2014the first new programs in 18 years \u2014125 high-quality applications were submitted by local community organi- zations nationwide. In addition, a 1998 AARP survey conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide indicated a ''sea change '' in retirement patterns: the majority of ''babyboomers '' intend to con- tinue to keep their jobs and never retire from work! The 1998 Independent Sectorstudy showed that seniors who are still working are more likely to volunteer on aninformal basis than to volunteer in a program like FGP that requires a commitmentof 20 hours of service every week. It will be the ''boomers '' who have not acquired the skills needed to keep their jobs as they age or who have worked at low-payingjobs who will be available to volunteer every day, who will need FGP to providethem with opportunities to stay active. Please help us tap one of the nation 's only increasing national resources \u2014our low- income seniors \u2014by supporting a total fiscal year 2001 appropriation of $107.177 million for the Foster Grandparent Program, and allocating no funds to senior dem-onstration for fiscal year 2001. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to testify before the Subcommittee today. My name is Craig Morris, and I am speaking on behalf of the American Mu-seum of Natural History and in support of the Institute of Museum and LibraryServices. ABOUT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Founded in 1869, the American Museum of Natural History [AMNH] is one of the nation 's preeminent institutions for scientific research and public education. Throughout its history, the Museum has pursued its joint missions of science andeducation, of examining critical scientific issues and educating the public aboutthem. It is renowned for its exhibitions and collections, which serve as a field guideto the entire planet and present a panorama of the world 's cultures. Museum collec- tions of some 32 million natural specimens and cultural artifacts provide an irre-placeable record of life on earth. Its explorers and scientists have pioneered discov-eries and offered us new ways of looking at nature and human civilization. The Mu-seum 's power to interpret wide-ranging scientific discoveries and convey them imaginatively has inspired generations of visitors to its grand exhibition halls andeducated its three million annual visitors \u2014500,000 of them schoolchildren \u2014about the natural world and the vitality of human culture. Since 1887 the Museum has sponsored thousands of expeditions, sending sci- entists and explorers to every continent; currently more than 100 field projects areconducted each year, including ongoing research in such countries as Chile, China,Cuba, Madagascar, Mongolia, and New Guinea. Some of the most influential sci-entists of the twentieth century, including Margaret Mead, George Gaylord Simp-son, Roy Chapman Andrews, and Ernst Mayr were either staff members of or affili-ated with the Museum. Today more than 200 active Museum scientists with internationally recognized ex- pertise, led by 47 curators, conduct laboratory and collections-based research pro-grams as well as field work and training. Scientists in five divisions (Anthropology;538 Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences; Invertebrate Zoology; Paleontology; sequencing DNA and creating new computational tools toretrace the evolutionary tree, documenting changes in the environment, making newdiscoveries in the fossil record, and describing human culture in all its variety. TheMuseum also conducts graduate training programs in conjunction with a host of dis-tinguished universities, support doctoral and postdoctoral scientists with highlycompetitive fellowships, and offer talented undergraduates an opportunity to workwith Museum scientists. In many ways, the AMNH is similar to a research university, with its scientific faculty from diverse fields such anthropology, earth and planetary sciences, astro-physics, and all branches of zoology. Yet the Museum is distinct in that its mission extends beyond research and training. Museum curators are also deeply engaged asexhibition and education advisors and as caretakers of the Museum 's ever growing collections. They help to promote public understanding of science, of where we comefrom and where we may be headed. In exhibitions, which are among the Museum 's most potent educational tools, AMNH scientific knowledge and discovery are translated into three dimensions. TheMuseum is proud to continue its tradition of creating some of the world 's greatest scientific exhibitions. Last month, in one of the most exciting chapters in the Muse-um's long and distinguished history of advancing science and education, it opened the spectacular new Rose Center for Earth and Space. The Rose Center includes anewly rebuilt and updated Hayden Planetarium that allows visitors to journeyamong the stars and planets in our own and in other galaxies; and the Lewis B.and Dorothy Cullman Hall of the Universe, where interactive technology andparticipatory displays elucidate important astronomy and astrophysics principles.The adjoining Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth, which opened in 1999, explores theprocesses that determine how the Earth works; it in turn leads to the recentlyopened Hall of Biodiversity. Together, the new planetarium and halls provide visi-tors a seamless educational journey from the universe 's beginnings to the formation and processes of Earth to the extraordinary diversity of life on our planet. The Museum 's Education Department spearheads the AMNH 's commitment to promoting public education, particularly in an informal setting. It builds on the Mu-seum 's unique resources to offer rich educational programming dedicated to increas- ing scientific literacy, to encouraging students to pursue science and museum ca-reers, and to providing a forum for exploring the world 's cultures. The Department targets its efforts particularly to New York City 's diverse and often underserved communities and school districts, to those populations traditionally poorly served byschools, those underrepresented in science, and those for whom museums typicallyare not a welcoming destination. Each year hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, and schools participate in workshops, courses for college credit, and visits to the Museum. Annually, morethan 500,000 students and teachers visit on school trips, prepared and supportedby curriculum resources and workshops. For schools that cannot get to the Museum,Moveable Museums offer off-site access, free of charge. As well, Education Depart-ment lectures, field trips and workshops on subjects ranging from birding to earth-quakes, gospel music to Native American culture, and Hudson River geology to go-rilla conservation attract large audiences of adults, children, and families. In 1997 the Museum launched in partnership with NASA the National Center for Science Literacy, Education, and Technology to advance science literacy throughoutthe United States and to extend the Museum 's educational reach and impact to a national audience, including local communities. In creating the National Center, theMuseum and NASA recognized an opportunity to combine and leverage their incom-parable resources, and through new technologies to bring learning and discovery,materials, and programs into homes, schools, museums, and community organiza-tions around the nation. SUPPORT FOR THE INSTITUTE OF MUSEUM AND LIBRARY SERVICES The American Museum of Natural History supports the goals and accomplish- ments of the Institute of Museum and Library Services [IMLS]. The Museum 's own collections of more than 32 million artifacts and specimens are considered to be thelargest non-federal Museum collection in America, and one of the largest and mostsignificant biological collections in the world. Its Library houses one of the world 's preeminent collections of natural history and anthropology materials. It sharesIMLS commitments to increasing technological access to the nation 's museum and library resources and to building partnerships to address community needs; and iturges increased investment in IMLS so as to advance public access to these vitaleducational institutions.539 Scientific and Cultural Collections The cumulative result of 130 years of exploration, collecting, and research, the AMNH collections are a major scientific resource providing the foundation for theMuseum 's interrelated research, education, and exhibition missions. Those collec- tions are organized around the departments Invertebrates, Mammalogy, Ornithology, and Vertebrate Paleontology.They often include endangered and extinct species as well as many of the onlyknown ''type specimens, '' or examples of species by which all other finds are com- pared. Within the collections are many spectacular individual collections, includingthe world 's most comprehensive collections of dinosaurs; fossil mammals; Northwest Coast and Siberian cultural artifacts; North American butterflies; spiders; Aus-tralian and Chinese amphibians; reptiles; fishes outside of their home countries; andone of the most important bird collections. Collections such as these are historicallibraries of expertly identified examples of species and artifacts, associated withdata about when and where they were collected. Such collections provide essentialbaseline data for Museum scientists as well as more than 250 national and inter-national visiting scientists each year. And the collections are all located on-site toallow scientists ' with ease of access. The Museum 's halls of vertebrate evolution provide an excellent example of the relationship among science, collections, education, and exhibition. In these halls,visitors walk directly along a phylogenetic tree indicated by a pathway on the floor. At each branch in the tree, a visitor can stop and view fossils that exemplify setsof anatomical features that inform scientists about natural groups of organisms. Thecollections are also the source of the extraordinary ''Spectrum of Life '' exhibit in the new Hall of Biodiversity. This exhibit features more than a 1,000 expertly mountedspecimens from 28 scientific classifications; it is perhaps the world 's most com- prehensive display of the diversity and evolution of life. It includes interactive com-puter kiosks that visitors use to identify and interrelate organisms on evolutionarytrees. The confluence of collections, evolutionary research, and beautiful exhibitionmakes these halls among the Museum 's most compelling educational features. Natural History Library The American Museum of Natural History is also home to the largest unified nat- ural history library in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to supporting the workof the Museum 's scientific staff, the Library serves the world 's scientific and schol- arly communities as well as students from the colleges and universities in the tri-state area and interested members of the public. Each year thousands of users visitthe Library, and its staff answer more than 26,000 reference questions. The Library contains over 485,000 volumes, including pamphlets, reprints, books, journals, photos, several hundred films, and rare books dating to the fifteenth cen-tury. It also houses the Museum 's astronomy collections, including the Perkins Li- brary of more than 35,000 volumes and the Bliss Collection of rare and ancient sci-entific instruments. The archives contain more than 1,900 linear feet of materialsand 250 reels of microfilm. Additionally, the Library maintains approximately1,000,000 photographic images documenting specimens and scientific work, 3,000documentary films, and over 2,700 art objects and memorabilia. Other highlights of the Library collection include over 300 manuscript collections of notable naturalists and scientists; a unique collection of 13,000 rare books thatspans over 500 years of scientific and expedition literature; and diaries and logs, in-cluding Captain James Cook 's account of Australia (1783) and Charles Darwin 's zo- ology of the voyage of ''H.M.S. Beagle '' (1839 -1843). Preservation and Access By assuming stewardship of these irreplaceable Library holdings and scientific collections, the Museum serves as custodian of one of the most important recordsof life on earth. And as steward and custodian, it places the highest possible priorityon preservation and access, so that the collections will be protected and availablefor research, for exhibit, and for education for generations to come. The Library is engaged in a major pilot effort, with private foundation support, to digitize its holdings and link them to the scientific collections. This model project,illustrative of the digitization initiatives the IMLS supports, will help to pave theway in transforming access to and ways to use the Museum 's collections and hold- ings. An expansion of the digitization project would increase access enormously forresearchers, students, teachers, and the general public to the Museum and Libraryholdings. The Museum has also undertaken major efforts to improve storage, preservation, and access of its vast collections. This year Museum departments will move into anew nine-story Natural Science Building. This facility will significantly increase ex-540 hibition and collections storage space, with 30,000 sq. ft. of climate-controlled com- pact storage facilities for portions of the scientific collections, along with a digitalimaging laboratory. The Anthropology Division is also nearing completion of a 25-year collection stor- age upgrade and related digitization project. Scheduled for completion in 2002, andwith support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, this upgrade willensure scholarly access to these vital and magnificent collections. The new digitalimage database and accompanying electronic catalog will facilitate access for staff,visiting scholars, and off-site researchers. BIOLOGICAL COLLECTION STORAGE UPGRADE AND DIGITIZATION PROJECT With the successful Anthropology storage upgrade and digitization project nearly complete, the Museum now turns its focus to critical improvement of other storagefacilities and to digitizing the biological collections for upgraded preservation andwider access. The IMLS has a distinguished history of supporting cutting edge col-lection and technological practices. We do seek partnerships with IMLS that willallow us to provide leadership in collection practices and serve as a national modelin improving public access to museum and library resources through technology. Technological Innovation for Greater Public Access Biological science at the Museum centers on expert documentation of species and investigation of their evolutionary and ecological relationships. The collectionstherefore provide essential baseline data for scientific inquiry. Due to the unparal-leled interest in the Museum 's biological collections and unwieldliness of the speci- mens, comprehensive digital imaging and electronic cataloging of many of these col-lections will allow the Museum readily to share our resources through technologywith a national and international audience. We would like to develop a database,with a web front end for worldwide general audience access, to allow digitized speci-mens and field data to be searched across many fields (for instance, by locality orage). Detailed digital renderings would allow ready and safe access to often fragilearchival material and allow off-site researchers and users to peruse the collectionand strategically plan Museum visits. These last two matters are key. If using thedatabase can help researchers can plan Museum visits, the productivity of their vis-its will be significantly enhanced. Collection Storage Facilities Collections preservation and access are top Museum priorities. The Museum 's col- lections are the heart and soul of our scientific research, permanent and temporaryexhibitions, and education programs. Access to the collections allows undergraduate,graduate, post-graduate, and even high school students to conduct real researchprojects in intensive learning programs. As the collections grow, questions abouthow to curate them, including how to use limited physical storage space, arise.While many similar institutions house their collections separately from their faculty,the Museum is committed to keeping its scientists, educators and collections to-gether by expanding on site. The new Natural Sciences Building, for example, canaccommodate a substantial amount of new compact storage, including a uniquesuper-cold storage facility to allow for the preservation of tissue samples for futureof DNA study. As these endeavors demonstrate, the American Museum of Natural History sup- ports the important goals of IMLS to preserve and expand access to library and mu-seum resources and to reach out to broad audiences and diverse communities. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG FOUNDATION Chairman Specter and members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I want tothank you for the opportunity to submit the following two proposals that we at Colo-nial Williamsburg are excited about and feel could help to re-calibrate our nationalcompass and engage future generations in a stimulating discussion about the basicprinciples of democratic government that have made this country a world leader. You may know Colonial Williamsburg as John D. Rockefeller, Jr. 's famous re- stored eighteenth century town. But the significance of this town goes far beyondthe bricks and cobblestones. We are the nation 's largest outdoor living museum. Our conservancy museums have one of the largest collections of eighteenth century An-tiquities in the world. There are over 600 original and restored eighteenth centurybuildings in our 173 acre Historic Area. We also have a large and talented interpre-tive staff who can bring American history and the democratic principles of our fore-541 fathers to life in a fun and stimulating learning environment. Quite simply, Colonial Williamsburg is an educational institution. Its significance is both public and per-sonal, educational and experimental. Its mission is to tell the story of a diversegroup of people who fought to create a new community in a new land, based on newideals. Our living history approach creates the environment of the past \u2014a colonial town \u2014and populates the streets, homes, and shops with costumed interpreters. Visitors can actually touch history. They can talk with tradesmen, ask them ques-tions, and examine their crafts. They can sit as a local magistrate at the colonialcounty courthouse. They can eat a meal in an authentic eighteenth century colonialtavern, help make bricks for the foundation of a house, even engage in a politicaldiscussion with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or the royal governor. Theyhear the echoes of Patrick Henry 's denunciation of the Stamp Act resonate through- out the halls of the Colonial Capitol. Visitors can literally immerse themselves inthe past. The result is a dynamic method of history education that generates an ex-citement for learning about the ideas and principles upon which our democracy isbased. Over three million people visit our site each year from all 50 states and from many other countries. But our goal of fulfilling Jefferson 's objective of an educated populace does not stop with just those guests who are able to visit Colonial Wil-liamsburg in person. Colonial Williamsburg has long been the leader in providing distance learning with a variety of educational programming activities for over fifty years. Today, withthe best technological communication resources at our command, we are able toreach millions of students and teachers throughout the country through broadcast,internet, interactive media and digital satellite. One of the results of these advancesin technology is our award winning Electronic Filed Trips that allow students andteachers to ''visit'' Williamsburg via interactive television programs, while our www.history.org web site offers convenient access to our educational and researchresources on the Internet. Our Electronic Field Trips provide a live, interactive format by Colonial Williams- burg to over one million registered students. These programs are also viewed by an-other three million students on a delayed basis courtesy of local PBS stations. Weprovide seven Electronic Field Trip programs each year. The programs deal with avariety of topics from methods of travel in the eighteenth century, to slavery, ap-prenticeships, and indentured servitude, to tradesmen rebuilding the houses andstructures of Colonial Williamsburg. Schools that register for the program receiveprinted lesson plans, resource materials, internet activities, and other materials toprepare students during the month preceding the program. The program comes liveinto the classroom and registered students can phone in questions to interpretivestaff who appear in the program segment. Over 30 other interpretive and research staff take calls, email, and internet messages and respond to the students. Materialremains on our web site for 30 days after the program. During one of our most re-cent programs, over 1,300 calls from across the country were received. While we currently reach over four million students with these award-winning, state-of-the-art programs, we feel we have an obligation to help more schools andstudents meet national standards of learning. We have been informed that inschools using the Electronic Field Trips these scores have gone up. The programsaddress more than just history SOL 's\u2014they cover science, math, and other subjects as well. We would like to be able to offer our Electronic Field Trips, free of charge to an additional 10,000 schools across the country. This would mean reaching an addi-tional five million students a year. We have already developed the facilities and thehigh tech programmatic infrastructure for these programs. We have proven how suc-cessful they can be in exciting and educating students. We believe that if we canreach these additional 10,000 schools, the programs will become self-supporting. Webelieve we can convince these schools and others that the seven programs are worth$500 a year. As stewards of an important segment of our American heritage, we areasking for a one-time appropriation of $3 million to reach an additional five millionstudents and to help students, teachers, and schools in all 50 states provide the typeof state-of-the-art programs that teachers want and that will use twenty-first cen-tury technology to develop an understanding in the students of timeless eighteenthcentury principles. We want to expand our educational programs to many more areas and students across the country. The Electronic Field Trips offer stimulating, state-of-the-art, fun,yet challenging programs. They have allowed millions of students and teachers tolearn and understand the events that have shaped the nation 's history. They also542 ensure we keep alive John D. Rockefeller Jr. 's goal for Colonial Williamsburg ''that the future may learn from the past. '' You may accuse me of bias, but I believe Mr. Rockefeller would be proud of our educational programs. He would also encourage us to do more with his vision inmind. The advent of the twenty-first century provides an appropriate time to reflecton America, the democratic values that have influenced representative government,and the legal principles that have always protected a free society. Indeed, the onset of the new century in an opportune time to focus on the History of America. Responding to the challenge to learn from the past and prepare new generations of American leaders, the College of William and Mary and Colonial Williamsburg,two of the most prestigious educational institutions in America and preeminentstewards of early American history, are collaborating to establish a unique and chal-lenging residential program for scholarly historical research at Virginia 's Colonial Capital. We are tentatively calling it the Institute of American History and Democ-racy. The goal of the institute will be to assist the nation in re-calibrating its internal compass to enhance the understanding of college and high school students in ournation 's historic journey and to encourage the ongoing review of America 's founding principles. The Institute would be open to visiting undergraduates from colleges anduniversities across the United States and from the international community. Aca-demic credit would be provided by the College of William and Mary. Joint William and Mary and Colonial Williamsburg faculty, as well as nationally- recognized historians would develop the curriculum and present the courses. Coursetopics would include early American history, constitutional history, governmentalinstitutions, social history, military history, archeology, and museum-related fields. During the summer, this joint faculty would provide a similar program of courses for outstanding high school students from across the country. Summer high schoolstudents would be able to earn advance college credit for these courses. ColonialWilliamsburg has been providing a similar program for teachers for the last tenyears. Our Teacher Institutes have helped to avoid teacher burnout and have in-stead rekindled the passion for history and raised the teaching skills of those at-tending, several of whom have later been named teacher of the year in their states. Both Colonial Williamsburg and the College of William and Mary have developed some of this country 's most advanced and interactive methods of education. College and high school students who attend the proposed Institute would become involvedin interactive and hands-on learning experiences, as well as being exposed to exten-sive original research materials. These teaching methods along with state-of-the-arttechnology will engage the students and bring history alive. It is our hope that thecurriculum developed for the Institute could also be adapted to our outreach capa-bilities and thereby made available to an even wider audience. We are seeking a one-time award of $5 million to cover the initial start-up costs for the Institute including curriculum development, staff training, program mar-keting, and facility modifications. Housing will be provided by Colonial Williams-burg at existing facilities. Classroom space will be provided by Colonial Williams-burg and the College of William and Mary at existing facilities. Once established,the program will be self-supporting through tuition and private donations. I should note that Colonial Williamsburg has never sought this type of federal funding support before. We are seeking this assistance now because we believe thesetwo programs will add significantly to future generations ' understanding of basic democratic principles and will help to keep those principles alive and well for manygenerations to come. We want to help keep the ship of state pointed in the rightdirection by ensuring all of our citizens understand and can apply the basic prin-ciples and ideals of democracy that were established in this country in the late1700 's by the founders of our nation. Again, thank you for the opportunity to submit what we believe are two very ex- citing proposals. We hope you will agree and will help us make them a reality. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL MINORITY PUBLIC BROADCASTING CONSORTIA The National Minority Public Broadcasting Consortia (Minority Consortia) sub- mits this statement on the fiscal year 2003 appropriation for the Corporation forPublic Broadcasting (CPB). Our primary missions are to bring a significant amountof programming from our communities into the mainstream of PBS and publicbroadcasting. In summary, we request that the Committee support: \u2014The Administration 's request of $365 million for CPB for fiscal year 2003, a $15 million increase over fiscal year 2002;543 \u2014The Administration 's request of $20 million in CPB fiscal year 2001 funds for digital conversion; and we request that some of this funding be available toindependent minority producers for conversion to digital production; \u2014With regard to the Minority Consortia and multicultural programming we re- quest that the Committee support \u2014 An increased allocation of CPB program funds to expand our programming, in- cluding a 15 percent increase in the Multicultural Program Fund (currentlyat $3.2 million) which we administer; An increased allocation of CPB system support funds to expand our administra- tive capacity, at an amount at least commensurate with the overall CPB in-crease; Increased CPB outreach efforts to promote the multicultural television produc- tions expected to air on PBS this year. The National Minority Public Broadcasting Consortia consists of the National Asian American Telecommunications Association, the National Black ProgrammingConsortium, Native American Public Telecommunications, Pacific Islanders in Com-munications and the Latino Public Broadcasting Project. A federal appropriation of $365 million as requested by the Administration for CPB would be a reasonable, albeit modest, contribution toward our national treas-ure of public broadcasting. The debate of the past several years regarding public tel-evision and public radio has highlighted the great esteem in which they are held.We urge Congress to provide at least as much as has been requested by the Admin-istration for CPB for fiscal year 2003. Public broadcasting, including PBS and NPR, is particularly important for minor- ity and ethnic communities. While there is a niche in the commercial broadcast andcable world for quality programming about our communities and our concerns, it isin the public broadcasting industry where minority communities and producers aremore able to bring quality programming for national audiences. Additionally, publictelevision and radio is universally available. In 1994, CPB initiated research amongAsian American and Native American communities which documented that respond-ents felt their communities were negatively stereotyped on commercial televisionand that that PBS had more realistic portrayals. (REACHING COMMONGROUND: PUBLIC BROADCASTING 'S SERVICES TO MINORITIES AND OTHER GROUPS, July 1, 1994, pages 41 -41 of the Appendix). This survey also re- vealed that both groups wanted increased visibility in public television and furtherrecommended that there be expanded promotion of public broadcast programmingutilizing Asian American and community groups and tribal organizations. EarlierCPB surveys of Latino and African American communities showed similar findings. This is the Optimum Time to Increase Resources for CPB 's Mission of Diversity. \u2014 The Minority Consortia works closely with CPB. We value our relationship withPresident Coonrod and the CPB staff and appreciate the financial and technical as- sistance provided to us by that organization. We do not doubt CPB 's commitment to increasing the diversity of programming on public television and radio, but alsobelieve they can do more with the resources at hand. The stated commitment ofCPB and Congress for increased multicultural programming combined with threeyears of funding increases make this an ideal time for significant progress. It maybe now or never. Since 1988, ten Congressional authorizing and appropriations reports have ex- pressed support for the Minority Consortia and/or for increased multicultural pro-gramming on public television. The CPB fiscal year 2000 funding received by the Minority Consortia organiza- tions \u2014$1.53 million for institutional support ($307,000 per organization \u2014a $28,000 increase per organization over fiscal year 1999) and $3.2 million in programmingfunds ($636,000 per organization) \u2014is certainly modest compared to the cost of pro- ducing an increased amount of quality multicultural programming for public broad-cast. Our programming and administrative support funding combined is 1.56 per-cent of the CPB fiscal year 2000 budget (Fiscal years 2001 and 2002 funds have notyet been distributed). We appreciate that CPB has identified an additional $2.5 mil-lion in program funds which we, along with others, can compete, but the commit-ment for diverse programming should be larger than that. The Minority Consortia shared in the CPB fiscal year 1997 and 1998 budget re- ductions. Now, however, we are in a period for which Congress has appropriated in-creased funding for CPB. The CPB fiscal year 2001 appropriation, which has notyet been distributed, is $340 million, a $40 million increase over fiscal year 2000.And the fiscal year 2002 appropriation is $350 million, an increase of $10 millionover fiscal year 2001. The testimony of CPB President Bob Coonrod before this Subcommittee on March 28, 2000 discussed the need to increase the diversity of public broadcasting offer-544 ings, including multicultural programming. He also noted that the younger segment of our society is even more ethnically diverse than the older population. We applaudCPB 's public discussion of this need, and intend to work collaboratively with them and the entire public broadcasting community to help make this a reality. But inorder to do this, the amount of funding allocated for the development of multicul-tural programming must substantially increase. And at a minimum, the administra-tive funding for the Consortia should increase commensurate with the overall CPBbudget (a proposed 4.2 percent increase for fiscal year 2003). Audience Building. \u2014We ask your support in encouraging CPB to increase its ef- forts to build audiences for PBS programs presented by the Minority Consortia. Thegood news is that number of programs presented by the Minority Consortia on pub-lic television are increasing. On the other hand, the small administrative an pro-gram budgets of the Minority Consortia are not sufficient to do the kind of commu-nity and national outreach we would like for building audiences for these programs.Obviously, we engage in audience building, but much more can and should be done. The most recent shows on national public television from the Minority Consortia organizations include regret to inform, homecoming \u2014sometimes I am haunted by memories of red dirt and clay, and warrior in two worlds. Digital Conversion Assistance. \u2014Much attention was given at the March 28, 2000 House appropriations hearing regarding the opportunities which digital technologywill provide in the area of programming. With stations able to broadcast on multiplechannels, there will be a need for a tremendous amount of new, quality publicbroadcasting programming. There are costs involved in the conversion which go be-yond the significant equipment and hardware needs of stations. It will also take ad-ditional money to produce programming for digital broadcast. All producers will facethese new, higher costs. Film producers will need to use equipment that is high defi-nition quality, and that is an expensive proposition. Most producers with whom wework do have not the finances for this new equipment. CPB is currently providingsome technical assistance to producers regarding digital conversion. However, inde-pendent producers also need financial assistance in acquiring or accessing themeans to produce programming for digital broadcast. We also point out that the Minority Consortia organizations are jointly seeking non-federal sources of funding to support digital production for independent pro-ducers, and like their counterparts in public television and radio stations, inde-pendent producers also need federal assistance to make this transition. Work of the Minority Consortia. \u2014The Minority Consortia organizations work both individually and collaboratively. In the past twenty years the Consortia organiza-tions have individually provided to public broadcasting 's schedule hundreds of hours of programming addressing the cultural, social and economic issues of the country 's racial and ethnic communities. Individually, each Consortia organization has beenengaged in cultivating ongoing relationships with the independent producers com- munity by providing technical assistance, program funding, programming supportand distribution. We also provide numerous hours of programming to individualpublic television and radio stations. On the collaborative front, the five organizations comprising the Minority Con- sortia are working to jointly write and publish a catalog, newspaper ads, Open Callsfor Proposals, and a newsletter. Perhaps of most potential significance is our planned joint production of a four- part series which will explore the complex demands of our rapidly changing multira-cial, multicultural society in America. We will work with many film producers andwith CPB and PBS on the production, and CPB will provide some financial assist-ance. The production is entitled Matters of Race, and we have engaged noted pro-ducer/writer Orlando Bagwell (Malcom X: Make it Plain, Eyes on the Prize, A Hymnfor Alvin Alley, Fredrick Douglass: When the Lion Wrote History) to produce thisseries. The project will result in more than television programming. The project willutilize an advisory group of teachers and will be designed so that modules that canbe pulled out for classroom use. It will also be formatted for radio broadcast andfor the internet, and will include such broadcast applications as extended inter-views. There will be great opportunity for extensive and diverse community out-reach and collaboration on this project throughout its development, distribution anduse. Currently the five consortia groups are in discussion with other public broadcast entities to pool and share resources to increase awareness of PBS 's and public broadcasting diversity initiative. Some of these collaborations include centralizingprogram distribution with American Public Television, creating minority outreachfor stations with the Public Television Outreach Alliance, and working with CPBand PBS to formulate a long range strategy for minority programming for public545 broadcasting. The Minority Consortia organizations work collaboratively with a number of television stations, and hope to increase such working relationships. Thank you for your consideration of our recommendations. We see new opportuni- ties to increase diversity in programming, production, audience, and employment inthe new media environment, and we as minority communities in public broadcastingthank you for your long time support of our work on behalf of our communities. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICAN INDIANS INTRODUCTION Good morning Chairman Specter, Senator Harkin and distinguished members of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,and Related Agencies. My name is Susan Masten and I am the President of the Na-tional Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the oldest and largest Indian advocacyorganization in the United States and Chairperson of the Yurok Tribe. On behalfof the 250 member tribes of NCAI, I would like to thank you for this opportunityto submit this statement regarding the President 's budget request for fiscal year 2001. NCAI is extremely optimistic about this year 's budget process. For the first time in a generation, the President has requested a total of $9.4 billion for new and exist-ing Indian programs. If preserved through the appropriations process, this requestwill provide an increase of $1.2 billion over the fiscal year 2000 budget. The lasttime the Federal Government enacted an increase of a similar scope, was in themid-1970 's, as a part of President Nixon 's Tribal Self-Determination policy. The President 's fiscal year 2001 budget request represents a commitment to Indian pro- grams and will better serve Indian communities. It also exemplifies a meaningfulstep toward honoring the Federal Government 's treaty and trust obligations to In- dian nations. As Congress advances the appropriations process for fiscal year 2001,NCAI seeks support from this Subcommittee to fully fund the Indian programs inthe Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION For fiscal year 2001, the President 's budget request for the Department of Edu- cation Office of Indian Education (OIE) is $116 million, a 50 percent increase overthe fiscal year 2000 enacted level. NCAI fully supports this request as it will allowthe Department 's OIE to fund formula grants to Local Education Agencies (LEAs), fund new discretionary programs for OIE, and start a new program for AmericanIndian administrators. Additionally, NCAI fully endorses the Administration 's effort to fund the initiatives under the 1998 Executive Order on Indian Education. For fiscal year 2001, $92.8 million is requested for OIE 's formula grant program to public schools, an increase of $30 million over fiscal year 2000. These funds areprovided to BIA supported schools for the improvement of educational achievementsof Indian students by allowing for the initiation and expansion of Indian specificprograms and services. Within the fiscal year 2001 requested budget is a $20 millionrequest for Special Programs, an increase of $6.7 million over fiscal year 2000, forawards for school readiness demonstrations, educator professional developmentgrants, and continuation of the American Indian Teacher Corps. NCAI supportsPresident Clinton 's commitment to recruit and train 1,000 new Indian teachers over a five-year period who will then teach in schools with high concentrations of Indianstudents. Additionally, the President has requested $5 million for the American In- dian Administrator Corps. Within the President 's fiscal year 2001 proposed budget for Higher Education, $40 million has been requested for a new dual degree pro-gram. NCAI strongly supports these funding initiatives to advance Indian educationand develop an educational system responsive to the needs of Native students andteachers. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES The fiscal year 2001 budget requests $44 million for the Administration for Native Americans (ANA), an increase of $9 million over the fiscal year 2000 enacted level.In awarding grants in fiscal year 2001, ANA will give special attention to energydevelopment and the creation of tribal codes and ordinances. NCAI urges Congressto support this much-needed increase that will support tribal government infra-structure and increase tribal government capacity to administer programs. The fiscal year 2001 request for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Federal Administration line-item is $165 million, an increase of $17 millionover fiscal year 2000. From this total, funding is provided to the Division of Tribal546 Services (DTS). The DTS provides programmatic support to 22 tribal TANF pro- grams, which directly affects 94 tribes and Alaska Native villages. It is estimatedthat by fiscal year 2001, approximately 50 percent of all federally-recognized tribeswill either administer or be served by a tribal TANF program. While the ACF hastried to provide necessary funding to carry out these duties, without line-item fund-ing authorization for the DTS, the increasing needs of Indian tribes surroundingthese social support programs will not be met. NCAI requests a $10 million line-item funding for DTS. While the fiscal year 2001 budget requests $2 billion for the discretionary Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG), an increase of $817 million dollars overthe fiscal year 2000 enacted level, tribal governments, who receive a 2 percent set aside of the CCDBG, will still fall far short of meeting child care needs on their res-ervations. There is a critical need for safe, healthy, nurturing child care environ-ments, particularly on Indian reservations, where parents have a higher mediannumber of children than the national average. NCAI request an increase in tribalchild care funding from its current level of 2 percent of the total appropriation. The fiscal year 2001 budget boosts funding for Head Start by $1 billion in fiscal year 2001, the largest funding increase ever. The budget also provides a total of$175 million, including a $30 million increase over fiscal year 2000, for Indian HeadStart. NCAI strongly supports this much-needed increase to Indian Head Start pro-grams, many of which are stretched to capacity. Three provisions under the purview of the Administration on Aging, authorized in the Older Americans Act (Pub. L. 89 -73, as amended), are of special importance to American Indian and Alaska Native elders. The first is Aging Grants for NativeAmericans authorized in Title VI. The President 's fiscal year 2001 budget requests $24 million, an increase of $5 million over the fiscal year 2000 enacted level, forTitle VI grants to tribes and tribal organizations. Current grantees report a 20 per-cent increase in the number of elders eligible for the service between 1996 and 1999.Because of this growing population of Native elders, NCAI requests that the full $30million authorized for Title VI be appropriated in fiscal year 2001. The second provision is Aging Research and Training, also authorized in Title VI. For fiscal year 2001, NCAI requests an appropriation of $630,000 with at least$130,000 earmarked for a continuing grant to NICOA to gather information on In-dian elders and to quantify their needs. The remainder should be directed to grantsfor training Title VI service providers to better serve Indian elders. The third provision is ombudsman/elder abuse prevention authorized in Title VII: Allotments for Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection Activities, Subtitle B: NativeAmerican Organization Provisions. Prevention programs for tribes are desperatelyneeded \u2014yet no funds have ever been provided for Subtitle B, despite an authoriza- tion level of $5 million. State programs currently receive $4.5 million for ombuds-man services and $4.7 million for prevention of elder abuse programs. However,these programs seldom, if ever, reach Indian Country. NCAI seeks full funding of$5 million in fiscal year 2001, specifically for tribal programs as authorized in Sub-title B of Title VII. In fiscal year 2001, there is a need of $600,000 for special HIV surveillance stud- ies to be undertaken in order to better understand the extent of the HIV epidemicin the Native American population, and to supplement the existing AIDS case andHIV infection data presently available. Additionally, $200,000 is needed to contractout a series of meetings between states, CDC, IHS, tribal representatives, and epi-demiologist to make recommendations on improving the disease surveillance systemin Native America. NCAI seeks the support of this Subcommittee in this request. The President 's fiscal year 2001 budget request for the Centers for Substance Abuse Prevention is $48.8 million. NCAI seeks the support of this Subcommittee insecuring a targeted funding program whose purpose is to involve Native Americansubstance abuse prevention treatment programs more actively in the effort to slowthe spread of HIV. The President 's fiscal year 2001 budget request for the National Institute of Health (NIH) is $3 million. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of funding for re-search related to HIV in Native America within NIH. NCAI requests the supportof this Subcommittee in seeking critical funding for behavioral research in par-ticular, to help better understand the underlying components of risk behavior lead-ing to HIV infection in the Native American population. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) at least $55 million can be appro- priated for the Indian Comprehensive Services program. In fiscal year 2001, the Ad-ministration has requested $55 million. NCAI regards WIA as an opportunity to547 more effectively provide job training services and urges Congress to fully fund this program. The fiscal year 2001 budget proposal includes $255 million for a new ''Fathers Work/Families Win '' initiative, $10 million of which is set aside to provide grants to help Native American low-income families. These proposed funds are aimed ataddressing the working poor and fathers, in the aftermath of no new WtW funding.NCAI supports the $10 million set aside for applicants from the Native Americanworkforce agencies. The fiscal year 2001 budget request also provides $15 million for the tribal sup- plemental youth employment services program that replaces the former JTPA Sum-mer Youth Program, and supports year-round activities. In addition, the Presidentproposes to increase the Youth Opportunity Grant (YOG) program from its current$250 million funding level to $375 million in fiscal year 2001. NCAI requests suffi-cient funding to provide reliable and consistent opportunities for youth. NCAI alsosupports adequate funding of other DOL programs that benefit American Indians,including the Administrations 's Disabilities Services request for $43 million in the fiscal year 2001 budget. NCAI asks that these work incentive grants and servicesbe extend to tribes. CONCLUSION Mr. Chairman, we urge the Congress to fulfill its fiduciary duty to American Indi- ans and Alaska Native people and to uphold the trust responsibility as well as pre-serve the Government-to-Government relationship, which includes the fulfillment ofhealth, education and welfare needs of all Indian tribes in the United States. Thisresponsibility should never be compromised or diminished because of any Congres-sional agenda or party platform. Tribes throughout the nation relinquished theirlands as well as their rights to liberty and property in exchange for this trust re-sponsibility. The President 's fiscal year 2001 budget request acknowledges the fidu- ciary duty owed to tribes. We ask that the Congress maintain the federal trust re-sponsibility to Indian Country and continue to aid tribes on our journey toward self-sufficiency. Thank you for allowing me to present for the record the National Con-gress of American Indians ' comments regarding the President 's fiscal year 2001 budget request. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO ENDHOMELESSNESS The National Alliance to End Homelessness is a national membership organiza- tion with nearly 2,000 members around the country. Most are local nonprofit com-munity-based and faith-based organizations that are doing the hands-on work toend homelessness for families and individuals. As our name implies, our primaryfocus is ending homelessness, not simply making it easier to manage. There is noth-ing inevitable about homelessness in the United States. We know more about home-lessness and how to address it than we ever have before. We know what programmodels are effective for what kinds of people. It remains only to bring these solu-tions to a scale commensurate with the problem, and to focus them on bringinghomelessness to an end. It is our contention that an end to homelessness is a goal that we can achieve by the end of the decade. To do so we need to pursue four lines of attack simulta-neously. We must: \u2014Plan for outcomes \u2014Close the front door in to homelessness \u2014Open the back door out of homelessness and in to housing \u2014Build the infrastructure. PLANNING FOR OUTCOMES We have an extensive system for dealing with homelessness. Too often, however, this system focuses only on managing the problem and not on a permanent solution.To change this focus we need to be sure we have accurate information on who home-less people are, how they become homeless, and what works to allow them to secureand stay in housing. We need to commit ourselves to ending homelessness as theoutcome of the system 's activities. And we need to use the data to plan strategically to bring about the result we want. Recommendation .\u2014Encourage all programs to collect information about homeless- ness among those the programs serve. Much of the recent explosion of informationand know-how about homelessness has come as a result of research funded by thissubcommittee. This effort needs to be extended to the state and local level.548 Recommendation .\u2014Encourage federal agencies and state governments funded by programs such as the substance abuse and mental health block grants to plan forreducing homelessness among the population served. An important mandatoryspending item in the Administration 's budget request is a $10 million initiative to provide money to a small number of states to coordinate services for homeless peo-ple by programs not specifically targeted to homeless people. The request is in thebudget for the Health Care Financing Administration, partly because Medicaid issuch an important program for homeless people. We urge the subcommittee to en-courage agencies under its jurisdiction to cooperate with the initiative and work tomake their services better coordinated and more accessible to homeless people. CLOSING THE FRONT DOOR IN TO HOMELESSNESS We need to hold government-funded systems accountable for, at the very least, ensuring that the Americans they serve do not become homeless. We must treathomelessness among people with mental illness as sign that the mental health sys-tem needs improvement; homelessness among former foster children as a similarsign for the child protection system; homelessness among people with addiction dis-orders for the substance abuse treatment system. Recommendation .\u2014Encourage mainstream programs such as the substance abuse and mental health block grants to address homelessness and housing stabilityamong their target populations. Over the past few years this subcommittee has en-couraged agencies that oversee large ''mainstream '' (i.e. not homeless-targeted) pro- grams to pay attention to the amount of homelessness among the populations theyserve. This has led to important work by the agencies involved, to examine waysto make these programs more conscious of housing stability as an end to beachieved. More remains to be done, and the subcommittee should continue its dili-gence in this regard. OPENING THE BACK DOOR OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND IN TO HOUSING Most people who become homeless find housing on their own in relatively short order. We need to speed up that process, and prevent disruptions during the periodof homelessness. A minority, however, remains homeless for a long time. Among thisgroup, disabilities are prevalent, including mental illness, substance addiction, andHIV/AIDS. This subcommittee 's work can have a huge impact on efforts to rehouse people who are chronically homeless and chronically ill. Besides housing, they need treat-ment and services: \u2014Outreach, particularly to long-term homeless people with mental health and substance abuse problems, to ensure that they make use of the services thatare available. \u2014Short-term treatment in a residential setting aimed at stabilizing these individ- uals and transitioning them into permanent housing. \u2014Treatment and long-term aftercare linked with permanent housing, creating permanent supportive housing, a powerful model that improves the lives oflong-term homeless people while saving public money that would otherwise bespent on hospital emergency rooms, emergency detoxification, acute mentalhealth care, shelters and jails. \u2014Help with employment, as soon as homeless people are stabilized in a residen- tial setting. \u2014Case management to ensure that all services are available. \u2014Preparing people with few skills for success, once their housing situation has been stabilized. \u2014Assistance, particularly with children, to avoid disruption of family life during times of homelessness. Recommendation .\u2014Appropriate $100 million for the Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals program. This program, first authorized in 1992, has the po-tential to fill the most gaping hole in the system of supports for chronically home-less people \u2014the lack of effective substance abuse treatment services. The program would provide competitive grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration to local agencies, to provide specific services for homelesspeople with addictive disorders and/or mental illnesses. GBHI would provide anideal mechanism for linking HHS-funded services with HUD-funded supportivehousing. There is not an existing appropriation for this program, but we request that the subcommittee pass a new appropriation for it because it fills such a crucialneed, for substance abuse treatment and for treatment for mental illnesses that arenot considered ''severe '' (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression).549 The Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals program was authorized by Section 506 of the Public Health Service Act. As is true of all other SAMHSA pro-grams, its authorization has expired, but we urge Congress to respond to this asit has responded for other SAMHSA programs, by making year-to-year appropria-tions until the reauthorization process can be completed. The Senate-passed bill toreauthorize SAMHSA programs, S. 976, would reauthorize the GBHI program. Recommendation .\u2014Appropriate $75 million for Projects for Assistance in Transi- tion from Homelessness. PATH provides formula grants to each state for outreach,case management and treatment for homeless people with severe mental illnesses,including those with a dual diagnosis of mental illness and drug or alcohol addic-tion. PATH is ideal for funding outreach and case management, allowing people with severe mental illness to be brought into the system of care, their treatmentstabilized, and services to continue once they are permanently housed. Recommendation .\u2014Provide $129 million for Health Care for the Homeless (through a $1.5 billion appropriation for Consolidated Health Centers). Health Carefor the Homeless is part of the Consolidated Health Centers line item in the budgetfor the Health Resource Services Administration. The program funds clinics thatspecialize in the unique treatment challenges presented by people who are homeless,often for long periods of time. Clinics provide primary care, as well as diagnostic,preventive, emergency medical, pharmaceutical, addiction, and mental health serv-ices. They also conduct intensive outreach and case management, linking patientsto housing, income and transportation. HCH projects are ideal to provide outreachand to stabilize the worst-off homeless people. Recommendation .\u2014Appropriate $120 million for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs. The Administration for Children and Families within HHS oper-ates coordinated competitive grant programs addressing the problems of homelessand runaway youth. Runaway and Homeless Youth programs support cost-effective,community-based services that protect youth from the harms of life on the streetsand either reunify them safely with family or find alternative placements. RHYPends homelessness by engaging in outreach, and quickly rehouses as many homelessyouth as possible. For others, it provides services that will prepare them to enteradulthood housed. Recommendation .\u2014Appropriate $15 million for the Homeless Veterans Reintegra- tion Program. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program, within the Depart-ment of Labor 's Veterans Employment and Training Service, provides job placement and related services to homeless veterans. Homeless veterans have many barriersto employment. According to DoL, HVRP helps overcome those barriers and placesveterans in jobs at a rate of about $1430 per placement, making it extremely cost-effective. While successful, HVRP has been able to serve only a small portion of thehomeless veteran population, due to insufficient funding. Last year an increase forthis program received bipartisan support. This year, the Administration has re-quested, and we support, the full authorization level of $15 million. Recommendation .\u2014Appropriate $50 million for Education for Homeless Children and Youth. A struggle for homeless service providers who serve families with chil-dren is to maintain the children 's stability during a time when their lives are turned upside down. Even if new housing can be found in a short time, the lasting effectsof a spell of homelessness can be devastating, if everything in their lives is dis-rupted. The most important potential source of stability for these children isschool \u2014but only if they can continue to attend school. That is the mission of the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. EHCY removes obstacles toenrollment and retention by establishing liaisons between schools and shelters andproviding funding for transportation, tutoring, school supplies, and the coordinationof statewide efforts to remove barriers. As a result, the percentage of homelessschool age children attending school increased from 50 percent prior to establish-ment of the program to 88 percent in 1997. This encourages quick rehousing of fami-lies by retaining ties to their communities. BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE In addition to initiatives that focus on homelessness, bringing homelessness to an end will require larger systemic reforms to improve the incomes of the poorestAmericans, to make housing more affordable, and to make services widely availableto those who need them. This subcommittee 's efforts in areas such as child care, education and employment are critical in this regard. Two programs under this sub-committee 's jurisdiction are particularly important: Recommendation .\u2014Fully fund the Labor Department 's ''Fathers Work/Families Win'' initiative. The Department of Labor has made great strides over the last few years in making it 's programs work better for the lowest income people, including550 homeless people. The proposal in the DoL budget for the ''Fathers Work/Families Win'' initiative provides great promise to continue the work begun by the mandatory Welfare to Work Grants Program \u2014making sure the poorest Americans have the tools they need to succeed in the workplace. We urge the subcommittee to approvethat initiative while encouraging the Department to continue to make those serv-ices, and the services of Workforce Investment Act programs, fully available to peo-ple who are struggling with homelessness. Recommendation .\u2014Appropriate $1.4 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy As- sistance Program. Inability to pay for utilities is second only to inability to pay rentas an economic cause of homelessness. LIHEAP has for many years proven an effec-tive program with bipartisan support, designed to help low-income people affordthese charges and avoid homelessness. We encourage Congress to provide adequatefunding for this important program.(i)LIST OF WITNESSES, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PREPARED STATEMENTS Page Alexander, Dr. Duane, Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Department of Healthand Human Services ............................................................................................ 127 Prepared statement .......................................................................................... 158 American: Academy of Physician Assistants, prepared statement ................................. 375Association of Colleges of Nursing, prepared statement ............................... 441Chemical Society, prepared statement ........................................................... 414College of Chest Physicians, prepared statement .......................................... 433Gastroenterological Association, prepared statement ................................... 436Heart Association, prepared statement .......................................................... 396Medical Association, prepared statement ....................................................... 328Museum of Natural History, prepared statement ......................................... 537Physiological Society, prepared statement ..................................................... 414Public Power Association, prepared statement .............................................. 342Public Transportation Association, prepared statement ............................... 352Society for Microbiology, prepared statement............................................ 393, 403Society of Clinical Oncology, prepared statement .......................................... 456Society of Mechanical Engineers, prepared statement .................................. 419Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, prepared statement .................. 475 Association of: American Universities, prepared statement .................................................. 495Population Centers, prepared statement ........................................................ 497Women 's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, prepared statement ...... 400 Babyland Family Services, Inc., prepared statement ........................................... 383 Battey, Dr. James F., Jr., Director, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Department ofHealth and Human Services ............................................................................... 127 Prepared statement .......................................................................................... 178 Bosch, Erin, prepared statement ............................................................................ 505Breast Cancer Action, letter from .......................................................................... 277 Fund, letter from .............................................................................................. 275 Byrd, Hon.
