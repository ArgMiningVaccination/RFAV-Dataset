It is a natural health care remedy that has been used for more than 200 years. Recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the second largest therapeutic system in use in the world, over 30 million European and millions of others around the globe benefit from using it. In the United States, homeopathic medicines are primarily used by a small segment of the population for non-life-threatening conditions such as the common cold, flu or pain. What is Homeopathy? The word Homeopathy is Greek in origin and means \"like disease.\" Thus, the basis of homeopathy is \"like heals like.\" Thus, Homeopathy today is based on two basic principles: \"like cures like\" and \"the minimum dose.\"Homeopathic Medicine uses a natural, holistic approach to the treatment of an illness. It treats the whole person as opposed to focusing on the diseased part. Homeopathic medicine views symptoms of the illness as normal responses of the body as it attempts to regain homeostasis. \"The minimum dose\" involves treating an individual with highly diluted substances, with the focus on triggering the body's natural system of healing. It's using the elements of nature to heal a patient internally. A process of dilution and succession prepare homeopathic medicines. The dilution is done using natural substances, alcohol, and water. Succussion is a process of agitation, best described as vigorous shaking. Homeopathic practitioners only provide enough medicine to initiate the healing process. The natural functions of the body do the rest. Providing minimal doses allows for maximum effect with the fewest side effects. What Conditions Does It Treat? Homeopathic treatments can be used for a variety of health issues, including some chronic conditions such as: Allergies Depression Chronic fatigue Migraines Pain such as knee pain back pain and neck pain Conclusion In many cases, homeopathy can complement the treatment that is already being given by the chiropractor. The body has a great ability to self-heal if it is properly aligned and adjusted. When your chiropractor adds homeopathic remedies, he or she may be able to hasten the healing process.
