We can find examples of herbal medicine used in ancient China, Egypt, and with indigenous peoples of North America and the continent of Africa. Today they are still used as a form of alternative medicine and even some pharmaceuticals are made from botanicals. [In holistic medicine](https://www.raowellness.com/whole-body-approaches/what-is-holistic-medicine/), herbal medicine is used either by itself or in conjunction with scientifically backed traditional practices. In modern times, herbs are applied for a variety of conditions like [inflammation](https://www.raowellness.com/conditions-we-treat/inflammation/), [cardiovascular issues](https://www.raowellness.com/services/cardiovascular-disease/), depression, anxiety, and boosting the immune system. Many of these plants have antioxidants, which fight free radicals and slow damage to the cells. A holistic doctor may add an herbal medicine regime to a patient's treatment as a way to manage chronic or other types of illnesses alongside treatments, like [acupuncture](https://www.raowellness.com/treatments-we-offer/acupuncture/) or [massage](https://www.raowellness.com/treatments-we-offer/lymphatic-enhancement-therapy/).

What to Watch Out For When using alternative herbal medicine, it is vital to stay informed to avoid any negative health complications. Work with a holistic doctor to ensure your safety, as they can monitor you and change the course of care if need be. You should also keep an eye out for any side effects and be sure to discuss them with your doctor, so they know whether they need to adjust your treatment. Additionally, be sure to follow instructions on labels, if taking supplements, and do not exceed the recommended dosage. Research the supplements you use to make sure you are getting them from a trusted brand. For any allergic reactions, get medical help immediately. Why Holistic Health There are several reasons why a person may choose to seek out holistic health. Holistic medicine seeks to treat the individual and a person can receive a more comprehensive plan of care than they might get with a traditional doctor. Holistic medicine takes a whole-body approach and cares for patients with the philosophy of creating balance in the mind, body, and spirit. The belief is if there is an imbalance then illness will occur in a person. So, to bring back this balance, a holistic practitioner will work with the person to treat all aspects of their health, rather than just the disease. People often turn to holistic health for the affordability of natural medicines and if it is more in line with a person's belief system, especially if they are wary of synthetic chemicals used in traditional Western medicine. Also, there is typically a sense that patients are really listened to about their issues, often unlike in traditional Western practices, and it is not just about managing symptoms. All of these different factors may influence someone to go to a holistic doctor and it is never a bad thing for people to consider all of their options when it comes to taking care of their health. Naturopathic v. Holistic Herbal medicine does fall under the category of [naturopathic medicine](https://www.raowellness.com/whole-body-approaches/what-is-natural-medicine/), but it is also practiced in holistic medicine. The difference is that holistic medicine is, usually, practiced specifically by a doctor who has been trained in traditional Western medicine. They also have the holistic philosophy of treating the whole person. Someone who solely practices naturopathic medicine does not have that same background and only has training in different types of natural remedies, such as herbs, massage, acupuncture, and homeopathy. Naturopathic medicine relies solely on natural remedies to heal people and will not use any traditional practices. However, naturopathy is often used in holistic or integrative medicine alongside conventional methods.
