Do you feel like you need a total reset for your health? You're not alone! Our increasingly toxic world creates a major burden on our bodies. There are approximately 80,000 chemicals registered for use in the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that hundreds of these chemicals are present in our bodies. Exposure through the air we breathe, the stress we feel and the food we ingest can add up to over 14 pounds of pesticides, herbicides, food additives and preservatives per year for the average American. The liver, together with the gastrointestinal tract, is the organ responsible for removing these toxins. If the liver is not working at full speed, every other system in the body is at risk as toxins become stored in the body. Some research shows that certain chemicals may affect our immune, endocrine, nervous and reproductive systems Toxins Can Contribute to a Wide Range of Conditions: Stuffy head Fatigue or difficulty sleeping Indigestion and other gastrointestinal upset Food cravings and weight gain Reduced mental clarity Low libido Skin that's not looking its best Joint discomfort Widespread inflammation Whether you are on-track with your health habits or way out of balance, we can all benefit from the boost of a detox.
