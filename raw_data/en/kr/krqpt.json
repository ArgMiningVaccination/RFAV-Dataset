I wouldn't have wanted to believe you! In fact, I've been afraid of psychics. If one were to tell me something I don't want to hear\u2014that might not even be right\u2014it could stick in my brain due to the premise of it being a divine truth. Suppose I told a psychic I was vegan and they \"saw\" I needed meat. This could sabotage my ability to be healthy without supporting the slaughter industries.

Over time, he became in demand with celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson for his extrasensory diagnoses. Luckily, the advice that \"Spirit of Compassion\" whispers in Anthony's ear turned out to be generalizable enough he was able to write books \u2014 sort of like health readings of the whole human race. Based on Anthony's content, here is what I changed in my vegan lifestyle recently that made it feel more awesome. Some of his ideas correspond with today's scientific consensus. Others do not. If any of them resonate, try them out slowly, carefully, and see how your body responds. When we are sick and searching for answers, all we can do is try. 1. I'm phasing out my exposure to toxic modern things Even the healthiest diet is not enough if the rest of your life looks toxic. Anthony... "}
