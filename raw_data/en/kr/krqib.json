It is touching, informative, and inspirational - take a look! We are using this video to launch our awareness campaign #StepUp4Vitiligo. Our goal is to raise awareness for vitiligo so that someday everyone will understand what it is and what patients go through, so insurance companies will stop denying coverage for current treatments, and so we can raise money for research to bring new, even better treatments to patients. Please help us and share "}
