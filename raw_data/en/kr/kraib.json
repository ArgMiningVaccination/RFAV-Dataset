The multidisciplinary TF of ERS members , specialists in pneumo nology, radiology and outcomes assessment convened on 23 December 2020 . Key clinical questions relat ing to the follow -up of patients with long COVID -19 were identified and prioritised by consensus . The TF was approved as part of ERS TF -2020 -14 (The European Respiratory Society Guideline for Management of COVID -19, chairs J . Chalmers, N . Roche) and follows other ERS COVID -19 initiatives (1-3). The TF reviewed features of acute disease that could predict long-term consequences , data on thromboembolic event risk, as well as infection control during the long COVID -19 period. Further, the TF reviewed the evidence for cardiopulmonary and imaging techniques and techniques for cognitive, psychological, disability and home care follow -up. Introduction The COVID -19 pandemic has infected almost 250 million people and resulted in the deaths of over five million (WHO) (4). The natural history of COVID -19 and the long -term sequelae, with adverse health outcomes and impact on health -related quality -of-life (HRQOL) are not fully understood (5,6) . Many patients suffered from COVID -19 recover their baseline he alth status, but, an uncertain proportion of COVID -19 survivors have persistent symptoms presenting a challenge for patients and physicians (7,8) . These l onger term consequences , thought to occur in approximately 10% of people infected (9) appear to vary in sever ity, often impact ing multiple organs. Whilst the primary s ymptoms and often breath lessness, fatigue, and sleeping difficulties, low grade fever, depression, anxiety, cardiac, pulmonary and renal anomalies have been reported (5). There is no established nomenclature on how to define the lasting sequelae of COVID -19. Those proposed lack clear criteria of how to define th is condition ' or how to stratify patients (10-13). Guidelines The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and Royal College of General Practitioner s (RCGP) in the UK published a rapid guideline on the manag ement of the lon g-term effects of COVID -19 in December 2020 (updated November 2021) (14). This guideline defines Post-COVID -19 syndrome as signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID -19, which continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explai ned by an alternative diagnosis . Referral to post -COVID -19 syndrome assessment clinics is recommended when symptoms persist for 6 -12 weeks. Acute COVID -19 signs and symptoms are characterised to occur up to four weeks following diagnosis while Long COVID' describes signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID -19 and post-COVID -19 syndrome encapsulates those with sympt oms persisting >12 weeks (14). The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR ) (15) suggest that people experiencing long COVID may exhibit distinct clinical entities, such as post -intensive care syndrome (PICS) (equivalent to the acute post -COVID phase), post -viral fatigue syndrome (if fatigue is the predominant post -COVID symptom), permanent organ damage (an underlying mechanism explaining long -term symptoms), and long -term COVID syndrome (equivalent to long and persistent post -COVID phases) based on the hypothesis that post -COVID symptoms vary in intensity and duration an d are not linear or sequential (16). In this statement we use the term long COVID to incorporate elements most in need of clinical follow -up and to include subgroups with ongoing symptomatic COVID and post -COVID syndrome. Guidelines for the follow -up of Long COVID The clini cal management of long COVID is challenging due to a lack of evidence -based guidelines and standardi sation in the pulmonary definition/terminology of the post-COVID - 19 condition' . The French respiratory society (SPLF) propose a complete lung evalu ation in patients with symptoms persisting 12 weeks following infection (day zero defined as day of hospital admission or beginning of symptoms) (17). The British Thoracic Society (BTS) , guidance supports algorithms for evaluating COVID -19 surv ivors in the first three months after hospital discharge based on the severity of acute COVID -19 and whether Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) level care was delivered (18). Algorithms for both severe and mild -to-moderate COVID -19 groups recommend clinical assessment and cardiopulmonary evaluation in all patients at 12 weeks, ac cording to clini cal judgmen t. Based on the findings of the 12-week assessment, patients either have further evaluat ion, or are discharged. Prior to this, an earlier clinical assessment for respiratory, psychi atric and thromboembolic sequelae and rehabilit ation needs, is recommended at four to six weeks post discharge for th ose with severe acute COVID -19, (defined as those needing ICU or high dependency unit (HDU) level care or those hospitalised with severe pneumonia, the elderly and all those with comorbi dities (18). Parameters for elderly' were not defined. Interim guidance on rehabilitation in hospital and post -discharge published by an ERS -ATS coordinated international TF recommend s early bedside rehabilitation for patients affected by severe COVID -19, assessment of oxygen needs at discharge and more comprehensive assessment of rehabilitation needs including physical as well as mental status six to eight weeks post-discharge (2). Monitoring patients with COVID -19 after discharge is necessary to understand the extent and severity of long -term effects. In this statement , we will focus on long COVID -19 follow -up one to six months post-acute COVID -19 infection. We define day zero the day of discharge , or the day of the beginning of symptoms. We aim to address questions about potent predictors of long -term consequences, as well as optimal post-hospital assessment related to thromboembolic events, pulmonary physiology, imaging and infection control, based on current data. Further , we will apprais e appropriate follow -up concerning cognitive, and psychological functioning , quality -of-life (QOL) , disability and home -care. Methods The TF consisted of 12 members (including a n Early Career Member) , expert s in respiratory medicine, pulmonary physiology, radiology and outcomes assessment . TF members w ere selected by the chairs based on their expertise a nd international representation. The chairs composed a list of 16 clinically important topics relevant to the follow -up of COVID -19 infection. Two meetings of TF members were convened and eight topics were selected according to clinical urgen cy and by consensus of the TF (Table 1) . TF members were divided into subgroups to address the topics. All questions were addressed follo wing the ERS rules for Statements. Statements are based on systematic literature searches (conducted by information specialists ). A full systematic review with meta -analyses and grading of the evidence was not performed and as a result this paper does not contain recommendations for clinical practice. Individual l iterature search es for every question were designed by professional librarians, with the input of TF members. Systematic searches were conducted up to 26 March 2021 in MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL . For the full search strategies see Appendix A. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were published in English , reporting in adult population s, and on outcomes one to six months post -discharge in hospitali sed and non- hospitali sed patients . Case reports and case series were excluded, unless otherwise specified (Appendix B). The study selection was finali sed in April 2021 . PRISMA diagram s for each question are in Appendix C. Preliminary individual subsections were further discussed in a virtual meeting ( May 2021 ) and revised until consensus among all co -authors was reached (June 2021 ). All co -authors critically revised and approved the final statement . This ERS statement combines an evidence -based approach , clinical expertise of TF members, systematic search of the literature and critical discussions from virtual meetings. The statement summari ses relevant literature and current practice by topic. I t does not provid e de nuovo recommendation s for clinical practice but indicates where the TF members are in agreement with published guidance . Figure 1 illustrates current practice of TF members . All members of the TF disclosed their conflicts of interest before initiation of the project and upon submission of the manu script.

The eight clinical priorities and questions addressed by this Task Force. Clinical Question 1. Are there features of the acute disease characteristics which predict long-term consequences? Evidence overview: Few data are available on predictors of long-term consequences of COVID -19. They mainly include pulmonary fibrosis (PF), as described by reduced single breath carbon monoxide lung diffusing capacity (DL CO), restrictive syndrome, and persistent ground glass, and fatigue and/or anxiety one to eight months post-COVID -19. Initially, 4524 records were identified . Twelve eligible studies were included (1 ret rospective cohort study and 1 1 prospective ) (8,19 -29), focus ing directly on predicting factors of PF and/or persistent symptoms after COVID -19 episode (Appendix C) . Of the 12 studies, the majority reported on hospitali sed patients and three reported on both hospitali sed and non-hospitali sed. No studies included non-hospitalised patients only. The main persistent symptoms reported in the included studies were fatigue (50-65% of patients ) and anxiety/depression (20-40% ). Risk factors for COVI D-19 persistent symptoms, especially fatigue, were not associated with initial severity (19), but with age, f emale gender and the number of symptoms during the first week of infection (19). These results were not found in all studies (20). Few studies focused on olfactory and gustatory late resolution. The initial grade of dysfunction (total or partial), gender, and presence of nasal congestion appeared as potential predictive factors (21). The vast majority of the studies included in this analysis focused on PF and reduced DL CO. The size of the cohorts and/or the design does not permit the calculation or estimation of the PF ri sk. Han reported (in 114 hospitalised patients) that one third of patients had fibrotic like lesions on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan done six months after discharge (22). Age among all possible factors, was the most frequent predictor of long -term consequences (8,22) , possibly because the aging lung is more susceptible to development of fibrotic response or elderly people may have a subclinical interstitial lung disease exacerbated by acute infection (30). Presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS , OR: 13; 95% CI: 3.3, 55 ) at the acute phase of the SARS -CoV -2, and the severity of the initial disease (8,22,23) were two predict ive factors of PF, but these data are also demonstrated in other causes of ARDS. According to the se studies , COVID -19 severity, as a predictor of PF, is evaluated by need of mechanical ventilation, ventilation duration, opacity score at discharge and hospitalisation duration (8,22) . Some biological parameters have been found to be associated with higher risk of PF: high LDH level on admission, low level of T -cells and, prolonged elevation of interleukin -6 (24). These parameters again reflect disease severity and indicat e the dysregulated immune response (25). LDH ha s already been considered as a marker of pulmonary injury (26). In the studies focus ing on DL CO decrease , the time to evaluate pulmonary function was variable between one to eight months, and so the long-term outcome of these abnormalities remains unknown. As for PF, initial disease severity (23,27,28) often evaluated by oxygenation modalities, sometimes by intensive care severity score and/or by other organ failure (for instance renal failure), appeared as the main risk factor. High flow oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation (invasive and non -invas ive ventilation) are associated to a higher risk of diffusion impairment (OR 4.6 in Huang study) (16). Biological ly, a higher level of D -Dimer at admission in a small cohort of 55 patients, was an independent predictor of abnormal DL CO at three months (29). Concluding remarks : Age, severity of COVID -19 (evaluated by a range of variables : oxygenation and ventilator modalities, ARDS, radiological data, and some biological parameters ; D Dimers, T cell count, LDH, Interleukin -6) appeared to be the best predictors of abnormal DL CO and PF occurrence. On the contrary, severity of initial disease was not associated with the persisten ce of symptoms, factors which appeared to be linked to gender, age and to the number of symptoms during the first wee k. These data are based on a few small studies and will need to be confirmed in new larger studies. Clinical Question 2. Which follow -up strategies relate to thromboembolic event s? Evidence overview: Hypercoagulability is a frequent haematological alteration in hospitalised patients with COVID -19. Clinical venous thromboembolism disseminated intravascular microvascular circulation, and arterial thrombosis. The systematic literature search identified 1181 studies on long -term consequences and patient follow -up. Six eligible studies (3 prospective, 2 retrospective, 1 strategy proposition ) were included (Appendix C) (31-36). Four studies examin ed the rate of thrombosis after discharge. In a n Italian follow -up study of 767 patients with COVID -19, 51% still reported s ymptoms at a median time of 81 days after discharge, with 38% of th ose having an elevated D-dimer level (31) including two asymptomatic pulmonary thrombosis discovered by investigating striking D -dimer elevation. In a retrospective cohort study of 163 post-discharge patients with conrmed COVID -19 not receiving anticoagulation, the cumulative incidence of thrombosis (including arterial and venous events) at day 30 following discharge was 2.5% (95% CI, 0.8 -7.6); the cumulative incidence of VTE alone was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1 -4.6). As the rate of haemorrhage a ppeared to be of the same magnitude, universal post discharge thromboprophylaxis was not recommended (32). Similar figures were demonstrate d at 42 days follow -up in a 152 -patient cohort (33). In a six week follow -up study of 33 patients discharged without anticoagulation, all patients with elevated D -dimer levels underwent ultrasound duplex scanning and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan to rule out VTE (34). There were no thromboembolic complications and no echocardiographic impairments. Consequently, in the absence of other thrombotic risk factors, patients with COVID -19 are mostly discharged without prophylactic anticoagulation. If diagnosed with pulmonary embolism ( PE) de novo during follow -up, patients should be treated in line with PE guidelines (37). Only one of the identified studies reported on the long -term outcomes of patients with COVID -19 and VTE. This prospective observational study evaluated a composite of major bleeding and death at 90 days in 100 consecutive patients with VTE in the setting of COVID - 19 (2/3 hospitalised , 1/4 in ICU; 64% PE) (35). Mortality (24%) and major bleeding (11%) were high. The majority of complications occurred in the first 30 days. Most patients received Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs ) (52%) or Low Molecular Weight Heparin at discharge. There were no VTE recurrences. The follow -up evaluation of patients with PE during acute COVID -19 draws from PE guidelines (37). Concluding remarks: At this stage, it is still unclear if pulmonary thromboembolism and inflammatory pulmonary microangiopathy (36) demonstrated in patients with severe COVID -19 will lead to sequelae such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In patients with persistent exertional dyspnoea without evidence of parenchy mal lung opacities on high resolution CT three to six months after discharge and with pulmonary function tests documenting preserv ed lung volumes and normal or reduc ed DL CO, follow -up evaluation should include echocardiogram and contrast enhanced CT to identify significant pulmonary vascular involvement, as per proposed guidance (18). As contrast enhanced CT cannot exclude CTEPH (38), lung perfusion studies with (SPECT) -energy CT (DECT) proposed to exclude vascular involvement in symptomatic post -COVID patients, even in absence of PE history during the acute illness (39). As suggested by previous guidel ines, i f there is evidence of significant Pulmonary Hypertension ( PH), patients should be considered for referral to a specialist PH centre (40,41) . Clinical Question 3. Which follow -up strateg ies relate to pulmonary physiology? Evidence overview : Although SARS -CoV -2 can theoretically infect various organs after binding to the ubiquitous ACE -2 cell membrane receptor, the respiratory system is the most frequently impacted due to the airborne nature of the infective agent. Regarding pulmonary function tests (PFTs) after the acute phase , 1578 records were identified (Appendix C). Thirty -nine eligible studies (1 Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), 3 systematic reviews, 11 prospective cohort studies , 7 retrospective studies , 15 cross -sectional, 2 case series ) were included (8,23,27 -29,34,42 -74). Two studies (23,45,46,56) . When measuring PFTs at rest, all investigators sought three main features, i.e. the existence of (1) obstructive pattern, (2) restrictive pattern, and (3) lung gas exchange impairment (27,42,43,52 -54,29,55 -57,28,58 -60,44 -46,23,47,48,34,8,49 looked at more integrative responses to physical exercise, either using six - minute walking test (6MWT) (8,23,34,42 -51,61,62,73,74) or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) (51,63 -65). The main parameter use d to define bronchial obstructive pattern is the ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1) over Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Restrictive pattern was deemed to be present based on either reduction of Total Lung Capacity (TLC) or the combination of low FVC and high FEV 1/FVC ratio when TLC could not be measured. In some studies, reduced Residual Volume (RV) was also considered as part of the restrictive pattern. Lung gas exchange was mostly assessed using the DL CO (27,73,42,43,74,52 -54,29,55 -57,28,58 -60,44 -46,23,47,48,34,8,49,50) . Only one study examined nitric oxide lung diffusing capacity (DL NO) combined with DL CO (69). The earliest time point after the acute phase of the disease is one month (27,42,73) , with a majority of the studies reporting PFTs from six weeks to four months (42,43,53,54,29,55 -57,28,58 -60,44 - 46,23,47 -51,66,67) , with very few at six months (8,52,64) post discharge or onset of disease. Patient inclusion criteria were inconsistent between studies . The majority of the studies included hospitalised patients, while two studies involved both hospitali sed and non hospitalised, and only one has been performed on non hospitalised patients. Patients with pre- existing chronic lung disease were not differentiated, thus making it difficu lt to relate abnormal PFTs results to either COVID -19 lung injury or possible pre-existing disease. There were disparities in reporting data either as absolute values, percentage of predicted values, with only a few report ing both absolute and percentage . Few studies adopted the Global Lung Initiative (GLI) approach using the lower limits of normal (LLN) threshold to distinguish abnormal values, whilst the majority retained 80% of predicted values for TLC, FVC and DL CO. Correcting DL CO for hemoglobin was not consistent . All studies reported a relatively high prevalence of reduced DL CO in 40 -65% of patients as compared with the medium to high prevalence of restrictive pattern and the exceptionally low prevalence, if not absence, of obstructive pattern. If th e high prevalence of altered DL CO found at one month after discharge , or the onset of the disease partly result from ongoing residual inflammation related to the initial lung injury, the persistent low values of DL CO at three and six months , even in patien ts with normali sed chest CT , raise the need for further discussion (75). DL CO is the product of the accessible alveolar volume (V A) and the transfer coefficient K CO; altered DL CO can theoretically occur when either V A or K CO, or both, are reduced (76). Deciphering between V A and K CO as the causal factor for reduced DL CO is therefore critical to infer the underlying lung structural changes with either interstitial abnorm alities or pulmonary vascular abnormalities. If DL CO had been measured in all studies assessing PFTs, V A and K CO were seldom reported, thus compromising key messages regarding the pathological nature of impaired lung gas transfer. Another way to dissect th e underlying mechanisms of reduced DL CO could be the simultaneous measurement of DL NO and DL CO. This test is only available in a small number of c enters , which may explain the scarcity of DL NO papers in patients with COVID -19. Concluding remarks: From the currently available literature (70-72), PFT's were performed on average three month s after onset of COVID -19. PFT measurement includ ing at least static lung volumes with ideally TLC measurement, expiratory flow rates and DL CO assessment are regarded as useful tools to assess long -term lung function sequelae in patients with COVID -19 by most investigators . An effort of global harmonization to (1) express results, (2) choose criteria defining anomaly, (3) refine patients' inclusion criteria, (4) prospectively investigate lung function in (5) multiple centers is still insufficient. There is agreement in all studies on the high prevalence of altered lung gas exchange in patients with COVID -19 as the main feature of PFTs anomalies . Most TF members provide DL CO results after correction for hemoglobin, and together with V A and K CO, it he lps the readers to decipher the underlying causes of altered lung gas exchange. A large, international multicenter trial using DL NO and DL CO simultaneous measurement could provide more useful information. Clinical Question 4. Which follow -up strategies relate to imaging? Evidence overview : Fourteen eligible studies (9 prospective cohort studies , 4 retrospective, and 1 cross -sectional) (22,43 ,45,47,77 -84,52,19) were included on imaging follow -up of patients with COVID -19, following a search of 1300 initial records (Appendix C) . A small number of studies reported high rates of persisting abnormalities on radiology at discharg e, despite absence of symptoms (52,77 -80,19) . Indeed, we know that radiological healing of pneumonitis is slower than clinical conve rsion. Further studies aimed to report the frequency of pulmonary abnormalities at three and six-month CT scan (22,43,45,52,81,82) . Studies of radiological abnormalities on CT at three to six months may overestimate the true frequency of persistent abnormalities as studies without systematic follow -up will be biased towards patients with severe disease and persistent symptoms . Only four of the studies included also non -hospitalised patient s. In fact, residual lung lesions are more frequently observed in CT scans of patients who had extensive imaging abnormalities as well as severely altered clinical -laboratory markers of disease severity (including ICU admission, longer hospitalisation ) during the acute phase (22,52,83) . The longitudinal behavior of CT abnormalities mostly reflects the temporal evolution of diffuse alveolar damage and organi sing pneumonia, namely the main pathologic patterns underlying COVID -19 pneumonia (84). Ground -glass opacity (GGO) is the most frequent finding at three -month CT, followed by parenchymal bands, peri -lobular opacities, and scant interlobular septal thickening. It was observed that these CT abnormalities diminish w ith time (22), while complete waning is still under investigation as more longitudinal data accumulate s. Intriguingly, GGO may gradually increase in extent and reduce in density (22). Terms such as fibrosis or \"fibrotic -like\" changes entered the literature , yet are still not justified for practical use and interpretation of the patient management. CT features of lung fibrosis were interpreted in up to 47.1% at the three -month follow -up (47). Han et al reported a prospective cohort of 114 patients undergoing a six-month follow -up CT scan (22). This included 35% of the total cohort with fibrotic like features (e.g. parenchymal bands, traction bronchiectasis etc.). Indeed, it is unlike ly that lung fibrosis occurs in such a large proportion of subjects who have had COVID -19 pneumonia, and most of those \"fibrotic -like\" changes might be reversible at later follow -up. Concluding remarks: Despite the current data , it is unclear if fibrotic -like' CT features represent irreversible disease (e.g. post -ARDS), or slowly regressive infiltrate secondary to organi sing pneumonia , also seen with mild distortion mimicking a ctual fibrosis. T he risk of over -calling lung fibrosis in follow -up CT scan seems more frequent in the presence of bronchial distortion within the areas of organi sing pneumonia features. TF members do not call such bronchial distortion traction bronchiectasis, which, by definition, represents an established CT feature of irreversi ble lung fibrosis. Therefore, most TF members are cautious when calling out fibrosis, especially in the early follow -up CT where parenchymal changes are encountered frequently and are more prone to resolve. Given the high proportion of subjects who either develop ARDS or undergo mechanical ventilation, the development of lung fibrosis remains a concern. More imaging data are needed to clearly distinguish between COVID -pneumonia sequelae and ventilator -induced lung injury. Guidelines are awaited to inform wh en and how imaging should be referred. TF members consider imaging follow -up in patients that were hospitalised and/or showed a more severe clinical disease course , or in patients presenting with new or progressive respiratory symptoms in the mid -long-term after acute COVID -19 syndrome. There are recommendations to r epeat CT scan at 12 weeks post -discharge in patient s with persistent symptoms, to complement clinic al assessment (18). CT is the most utili sed imaging technique to follow -up subjects who had COVID -19 pneumonia. In fact, it is undisputed that fine residual abnormalities such as GGO are best depicted with CT, rather than chest X -ray or lung ultrasound. As this disease involves a sizeable proportion of younger subjects who might need repeated follow -up, it is worth underscoring that low -dose thin -section CT protocol is used by the TF members. Clinical Question 5. Which follow -up strategies relate to infection control? Evidence overview: A large number of reports on COVID -19 ha ve been published within the past 17 months, yet evidence regarding the dynamics of SARS -CoV -2 shedding in patients with COVID -19 in general and in specific patient subgroups in particular , is scarce. Five eligible studies were included (2 retrospective studies, 2 case studies, 1 guideline) (85-89) following a search of 815 initial studies (Appendix C) . A further systematic review and meta -analysis identified by the authors after completion of the literature searches is also included in this review (90). In susceptible individuals, viral replication starts to increase rapidly only a few days after SARS -CoV -2 exposure. Viral load usually peaks about a week after infection, in most patients approximately 24-hours before COVID -19 symptoms commence. In immune - competent patients, replication -competent SARS -CoV -2 can be isolated from the respiratory tract for one to several weeks after the onset of symptom s. More specifically, a recent meta - analysis of 79 reports on SARS -CoV -2 found that mean duration of SARS -CoV -2 RNA shedding was 17.0 days (95% CI 15.5 -18.6) in upper respiratory tract, 14.6 days (9.3 -20.0) in lower respiratory tract, 17.2 days (14.4 -20.1) in stool, and 16.6 days (3.6 -29.7) in serum sample s (90). SARS -CoV -2 shedding duration was positively associated with age and COVID -19 severity. While these numbers suggest that after three weeks viral shedding usually concludes, it is noteworthy that the same meta -analysis report s maximum shedding duration of 83 day s in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum (90). Importantly, viral shedding does not necessarily provide active infectious virus. Many studies did not detect live virus beyond day nine of illness despite persistently high viral mRNA loads . One study observed shedding of infectious SARS -CoV -2 up to 70 days after initial diagnosis from an asymptomatic immunocompromised patient with cancer (85). Other conditions of constitutive or acquired immunosuppression may predispose to prolonged shedding of live SARS -CoV -2 or reactivation of infection, such as cancer -directed t herapies (86). Further, time to SARS -CoV - 2 clearance among cancer patients varies substantially d epending on the criteria used (87). Most evidence has been derived from other virus variants than the currently wide -spread delta -variant, however, there is no evidence available for significant differences in the time course of viral load between SARS -CoV -2 variants. Of note, positive SARS -CoV -2 PCR tests following temporary PCR negativity have been described in recovered patients with COVID -19. Several causes of recurrent positive tests for SARS -CoV -2 are suggested, including false -negative, and false -positive PCR tests, detection of viral particles rather than replication -competent virus, reactivation, and re -infection with SARS -CoV -2, the latter two being more likely in immunocompromised patients than in healthy individuals. Depending on the specific healthcare setting, recurrent SARS -CoV -2 test positivity may preclude patie nts from treatment of underlying diseases over a longer time period. Considering the risk of increased morbidity and mortality of the underlying disease resulting from treatment delay, the TF members advocate for interpret ation of the Cycle Threshold ( Ct) value of R eal Time -PCR in the clinical context . This will enable treatment of high risk underlying disease , despite ongoing positive SARS -CoV -2 testing (88,89) . Concluding remarks: The majority of TF members perform recurrent PCR testing after acute COVID -19 in specific subgroups of patients , on a case -by-case decision , given the lack of scientific evidence and universally agreed follow -up strategies for infection control in COVID -19. Particularly immunodeficient patients including, but not restricted to, hematologic, oncologic, T - or B - cell incompetent patients is useful to undergo repetitive testing with indivi dual frequency (e.g., once weekly) due to protracted high risk status or recurrent viral shedding. Clinical Question 6. Which follow -up strategies relate to cognitive, psychological and quality -of-life consequences? Evidence overview: Published studies attempt to measure a range of symptoms occurring as a consequence of COVID -19, the impact of long COVID and evaluate outcome measures used . One thousand, four hundred and two studies were screened (Appendix C) and 19 studies were included (8,34,49,61,74,91 -104) (2 reviews; 1 systematic, 9 prospective cohort studies, 3 survey design , 3 retrospective studies, 1 ambi -directional cohort study / 1 cross -sectional ) report ing on symptom burden and QOL . All studies included hospitalised patients. The survey conducted by Machado et al (98) exten ded to non -hospitalised patients and a small RCT (n=72) investigating the impact of rehabilitation on the elderly post -COVID did not differentiation hospitalisation status (74). The spectrum of symptoms reported include fatigue -94); dyspnoea; cough (93); (93); sleep disorders (8,93,98) ; anxiety, and/or depression (8,34,74,92,99,100) ; pandemic -related stress factors (PRSF) (92,95,99) ; with several studies reporting on HRQOL (34,49,74,94,95,100 - 102) , specifically functional status (98,103) or level of independence with activities of daily living (ADLs) (96). A prospective cohort study of 183 patients (median age 57 years; 61.5% male, 54.1% white) reported older participants (65 8.666 [95% CI: 2.216, {0.225, 0.949 }, p=0.0356] ), had statistically significant higher odds of experiencing persistent symptoms at 5 weeks post discharge (94). At six months post -acute COVID -19 survivors continued to experience fatigu e, muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. A cross-sectional study of 1,696 consecutive patients, age 71.8 \u00b113.0 years -old; 56.1% of females ; 82.3% with c omorbidities reported that independence for ADLs was lower in those admitted to the ICU than the ward group (61.1% [95%CI Conversely dependence for ADLs was also more frequent in the ICU group (96). Patients wh o were more severely ill during hospital stay had more impaired DL CO and were the main target population for intervention s of long -term recovery (8). Those admitted to ICU required more oxygen therapy (25.5% vs 12.6%, p<0.001), and non-routine activities (66.3% vs 48.2%, p<0.001) (96). Persistent symptoms of fatigue and sleep disturbance following severe COVID -19 pneumonia impact ed HRQOL, productivity, physical activity and mental ill-health, associated with high rates of positive screening tests for anxiety, depression and Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD ) (92,95,99) . A systematic review and narrative synthesis recommen ded a prompt general clinical' evaluation and risk assessment of patients presenting with neurological symptoms to minimise cognitive impairment and mental health thereby improving prognosis and outcomes (104) . Causative mechanisms for adverse mental health outcomes following COVID -19 infection have not yet been established. Biological pathophysiological mechanisms, relating to cerebral vascular inflammation and thrombosis , survivor guilt and isolation in COVID -19 survivors are cited as contributory factors of adverse mental health outcome s (92). There is a lack of consistency in the selection of instruments to me asure symptom burden, cognitive impairment, psychological well -being and QOL . A systematic review identified 33 outcome measures from 36 studies (70). Most commonly used were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Short Form -36 (SF -36) and St George 's Resp iratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) . A summary of broad range of instrumen ts reported on in this review is su mmarised in supplementary Table 2. According to standardi sed questionnaires, patients experienced reduced Q OL mainly due to decreased mobility (SGRQ activity score: 54 [19- 78]) (34). The battery of outcome measures implemented in some studies is recognised as being impractical for routine clinical use. Focussed patient interview s were suggested as an altern ative substitute for questio nnaires (92). Further, recommendations included a call to rationalise the approach to the selection of / combination of outcome measures to capture all elements of COVID -19 to better understand the impact on surv ivors and to plan timely and appropriate interventions to maximize functional return (70). Few differences were observed between HRQ OL for patients cared for on the ward and ICU (93). Hospitalised individuals present ed high levels of disability, dyspnoea , dysphag ia, and dependence (96). Social disconnect appeared to predict the presence of Post Trau ma Stress Syndrome ( PTSS ) (beta 0.59, 0.37 -0.81, p< 0.001) a month after hospitalisation but the severity of COVID symptoms was not predicative for PTSS (99). Depressive a nd anxiety symptoms decreased one -month following hospitalisation . However , higher levels of anxiety (standardi sed beta 1.15, 95% CI 0.81-1.49, p< (beta 0.97, 95% the first week of , feelin gs of social disconnected 0.25, 95% CI0.03 -0.47 p=0.026) predicted higher PTSS scores one month post -hospitalisation (106) . The need for social support during hospitalisation with a more robust approach to managing uncertainty regarding health status and family concerns is identified . Few s tudies explor ed the cognitive, psychological and QOL consequences of long COVID in non -hospitalised patients . Concluding remarks: Few differences were observed between HRQ OL for patients cared for on the ward and ICU, more in depth exploration in larger cohorts of patients including more severe ICU patients is needed . A need was identified to target the reduction and avoidance of PTSD . The long -term psychosocial effects ( e.g. depression, anxiety, psychosomatic preoccupations, insomnia) and an awareness of symptoms indicative of PTSD, require prompt clinical follow up as suggested by earlier guidelines (95). Early rehabilitation helps to reduce PTSD and mitigates the long-term sequ elae (103) . To date P ulmonary Rehabilitation has been informed by experiences in other chronic respiratory conditions. Further studies and consensus on the approach are needed. Consensus is also needed on the selection of outcome measures to minimise clinical burden and standardise research. Psychosocial implications should not be ignored and particular attention paid to the caregiver burden, famil y support and impact of recurrent and cross infection . HRQOL captures symptom experience and disease impacts that may result in disability. Further discussions on symptoms associated with disability are reviewed in Q8. Clinical Question 7. Which follow -up strategies relate to disability? Evidence overview: One thousand one hundred and twenty -one studies were screened (Appendix C) and 15 eligible studies (23,28,43,45,47,56,74,92,105 -111) were included (1 RC T, 1 systematic review, 12 prospective studies, and 1 retrospective ). Nine studies included hospitalised patients, two included non-hospitalised patients , and four both hospitalised and non - hospitalised. All studies report on disability ( a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities) due to persistent symptoms after recovering from acute COVID -19 infection, including fatigue and dyspnoea . Evidence is emerging of patients experiencing more than one symptom resulting in disability with psychological and cognitive symptoms reported to affect functional abilities in the long -term (23,28,43,45,47,56,74,92,105 -111). In COVID -19 survivors, dyspnoea and associated disability is the most frequent persistent respiratory symptom regardless of the need for hospitalisation ranging from 5 .5% to 54% at one to four months (28,45,47,56,92,106 -108). Tenforde (109) reported shortness of breath at three weeks in 29% of patients never hospit alised. The most used measure to assess dyspnoea was the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale (19,23,43,45,47,56) followed by the modified Borg dyspnoea scale (MBS) (19) and the Borg category dyspnoea scale (92,107) . Follow -up and management of COVID -19 survivors presenting symptoms and subsequent disability is an urgent priority . There is emerging evidence of debilitating disability months after COVID -19 infection. Disability with limited physical performance due to dyspnoea, fatigue or both was measured with at least one of the following tests: the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score, 2 -minute walking test or 1 -minute sit -to-stand test (1MSTST) was found in 35% of COVID -19 survivors at six weeks (92), in 14% at three months (106) , in 53,8% at four months (28), in 32% at six months (110) . Six-MWD was within normal values at 75 days with only 3% of patients experiencing documented oxygen saturati on below 90% (median [IQR] MBS 3 [2-5]) (105) . At three months follow -up, 6MWD was within normal values (45) and only one out of 62 patients had oxygen saturation below 90% (47). Six-MWT showed a significant reduction in distance walked and oxygen saturation levels in severely impaired COVID -19 patients compared to those with mild/moderate disease (23). In a pros pective observational study at three months after discharge (43) 22% of patients had 6MWD <80% of predicted and 16% de -saturated on exertion. Disability persisted after a multi disciplinary rehabilitation programme: 1MSTST below normal value in 33.3% and SPPB in 53.3%. Barthel Index showed poor performance in ADLs in 47.5% of COVID -19 survivors (111) . In a RCT (74) , exercise capacity (6MWD) and ADL s (assessed with Functional Independence Measure [FIM] scale ) were evaluated six months after the COVID -19 infection : patients undergoing a six-week rehabilitation programme (including respiratory muscle training, cough exercise, diaphragmatic training, stretching exercise and home exercise but without specific trai ning and whole body exercises) showed improvement in 6MWD when compared to the control group. Results on ADLs have been also reported in a prospective follow -up study (107) on 116 post -COVID ICU patients which documented no limitations after two months from infection. Concluding remarks: Evidence on follow -up of COVID -19 survivors suggests that patients recovering after the acute phase may present with prolonged symptoms for more than four weeks causing disability with reduced functional performance and ADLs . This impacts some if not all aspects of HRQOL . Most TF members evaluate and systematically follow -up COVID survivors with unresolved or new or progressive symptoms with related disability . Decline in exercise tolerance, weakness, or reduced mobility define the assistance needed for ADLs (e.g, feeding, dre ssing, bathing, toileting, driving, housekeeping, and grocery shopping) and help clinicians to develop appropriate disability management strategies of pulmonary sequelae . Rehabilitation programmes includ ing exercise training could mi tigate longer term disability. Long COVID clinics offer a one stop shop for assessment and monitoring disability. Longitudinal cohort studies are needed to determine the most effective interventions. Clinical Question 8. Which follow -up strategies relate to home care follow -up (tele- medicine/ tele -rehabilitation) ? Evidence overview: Patients with p ost-acute COVID -19 are at risk of long -term functional impairment, and the rehabilitation community is calling for action preparing for a large increase of rehabilitation needs in this patient population (95). We screened 2057 record s that were initially identified (Appendix C) . According to the 29 eligible studies included (4 systematic reviews, 15 prospective cohort studies , 8 retrospective, and 2 suggestion documents) (95,96,112 -138), tele-health , often used a broad term to include tele-visit, telemedicine, tele -coaching, te le- nursing and tele -rehab ilitation offers an opportunity to follow -up patients whilst reducing the burden of travel for those patient s affected by COVID -19, those with positive COVID tests and those with COVID sequelae. Virtual services may include: asynchronous clinical communications, real -time virtual care, messaging, telephony or video conferencing, virtual health assessments, and medication review. The COVID -19 pandemic forced a rapid adoption of tele/digital approaches over traditional in-person visits although uptake is reported to be lower in communities with higher rates of poverty (112) . Telemedicine and tele-rehabilitation have been proposed in COVID patients who suffer from exercise dyspnea, adequate stable condition, residual disability, displaced or isolated (113) provided they can ambulate independently, use technology, require minimal supplemental oxygen, and were cognitively intact (114) . Tele-health may improve access and reduce barriers to healthcare access, overcome financial costs, increase medical care and follow -ups, and, most importantly, reduces the risk of COVID -19 transmission (115) . Approaches can monitor vital parameters (SpO2, heart r ate, blood pressure, respiratory rate). Specifically pocket oximeters and smart phone -based systems need particular accuracy to avoid error in pulse oximetry (116) . In selected cases, breath sounds can be analy sed using advanced signal processing and analysis in tandem with new deep/machine learning (117) . Tele-health implemented in response to the COVID -19 pandemic in general resulted in high patient and provider satisfaction (115,118 -125). Telemedicine/tele -rehabilitation acceptance is related to increased accessibility, enhanced care, usefulness, ease of use, and privacy/discomfort, whereas anxiety about COVID -19 is not (126) . Being male, having a history of both depression and anxiety, lower patient activation (121) technical and administrative challenges (122) were significantl y associated with a poor telehealth experience. Mobile apps have been proposed for citizens, health professionals and decision -makers to reduc e the burden on hospitals, provid e access to credible information, track the symptoms and mental health of individuals (127 -129), help patients to improve their emotional resilience and subsequently their ability to cope with the trauma of their COVID -19 experience s (130) . During the pandemic the pe rcent age of visits via telemedicine increased twenty -three -fold compared with the pre -pandemic period (112,131) . As a ma jority of chronic respiratory patients are elderly and have multiple co -morbidities, they are notably susceptible to sev ere complications of COVID -19 and a s such, have been advised to minimi se social contact. This increased patients ' vulnerability to physi cal deconditioning, depression, and social isolation. To address this major gap in care, some clinic -centered Pulmonary Rehabilitation programs converted some or all of their education al package s to home -based tele -rehabilitation (132) . Tele -rehabilitation offers positive clinical results, even comparable to conventional face -to-face rehabilitation approaches (133) with g eneral guide s prepared in some countr ies (134) . In post ICU patients tele -rehabilitation consisted mostly of second opinions of psychologists (11.8%), physical therapists (8.0%), dietitians (6.8%), and speech-langu age pathologists (4.6%) (96). Tele-health has been used for patients experiencing depression and isolation to maintain sufficient relationships (135) . Barriers to medicine at distance have been described as: advanced age, poor confidence with technology, lack of communication, reduced confidence in doctors, additional burden for complex care, ethical issues, and skepticism (121) (115,136 -138). Several obstacles must be overcome for a wide use of tele -health : 1) the te chnology must be usable by the largest possible number of patients , 2) clarity on medico -legal liability and data privacy , 3) lack of the economic reimbursement , 4) proper training of health professionals involve d, 5) adequate caregiver support , 6) infrastructure, operational challenges, regulatory, communication and legislative barriers (113,119,132) . Concluding remarks: Telehealth appointment experiences were often comparable to traditional in -person medical appointment experiences . Although telemedicine/ tele-rehabilitation appear to be acceptable , the level of agreement on standardi sation remains unclear in particular the ratio of cost- effectiveness. Telehealth was effective as a mode of health care delivery during the pandemic and may be sustainable (113,121) . Careful attention will be needed to integrate these services into current health care delivery system s whilst preserving patient -centered and quality care (123) . Further high-quality studies to enable the successful implementation of these modalities are needed (132) . Discussion It is evident that long COVID is a substantial global public health problem with severe consequences for affected individuals. Emotional well -being and QOL are particularly impacted (104) . A standardised minimum set of outcomes for clinical care of patients with COVID -19 has recently been publish ed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) , and is categorised into five domains: (1) functional status and quality of life, (2) mental functioning, (3) social functioning, (4) clinical outcomes and (5) symptoms (139) . Whil st these outcomes may need some adjustment for specific co - morbidities, treatment approaches and demographics , consensus recommendations could help guide clinical services and enabling data comparison of patient -centric clinical outcomes . Active management and strategies for the prevention of persistent symptoms and potential long-term complications continue to be explored as a more comprehensive underst anding of COVID -19 sequelae , a multicentre, long -term follow -up study of adults discharged in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID -19 published in October 2021 (140) . PHOSP -COVID determined that severe mental and physical impairments are independent of the degree of acute lung injury and could be related to persisting systemic inflammation. The investigators suggest a proactive approach and holistic clinical care that is stratified and personalise d with access to interventions to improve mental, physical, and cognitive health. At six-month s post- discharge , morbidity was more prevalent in females, middle age, those with two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness . Given the multi -system ic nature of the post - COVID -19 condition, a multidisciplinary response is likely to be the optimal appro ach. Many post-COVID -19 multidisciplinary clinics are emerging globally (104) with post-COVID -19 clinical programs designed to meet the needs of individuals characterised according to previous hospitalisation with COVID -19, non -hospitalisation with persistent respiratory symptoms post -COVID -19, and pre-existing lung disease complicated by COVID -19 (141) . Long COVID -19 appears to overlap with complications of acute COVID -19 making it hard to define. Further evidence and research from multi -disciplinary teams is crucial to understanding the causes, mechanisms, risks and consequences of long COVID -19 (142) . The ultimate goal is to develop preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies. Indiv iduali sed interventions in long COVID clinics with multiple specialties, including graded exercise, physical therapy, conti nuous check -ups, and cognitive behavioural therapy should be designed to address long COVID -19 care (143) . Sensitivity to gender, age and screening all patients regardless of COVID -19 severity across a range of physical and mental -health symptoms particularly anxiety, and cognitive impairment will be required to target interventions at an individual level and to groups of patients with similar post-COVID profiles. Preliminary report s confirm the feasibility and sa fety of a dedicated tele-rehabilitation program for survivors of COVID -19 pneumonia with a clear improvement in exercise tolerance and dyspnoea (144) . Adapting tele -rehabilitation to the usual practice of physical therapy can be achieved through a change of paradigm to ensure an effective patient -based tele-rehabilitation (145) . From the clinical perspective, physicians should be aware of the symptoms, signs, and biomarkers present in patients previously affected by COVID -19 to promptly assess, identify and halt long COVID -19 progression, and minimi se the risk of chronic effects . Identification of possible biomarkers or laboratory tests would be useful , similar to those we have for acute infection or post -acute hyper -inflammatory illness (146) . Data showing that almost one third of COVID survivors will present with lung abnormalities six-months after initial infection (22) raises questions. Does this high proportion of patients have clinically significant interstitial lung disease, or we should interpret these findings with more scepticism (147) ? Ongoing monitoring and regular follow -up will enable physicians to assess clinically significant pulmonary sequelae identifying long COVID manifestations early and improving management. This Statement intended to describe the evidence regarding eight clinical questions about long COVID -19 consequences . The systematic search was completed in March 2021. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria but published after the cutoff date are not inclu ded. The aim of this document was to provide a rapid first overview of the clinical questions identified to help clinicians consider important aspects of follow -up care for patient with COVID -19. This Statement is primarily fo cused on the respiratory syste m. Given the volume of publications related to C OVID -19, we plan to update this s tatement and to further inform a clinical practice guideline with recommendations. Recommendations for Research Post-acute sequelae COVID -19 research is a global priority with the US National Institute of Healt h (NIH) investing US $1.15 billion over four years and the NIHR in the UK investing \u00a338.5 m illion . Predisposing factors and symptom patterns associated with long -term sequelae remain difficult to determine. Important ly, the COVID -19 ERS Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) , END -COVID , aims to merge national long COVID initiatives in Europ e. END -COVID intends to study the long -term effects of COVID -19 in post - hospitalisation survivors , both in those with premorbid lung conditions , and in those with no previous lung disease and co -morbidities. It is a priority to identif y determinants of those more likely to experience prolonged sequelae following SARS -CoV -2 infection. Some s tudies are under way to identify those at greatest risk (148) but the existence of intrinsic, extrinsic (biological, psychological, and social), an d factors associated with hospitalisation and interventions, require deeper investigat ion. Research on the respective contributions of physical/biological and functional somatic mechanisms to the expression of long COVID -19 depending on the characteristics of this expression and of the acute disease is urgently needed . Histopathological phenotyp ing and genotyping are crucial, enabling deeper insights into the differences in pathogenesis and underlying immunological and tissue regenerative response patterns. The design of ge netic association studies may unravel potent genetic correlations (149) . Large, multicenter studies will evaluate the long-term consequences of pulmonary physiology, imaging, alongside patient factors particularly disability and QOL . Further data is needed to determine the impact of COVID vaccines for those diagnosed with long COVID. Summary Statements Age and initial disease severity appear to correlate with long -term consequences, but not necessarily with the persistence of symptom s (larger studies required). In patients with persistent exertional dyspnoea not explained by CT or PFTs abnormalities 3-6 months after discharge, most TF members include echocardiogram and contrast enhanced CT in the follow -up evaluation to identify pulmonary vascular involvement. PFTs measurement including static lung volumes, expiratory flow rates and DL CO assessment are regarded as useful tools to assess long -term lung function sequelae in patients with COVID -19. TF members agree with the propose d recommendations to repeat CT scan at 12 weeks after discharge in patients with persistent symptoms, as a complement to clinical -functional assessment. However, TF members are cautious when interpreting CT abnormalities taking into consideration the risk of over -calling lung fibrosis. The majority of TF members perform recurrent PCR testing after acute COVID -19 in specific subgroups of patients, on a case -by-case decision, given the lack of scientific evidence. Based on current e vidence , patients recover ing after the acute phase may present prolonged symptoms affecting functional performance and daily life activities. Most TF members evaluate and systematically follow -up COVID survivors with unresolved or new or progressive symptoms . Telemedicine/tele -rehabilitation appear to be acceptable and telehealth was effective during the pandemic . Integration of these services into current health care delivery systems must preserve patient -centered and quality care.
