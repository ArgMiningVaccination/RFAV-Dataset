Just as tinctures and teas can promote healthy digestion and relaxation, herbal self-care rituals encourage whole body wellness and nourish the spirit.* For example, golden calendula flowers infused in oils can promote a radiant complexion and the simple addition of lavender essential oil to baths can relax the spirit. While these spa-like practices and products may seem more indulgent than necessary on the surface, we believe in the wisdom of age-old rituals when it comes to wellness. Bathing is actually an ancient therapeutic practice called balneotherapy. Romans recognized the importance of water therapy and even provided public bath houses for citizens. Steams, baths, and cold water plunges are used by Ayurvedic healers depending on your particular dosha, or your particular constitution, to maintain health and promote circulation. Almost all ancient cultures prescribe therapeutic bathing rituals to promote overall wellness and calm the skin, our body's largest organ. Herbs and oils have long been combined with bath therapy to relax the mind, soothe sore muscles, and promote supple skin.* These days, many bath products and cosmetics include ingredients you may not want or are even tested on animals. Verifying with The Environmental Working Group's [Skin Deep Guide to Cosmetics](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) is a great way to ensure the quality of your favorite products, and we highly recommend checking labels to make sure they are made cruelty-free. While more and more companies are selling ethically made or sourced natural products, it's often more satisfying to make products yourself. We've crafted two herbal bath recipes that are simple and soothing: our Spring Tea Bath Blend and our Flower-Powered Sea Salts. For our herbal DIY ingredients, we trust our friends at [Mountain Rose Herbs](https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/ingredients). Whether you are drawing a bath infused with medicinal herbs or lathering on a natural and nourishing lotion, these healthy habits are fundamental to whole body wellness. In this busy era, it can often be hard to fully show up for ourselves and commit to these simple acts of self-love. When we weave herbs into wellness, these practices become even more enticing, like a sweet treat we want to indulge in again and again. Keep in mind that healthy skin and healthy bodies are also fueled by whole foods, proper hydration, and regular sleep.
