Let's face it: when your [Bali yoga](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/yoga-in-bali/) guru gently entices you back from your [relaxation](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/peppers-sentosa-wellness-retreats/) into the real world, serenity lingers longer when your senses are awakened to [beautiful surroundings](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/affordable-spas-in-bali/). Bali is the perfect place for [practicing yoga](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/5-best-yoga-retreats-bali/) with a view or three: even an average [yoga pavilion](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/yoga-studios-in-bali/) can be draped in lush green jungle or have the Indian Ocean sparkling beneath you. We've picked the studios that make us sing \"Om!\" with even more appreciation for Bali's beautiful surroundings. Uluwatu Surf Villas, Uluwatu Perched overlooking the Indian Ocean in the middle of Bali's [surfing](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/fit-goddess/) and cliff-top sunset mecca, is our favourite yoga location in Bali and it's down on the [Bukit](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/jimbaran-bali-travel-guide/). Set back from the cliff front, the Morning Light yoga studio at Uluwatu Surf Villas is tucked away amongst lush gardens and private villas, with the Indian Ocean rumbling beneath you. It features antique ironwood beams and polished reclaimed teak floors shaded by a traditional thatched grass roof, creating an open-air studio at one with the ocean breeze and sounds of the surf. The estate's location on the [South peninsula](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/semara-resort-finns-beach-club/) usually guarantees sunny days, tropical breezes, and ultra consistent surf so you can stretch and surf until your heart's content. With three classes daily all open to the public, it's too easy to fit in a surf, swim and sleep around your morning or sunset yoga sessions - if you're not fortunate enough to be staying in their stunning three or four bedroom villas. [Uluwatu Surf Barn, Ubud This is where Ubud's yoga pulse beats: a [number one](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/the-best-of-ubud/) stop for anyone travelling to Bali with a yoga mat within arms reach. [Yoga Barn](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/directory/the-yoga-barn-bali/) is spectacular two storey construction made of wood and bamboo overlooks the iconic Balinese surrounds - swaying palm trees and emerald green, luscious rice fields. Classes here vary from classic Hatha to more exotic Embodied Flow, Yoga Nidra, Laya Yoga and other activities like Tibetan Bowl Meditation, Sound Medicine and a community favourite - Ecstatic Dance, where everyone is welcome. Rub shoulders with the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Ubud's yoga community and dance like there is no tomorrow. Practicing the art of 'enjoying the moment', has never eco-friendly hotel that's more of a community playground than just a pretty tourist accommodation. The beautiful and amazingly well-groomed [estate](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/top-5-spas-in-canggu/) houses bountiful vegetable gardens, a salt water pool that's open to the public any day but weekends and two spacious yoga pavilions set in antique joglos. No walls, no troubles - let the frangipani-scented breeze cool you down while the best [yoga teachers in Bali](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/yoga-studios-in-bali/) guide you through the practice. Don't be surprised if one of the local dogs happily walks in during shavasana time, and curls right next to you. [Desa Power Now, Sanur At the quiet wave-free beach of [Sanur](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/sanur-bali/), with palms nodding and the gentle breezes - what else can a yogi centre by the sea dream of offering yoga lovers? This spacious two-story, open-plan shala is made entirely of bamboo and hosts a studio, teahouse, organic juice bar, library, chill-out area and plenty of space to chat about your doshas and chakras with like-minded folks. Though this centre is bliss and relaxation personified, it is a yoga powerhouse of all you would love to experience, and more. [The Power Of Now](http://www.powerofnowoasis.com), Four Seasons Sayan, Ubud A wooden terrace in the middle of blooming lotus pond, floating high above the misty jungle valley - that's what one of world's [most beautiful yoga](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/5-best-yoga-retreats-bali/) spot looks like and this one is nestled in the [Four Seasons](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/jimbaran-bali/) Sayan resort in [Ubud](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/batu-belig-seminyak-best-dining/). These sunrise classes are worth skipping the wine testing the night before and waking up at dawn. It's too bad this privilege is available for hotel residents only, though it's definitely worth the splurge to treat yourself. [Four Canggu A community-oriented space that has everything to please a New Age warrior: [Samadi](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/new-places-in-bali-canggu/) is a weekly farmers market, vegetarian caf\u00e9 and elegant yoga space in [Canggu](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/top-5-spas-in-canggu/), even a terrace that's equipped with a cocoon swing! Designed by a Dutch architect, this sleek studio is an oasis of contemporary cool surrounded by tropical greens and koi carp pools. For those looking for a deeper experience, there is a senses deprivation camera attached to the studio - give your mind a good shake by trying to relax in a shallow pool in a complete darkness. [Samadi](http://www.samadibali.com), Jalan real hideaway? You've just arrived. Sidemen, located on the east coast, half way to [Candidasa](https://thehoneycombers.com/bali/bedugul-lovina-candidas/), is worth running away to - it's a magical land of untouched greenery, where farming is the only social activity. No shops, no street vendors, no surfers around - pretty much nothing at all, just an absolute serenity. The yoga pavilion at Samanvaya boutique retreat is a massive bamboo construction standing tall above endless rice paddies and inviting for the deep, undistracted practice. Try your best not to nap when in meditation! [Samanvaya](http://www.samanvaya-bali.com), Br. Tabola, Sidemen, 80846, Karangasem, Bali, 82 147 103 884. Top image: Uluwatu Surf Villas.
