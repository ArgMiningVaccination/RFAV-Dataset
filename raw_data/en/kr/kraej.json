I think we all (maybe unconsciously) understand that when the body is in a relaxed state, it is able to heal itself more effectively. Meditation can also help to clear away negative energy and replace it with positive energy. But is meditation actually considered a form of energy healing? Well.. let's find out! Table of Contents What Is Energy Healing? According to the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/energy-healing), energy healing is: \"A form of complementary and alternative medicine based on the belief that a vital energy flows through the human body. The goal of energy healing is to balance the energy flow in the patient. It is used to reduce stress and anxiety and promote well-being. Energy healing is being studied in patients receiving cancer therapy, to find out if it can improve quality of life, boost the immune system, or reduce side effects. Also called energy therapy.\" In other words, it is a holistic practice that activates the body's subtle energy systems to remove blocks. By removing these energetic barriers, the body's innate capacity for self-healing is boosted. Emotional and spiritual healing It is a fact that our minds shape our reality in a much more profound way than we realize. We are aware that a good mood makes our day seem perfect, and a bad mood makes it appear the opposite. Most of the time, we are unaware of how intricately connected our reality and mind are. The majority of spiritual traditions have always acknowledged this, and it is now also being recognized by science. Our minds or consciousness are figuratively the creators of our reality, according to spirituality and current research in quantum theory. It's important for us to understand from a physiological perspective how negative emotions like fear, stress, and anxiety trigger the area of the brain that controls our body's 'fight-or-flight' response. The body responds by producing an instant trigger factor at the expense of turning off non-essential systems. The immune system, which naturally permits the disease to start and prevents its healing, is the most important system that is shut down in this situation. Relaxing and reducing these effects are possible with mind-body medicine. In other words, mind-body medicine is key for emotional and spiritual healing. Facts About Energy Healing Your journey to wellbeing depends critically on your energy body. Here are [5 facts about energy healing](https://www.growthwellnesstherapy.com/our-blog/5-things-everyone-needs-to-know-about-energy-healing) that you should know: Energy Healing is Based on Scientific Fact Energy Medicine Can Help Heal Physical and Emotional Traumas Energy Healing is Available to Everyone Energy Medicine is Painless and has no Negative Side Effects Energy Medicine Works with Almost Every Other Type of Healing Is Meditation Energy Healing? Yes, meditation is energy healing. Let me explain... The foundation of good health and wellbeing, for both body and mind, is prana (the vital life energy). Through meditation, prana can be gained. You feel alert, energized, and full of humor once your body is filled with more prana. On the other hand, lethargy, dullness, and lack of excitement are symptoms of a prana deficiency. As we discussed in the first chapter, the immune system and neurological system interact closely. So stress in the neurological system is well known for blocking our body's natural ability to recover itself. By meditating, one can let go of their pressures, fears, and anxieties and increase their level of prana, which benefits their body, brain, and nervous system. What Exactly Is Prana? Despite having a connection to the breath, prana is not the breath. Prana is an energy that flows through an intricate system of subtle bodily passageways. The Nadis, or channels, of the subtle body connect form and mind and serve as a pathway for energy, or prana, much like the central nervous system does. Can You Get Energy From Meditation? Yes, you can gain energy from meditation. This is because when you meditate, all of the energy that is ordinarily used (or most of the time squandered) on thinking, processing emotions, or acting is withheld. Therefore, as you meditate, this energy is not lost but rather is gathered. In addition, as we discussed in the previous chapter, prana (vital life energy) can be gained during meditation as we withdraw our attention from stress factors collected through our senses. What Is The Real Power Of Meditation? I think the real power of meditation lies in the fact that you can improve your awareness and purposefulness in life by practicing meditation. It teaches you how to respond to situations in life rather than simply reacting to them.

Yes, meditation can speed up the healing process. This is because, as we discussed in chapter 3, the energy that is ordinarily squandered on things like stressful thought processes, is withheld when we're meditating. This energy, along with the prana that is gained through meditation and the absence of energetic blocks (caused by things such as stress) enables the body to heal much faster than it would ordinarily do.
