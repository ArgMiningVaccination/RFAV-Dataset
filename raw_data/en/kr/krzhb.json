The first supply of the COVID -19 vaccine was made available in Hawaii starting in mid -December 2020. The number of doses has increased significantly , and most people can be vaccinated in sites across Hawaii , often without an appointment (i.e., \"walk -in\"). You can find out where vaccine sites are located at hawaiicovid19.com/vaccine and www.vaccines.gov/search . How much does the COVID -19 vaccine cost? The COVID -19 vaccine is free for everyone , including people without health insurance coverage . Ending the COVID -19 pandemic is a national public health priority so the vaccine is offered at no cost, regardless of health insurance coverage o r immigration status . It is being purchased by the federal government with taxpayer dollars. How many doses of the vaccine are needed and why? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both require two shots for the primary series, while the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires one shot. Pfizer's and Moderna's two shots are spaced out by a number of weeks and you will be alerted when to get your second shot. If you have had your first shot, you will automatically be eligible to schedule the second shot when it is due. Page 4 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 Who is eligible to receive the COVID -19 vaccine? As of November 2021, everyone aged 5 and over is now eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccination at this time . You can read about CDC vaccine recommendations at the following site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/recommendations -process.html . Are children ab le to be vaccinated against COVID -19? Yes. In May 2021, CDC and FDA approved emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15 , and then in November 2021, they approved emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for children aged 5 to 11. In August 2021, FDA granted full approval for the Pfizer vaccine for persons aged 16 and older (see What does it mean if a vaccine has Emergency Use Authorization or is fully approved by FDA? below for more information). CDC and FDA based their decision to authorize the vaccine for young children and adolescents on the following information: Vaccination is the best way to protect children aged 5 and older from COVID -19, which has cau sed tens of thousands of children to be hospitalized and led COVID -19 to becom ing one of the top ten causes of pediatric death, despite children's lower risk of becoming severely ill or hospitalized from COVID -19 compared to adults. The vaccine has been r igorously reviewed and is safe and effective in children . Its authorization by FDA and CDC was based on extensive data from clinic trials of thousands of younger children that showed high levels of safety and effectiveness, especially when compared to the risks associated with getting COVID -19. Children getting vaccinated against COVID -19 not only reduces their risk of getting COVID -19, but also helps them \"return to normal,\" such as in -person school and sports activities, while protecting their vulnera ble family members and the community. The State of Hawaii is following FDA and CDC's recommendation s for childhood COVID -19 vaccines , making the Pfizer vaccine available to everyone aged 5 and older through certified vaccination providers. As with adolesc ents aged 12 to 17, parents or legal guardians must submit signed consent forms before a minor child can be vaccinated You can read about CDC vaccine recommendations at the following site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/recommendations/adolescents.html . You can read about the CDC's authorization of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 at the following site: www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1102 -PediatricCOV ID-19Vaccine.html . When and where will the vaccine be available for younger children? COVID -19 vaccines for children under 12 have been available since November 8, 2021 from over 200 locations statewide that include medical facilities, community health centers, mobile Page 5 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 clinics, pharmacies, pediatrician's offices, and more than 130 public, private, and charter schools. Parents should contact their child's school directly to see if and when the school will be offering vaccinations to students. Information on where vaccines are available can be found at hawaiicovid19.com/vaccine . Is the Pfizer vaccine dose f or children aged 5 to 11 different from the adult vaccine? Yes, the Pfizer vaccine dose for children aged 5 to 11 is 10 micrograms, which is one -third the dose used for adults. How can I protect my child who is too young to get vaccinated? CDC has recommendations for children aged 4 and under who are not yet able to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. These include the following: All adults and all children age d 5 and older in the household should get vaccinated to protect younger children who canno t yet be vaccinated. Everyone, including both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people, should wear a mask indoors in public to prevent spread of the COVID -19 variants. Choose safer activities for your family, such as outdoor activities or indoor activiti es in areas that are well ventilated (open windows when possible) . Avoid large crowds and gatherings. You can read more about CDC's recommendations for protecting unvaccinated children I go to get myself or a family member scheduled to get vaccinated for COVID -19? HDOH maintains a website with registration links for multiple healthcare systems across the state. You can find it at this URL: hawaiicovid19.com/vaccination -registration . There are county -specific sites at the following links: Kauai County General information site information: www.mauinuistrong.in fo/vaccination -locations -county -of-hawaii - hawaiicount ygis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/vaccine 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 City & County of Honolulu General information and vaccine site locations: www.oneoahu.org/vaccine and hawaiicovid19.com/vaccination -registration/#honolulu -county A nationwide also available at this site: vaccinefinder.org/search . How will I know when it's my turn to receive the COVID -19 vaccine? As of May 12 , 2021, all persons in the state who are aged 12 or over are eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. HDOH maintains the latest information on the vaccine's status in Hawaii at www.hawaiicovid19.com/vaccine . Will there be enough vaccine for everyone in Hawaii? Yes. Although the initial supply was limited, millions more doses are being made and everyone in Hawaii will eventually be able to be vaccinated , most likely in the first half of 2021. Can the COVID -19 vaccine give someone COVID -19? No, you can not get COVID -19 from the COVID -19 vaccine. The mRNA vaccines - Pfizer and Moderna - do not use the live virus that causes COVID -19. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine also cannot give you a viral infection. Both kinds are safe and can help protect you and th ose around you from COVID -19. Is the COVID -19 vaccine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women? Yes. CDC recommends that women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant receive the COVID -19 vaccine, based on extensive data and evidence gathered since last year showing that the vaccines are safe and effective for these groups and far outweigh risks. More recent evidence also shows that the vaccines help lower risk of serious illness , death , and other adverse health outcomes for both the pregnant person and their newborn . Key information: COVID -19 vaccination is strongly recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future because of the dangers of getting infected with COVID -19, and its variants. Compared to fully vaccinated pregnant women, unvaccinated pregnant women and their newborn children had greater risk of health problems, including: o Severe illness requiring hospi talization or intensive care unit admission of the pregnant person o Death of the pregnant person o Preterm birth o Admission of newborn child to neonatal intensive care unit o Possible risk of outcomes such as preeclampsia or stillbirth New evidence shows no inc reased risk of miscarriage after receiving an mRNA vaccine (e.g., Pfizer or Moderna) before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Evidence shows the benefits of receiving a COVID -19 vaccine outweigh any known or Page 7 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy. There is c urrently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID -19 vaccines, cause fertility problems in women or men. Pregnant and recently pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19 compared to non -pregnant people. All approved vaccin es are safe for these groups: o Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID -19, so they cannot give you or your unborn child COVID - 19, nor will they interact with your DNA or your unborn child's DNA. o The Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains a modified version of a different virus (i.e., not the coronavirus that causes COVID -19), which has been safely given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy without any adverse pregnancy - related outcomes to t he pregnant person or their child. You should talk to your healthcare provider you are seeing for your pregnancy care to discuss whether to get a COVID -19 vaccine. If you would like to speak to someone about COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy, please contact MotherToBaby by calling 1-866-626-6847 or going to mothertobaby.org/ask -an-expert . You can learn more about the risks of COVID -19 for pregnant people at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/need -extra -precautions/pregnant -people.html You can learn more about protecting yourself during pregnancy at this CDC sit e: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/prevent -getting -sick/prevention.html You can learn more about COVID -19 vaccines for pregnant women at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html You can learn more about vaccines in general for pregnant women at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/index.html Why was the Johnson & Johnson vaccine temporary halted ? Even after approval, all vaccine use is continuously monitored for safety and effectiveness. Use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused across the United States in mid -April 2021 , including in Hawaii , due to concerns of extremely rare but serious blood clo ts called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of blood platelets that required further investigation . On April 23, CDC recommended resuming its use but to inform people receiving it of its risks, which are very uncommon . Hawaii resumed use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on April 29, 2021. You can read more about the temporary halting of Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the CDC decision to resume its use at the following site: www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda -cdc-lift-vaccine -use.html Page 8 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 More i nformation will be made public as it becomes available in the coming months . More information the safety of FDA -authorized vaccines is available at the following sites. Pfizer: www.fda.gov/media/144414/download Moderna: www.fda.gov/media/144638/download Johnson & Johnson: www.fda.gov/media/146305/download If I have already had COVID -19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID - 19 vaccine when it's available? Yes, you should get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID -19 and may have \"natural immunity.\" This is what you should know: It is possible to be infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 even after recovering from COVID -19. Experts do not yet know ho w long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. This continues to be studied by experts and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID -19. If you were treated for COVID -19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID -19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments yo u received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID -19 vaccine. If you or your child has a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS - A) or children (MIS -C), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered f orm being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS -A or MIS -C. No one should be vaccinated while they are currently sick with a COVID -19 infection. Vaccinating should be postponed until the person has no more symptoms and criteria have been met for them to discontinue isolation. Can I take the COVID -19 vaccine with other vaccines, like the flu vaccine? Yes, you can. CDC now recommends that you can get your influenza vaccine (flu shot) at the same time that you get your COVID -19 vaccination or booster . For more information, go to the following: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/expect.html ). You can read more about the benefits of getting vaccinated for the flu at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine -benefits.htm . (During the previous flu season, 2020 -21, CDC had recommended against getting the flu vaccine at the same time as the COVID -19 vaccine, because of a need for more data on s afety and effectiveness. At that time, they recommended that no other vaccine should be received between 14 days before you receive your COVID -19 vaccine and 14 days afterward , but Page 9 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 research data since that time shows that it is safe and effective to get ot her vaccines at the same time as the COVID -19 vaccine.) Do I need to wear a mask when I am r eceiv ing the COVID -19 vaccine? Yes, you should wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth whenever you are in public and close contact with people outside your ho usehold cannot be avoided, such as when you are getting a vaccine shot. (Anyone who has trouble breathing or who is unable to remove a mask without assistance should not wear a mask.) Will I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people after I am \"fully vaccinated\" for COVID -19? When can I stop wearing a mask? Yes, because of risk of COVID -19 variants , even after you are \"fully vaccinated\" (which means two weeks have pa ssed since you received your final shot), you will need to wear a mask in indoor public settings and practice other preventive measures, like avoiding close contact with other people. Mask wearing is also recommended in crowded outdoor settings, even for f ully vaccinated people. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID -19 vaccines provide under real -life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering yo ur mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Are there other vaccines that can help prevent me from getting COVID -19? Does getting the annual flu shot help? No. A flu vaccine will not protect you from getting COVID -19, but it can help keep your immune system health ier by prevent ing you from getting influenza (the flu) at the same time as COVID - 19, which can keep you from getting more severe illness. Experts believe both will be spreading at the same tim e this coming winter. Right now, there are three COVID -19 vaccines that have been approved for use in the United States : COVID -19 Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine , COVID -19 Moderna Vaccine , and Johnson & Johnson Janssen COVID -19 vaccine . These are the only available vaccines that will protect against COVID -19 at this time . On April 13, 2021, use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was halted across the United States, including Hawaii , pending a careful review of its safety . On April 23, C DC recommended lifting the pause. Hawaii resumed use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on April 29, 2021. You can read more about the temporary halting of Johnson & Johnson vaccine at the following site: www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda -cdc-lift-vaccine -use.html Does immunity after getting COVID -19 last longer than the protection you would get from a COVID -19 vaccine? How long will the vaccine protect people? Page 10 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 The protection someone gains from having an infection (called \"natural immunity\") varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. We know that people who have recovered from a COVID -19 infecti on have shown waning immunity over time, but don't know exactly how long natural immunity for COVID -19 can last. Experts are working to learn more about COVID -19, including natural immunity and immunity from vaccines, and CDC and HDOH will let the public know as new evidence becomes available and recommendations change. Does the COVID -19 vaccine have any side effect s? Can it cause you to get sick? Clinical trials for the COVID -19 vaccines and later vaccinations of millions of people have found that in general, most people do not have serious problems after being vaccinated. Adults and children may have mild side effe cts from the vaccine, which are normal si gns that the body is building protection. These side effects may affect their ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects and allergic reactions are rare. At this time, the worst reported side effect that some people have had is a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. If you know you are allergic to any ingredient in one of the vaccines, you should not get that vaccine. If you know you have allergies, but do n't know if you are allergic to an ingredient in the vaccines talk to your provider or the provider offering you the vaccine before getting vaccinated. Some common but temporary side effects may be soreness, redness, or warmth in the arm where they got th e shot. These symptoms usually go away on their own within a week. Some people report getting a headache or fever after receiving a vaccine. Can you still get sick even if you've been vaccinated? Yes. Because no vaccine is 100%, it is still possibl e to get infected with COVID -19, especially as fast-spreading strains , or variant s, become prevalent in Hawaii. These are called \"breakthrough\" cases , and most people who are vaccinated experience less severe symptoms of COVID -19 and have a lower risk of hospita lization and death from COVID -19 than those who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated. It's important to remember that the vaccine still provides strong protection in breakthrough cases. T he vaccines are very effective against COVID -19, including known variant s, and the risk of someone with a breakthrough COVID -19 infection getting sick or dying is much lower if they are fully vaccinated (i.e., two weeks have passed since their final dose). Fully vaccinated people who become infected are also signi ficantly less likely to infect other people. What is \"herd immunity\" and how does it work? What percentage of the population needs to get vaccinated to have herd immunity to COVID -19? Herd immunity refers to a situation where most of the population is imm une to an infectious disease, either from previous infection or vaccination. This provides indirect protection (i.e., Page 11 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 \"herd immunity\" or \"herd protection\") to people who are not immune to the disease because it makes it harder for the disease to spread. Experts do not know what percentage of people would need to get vaccinated or have natural immunity (from previous infection) to achieve herd immunity for COVID -19, so it is important for all people eligible to get the COVID -19 vaccine and booster. Is the COVID -19 vaccine safe? The COVID -19 vaccines being offered to the public are very safe. They have gone through comprehensive initial studies, checking for safety and effectiveness and making sure they meet the FDA's rigorous standards . Even after emergency approval or full approval (see next question) , they are continually monitored for any problems or concerns. Hundreds of millions of doses have been given in the United States saf ely, providing those who received them with the strongest protection against COVID -19 infection, serious illness, hospitalization and death. HDOH is also monitoring for possible adverse events and for any announcements from FDA and CDC. This monitoring is critical to help ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks for people who receive vaccines. If any vaccine were found to be unsafe, FDA, CDC and HDOH would let the public and medical providers know. What does it mean if a vaccine has Emergency Use Authorization or is fully approved by FDA? Emergency Use Authorization. Initially, all three vaccines approved for use in the United States (i.e., Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) had met the standards for FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) after they first were carefully tested in clinical trials of tens of thousands of people to make sure that they are safe and that they work. When a vaccine is granted EUA by the FDA, it means the benefits of this vaccine outweigh the known and potential harms of becoming infected with COVID -19. An EUA also means that e ven after the initial studies, safety is continuously ch ecked. There are many safety monitoring systems that watch for adverse effects and possible side effects that were not seen in clinical trials. If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety c oncern. Experts then decide whether changes are needed in the vaccine recommendations. This is what happened with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine while its use was paused (you can read more about the Johnson & Johnson pause at www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda -cdc-lift-vaccine -use.html ). Full FDA approval. On August 23, 2021, the FDA gave full approval to Pfizer's COVID -19 vaccine, which has been renamed Comirnaty , for use in people aged 16 and over (the Pfizer vaccine is still approved for people aged 12 to 15 under Emergency Use Authorization. Full approva l comes after the FDA Page 12 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 analyzes the effectiveness and safety data from not only the tens of thousands of clinical participants, but also the analysis of real -world safety data such as the millions of Americans who have received the Pfizer vaccine since it w as approved for emergency use. Like the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines under Emergency Use Authorization, the fully approved Pfizer vaccine will continue to be monitored carefully for any concerns about safety or effectiveness that might occur. You can read more about FDA's approval decision at -first-covid -19-vaccine . How do I report it if I have a problem or bad reaction after getting a COVID -19 vaccine? CDC and FDA encourage the public to report possible side effects (\"adverse events\" ) through VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and V-safe. An \"adverse event\" is any health problem that happens after a shot or other vaccine. An adverse event might be truly caused by a vaccine, or it might be pure coincidence (something that happened after vaccination but not caused by the vaccine). One of the main jobs o f CDC's Immunization Safety Office is doing research to find out if adverse events that are reported by doctors, vaccine manufacturers, and the public are truly caused by a vaccine. VAERS on the Internet VAERS is a national system that collects data to lo ok for side effects (\"adverse events\") that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected, or occur in unusual patterns. CDC uses VAERS to monitor the safety of vaccines across the country , which is a top priority. The Vaccine Adverse Event Rep orting System (VAERS) can be found at the following website: vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . V-safe on your smartphone You can also use a tool on your smartphone, called V -safe, to tell CDC about any side effects you have after getting the COVID -19 vaccine. V -safe will also provide you reminders if you need a second vaccine dose. V-safe uses text messages and web surveys to provide personalized health check -ins after you receive a COVID -19 vaccinatio n. Through V -safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any problems you experience after getting the COVID -19 vaccine. Depending on your answers, someone from CDC may call to check on you and get more information. You can learn more about how to registe r and use V -safe at the following website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html . You can learn more about the difference between routine side effects and adverse events at Page 13 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/sideeffects/index.html . Why would a vaccine be needed if we can do other things, like social distancing and wearing masks, to pr event the virus that causes COVID -19 from spreading? Getting a vaccine is only one of several tools available to us to stop the COVID -19 pandemic. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from others, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Are there known adverse events associated with the COVID -19 vaccines? Adve rse events are uncommon but still possible. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after receiving the vaccine. For this reason, you will be asked to stay at the place where you receive your vaccine for at least 15 minutes so you can be monitored for any problems after vaccination. Signs of severe allergic reaction can include the following: difficulty breathing swelling of your face and throat a fast heartbeat a bad rash all over your body dizziness and weakness Overall, these adverse events do not raise safety concerns, and the risk of serious adverse events is outweighed by the benefits of receiving the vaccine. More information about adverse effects is available at the following sites : www.fda.gov/media/144414/download www.fda.gov/media/144638/download How much protection does the COVID -19 vaccine provide ? The Pfizer and M oderna vaccines that have been approved for the general public have been shown to be about 95% effective 14 days after the second dose. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine that has been approved for the general public have been shown to be about 70% effective 14 days after the single dose. All three are effective against the Delta and Omicron variant s. For more information about the Omicron variant, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/variants/omicron -variant.html More information is available at: www.fda.gov/media/144245/download Does the COVID -19 vaccine protect against transmission of the virus to other people ? Most vaccines that protect from viral illnesses also reduce transmission of the virus that causes the disease by those who are vaccinated. Page 14 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 Evidence exists, however, that fully vaccinated people can still spread the Delta variant to other people, though the rate of transmission is much lower than with unvaccinated people. This is one of several reasons to continue wearing a mask and practicing social distancing while indoors or in crowded outdoor settings, even after getting fully vaccinated. I want to know what is in the vaccine I will be getting. What are the ingredients? The Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine includes the following sodium phosphate dihydrate The Moderna COVID hydrochloride acetic acid sodium acetate sucrose The Johnson & Johnson Janssen COVID -19 vaccine includes the following ingredients: recombinant replication On April 13, 2021, use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was halted across the United Page 15 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 States, including Hawaii , pending a review of its safety. On April 23, CDC recommended resuming its use. Hawaii resumed use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on April 29, 2021. You can read more about the temporary halting of Johnson & Johnson vaccine at the following site: www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda -cdc-lift-vaccine -use.html . None of the vaccines contain egg s, gelatin, latex, or preservatives. More information about these vaccines' ingredients is available at the following sites. Pfizer : www.fda.gov/media/144414/download Moderna: www.fda.gov/media/144638/download Johnson & Johnson: www.fda.gov/media/144245/download Will the COVID -19 vaccine be a yearly vaccine? Are there recommendations for third doses or booster shots ? At this time there are no plans for the COVID -19 vaccine t o be a yearly shot, like \"the flu shot\" currently is. However, FDA and CDC have recommended that all fully vaccinated people age 18 and over should get an additional shot or a booster shot to stay as protected from COVID -19 infection and complications as p ossible. (It is important to note that b ooster shots are common for vaccines, which can have a reduction in effect over time. The FDA-authorized and -approved COVID -19 vaccines \u2014Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson \u2014remain highly effective against COVID -19, including the Delta variant. ) In August 2021 CDC announced new recommendations for an additional third dose of the Pfizer vaccine (Comirnaty) or Moderna vaccine for immunocompromised individuals (see Who shoul d get an additional third shot? below) . Also, on September 23, 2021, CDC announced recommendations of booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine for people 65 years of age and older, as well as people age who are at high risk of getting serious illness from COVID -19 infection due to health conditions, job exposure, etc . On October 21, 2021, CDC announced similar recommendatio ns for those who received the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines . As of November 21, 2021, FDA and CDC are authorizing booster shots for all fully vaccinated people age d 18 and over (see Who should get a booste r shot? below). On December 9th, CDC strengthened its booster recommendations to encoura ge everyone 16 and older to receive a booster shot. CDC also updated recommendations for when many people can receive a booster shot, shortening the interval from 6 months to 5 months for people who received the Pfizer - BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine. This means that people can now receive an mRNA booster shot 5 months after completing their Pfizer -BioNTech primary series. The booster interval Page 16 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 recommendation for people who received the J&J vaccine (2 months) or the Moderna vaccine (6 months), has not changed. Who should get an additional third shot? An additional third shot of Pfizer (Comirnaty) and Moderna vaccines is recommended for people who are immunocompromised. This is different from booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine (Comirnaty) (which are addressed in the next question ). CDC also recommends that moderately or severely immunocompromised 5 -11-year -olds receive an additional primary dose of vaccine 28 days after their second shot. At this time, only the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine is authorized and recommended for children aged 5-11. This is wh at you should know about an additional shot for immunocompromised people : An additional third dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer and Moderna) is recommended for people whose immune systems are moderately to severely compromised . People who are moderately to severely immunocompromised need a third shot because they are especially vulnerable to COVID -19 due to being more at risk of serious and prolonged illness. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems may not build the same l evel of immunity from just two doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines compared to people who are not immunocompromised. This third dose is not the same as a booster dose given to people when their immune response to a primary vaccine series is likely to hav e waned over time. People who are immunocompromised are who are not sure if they are should contact their healthcare provider to determine whether and when to receive a third dose. More information about third doses for immunocompromised people can be fou nd at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html . Who should get a booster shot? CDC has strengthened its booster rec ommendations and is encouraging everyone 16 and older to receive a booster shot. Initial data suggests that COVID -19 boosters help broaden and strengthen the protection against Omicron and other variants. At this time, only the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 va ccine is authorized and recommended for adolescents aged 16 and 17. As with the initial doses of the COVID -19 vaccines, the booster shots will be free and available to everyone who is eligible , regardless of insurance coverage or immigration status. This is what you should know about booster shots : For those who received the Pfizer vaccine , the CDC recommends everyone 12 years and older receive a booster shot at least 5 months after completing their primary COVID -19 vaccination series. Page 17 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 For those who received the Moderna vaccine , the CDC recommends adults 18 years and older receive a booster shot at least 5 months after completing their primary COVID -19 vaccination series. For those who received the Johnson & Johnson /Janssen vaccine , CDC recommends adults 18 years and older receive a booster shot at least 2 months after receiving their J&J/Janssen COVID -19 vaccination. Individuals may choose to get a different vaccine from the one they received initially . o For those who received Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, a booster of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine is preferred in most situat ions. Teens 12 -17 years old may only get a Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine booster. o For those who received a Johnson and Johnson vaccine, a booster of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine is preferred in most situations. Getting unvaccinated people fully vaccinated remains a priority for stopping COVID -19. The decision by FDA and CDC to recommend these booster shots is based on an independent and transparent review process of the latest data and evidence showing that booster shots are safe and effective. Side effects for booster shots were similar to those from second vaccine doses and were mostly mild, moderate, and short -lived. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data to determine when other groups may become eligible for booster shots. The booster shots are the s ame formulation as the current COVID -19 vaccines. The Moderna vaccine booster shot, however, is only half the dose of the initial series. The risks to getting a booster shot so far have been similar previous doses, including temporary side effects such as fever, headache, fatigue, and pain at the injection site. The definition of \"fully vaccinated\" remains the same: people are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of Pfizer (Comirnaty) or Moderna, or two weeks after their single dose of Johnson & Johnson. More information about booster shots for fully vaccinated people can be found at the following CDC sites : www.cdc.gov/coron avirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/booster -shot.html COVID -19 vaccine be used i nterchangeably? For the initial vaccine doses, no . Initial doses of COVID -19 vaccines using mRNA are not interchangeable with each other. Both the first dose and the second dose should be done with the same product . However, for the booster shot, indivi duals may choose a different vaccine from the one they received as the initial dose. Can I take a pain reliever or fever reducer after vaccination if I have side effects? Yes. Pain relievers and fever reducers (e.g., acetaminophen, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory Page 18 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 drugs) may be taken if pain results from the vaccine, but they are not recommended to prevent post -vaccination symptoms. Are there any contraindications to getting the COVID -19 vaccine? According to CDC, you should not receive the vaccine at this time and speak to their healthcare provider if you have a history of the following: Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine or any of its components Imme diate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol [PEG]) Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate (due to potential cross -reactive hypersensitivi ty with the vaccine ingredient PEG) More information is available at: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/info -by-product/clinical -considerations.html . Is there a time limit between doses where dose 1 is no longer effective and a pati ent must start again with the initial dose? At this time, t here is currently no information available about how long someone can wait to get their second dose ( CDC will update guidance as it becomes available ). This is why it is recommended that everyone g et their second dose soon after they are able. Are the COVID -19 vaccines effective against all currently circulating SARS -CoV-2 variants/strains? Research indicates that immune response induced by the vaccine strain should be effective against the varian ts currently in circulation. Antibodies produced by the body as a result of vaccination are equally capable of neutralizing these variants. More -emerging -variant.html . I want to know when I will be able to be vaccinated. Could you tell me what tier of vaccination I fall into? Hawaii ha d been vaccinating people according to a system of tiers recommended by CDC, based on risk and exposure to the coronavirus. Initially, only people in tiers 1a, 1b, and 1c, which include certain -high risk in dividuals (listed below), were the only ones eligible to be vaccinated in Hawaii. However, as of April 19, 2021, the entire state of Hawaii has been in Phase 2 of the COVID -19 vaccine rollout. This means all persons in Hawaii aged 12 or older are eligibl e to receive the vaccine. More information is available at: hawaiicovid19.com/vaccine/#first -vaccines . Page 19 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 Children 5 years and older can also get the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine, as of November 2021. Children ages 5 -11 will receive a separate vaccine formulation denoted with an orange cap of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine and will receive the vaccine with a smaller needle. This page share s up to date information and resources on how to help get children ages 5 -11 years old vaccinated: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/planning/children.html Does HDOH have plans to vaccinate people in ca re homes? HDOH is working closely with various pharmacies to administer vaccinations to residents of licensed care homes including community care foster family homes to administer vaccinations to as many people as possible as quickly as possible. For many , this means that pharmacies have or will very soon contact the care homes to schedule vaccine administrations in their homes. On Oahu, all licensed care homes will be scheduled for in -home vaccinations. On neighbor islands, pharmacies are scheduling vacci nations through drive -through clinics or in - home appointments. DOH/OHCA is keeping licensed care homes updated weekly on when vaccinations will be made available so they can plan accordingly, too. For more information, please visit: hawaiicovid19.com/vaccine . Will I receive proof of vaccination? When you get vaccinated, you should receive a vaccination card or printout that tells you what COVID -19 vaccine you received, the date you received it, and where you received it. If it is your first dose, the vaccination card may include information about when you should get your second dose. You should also receive a paper or electronic version of a fact sheet that tells you more about the specific COVID -19 vaccine you are being offered. Each authorized COVID -19 vaccine has its own fact sheet that contains information to help you understand the risks and benefits of receiving that specific vaccine. More information is available at: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/expect.html . Will the vaccine be mandated? Is there a \"vaccine passport\" in Hawaii? At this time there is no state or federal requirement for the vaccine. As the vaccine becomes more readily available it is possible that businesses and other employers may choose to add a vaccine requirement. In August 2021, the State of Hawaii mandated that all employees either show proof of being fully vaccinated or be subje ct to regular COVID -19 testing. The University of Hawaii has also required all students participating in in -person learning be fully vaccinated. For more information on state or county requirements for the general public or business customers to be vaccin ated against COVID -19 or to show a negative COVID -19 test, please visit Page 20 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 our general COVID -19 FAQs at health.hawaii.gov/prepare/files/2020/04/DOH_COVID - 19_FAQs.pdf and see the information at the question Are the State of Hawaii and county governments mandating \"vaccine passports\" or requiring people to be vaccinated? Is vaccination required for any kind of activity? Are there any restrictions for non -citizens or u ndocumented people getting vaccinated? No, there are not. The vaccine is available for free to everyone within the state of Hawaii, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. Insurance coverage is not required. All people residing in Hawaii are encou raged to get vaccinated if they are at least 12 years of age and do not have health conditions that would prevent them from getting vaccinated. Do I have to have an ID to get vaccinated? Although you may be asked for personal identification, it is not re quired in order to get a vaccine. Even if you do not provide an ID with you, you can get vaccinated. What if I miss my second dose? What do I do? It is important that you receive your second dose. The COVID -19 vaccines that require two doses are not comp letely effective unless you receive the second dose. Your second dose will be scheduled at the time you receive your initial dose. If you miss your second dose, reach out to the provider for recommendation of next steps. If I cannot take the flu vaccine d ue to an egg allergy, can I receive the COVID -19 vaccine? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not contain human or animal cells. Since they are not grown in eggs like some influenza vaccines, you should be safe. However, if you have a history of allergic o r severe allergic reactions, you should seek guidance from your healthcare provider before choosing to be vaccinated. Are there any tests people have to get before getting the vaccine? CDC has found that the COVID -19 vaccines are safe for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and those who are planning to get pregnant, so they are not recommending a routine pregnancy test or an antibody blood test for COVID -19 before you get the vaccine. You should talk with your healthcare provider about any questions you have due to your own personal medical history. Can I get the second dose of the vaccine in a different state than where I got the first dose? It is important to get the second dose of the same vacci ne in the time frame required for your vaccine . You might be able to get that same vaccine in a different state, but you should check before traveling to ensure availability in the state you are traveling to . Consult that state's Page 21 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 COVID -19 vaccine website. Make sure you have your immunization records, including the card you receive when you get your first dose. Where can I get information about the requirements for traveling to Hawai' i during the pandemic ? https://hawaiicovid19.com/travel/getting -to-hawaii/ Are there exceptions to quarantine when traveling or returning to Hawai'i? https:/ /hawaiicovid19.com/travel/faqs/ Do we have to wait for one group to be vaccinated before the next group can receive vaccine? How long will it take to move between phases? At this time, all persons aged 5 and older are eligible to be vaccinated. The syste m of tiers and groups is no longer in effect. Can this vaccine cause COVID -19? How does it work? No, the vaccine cannot cause COVID -19. The vaccine contains a synthetic, small piece of the SARS -CoV-2 genetic code (messenger RNA) that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive \"spike\" protein (SARS -CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID -19). When vaccinated, the body produces copies of the spike protein, which alone does not cause disease, and the immune system learns to react defensively, producing an immune response against the virus . Although this technology has not been used in any FDA -licensed preventive vaccine, FDA scientists have expertise with this technology as it has been used to develop other preventive investigational vaccines that have been tested in human clinical trials. FDA does not have specific safety concerns with a vaccine that utilizes this technology. More information is available do after I am fully vaccinated? If you are fully vaccinated (which means at least two weeks have passed since you have received the final dose of your vaccine) , then you may be able to resume some activities safely. This guidance from CDC represents a first step toward returning to everyday activities in our communities , although caution is still needed due to the Delta and Omicron variant s. It will be updated by CDC and HDOH as more people are vaccinated, COVID -19 rates rise or fall significantly , and new scientific evidence about variants and other issues becomes available. (After the Delta variant became common in the US, CDC recommended some restrictions on earlier guidance.) Page 22 of 22 RETURN TO MENU version 01/ 13/2022 At this time, CDC is advising that fully vaccinated peo ple do the following: In indoor public settings in areas with substantial or high transmission of COVID -19, they should wear a mask to prevent spread, especially if they or a household member is immunocompromised. In outdoor settings, fully vaccinated peop le do not need to wear a mask, but they are encouraged to do so if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised. They should get tested if they experience COVID -19 symptoms and isolate if they have tested positive for COVID -19 in the prior 10 d ays. They should get tested three to five days after exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 and wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days after the exposure or until they receive a negative test. They can travel domestically witho ut getting a viral test before or after traveling, including to/from Hawaii. They can also travel domestically without the need to self - quarantine following travel. They can travel internationally without getting tested before leaving the United States (unless required by their destination) and do not need to self -quarantine after returning to the United States. However: o International travelers must still have a negative viral test or documentation of recovery from COVID -19 before boarding a flight to the United States. o International travelers arriving in the United States are still recommended to get a viral test three to five days after travel, regardless of vaccination status.

OVERVIEW What is COVID -19? COVID -19 is a novel ( new ) respiratory virus that was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in Hubei Province , in December 2019 . It has since spread across China and around the world . On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March 11 , 2020, declared a pandemic (global outbreak of a disease). The most updated numbers can be found at the HDOH website: health.hawaii.gov/covid19 . HDOH is urging all res idents to help prevent the spread of COVID -19 in our communities . You can learn what to do by visiting of COVID -19? As with many other contagious diseases, the coronavirus that causes COVID -19 can change over time due to gene mutations that occur when the virus reproduces and spreads to other people. There are multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID -19 and more are expected to occur. Some v ariants may spread more easily or be more resistant to treatments and vaccines. CDC, WHO, and other public health organizations are constantly monitoring COVID -19 cases for new variants so we can be prepared. You can learn more about COVID -19 variants by visiting this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/variants/variant.html . What is the Delta variant? What do I need to know? The Delta variant spreads more quickly and easily than earlier strains of the coronaviruses and can cause more serious illness and death . The symptoms of the Delta variant are the same as earlier versions of COVID -19. This is what you should know about the Delta variant: The Delta variant is highly contagious , more than 2x as contagious as previous variants. Some data suggest the Delta variant might cause more severe illness than previous variants in unvaccinated people . In two different studies from Canada and Scotland, patients infected with the Delta variant were more likely to be hospitalized than Page 6 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 patients infected with Alpha or the original virus that causes COVID -19. Even so, the vast majority of hospitalization an d death caused by COVID -19 are in unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people remain the greatest concern: The greatest risk of transmission is among unvaccinated people who are much more likely to get infected, and therefore transmit the virus. Those who are up to date with their vaccinations get COVID -19 (known as breakthrough infections ) less often than unvaccinated people. Peop le infected with the Delta variant, including fully vaccinated people with symptomatic breakthrough infections, can transmit the virus to others. CDC is continuing to assess data on whether fully vaccinated people with asymptomatic breakthrough infections can transmit the virus. Fully vaccinated people with Delta variant breakthrough infections can spread the virus to others. However, vaccinated people appear to spread the virus for a shorter time: For prior variants, lower amounts of viral genetic material were found in samples taken from fully vaccinated people who had breakthrough infections than from unvaccinated people with COVID -19. For people infected with the Delta variant, similar amounts of viral genetic material have been found among both unvaccin ated and fully vaccinated people. However, like prior variants, the amount of viral genetic material may go down faster in people who are up to date with their COVID vaccinations when compared to unvaccinated people. This means those who are u p to date wit h their COVID vaccinations will likely spread the virus for less time than unvaccinated people. You can learn more about the Delta variant by visiting this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/variants/delta -variant.html . What is the Omicron variant? What do I need to know? Right now, CDC, WHO, and public health experts are particularly concerned about the Omicron variant, which has more genetic mutations than previous variants (including Delta) and may spread more quickly than earlier strains of the coronavirus, even among those who are up to date with their vaccinations . The Omicron variant has already been identified in most states and territories, including Hawaii. It is not yet known if Omicron can cause more serious illness and death, and researchers are investigating this carefully. The symptoms of the Omicron variant are the same as earlier versions of COVID -19. We do know that being up to date with COVID -19 vaccinations are the best ways to protect against the Omicron variant. This is what you should know about the Omicron variant: Getting vaccinated (and, if appropriate, getting a vaccine booster) is the best protection against Omicron and other known variants: Page 7 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 o The COVID -19 vaccines authorized by the FDA protect against Omicron and other known variants. o People w ho are up to date with their vaccinations are much less likely to get infected, get very sick, or die from COVID -19, compared to people who are not vaccinated. o People who are up to date with their vaccinations are less likely to spread COVID -19. o People who are eligible (i.e., six months have passed since they received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two months have passed since they received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine) should get a booster shot to maximize their protection against the Omicron variant. Unvaccinated people appear to be more at risk of getting seriously ill or dying from the Omicron variant than earlier forms of COVID -19. Because the Omicron variant spreads more easily and quickly, and because those who are up to date with their vaccinati ons may also transmit it, everyone (including fully vaccinated people) should continue wearing masks in public indoor spaces and crowded outdoor settings. You can learn more about the Omicron variant by visiting this CDC website: are \"breakt hrough\" cases? COVID -19 vaccines are effective at preventing infection, serious illness, and death. Most people who get COVID -19 are unvaccinated. However, since vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, some people who are up to date with their vaccinations will still get COVID -19. An infection of a fully vaccinated person is referred to as a \"vaccine breakthrough infection.\" Vaccine breakthrough infections are expected. COVID -19 vaccines are effective at preventing most infections. However, like other vaccines, they are not 100% effective. Fully vaccinated people with a vaccine breakthrough infection are less likely to develop serious illness than those who are unvaccinated and get COVID -19. Even when fully vaccinated people develop symptoms, they tend to be less severe symptoms than in unvaccinated people. This means they are much less likely to be hospitalized or die than people who are not vaccinated. People who get vaccine breakthrough infections can be contagious. You can learn more about breakthrough cases by visiting this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why -measure - effectiveness/breakthrough -cases.html . 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 How does COVID -19 spread? Although we have uncovered a lot about COVID -19, w e are still learning how the virus spreads. Although SARS -CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19) likely came from an animal source, it is now primarily spread from person -to-person. Some viruses are very contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. This virus spreads very ea sily and sustainably between people. Like m ost coronaviruses (including the common cold) , the virus causing COVID -19 spread s mainly through the tiny droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby and possibly be inhaled into the lungs. People infected with the virus causing COVID -19 can also spread the virus, even if they do not have symptoms of COVID -19, which makes this viru s especially difficult to stop. At this time , our best research shows that COVID -19 is spread in the following ways: The virus causing COVID -19 spreads more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles , which is highly contagious. The Del ta variant spreads much more easily and quickly than earlier versions of COVID -19. It spreads most easily between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) , especially indoors but even in crowded outdoor settings. The virus travels t hrough respiratory droplets produced , especially when an infected person coughs or sneezes, but possibly also when they talk, yell, or sing . These droplets can land in the mouth , nose , or eyes of someone nearby or possibly inhaled into the l ungs. COVID -19 may spread like this even if the infected person is not showing symptoms (\"asymptomatic\") and does not know they are infected . There is evidence that a person can get COVID -19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose , or eyes; however, this is not thought to be a main way the virus spreads. Mother -to-child transmission during pregnancy seems to be rare , but after birth a newborn is susceptible to person -to-person spread through respiratory droplets . (Please see I am currently pregnant and Can I breastfeed my baby? in a later section to see how pregnant and breastfeeding mothers can protect thei r child.) At this time there is no evidence that the virus spreads through food. The risk of getting COVID -19 from food you cook yourself or from handling and consuming food from restaurants and takeout or drive -thru meals is thought to be very low. You can learn more about how COVID -19 spreads at -19 if they have no symptoms? Although the virus is usually spread from infected people who have symptoms of COVID -19 (\"symptomatic\"), we now know that people infected with the virus who have no symptoms Page 9 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 (\"asymptomatic\") or who are n ot yet showing symptoms (\"pre -symptomatic\") can also spread the virus to other people . This is why it is important for people to wear face coverings in public or in close proximity to other people even if they think they are not infected. People who are up to date with their COVID vaccinations should also continue wearing face coverings indoors in public places and in crowded places outdoors. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT What are the symptoms of COVID -19? Patients with COVID -19 generally report mild symptoms to severe illness , usually 2 to 14 days after exposure . If you have these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Muscle or body aches Fatigue Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Some patients may not report fever, especially the very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, and people taking certain fever -lowering medications. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. The above list does not include all possible symptoms. This list will be updated as CDC and other researchers learn more. Are there emergency signs of COVID -19? What should I do if I have th em? People who have COVID -19 or think they have COVID -19 should watch for emergency warning signs and seek emergency medical care immediately, by calling 911 or calling ahead to their local emergency facilit y (and notifying the operator that they are seeki ng care for someone who has or may have COVID -19). These emergency warning signs include the following: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face Page 10 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 How long does it take for symptoms to appear? CDC believes the symptoms of COVID -19 may appear as early as 2 days after exposure and as long as 14 days after exposure. Are there complications from COVID -19? Many patients with COVID -19 develop pneumonia in both lungs. In a sma ll percentage of cases, death occurs . Some people have developed long -term health conditions even after their COVID -19 infection has cleared. These include long -lasting conditions known as \"long COVID ,\" as well as Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS). You can learn more about them at the following CDC websites: \"Long COVID\": www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/long -term tested for COVID -19 infection? You should call ahead to a healthcare provider to find out about getting tested for COVID -19 infection if one of the following is true: If you have COVID -19 symptoms After known or suspected exposure to COVID -19 For screening (schools, workplaces, congregate settings, etc.) Before travel When asked by a healthcare professional or public health official People at higher risk for severe disease (older people, those with chronic medical conditions and immunosuppression) should also be prioritized for testing. They should contact a healthcare provider who can help determine whether they should be tested for COVID -19. You ca n use the CDC's \"Viral Testing Tool\" to see -ncov/testing/diagnostic -testing.html#who -should the CDC's \"Coronavirus Self -Checker\" to see if you should contact a healthcare provider: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/ symptoms -testing/symptoms.html . People who have tested positive for COVID -19 but have recovered from their symptoms may continue to test positive for three months or more without being able to spread the virus to others. These people should get tested again only if they develop new symptoms of COVID -19. They should speak with their healthcare provider about getting tes ted if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID -19 in the last 14 days. You can read more about testing here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/symptoms -testing/testing.html Page 11 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 Is free testing for COVID -19 available in Hawaii? Yes. HDOH maintains a website that contains information on where to obtain a COVID -19 test, including locations that offer free testing. You can find the information at hawaiicovid19.com/testing -isolation -quarantine . If I test negative, does that mean I cannot get COVID -19? No. A negative test means you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected , or that your sample was collected too early in your infection. You could also be exposed to COVID -19 before the test , but the infection may be too low to detect at the time the test was performed. If you have symptoms later, you may need another test to determine if you are infected with COVID -19. A negative viral test does not mean you cannot get infected or get sick later. Why is an \"official\" test result pos itive even though the test I took at home or elsewhere was negative? Some tests are more sensitive than others and may detect a COVID -19 case that a less sensitive test missed. For example, the PerkinElmer New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, used b y Operation Expanded Testing, detects as low as 180 NDU/mL (NAAT detectable units per milliliter), while the test from Quest does not detect lower than 1,800 NDU/mL. What is a \"close contact\"? A close contact is someone who meets one of the following desc riptions: They have been within 6 feet of a COVID -19-infected person for 15 minutes or longer. They have been directly in contact with a COVID -19-infected person's secretions (e.g., they were coughed on). Who is at greatest risk for severe illness from COVID -19? Those at higher risk include older adults and anyone with underlying health conditions, although people of all ages and healthy people are also at risk. Those in the following groups are most vulnerable to severe illness from COVID -19: Olde r adults o Risk goes up with age, although all ages have some risk. o The greatest risk for severe illness is among those aged 85 and older. People of any age with these conditions: o Cancer o Chronic kidney disease o COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) o Weakened immune system (immunocompromised) from organ transplant o Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher) o Serious heart conditions (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies) Page 12 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 o Sickle cell disease o Type -2 diabetes melli tus (formerly known as adult -onset diabetes) People with frequent institutional or organizational exposure to people with COVID -19 What other conditions can make you vulnerable for severe illness from COVID -19? Other conditions may put people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19, including children. These include the following: Asthma (moderate to severe) Cerebrovascular disease (affecting blood vessels and blood supply to the brain) Hypertension or high blood pressure Weakened immune system (immunocompromised) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines Neurologic conditions such as dementia Liver disease Pregnancy Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues) Smoking Vaping Thalassemia Type -1 diabetes mellitus Social determinants of health o Crowded housing, poor access to quality healthcare, lower income, incarceration, resident of long -term care facility, certain occupations People with underlying medical conditions are advised to keep their healthcare appointments, practice preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, frequent hand -washing, wearing face coverings, etc.) , and make sure to have at least a 30 -day supply of pres cription and non - prescription medicines. Are children affected by COVID -19 in any unique way? Although children are generally at much lower risk than older adults, there have been over 4,000 cases of a rare but serious condition associated with children and adolescents called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS -C). It can begin weeks after a child or adolescent is infected with the virus causing COVID -19, even in those who had not shown symptoms of COVID -19. As of August 27, 2021 , forty -one deaths are considered likely due to MIS-C. MIS-C has been described as inflammation across multiple body systems, potentially including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal organs. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, conjunctivitis, and fatigue. Page 13 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 You can learn more about MIS -C at the following CDC page: www.cdc.gov/mi s-c/cases . Are some ethnicities more likely to get coronavirus than others? No, viruses cannot target people from specific populations, ethnicities, or racial backgrounds. People who have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected c ase are not at greater risk of acquiring and spreading this new virus than others. In particular, people of Chinese or other East Asian descent are not more likely to get or spread the coronavirus. There is increasing evidence, however, that certain racia l and ethnic groups may be more adversely affected than other groups. This is largely due to inequities in social determinants of health, such as poverty and inadequate access to healthcare, that affect some groups worse than others. Some groups are also d isproportionately represented in essential work settings and thus at greater risk. Such groups may include Pacific Islanders and foreign -born individuals, as well as Black Americans, people of Hispanic or Latino background, and Native Americans. What is the test for SARS -CoV-2 or COVID -19? Can any laboratory in Hawaii test for it? SARS -CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19) is detected through laboratory testing of respiratory specimens and serum (blood) . A viral test is looking for genetic material of th e virus, which will be in your respiratory samples if you are currently infected . An antibody test (see below) looks for antibodies that might appear if you had a past infection. Healthcare providers who think their patients may have COVID -19 can wor k with HDOH to have their specimens tested. Testing can be performed at the Hawaii State Laboratories Division, at CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, and at some commercial labs. What is an antibody test? An antibody test (also referred to as a serology test or serologic test) is a blood test that can see if you have antibodies against a microorganism, such as the virus that causes COVID -19. (Antibodies are specific proteins your body makes in response to infections.) These are things you should know about antibody tests: An antibody test might determine if you have previously been exposed to that particular microorganism. According to CDC, it is possible that a positive test result means you have antibodies from an infection with another virus from the coronavi rus family. An antibody test should not be used to find out if you have a current infection because it can take 1 to 3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. A viral test using samples from a person's respiratory system is needed to determine if they ar e currently infected. CDC does not know yet how well having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again or how long that protection might last. You can read more about antibody testing here: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/lab/serology -testing.html . Page 14 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 I took a serological (blood) test that says I have antibodies for the virus that causes COVID -19. Does that mean I can stop quarantining or social distancing? No, if you have been ordered to quarantine, you must abide by the rules of your quarantine until the Department of Health tells you that you can stop. Scientists are still conducting studies on serologic testing for COVID -19 and it is not clear if the presence of antib odies found in these tests accurately indicate s immunity against COVID -19. How is COVID -19 treated? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to allow healthcare providers to use products that are not yet approved, or that are approved for other uses, to treat patients with COVID -19 in the U.S. if certain legal requirements are met. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed and regularly updates Treatment Guidelines to help guide healthcare providers caring for patients with COVID -19, including when clinicians might consider using one of the products allowed for use under an EUA. Treatments used for COVID -19 should be prescribed by you r healthcare provider. People have been seriously harmed and even died after taking products not approved for use to treat or prevent COVID -19, even products approved or prescribed for other u ses. Talk to your healthcare provider about what option may be best for you. Your healthcare provider might recommend the following to relieve symptoms and support your body's natural defenses: Taking medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever Drinking water or receiving intravenous fluids to stay hydrated Getting plenty of rest to help the body fight the virus For people at high risk of disease progression, the FDA has issued EUAs for a number of treatments for COVID -19. Monoclonal antibody treatments could help the immune system recognize and respond more effectively to the virus. Oral antiviral medications that target specific parts of the SARS -CoV-2 virus can help reduce its multiplication and spread through the patient's body. Some of these treatments may not be effective against the Omicron variant. Your healthcare provider will decide which, if any, of these treatments are appropriate to treat your illness. The NIH COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines provide recommendations about these treatments for COVID -19 and describe what is known about their effectiveness. If used, they should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis. Page 15 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 You can read more about COVID -19 safe to try medications intended for other purposes ? COVID -19 treatments should be prescribed by your healthcare provider. People have been seriously harmed or even died after taking products not approved for prevention or treatment of COVID -19, incl uding products approved or prescribed for other medical purposes such as hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin. Ivermectin, for example, is an antiparasitic medication approved for use in animals and humans to get rid of parasitic worms, head lice, and other p arasites. Ivermectin is not an antiviral medication and has not been conclusively found to prevent or treat COVID -19 infection. Using a medication like ivermectin without the oversight of a healthcare provider to prevent or treat COVID -19 can be very dange rous, especially if a large dose is used or if it is mixed with other medications, like blood thinners. Overdosing on ivermectin can lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension), problems with balance (ataxia), seizure s, coma, and death. Using ivermectin prescribed for animals is especially risky because they may contain substances tested for use in animals but not in humans. Getting vaccinated against COVID -19 with one of the approved vaccines available is by far the best way to prevent infection, serious illness, and death. You can read more about the risks of using ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID -19 by going person with COVID -19 infection contagious? When can they be around others? Follow this updated isolation guidance, regardless of vaccination status: Day 0 is your first day of symptoms or a positive viral test. Day 1 is the first full day after your symptoms developed or your test specimen was collected . If you have COVID -19 or have symptoms, isolate for at least 5 days. Wear a well -fitted mask if you must be around others in your home. Ending isolation if you had symptoms : After 5 full days if you are fever -free for 24 hours (without the use of fever reducing medications) and your symptoms are improving. Page 16 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 Ending isolation if you did not have symptoms : After at least 5 full days after your positive test. If you were severely ill with COVID -19: You should isolate for at least 10 days. Consult your doctor before ending isolation. Take precautions until day 10 Wear a well fitted mask for full 10 days anytime you are around others inside your home or in public. Do not go to places where you are unable to wear a mask. Avoid travel. Avoid being around others who are at high -risk. More information about isolation and quarantine is available SITUATION IN HAWAII AND THE UNITED STATES How many cases of COVID -19 have there been in Hawaii? How many deaths? Hawaii has experience d nearly one hundred thousand cases and over seven hundred deaths. The latest numbers can be found at the HDOH website: health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019 . Am I at risk for COVID -19 in the United States? Yes, people across the country are at risk for COVID -19. The latest updates are available at CDC's COVID Data Tracker and HDOH's COVID -19 website . In Hawaii, at present, mask wearing is required indoors even by those who are up to date with their vaccines . Mask wearing is not required outdoors by anyone (regardless of vaccination status) but is highly recommended when in large groups. The following people are at increased risk: People in places where ongoing community spread is reported are at elevated risk of exposure People who have traveled to places with ongoing community spread Healthcare workers exposed to or caring for people with COVID -19 Family members or close household contacts caring for people with COVID -19 Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions who may experience more severe illness if they become inf ected Page 17 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 No matter what the ir risk is, everyone is advised to get vaccinated, always wear masks in public when indoors (including public transportation) and outdoors when in large groups , practice \"social distancing \" to protect themselves and others , and frequently wash their hands . Public health authorities such as CDC and HDOH want everyone to be prepared for the likelihood that COVID -19 will continue to spread widely in the United States for months to come . Is COVID -19 a danger in Hawaii? You can find information about Hawaii's current COVID case count here: Hawaii Data Dashboard . HDOH is urging all residents to prepare for the likelihood that COVID -19 will continue to spread widely in our communities . HDOH wants the public to get vaccinated and to know and practice other important preventive measures, such as social distancing , use of cloth fac ial coverings (\"masks\") when in public settings indoors or around other people (including when using public transportation) or in crowded outdoor settings , and frequent handwashing with soap and water for 20 seconds or with alcohol -based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 percent alcohol) , to prevent spread of COVID -19. A short HDOH video demonstrating proper hand -washing technique can be found at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2r2iqbEM5s . Regardless of how widespread COVID -19 becomes in Hawaii, our access to certain resour ces could still be impacted by this outbreak. Hawaii residents should make sure they and their household are prepared with a family emergency kit that lasts at least 14 days , in case a family member is quarantined or if there is a shortage of certain goods , such as medicine and food, in the event of a continuing pandemic. However, residents are reminded that hoarding goods may adversely affect other members of our island community. You can learn more about preparing a family emergency kit at health.hawaii.gov/prepare/protect -your -family . HDOH is continually updating information as the situation evolves and federal guidance changes. We urge everyone to learn about COVID -19 by staying informed with credible sources, such as CDC's COVID -19 website and HDOH's two websites www.hawaiicovid19.com and health.hawaii.gov/covid19 . What would happen if widespread person -to-person transmission continues in Hawaii or elsewhere in the United States? What is the reason we are trying hard to prevent this? While proactively carrying out prevention measures may slow the spread of COVID -19, it is important t o be prepared for the possibility that it will continue to be widespread in Hawaii. If there is widespread transmission of COVID -19 in a particular area , there would be large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time , overwhelming hospitals and healthcare providers and public health, with elevated rates of hospitalization , severe illness, long -term health problems and death. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and the tran sportation industry may also be affected. Page 18 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 (See What measures are being done to prevent widespread transmission? below.) Does HDOH tell us where there is a confirmed case in Hawaii and where the case is located? HDOH inform s the public whenever there are new confirmed cases. A map of the areas where there have been cases can be found at this names of confirmed cases , dea ths, or persons under investigation? HDOH protects the privacy of persons and their households and does not release names or other information that could be used to identify a person infected with COVID -19, someone who has died, or someone under quarantin e. HDOH may release information about the number of people infected based on county or ZIP code. At the same time, those who may have been exposed have a right to know and to protect themselves. When HDOH identifies a potential case of COVID -19, a detailed investigation is performed that includes tracing and contacting all close contacts of that person during the time that they were infectious. Since the virus is spread by prolonged close contact, people who have briefly been in the same indoor envi ronment or had brief interactions are not considered to be at risk for infection. What are the differences between \"isolation\" and \"quarantine\"? Isolation and quarantine are two important tools for protecting the public during the COVID -19 pandemic. Alth ough some people use the terms interchangeably, they mean different things. Isolation Isolation separates sick people from people who are not sick. People who are in isolation must stay home . In the home, anyone who is sick should separate themselves fr om others by staying in a specific \"sick\" bedroom or space and using a different bathroom. The sick person should wear a face covering if they are in contact with others. Quarantine Quarantine separates someone who has been in contact with a person with C OVID -19 from other people, in case they have been infected and become sick, to prevent spread. Quarantine can be at a facility or in one's home (which is often called \"self -quara ntine\"). People who are in self -quarantine must stay at home . People in self -quarantine must separate themselves from household members as much as possible. People in self -quarantine should monitor their health and wear a face covering (\"mask\") if they need to be in contact with others. Page 19 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 What is the guidance for home isolation and q uarantine? People who have tested positive for COVID -19 and the people they have come in close contact with, both at home and outside the household, must take precautions to protect themselves and the community by preventing further spread of the coronavi rus. This may include isolation, quarantine, and testing. Please visit CDC's COVID Isolation and Quarantine webpage for more information. If I have been vaccinated, do I still have to quarantine or isolate if I am exposed to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID -19? Everyone 5 years and older is recommended to receive a primary series of a COVID -19 vaccine to be considered fully vaccinated. CDC recommends that people remain up to date with their vaccines, which includes additional doses for individuals who are immunocompromised or booster doses at regular time points. Individuals who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should get an additional primary shot and a booster shot. If you are up to date with your vaccines, and you've had close contact with someone who has COVID -19, you should do the following: You don't need to quarantine unless you develop symptoms. Get tested five days after your last close contact with the person , even if you have no symptoms . Watch for symptoms until 10 days after you last had close contact with the person. Wear a well -fitted mask for 10 full days any time you are around others inside your home or in public. Do not go to places where you are unable to wear a mask . Avoid travel. Avoid being around people who are at high risk. If you develop symptoms, isolate immediately and get tested. Continue to stay home until you know the results. Wear a well -fitted mask around others. If I have recently recovered from COVID -19, do I still have to quarantine or isolate if I am exposed to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID -19? If you were exposed to COVID -19 and had confirmed COVID -19 within the past 90 days (you tested positive using a viral test), then: You do not need to stay home unless you develop symptoms. Watch for symptoms until 10 days after you last had close contact with someone with COVID -19.

Are the State of Hawaii and county governments mandating \"vaccine passports\" or requiring people to be vaccinated? Is vaccination r equired for any kind of activity? Vaccination requirements are not new in the United States. They are typically required for attendance in public schools from elementary school and on up to college, for example, as well as military service, and even some t ypes of travel or immigration documents. As the pandemic continues, some private -sector establishments and government organizations may require their employees , customers , or other members of the general public to be up to date with their COVID -19 vaccinat ions (or, in some cases, provide proof of a negative test result) to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. At this time there is no statewide or county -wide mandate to get vaccinated and no \"passport\" is required, although some institutions such as the University of Hawaii may require people be up to date with their COVID -10 vaccinations in order to come to class in person , while State of Hawaii and county -level employees are required to get vaccinated or present a negative test result on a regular basis. Some counties are also requiring vaccination or proof a negative test for some employees and customers. Detailed information can be found below. State -level mandates On August 5, 2021, Governor Ige announced that all state and county employees in Hawaii must provide their vaccination status to their department, office, or agency by August 16, 2021. Those employees who cannot provide proof of vaccination will b e subject to regular COVID -19 testing. Employees will be responsible for covering the cost of testing, but they may also obtain testing from free testing sites to meet this requirement.

HDOH no longer provides clearance letters to inform your employer, school, etc., that you have successfully completed your isolation or quarantine and are able to return to work, study, etc. If I am working with COVID -19 patients or I know of someone who has COVID -19, what can I do to protect and help reduce stigma for that person? There are several things you can do to protect individuals and reduce stigma: Maintain privacy and confidentiali ty of those seeking healthcare and those who may be part of any contact investigation or other services (e.g., wraparound services) related to the COVID -19 outbreak. Raise awareness of COVID -19 while showing empathy for people's concerns and fears. Counte r myths and rumors by sharing accurate information about how the virus spreads. Speak out against negative behaviors, including negative statements on social media about groups of people, or exclusion of people who pose no risk from regular activities. Share with others the need for social support for people who have experienced stigma, who have returned from an area with ongoing spread, or who are worried about friends or relatives in affected areas. When there are cases in Hawaii, how are they isolated? What are the procedures and protocols , including for visitors to Hawaii ? HDOH coordinates closely with Hawaii's healthcare facilities to ensure any clinic, hospital, or other healthcare setting is ready to care for a person infected or potentially infected with COVID -19 with appropriate isolation precautions. Cases not needing hospitalization will be subject to at-home isolation with close monitoring by public health authorities and ready access to medical care. Tourists and other non -residents of Hawaii who have tested positive for the virus causing COVID -19 can call 1 -800-GO-HAWAII (1 -800-464-2924) to receive a list of hotels that are willing to take in individuals who are infected with COVID -19. It is the respo nsibility of the individual to pay for the hotel room and any other additional expenses related to staying at the hotel (including transportation, food, medication, etc.). What is self -monitoring? People with travel history to areas where there is widesp read community transmission but who have no symptoms of COVID -19 may be asked to stay home or in their hotel room and self - monitor for 10 days and check themselves for symptoms of COVID -19 (sometimes called \"self - quarantine\") . If they develop a fever , coug h, or other symptoms of COVID -19, they should call their healthcare provider for guidance and tell them about their symptoms and travel history.

What is HDOH doing to monitor the situation with COVID -19? Vigilance and monitoring HDOH is actively working to detect potential cases of COVID -19 as early as possible by monitoring its disease surveillance systems to identify persons that require investigation and testing and are reviewing internal protocols to ensure proper management of cases. HDOH is working with its federal airport partners (U S Customs and Border Protections and CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine) who are performing enhanced screening to identify travelers from countries with widespread transmission of COVID - 19. Its disease investigation staff are actively monitoring these ind ividuals with daily phone calls to record their temperature and confirm that they are avoiding contact with the public. HDOH is in constant communication with the CDC, public health partners in other jurisdictions, and local legislators and state officials to ensure Hawaii is aware of new developments in the COVID -19 outbreak. Over the past 15 years HDOH has been developing and refining its respiratory disease surveillance systems following CDC guidelines. This system includes sentinel influenza - like illnes s surveillance sites, virologic surveillance, pneumonia and influenza associated mortality, and cluster/outbreak investigations. HDOH is monitoring these systems on a daily basis looking for changes that might indicate the presence of COVID -19 clusters. Preparation and Prevention HDOH is working with the medical community to issue Medical Advisories and Alerts and to ensure that hospitals and providers are following infection control recommendations and are prepared to detect and treat any patient with s ymptoms and travel history consistent with COVID -19. HDOH is communicating regularly with its local partners in the travel industry and schools to address their concerns and ensure the latest and most accurate guidance and information are being shared with their staff. What are hospitals in Hawaii doing about COVID -19? HDOH is sharing with and up dating infection control guidance to healthcare facilities to ensure hospitals and healthcare providers are prepared should they encounter a person potentially infected with COVID -19. Hospitals and healthcare providers, in turn, are reviewing their infecti on control policies and stepping up their ability to handle COVID -19 cases. Hospitals and HDOH are in regular communication with federal partners to ensure supplies of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers are adequate. Page 24 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 PREVENTION AND PROTECTION What measures are being done to prevent widespread transmission? Vaccinating as many people as possible against COVID -19 is the most important tool we have to prevent further spread of COVID -19. Federal, state, and local officials encourage everyone who is eligible to get the COVID -19 vaccine, which is widely available. Additionally, social distancing remains a key component of prevention. Across the country, many large events that attract multiple people, including sporting events, entertainment, etc., have been canceled or postponed. Even as the country \"reopens,\" e vent s that are encouraged to practice social distancing (i.e., having people at least six feet apart). In many areas, including Hawaii, school had been temporarily canceled. Starting in mid- and late March 2020 , Governor David Ige issued several directives and restrictions to promote social distancing and control COVID -19 in Hawaii , some of which are still in place . They include the following: Quarantining all travelers arriving in Hawaii , includ ing state residents, for 10 days. (See Is Hawaii quarantining travelers to our state who are arriving from elsewhere in the US? below for more information.) Encouraging only essential workers go to their jobs, while others work from home if possible. Limiting s ocial gatherings per CDC guidelines . Residents are asked to avoid any non -essential travel. Services and activities at places of worship are asked to worship remot ely and/or employ social distancing for in -person worship. High -risk individuals are asked to stay home and take additional precautionary measures. Visitors are asked to postpone their vacations to Hawaii for the time being . These measures continue to be in place with various degrees of restrictions . To learn more, visit the Governor's news page: governor.hawaii.gov/category/newsroom . The State of Hawaii has plans to gradually reopen the economy as conditions safely allow. The guidelines and other information can be found at this website : recoverynavigator.hawaii.gov . Reopening of businesses and resumption of activities are based on the businesses' ability to keep both employees and customers safe and to continue following social distancing guidelines. They must implement physical distancing requirements such as capacity limits and ensuring 6 feet or more between individuals using floor markings and signage. They should also limit in - person work when possible, reduce the number of high -touch surfaces and objects, and communicate health and safety protocols to all employees, customers, and visitors. In some businesses, proof of bei ng up to date with COVID -19 vaccinations or a negative COVID -19 test may be required.

How can I prevent the spread COVID -19? The best way to prevent transmission of any respiratory illness (including flu) is to follow everyday preventive actions: Get vaccinated for COVID -19 as soon as you are eligible. Make sure to follow through with the second dose (of Moderna or Pfizer) if required. Practice social distancing. o Keep at least six feet away from other people (about two arms' length), to keep droplets away from each other when speaking, coughing, or sne ezing . o Avoid groups of more than a few people (local restrictions may prevent you from meeting in larger groups). o Limit close contact with others outside your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces. o Avoid close contact with people inside your home wh o are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others. o Wearing a mask in public settings and when around people who don't like in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to do, is one of the most effect ive ways to prevent the spread of COVID -19. In Hawaii, at present, mask wearing is required even by people who are up to date with their COVID vaccinations when they are in indoor public settings and is recommended when in crowded outdoor settings . Get your flu shot. With current seasonal flu activity, it is likely there will be confusion as persons with flu will exhibit some of the same symptoms as COVID -19, such as fever and cough. We strongly recommend residents ages 6 months and older protect themsel ves against flu by receiving the seasonal flu vaccination. CDC now recommends that you can even get your flu shot at the same time that you get your COVID -19 vaccination (see: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/expect.html ) . Read more about the benefits of the flu shot at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine -benefits.htm . Page 26 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating or preparing food ; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol -based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick , including at your home. Stay home when you are sick . Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue; then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. You can learn more about safely and effectively cleaning and disinfe cting your home at this getting -sick/disinfecting -your -home.html . When out in public or around other people, wear a mask , particularly indoors and in crowded outdoor settings . Disinfect objects you will touch, like the cart or gasoline pump, using a disinfectant wipe. Use online services instead of shopping in person when possible to avoid contact with other people. Monitor your health daily. Be alert for symptoms of COVID -19. Follow directions by state and local authorities, as well as HDOH and CDC. What kind of alcohol is safe to have in hand sanitizer? The only forms of alcohol that can be safely used in hand sanitizer are isopropyl alcohol and ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol ). Some hand sanitizers have been found to contain methanol which is dangerous if absorbed through the skin and deadly if ingested. The F DA has warned that some alcohol -based hand sanitizers may have been contaminated with methanol during manufacture and have since been recalled . More information on this warning and the recall , as well as a list of affected products, can be found at this safety concerns for alcohol -based hand sanitizers? Although alcohol -based hand sanitizers are safe when used as directed, FDA provides several warnings: Hand sanitizer should never be ingested by mouth. FDA urges consumers not to drink any of these products. Some hand sanitizers do not contain a sufficient amount of ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to be effective. CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol -based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol. Beware of false or misleading claims (e.g., prolonged protection for up to 24 hours, or \"FDA -approved\") Be careful about hand sanitizers packaged to appear as drinks, candy, or liquor bottles, as their appearance could result in accidental ingestion, particularly by children who Page 27 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 may not understand the product's label. Small children are particularly at risk with these products since ingesting only a small amount of hand sanitizer may b e lethal in a small child. Should I delay other medical care due to COVID -19? How can I safely get medical care? No, you should not delay care that you need to manage medical conditions or to address new health issues. However, you should take precautions to avoid unnecessary contact: Talk to your doctor online using \"telehealth\" visits , by phone, or through email when possible. If you must visit in person, protect yourself and others with preventive measures. If you need emergency medical care, seek it im mediately. Make sure your children receive their vaccinations on time, so they continue to be protected from deadly vaccine -preventable diseases. Call your pediatrician's office to learn about the safety protocols they have in place. If possible, use drive -thru windows or curbside services, mail -order, or other delivery services to receive your medication. I am currently pregnant. What should I be aware of regarding COVID -19? Based on what is known at this time, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19 compared to non -pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID -19. Therefore, if you are pregnant , be careful to protect yourself and help reduce the sp read of the virus that causes COVID -19 by doing the following : Get vaccinated against COVID -19. The vaccines have been carefully studied for effectiveness and safety and they are considered safe for pr egnant and breastfeeding women. They have also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of serious illness, death, and other outcomes for both the pregnant person and their newborn.

You and your family should consult with your healthcare provider about whether to start or continue breastfeeding. Breastmilk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. It is not known if mothers with C OVID -19 can spread the virus to their babies in their breast milk, but limited data currently available suggests this is not likely. If you have COVID -19 and choose to breastfeed, take precautions to avoid spreading the virus to your infant: Get vaccinated against COVID -19. The vaccines have been carefully studied for effectiveness and safety and they are considered safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. You can learn more at this CDC page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html . Wash your hands before each feeding Wear a cloth face covering while breastfeeding. If you have COVID -19 and choose to express yo ur breast milk: Use a dedicated breast pump Wear a cloth face covering during expression Wash your hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and before expressing breast milk Follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use If possible, expressed breast milk should be fed to your baby by a healthy caregiver who does not have COVID -19, is not at high -risk for severe illness from COVID -19, and is living in the same home. You can find out more about how breastfeeding women can protect thems elves and their child from COVID -19 at CDC site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/need -extra - precautions/pregnancy -breastfeeding.htm l. Is there a vaccine for SARS -CoV-2 / COVID -19? Yes. The federal government has approved or authorized several vaccines for COVID -19. Even as people get vaccinated, it is important to continue practicing preventive measures, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, frequent hand washing, etc. Page 29 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 Does the flu shot provide any protection against COVID -19? The annual flu vaccin ation does not protect against COVID -19, but it is recommended for all persons age 6 months or older to protect against getting influenza ( \"the flu \"). CDC now recommends that you can even get your flu shot at the same time that you get your COVID -19 vaccin ation (see: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/expect.html ) . Read more about the benefits of the flu shot at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine - benefits.htm . Why should I get the flu shot if it doesn't protect against COVID -19? If more people get their annual flu shot, it can help everyone in the fight against the COVID -19 pandemic, while preventing the spread of flu which can be deadly to some people , particularly the very young, older people, and those who are immunocompromised. Symptoms of COVID -19 are similar to symptoms of influenza (\"the flu\"). Reducing the number of flu cases (by getting the flu shot) not only helps decrease the burden on healthcare providers and facilities, but having fewer patients with flu -like symptoms also makes it easier to detect those persons who might have COVID -19 infection. More importantly, the flu shot prevents you from getting flu and spreading it to others, especially very young people, elderly people, and those with compromised immune systems. For these people especially, flu can be severe or even lead t o death. A flu shot may also reduce your risk of severe illness if you do get the flu, and that may help you avoid flu -associated hospitalization. This will keep you healthy and help our clinics and hospitals avoid being overwhelmed during the COVID -19 pa ndemic. Will wearing a mask protect me from COVID -19? Why should I wear a mask? CDC recommends that all people who are not yet fully vaccinated wear cloth face coverings (frequently referred to as \"masks\") in public settings when around people not living in their household, especially when other social distancing measures (like staying 6 feet apart) are difficult to maintain. Because the variants can sometimes infect fully vaccinated people , they are also recommended to wear masks in indoor public settings and in crowded outdoor settings. In Hawaii, at present, mask wearing is required even by those who are up to date with their COVID -19 vaccinations when in public indoor settings and is recommended in cro wded outdoor settings. Masks, worn over both the nose and mouth, are a simple but very effective way to reduce the spread of COVID -19 when they are widely used by people in public settings (including on public transportation) . Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent our respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. Page 30 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 Guidance to wear masks is based on what is known about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID -19, as well as emerging evidence about how well face coverings can reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID -19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so using masks to block respiratory droplets is especially important where people are close to each other or where maintaining social distancing is difficult , such as indoor settings or crowded outdoor settings. Whether you should wear a surgical mask, an N95 respirator (\"N95 mask\") , or a cloth facial covering (\"cloth mask\") depends on your situation: If you are sick , wearing a face mask can help prevent others from being infected by the droplets from when you cough, sneeze, or even talk . If you are a healthcare worker or are around COVID -19 patients , surgical masks or N95 respirators, used with other PPE (personal protective equipment), can help prevent infection and spread of COVID -19. For healthy or well people not in a healthcare settin g, wearing a surgical face mask or N95 respirator is not recommended to prevent infection. However, CDC advises that cloth facial coverings provide significant protection against spread and recommends people wear them in settings where social distancing is difficult . o Because of shortages of surgical masks and N95 respirators in healthcare settings, which are \"critical supplies\" during the pandemic, at this time it is important to save those for healthcare workers. o The guidance to wear cloth fa ce coverings (\"masks\") is because of evidence that some people who appear to be well may be infected with the coronavirus causing COVID -19 but are asymptomatic (having no symptoms) or pre - symptomatic (they haven't yet developed symptoms). This means that t he virus can spread between people (through speaking, coughing, or sneezing) interacting in close proximity even if they don't have symptoms of COVID -19. o Cloth masks can be made out of handkerchiefs, scarfs, and other cloth items. o Local regulations and some businesses may require use of cloth facial coverings. Am I required to wear a mask despite CDC's announcement that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks or practice social distancing ? On May 13, 2021, CDC had provided updated guidance saying that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or practice social distancing in any setting (indoors or outdoors), except where required by federal, state, lo cal, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. However, in July 2021 studies showing that the Delta variant could spread very quickly even among some fully vaccinated people caused CDC to change its recommendations. Now even those who are up to date with their COVID vaccinations are recommended to wear masks in indoor public settings and in crowded outdoor settings. The State of Hawaii continues to require all fully vaccinated people in the state to wear masks and practice social distancing Page 31 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 when around other people in indoor public settings, just as those who are not fully vaccinated are required to do. Effective May 25, 2021, masks are not required of anyone outdoors, regardless of vaccination st atus, but they are recommended in crowded outdoor settings. Please refer to county websites for more information about rules and laws that may pertain to wearing masks in public. What other things should I know about wearing a cloth face covering (\"mask\") ? Important things to consider about wearing a cloth face covering: Wash your hands before putting on your face covering. Put your face covering over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin. Make sure you can breathe easily while wearing the face covering. Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing your face covering and wash your hands immediately after removing it. Wash your cloth face covering after using it . You can wash it with regular laundry, using the warmest wat er appropriate for the cloth and drying it completely afterward. When drying it, use the highest heat setting and leave it in the dryer until completely dry. If air drying, lay it flat \u2014 in direct sunlight in possible \u2014 until it completely dries. Try to fi t your face covering snugly against the sides of your face. o Gaps can let air with droplets leak in and out around the edges of the mask. If the mask has a good fit, you will feel warm air come through the front of the mask and may be able to see the mask material move in and out with each breath. o Pick a mask with more than one layer to keep other people's respiratory droplets from getting inside your mask and to keep more of your respiratory droplets from getting outside your mask. o If you do not have a mas k with layers, consider wearing a disposable mask underneath a cloth mask. Wear the second mask so that it pushes the edges of the inner mask against your face. o Do not combine two disposable masks, since this generally does not help make the fit tighter. o If you are using a KN95 mask, you do not need to use a second mask. Although masks can provide protection from droplets that contain the virus , it is important to remember that wearing a mask is just one of the critical preventive measures we have to prevent the spread of COVID -19. You should get vaccinated and also practice social distancing, wash your hands (especially before touching your face, nose, or mouth), cover your nose and mouth with your elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, limit your contact with sick people , and stay home if you are sick. CDC's guidance on wearing cloth masks or other fa cial coverings can be found here: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/your -health/effective -masks.html Page 32 General Dr. Jerome Andrews demonstrates how to mak e a homemade cloth mask with household items: youtu.be/tPx1yqvJgf4 . Another helpful video on tightening masks can be found here: youtu.be/UANi8Cc71A0 . What is an N9 5 respirator? How is it different from a surgical mask? N95 respirators (sometimes call \"N95 masks\") are tight -fitting protective device s that cover the face and can filter out 95% of airborne particles, including droplets. They require fit testing to insure a proper seal on the user's face. Surgical mask s (also called \"face masks\") are looser fitting than N95 respirators, so they do not p rovide an effective barrier against particles. However, they can provide significant protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. You can find more information about N95 respirators and surgical masks at this CDC page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/respirator -use-faq.html . Is it necessary to wear two masks? In February 2021 , CDC began recommend ing that masks may provide more protection if the masks are layered or if users \"double mask\" by using a medical mask underneath a cloth mask. This will improve fit and improve filtration, which will help keep droplets from spreading between people.

There is no evidence you can become infected with COVID -19 from a product imported from China. COVID -19 appears to be related to coronaviruses like SARS and MERS which do not survive long on surfaces. Instead, th ey are usually spread from person -to-person through respiratory droplets. What about animal products from China? CDC currently has no evidence that animals or animal products imported from China pose a risk for spreading COVID -19. Information will be updated as it becomes available. Is my pet at risk of getting COVID -19? Do animals in Hawaii have COVID -19? Although this coronavirus seems to have come from an animal source, it is now spreading from person -to-person. We are still learning about how COVI D-19 spreads , and there has been some evidence that a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, have been infected with the virus that causes COVID -19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID -19. To protect your pets, CDC suggests taking pre cautions similar to those you would take to protect yourself and family members: Do not let your pets interact with people or other animals outside your household. o Keep cats indoors , if possible , to prevent them from interacting with other animals or peopl e. o Walk dogs on a leash, staying at least 6 feet from other people and animals. o Avoid dog parks or other public places where a large number of people and dogs may gather. Talk to your veterinarian if you r pet gets sick or you are concerned about their hea lth. If you or someone in your household becomes infected with COVID -19, you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals just as you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sic k. Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding. Page 46 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them. Washing your hands after handling animals, their food, waste, or supplies is always a good idea. You can learn more about caring for pets during the COVID -19 pandemic at this CDC webpage: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/daily -life-coping/animals.html . If I think I or my family member has contracted COVID -19 but we have no health insurance due to a los t job or other situation, what should we do? Will we be turned away from a hospital? Hospitals in Hawaii do not turn away emergency cases, regardless of insurance coverage. However, any individual or family that has lost health coverage due to job loss or other circumstances is encouraged to contact federal and Hawaii state resources to obtain health insurance, such as the federal government's healthcare marketplace or Hawaii's Quest. You can find out about your eligibility for free or subsidized healthca re coverage by visiting www.healthcare.gov/connect or humanservices.hawaii.gov/mqd or by calling Quest at 1 -877- 628-5076. What is the correct name of t his outbreak's disease and the virus that causes it? Global experts on viruses have officially named the virus causing the outbreak \"SARS -CoV-2.\" This is an abbreviation of \" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2.\" After researching the new coronavirus, scientists determined it is closely related to the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. The virus that caused SARS is known as SARS -CoV, so this new coronavirus is called SARS -CoV-2. Although the virus is known as SARS -CoV-2, the illness it causes is now officially called COVID -19 (short for corona virus disease 2019). Shortly after the outbreak first started in Wuhan, China, the virus and illness were often referred to as \"2019 Novel Coronavirus,\" which was usually abbreviate d as \"2019 -nCoV.\" The name \"COVID like \"Wuhan Virus\" and \"Chinese Virus\" are not official or used by the medical or public health communities and are considered derogatory and in appropriate. What are coronaviruses? They are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, these animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. Human coronaviruses are also commo n throughout the world and can cause mild to moderate illness (for example, \"the common cold\"). Some coronaviruses that infect humans are known to cause severe illness, like the coronaviruses that cause MERS and SARS. Page 47 of 47 RETURN TO MENU version 01/1 9/2022 COVID -19 is a pneumonia -type illness caused by a new (or novel) coronavirus called SARS -CoV-2 that originated in Wuhan, China. It may have originated in animals, but it can now be spread from person -to-person . So is COVID -19 the same as SARS and MERS? No, they are different coronaviruses.

There are multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID -19 and more are expected to occur. Some v ariants may spread more easily or be more resistant to treatments and vaccines. CDC, WHO, and other public health organizations are constantly monitoring COVID -19 cases for new variants so we can be prepared.

Right now, CDC and public health exper ts are particularly concerned about the so -called Delta variant, which spreads much more quickly and easily than earlier strains of the coronaviruses and can cause more serious illness and death . The symptoms of the Delta variant are the same as earlier ve rsions of COVID -19. This is what you should know about the Delta variant: Getting vaccinated is the best protection against Delta and other known variants: o The COVID -19 vaccines authorized by the FDA protect against Delta and other known variants. o People who are fully vaccinated are much less likely to get infected, get very sick , or die from COVID -19, compared to people who are not vaccinated. o People who are fully vaccinated are less likely to spread COVID -19. o At this time, there is no n eed for a vaccine booster against the Delta variant . Unvaccinated people are more at risk of getting seriously ill or dying from the Delta variant of COVID -19 than earlier forms of COVID -19. Page 6 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 More young people are getting sick with Delta compared to earlier versions of COVID - 19. This makes it as important as ever that younger people also get vaccinated (children as young as 12 years old are able to be vaccinated at this time). Because the Delta variant spreads more easily and quickly, and because fully vacci nated people may also transmit it, everyone (including fully vaccinated people) should continue wearing masks in public indoor spaces and crowded outdoor settings. You can learn more about the Delta variant by visiting this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/variants/delta -variant.html . What are \"breakthrough\" cases? In some cases, people who are fully vaccinated (i.e., more than two weeks have passed since they received all their vaccine doses) have become infected with the COVID -19, especially the Delta variant. Getting COVID -19 even though you are fully vaccinated is known as a \"breakthrough infection,\" although the risk of severe illness and death are much lower than for unvaccinated people. Fully vaccinated people can also spread the infection to other people, but it appears they are infectious for a shorter time th an unvaccinated people. However, breakthrough infections are uncommon, and fully vaccinated people who become infected have far lower risk of getting very sick from COVID -19 or dying compared to people who are unvaccinated. You can learn more about brea kthrough cases by visiting this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -19 spread? Although we have uncovered a lot about COVID -19, w e are still learning how the virus spreads. Although SARS -CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19) likely came from an animal source, it is now primarily spread from person -to-person. Some viruses ar e very contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. This virus spreads very easily and sustainably between people. Like m ost coronaviruses (including the common cold) , the virus causing COVID -19 spread s mainly through the tiny droplets prod uced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby and possibly be inhaled into the lungs. People infected with the virus causing COVID -19 can also spread the virus, even if they do not h ave symptoms of COVID -19, which makes this virus especially difficult to stop. At this time , our best research shows that COVID -19 is spread in the following ways: The virus causing COVID -19 spreads more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious. The Delta variant spreads much more easily and quickly than earlier versions of COVID -19. Page 7 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 It spreads most easily between people who are in close contact with o ne another (within about 6 feet) , especially indoors but even in crowded outdoor settings. The virus travels t hrough respiratory droplets produced , especially when an infected person coughs or sneezes, but possibly also when they talk, yell, or sing . These droplets can land in the mouth , nose , or eyes of someone nearby or possibly inhaled into the lungs. COVID -19 may spread like this even if the infected person is not showing symptoms (\"asymptomatic\") and does not know they are infected . There is evidence that a person can get COVID -19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose , or eyes; however, this is not thought to be a main way the virus spreads. Mother -to-child transmission during pregnancy seems to be rare , but after birth a newborn is susceptible to person -to-person spread through respiratory droplets . (Please see I am currently pregnant and Can I breastfeed my baby? in a later section to see how pregnant and breastfeeding mothers can protect their child.) At this time there is no evidence that the virus spreads through food. The risk of getting COVID -19 from food you cook yourself or from handling and consuming food from restaurants and takeout or drive -thru meals is thought to be very low. You can learn more about how COVID -19 spreads at -19 if they have no symptoms? Although the virus is usually spread from infected people who have symptoms of COVID -19 (\"symptomatic\"), we now know that people infected with the virus who have no symptoms (\"asymptomatic\") or who are not yet showing symptoms (\"pre -symptomatic\") can also spread the virus to other people . This is why it is important for people to wear face coverings in public or in close proximity to other people even if they think they are not infected. This includes people who are fully vaccinated, who should continue w earing face coverings indoors in public places and in crowded places outdoors. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT What are the symptoms of COVID -19? Patients with COVID -19 generally report mild symptoms to severe illness , usually 2 to 14 days after exposure . If you have these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or trouble breathing Page 8 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Muscle or body aches Fatigue Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Some patients may not report fever, especially the very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, and people taking certain fever -lowering medications. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. The above list does not inclu de all possible symptoms. This list will be updated as CDC and other researchers learn more. Are there emergency signs of COVID -19? What should I do if I have them? People who have COVID -19 or think they have COVID -19 should watch for emergency warning signs and seek emergency medical care immediately, by calling 911 or calling ahead to their local emergency facilit y (and notifying the operator that they are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID -19). These emergency warning signs inc lude the following: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face How long does it take for symptoms to appear? CDC believes the symptoms of COVID -19 may appear as early as 2 d ays after exposure and as long as 14 days after exposure. Are there complications from COVID -19? Many patients with COVID -19 develop pneumonia in both lungs. In a small percentage of cases, death occurs . Some people have developed long -term health conditions even after their COVID -19 infection has cleared. These include long -lasting conditions known as \"long COVID ,\" as well as Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS). You can learn more about them at the following CDC websites: \"Long COVID\": www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/long -term -effects.html MIS: of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Should I be tested for COVID -19 infection? You should call ahead to a healthcare provider to find out about getting tested for COVID -19 infection if one of the following is true: You are a close contact of a person with a laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 infection, whether you are symptomatic or asymptomatic . o This includes fully vaccinated people, who should get tested three to five days after their contact even if they have no symptoms . You have recently traveled outside Hawaii and have symptoms of COVID -19. You have symptoms of respiratory illness (such as cough or shortness of breath). People at higher risk for severe disease (older people, those with chronic medical conditions and immunosuppression) should also be prioritized for testing. They should contact a heal thcare provider who can help determine whether they should be tested for COVID -19. You can use the CDC's \"Viral Testing Tool\" to -ncov/testing/diagnostic -testing.html#who -should the CDC's \"Coronavirus Self -Checker\" to see if you should contact a healthcare provider: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/symptoms -testing/symptoms.html . People who have traveled to areas that have community spread of COVID -19, which includes much of the US Mainland as well as other co untries, should do the following: Monitor their health for 14 days after leaving those areas. Call their healthcare provider for guidance and tell them about their symptoms and travel history If they develop a fever or cough. People who have tested pos itive for COVID -19 but have recovered from their symptoms may continue to test positive for three months or more without being able to spread the virus to others. These people should get tested again only if they develop new symptoms of COVID -19. They shou ld speak with their healthcare provider about getting tested if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID -19 in the last 14 days. Is free testing for COVID -19 available in Hawaii? Yes. HDOH maintains a website that contains information on where to obtain a COVID -19 test, including locations that offer free testing. You can find the information at hawaiicovid19.c om/testing -isolation -quarantine . If I test negative, does that mean I cannot get COVID -19? No. A negative test means you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected , or that your sample was collected too early in your infection. You could also be exposed to COVID -19 before the test but the infection may be too low to detect at the time the test was performed. If you have symptoms later, you may need another test to determine if you are infected with COVID -19. Page 10 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 A negative viral test does not mean you cannot get infected or get sick later. Why is an \"official\" test result positive even though the test I took at home or elsewhere was negative? Some tests are more sensitive than others and may detect a COVID -19 case that a less sensitive test missed. For example, the PerkinElmer New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, used by Operation Expanded Testing, detects as low as 180 NDU/mL (NAAT detectable units per milliliter), while the test from Quest does not detect lower than 1,800 NDU/mL . What is a \"close contact\"? A close contact is someone who meets one of the following descriptions: They have been within 6 feet of a COVID -19-infected person for 15 minutes or longer. They have been directly in contact with a COVID -19-infected person's secretions (e.g., they were coughed on). Who is at greatest risk for severe illness from COVID -19? Those at higher risk include older adults and anyone with underlying health conditions, although people of all ages and healthy p eople are also at risk. Those in the following groups are most vulnerable to severe illness from COVID -19: Older adults o Risk goes up with age, although all ages have some risk. o The greatest risk for severe illness is among those aged 85 and older. People of any age with these conditions: o Cancer o Chronic kidney disease o COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) o Weakened immune system (immunocompromised) from organ transplant o Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher) o Serious heart conditions (e .g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies) o Sickle cell disease o Type -2 diabetes mellitus (formerly known as adult -onset diabetes) People with frequent institutional or organizational exposure to people with COVID -19 What other conditions can make you vulnerable for severe illness from COVID -19? Other conditions may put people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19, including children. These include the following: Asthma (moderate to severe) Cerebrovascular disease (a ffecting blood vessels and blood supply to the brain) Hypertension or high blood pressure Page 11 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Weakened immune system (immunocompromised) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening me dicines Neurologic conditions such as dementia Liver disease Pregnancy Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues) Smoking Vaping Thalassemia Type -1 diabetes mellitus Social determinants of health o Crowded housing, poor access to quality healthcare, lower income, incarceration, resident of long -term care facility, certain occupations People with underlying medical conditions are advised to keep their healthcare appointments, practice preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, fr equent hand -washing, wearing face coverings, etc.) , and make sure to have at least a 30 -day supply of prescription and non - prescription medicines. Are children affected by COVID -19 in any unique way? Although children are generally at much lower risk tha n older adults, there have been over 4,000 cases of a rare but serious condition associated with children and adolescents called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS -C). It can begin weeks after a child or adolescent is infected with the virus causing COVID -19, even in those who had not shown symptoms of COVID -19. As of August 27, 2021 , forty -one deaths are considered likely due to MIS-C. MIS-C has been described as inflammation across multiple body systems, potentia lly including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal organs. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, conjunctivitis, and fatigue. You can learn more about MIS -C at the following CDC page: www.cdc.gov/mis -c/cases . Are some ethnicities more likely to get coronavirus than others? No, viruses cannot target people from specific populations, ethnicities, or racial backgrounds. People who have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case are not at greater risk of acquiring and spreading this new virus than others. In particular, people of Chinese or other East Asian descent are not more likely to get or spread the coronavirus. There is increasing evidence, however, that certain racial and ethnic groups may be more adversely affected than other groups. This is largely due to inequities in social determinants of health, such as poverty and inadequate access to healthcare, that aff ect some groups worse Page 12 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 than others. Some groups are also disproportionately represented in essential work settings and thus at greater risk. Such groups may include Pacific Islanders and foreign -born individuals, as well as Black Americans, people of Hispan ic or Latino background, and Native Americans. What is the test for SARS -CoV-2 or COVID -19? Can any laboratory in Hawaii test for it? SARS -CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19) is detected through laboratory testing of respiratory specimens and serum (bl ood) . A viral test is looking for genetic material of the virus, which will be in your respiratory samples if you are currently infected . An antibody test (see below) looks for antibodies that might appear if you had a past infection. Healthcare providers who think their patients may have COVID -19 can work with HDOH to have their specimens tested. Testing can be performed at the Hawaii State Laboratories Division, at CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, and at some commercial labs. What is an antibody test? An antibody test (also referred to as a serology test or serologic test) is a blood test that can see if you have antibodies against a microorganism, such as the virus that causes COVID -19. (Antibodies are specific proteins your body makes in response to infections.) These are things you should know about antibody tests: An antibody test might determine if you have previously been exposed to that particular microorganism. According to CDC, it is possible that a positive test result means you have antibodies from an infection with another virus from the coronavirus family. An antibody test should not be used to find out if you have a current infection because it can take 1 to 3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. A viral test using samples from a person's respiratory system is needed to determine if they are currently infected. CDC does not know yet how well having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again or how long that protection might last. You can read more about antibody testing here: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/lab/serology -testing.html . I took a serological (blood) test that says I have antibodies for the virus that causes COVID -19. Does that mean I can stop quarantining or social distancing? No, if you have been ordered to quarantine, you must abide by the rules of your quarantine until the Department of Health tells you that you can stop. Scientists are still conducting studies on serologic testing for COVID -19 and it is not clear if the presence of antibodies found in these tests accurately indicate s immunity against COVID -19. How is COVID -19 treated? At this time, Remdesivir (Veklury) is the only antiv iral medication approved by FDA to treat COVID -19. There are no other antiviral treatments proven effective for COVID -19 at this time . Page 13 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home; they m ay receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. In severe cases, however, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. FDA has issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for a number of investigational monoclonal antibodies that c an attach to parts of the virus and may help the immune system recognize it and respond more effectively. These may be used for people at high risk of disease progression, but their effectiveness is not yet fully known. If used, they should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 10 days of symptom onset. Your healthcare provider will decide whether these investigational treatments are appropriate to treat your illness. You can read more about COVID -19 treatments at the medic ations intended for other purposes ? COVID -19 treatments should be prescribed by your healthcare provider. People have been seriously harmed or even died after taking products not approved for prevention or treatment of COVID -19, including products approved or prescribed for other medical pur poses such as hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin. Ivermectin, for example, is an antiparasitic medication approved for use in animals and humans to get rid of parasitic worms, head lice, and other parasites. Ivermectin is not an antiviral medication and has not been conclusively found to prevent or treat COVID -19 infection. Using a medication like ivermectin without the oversight of a healthcare provider to prevent or treat COVID -19 can be very dangerous, especially if a large dose is used or if it is mixed with other medications, like blood thinners. Overdosing on ivermectin can lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension), problems with balance (ataxia), seizures, coma, and death. Using ivermectin prescribed for animals is especially risky because they may contain substances tested for use in animals but not in humans. Getting vaccinated against COVID -19 with one of the approved vaccines available is by far the best way to prevent infection, serious illness, and death. You can read more about the risks of using ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID -19 by going 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 How long is a person with COVID -19 infection contagious? When can they be around others? CDC and others continue to study available data to better understand this. Very likely, as with other coronaviruses, a person is infectious as long as they are ill. However, we continue to monitor the situation to update the information. Generally, if you have COVID -19, you can b e around others in the following situations: You can be around others after you receive two negative test results in a row, at least 24 hours apart from each other. If you think or know you had COVID -19 and you had symptoms, then after all of the followin g: o 3 days with no fever o Symptoms improved o 10 days since symptoms first appeared If you tested positive for COVID -19 but had no symptoms: o 10 days after your test if you continue to have no symptoms o If you develop symptoms after testing positive, follow the guidance above for If you think or know you had COVID -19, and you had symptoms SITUATION IN HAWAII AND THE UNITED STATES How many cases of COVID -19 have there been in Hawaii? How many deaths? Hawaii has experience d nearly one hundred thousand cases and over seven hundred deaths. The latest numbers can be found at the HDOH website: health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019 . Am I at risk for COVID -19 in the United States? Yes, people across the country are at risk for COVID -19. Tens of m illions of people are confirmed to have been infected across the US, with over 600,000 deaths associated with COVID -19. Even with stay -at-home orders having been in place at different times across much of the United States since March 2020 and more than half the country having been fully vaccinated , CDC expects many more cases to be identified in the coming months . The latest updates are available at CDC's COVID -19 website and HDOH's COVID -19 website . For the general public who has not encountered someone with COVID -19, the immediate risk to their health from COVID -19 is considered low if they take preventive measures such as getting vaccinated against COVID -19, wearing masks when in public spaces (including public transportation) , practicing social distancing , and frequent hand washing, but as the outbreak continues , that risk can increase. In Hawaii, at present, mask wearing is required indoors even by fully vaccinated people. Mask wearing is not required outdoors by anyone (regardless of vaccination status) but is highly recommended when in large groups. Page 15 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 The following people are at increased risk: People in places where ongoing community spread is reported are at elevated risk of exposure People who have traveled to places with ongoing community spread Healthcare workers exposed to or caring for people with COVID -19 Family members or close household contacts caring for people with COVID -19 Older adults and people with underlyin g medical conditions who may experience more severe illness if they become infected No matter what the ir risk is, everyone is advised to get vaccinated, always wear masks in public when indoors (including public transportation) and outdoors when in large groups , practice \"social distancing \" to protect themselves and others , and frequently wash their hands . Public health authorities such as CDC and HDOH want everyone to be prepared for the likelihood that COVID -19 will continue t o spread widely in the United States for months to come . Is COVID -19 a danger in Hawaii? There have been close to one hundred thousand cases of COVID -19 in Hawaii , with hundreds of deaths . Many cases have been travel -related or contacts of people who have traveled , but a number have been a part of local clusters, such as parties or in care facilities . CDC is notified of all cases and close contacts of the cases are identified and informed of their exposure , a process called \"contact tracing.\" This is done through local contact tracers and disease investigators, using information from positive cases as well as location data. Federal , state, and local officials in Hawaii recognize the seriousness of the situation and work diligently with federal officials around the clock to prevent spread of COVID -19 within our state. HDOH is urging all residents to prepare for the likelihood that COVID -19 will continue to spread widely in our communities . HDOH wants the public to get vaccinated and to know and practice other important preventive measures, such as social distancing , use of cloth fac ial coverings (\"masks\") when in public settings indoors or around other people (including when using public transportation) or in crowded outdoor settings , and frequent handwashing with soap and water for 20 seconds or with alcohol -based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 percent alcohol) , to prevent spread of COVID -19. A short HDOH video demonstrating proper hand -washing technique can be found at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2r2iqbEM5s . Regardless of how widespread COVID -19 becomes in Hawaii, our access to certain resources could still be impacted by this outbreak. Hawaii residents should make sure they and their household are prepared with a family emergency kit that lasts at least 14 days , in case a family member is quarantined or if there is a shortage of certain goods, such as medicine and food, in the event of a continuing pandemic. However, residents are reminded that hoarding goods may adversely affect other members of our island community. You can learn more about preparing a family emergency kit at health.hawaii.gov/prepare/protect -your -family . HDOH is continually updating information as the situation evolves and federal guidance changes. We urge everyone to learn about COVID -19 by staying informed with credible sources, Page 16 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 such as CDC's website and HDOH's two websites www.hawaiicovid19.com and health.hawa ii.gov/covid19 . What would happen if widespread person -to-person transmission continues in Hawaii or elsewhere in the United States? What is the reason we are trying hard to prevent this? While proactively carrying out prevention measures may slow the spread of COVID -19, it is important to be prepared for the possibility that it will continue to be widespread in Hawaii. If there is widespread transmission of COVID -19 in a particular area , there would be large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time , overwhelming hospitals and healthcare providers and public health, with elevated rates of hospitalization , severe illness, long -term health problems and death. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and the transportation industry may also be affected. At this time, many people are still not yet vaccinated against COVID -19 and few medications approved to treat it , so in order t o prevent or reduce person -to-person transmission, Hawaii and other states have issued stay -at-home orders asking people to shelter in place for at least several weeks or restrict thei r activities at other times . (See What measures are being done to prevent widespread transmission? below.) Does HDOH tell us where there is a confirmed case in Hawaii and where the case is located? HDOH inform s the public whenever there are new confirmed cases. A map of the areas where there have been cases can be found at confirmed cases , deaths, or persons under investigation? HDOH protects the privacy of persons and their households and does not release names or other information that could be used to identify a person infected with COVID -19, someone who has died, or someone under quarantine. HDOH may release information about the number of people infected based on county or ZIP code. At the same time, those who may have been exposed have a right to know and to protect themselves. When HDOH identifies a potential case of COVID -19, a detailed investigation is performed that includes tracing and contacting all close contacts of that person during the time that they were infectious. Since the virus is spread by prolonged close contact, people who have briefly been in the same indoor environment or had brief interactions are not considered to be at risk for infection. What are the differences between \"isolation\" and \"quarantine\"? Isolation and quarantine are two important tools for protecting the public during the COVID -19 pandemic. Although some people use the terms interchangeably, they mean different things. Page 17 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Isolation Isolation separates sick people from people who are not sick. People who are in isolation must stay home . In the home, anyone who is sick should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific \"sick\" bedroom or space and using a different bathro om. The sick person should wear a face covering if they are in contact with others. Quarantine Quarantine separates someone who has been in contact with a person with COVID -19 from other people, in case they have been infected and become sick, to prevent spread. Quarantine can be at a facility or in one's home (which is often called \"self -quaratine\"). People who are in self -quarantine must stay at home . People in self -quarantine must separate themselves from household members as much as possible. People in self-quarantine should monitor their health and wear a face covering (\"mask\") if they need to be in contact with others. A mandatory 10 -day quarantine is also currently required for travelers from out of state or other countries (\"trans -Pacific travelers\" ). Mandatory quarantine for travelers from Oahu to other islands (\"inter -island travelers\") is no longer required. Please see Is Hawaii quarantining travelers to our state who are arriving from elsewhere in th e US ? for more details on the mandatory 10 -day quarantine, and Are there exceptions or alternatives to the 10 -day quarantine for travelers to Hawaii? for more details on the pre-travel testing waiver. What is the guidance for home isolation and quarantine? People who have tested positive for COVID -19 and the people they have come in close contact with, both at home and outside the household, must take precautions to protect themselves and the community by preventing further spread of the coronavirus. This may include isolation, quarantine, and testing. Exception s are made for two groups of people, fully vaccinated people and those who have recovered from COVID -19 in the past 90 days: Fully vaccinated people (two weeks have passed since they receive d the second dose of Pfizer [Comirnaty] or Modern a or the single dose of Johnson & Johnson) : o Do not need to quarantine if they were fully vaccinated prior to first exposure, as long as they do not have sympto ms of COVID -19. Please see If I have been vaccinated, do I still have to quarantine or isolate... below for detail ed information. People who have recovered from COVID -19 in the past 90 days : o Do not need to quarantine or need to test, as long as they do not have symptoms of COVID -19. Please see If I have recently had COVID -19, do I still need to quarantine or isolate... below for detailed information. Page 18 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 o Immediately self -isolate if they develop symptoms and contact their healthcare provider. Person with COVID -19 (mild to moderate illness who is not severely immunocompromised) If you are a person with COVID -19, whether vaccinated or unvaccinat ed, you must stay in isolation until the following conditions have been met: At least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared and At least 24 hours have passed since your last fever without the use of fever -reducing medications and Your symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved. Person with COVID -19 who has no symptoms (asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic) Even if you d o not have any symptoms, if you have a positive COVID -19 laboratory test, you must stay in isolation until at least 10 days have passed since your first positive test for COVID - 19. Even fully vaccinated people should isolate if they test positive for COVID -19. If you develop symptoms after testing positive, follow the guidance above for \" Person with COVID -19.\" Person who is a close contact of someone with COVID -19 CDC recommend s that close contacts of someone with COVID -19 quarantine for 10 days , with important conditions and exceptions outlined below that can go as long as 14 days . Fully vaccinated person who is a contact of someone with COVID -19 Even if you are fully vaccinated, it is possible to be infected with COVID -19. If you have been ar ound someone with COVID -19, you should get tested three to five days after your exposure, even if you have no symptoms. During this time you should do the following: Wear a mask indoors in public for 14 days following exposure or until your test result is negative. Isolate for 10 days if your test result is positive. Self-monitor for symptoms of COVID -19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath). Unvaccinated p erson who is a household contact of someone with COVID -19 If you are in the same household of someone with COVID -19 and you have ongoing contact, you must stay home in quarantine until 10 days after the person with COVID -19 is released from isolation . An exception is made for people living or working in congregate settings (see below). During the quarantine you should do the following: Stay separate from others, especially people at higher risk for severe illness. Self-monitor for symptoms of COVID -19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath). If possible, check your temperature twice daily. If possible, stay at least 6 feet from other people and animals in your household. Even though quarantine may end after 10 days, c lose contacts within the same hous ehold should continue self -monitoring for symptoms and adhere to all Page 19 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 recommended prevention measures fo r a full 14 days (i.e., mask use indoors or in crowded settings , social distancing, frequent and thorough hand washing, avoiding crowds, thorough cleanin g and disinfecting of area around them, using adequate indoor ventilation) . If COVID -19 symptoms appear, quarantine should continue for 14 days. Close household contacts who have received all doses of an FDA -approved COVID -19 vaccine ( two for Pfizer or Moderna, one for Johnson & Johnson) are not required to quarantine if all of the following are true: o They received their second vaccine dose at least two weeks prior to the earliest date of COVI D-19 exposure. o They have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID -19 exposure. Unvaccinated p erson who is a non-household contact of someone with COVID -19 If you are a close contact of someone with COVID -19, but not from the same household, you must stay home in quarantine until 10 days after your last contact with the person with COVID -19. An exception is made for people living or working in congregate settings (see below). During this time you should do the following: Stay separate from others, especially people at higher risk for severe illness. Self-monitor for symptoms of COVID -19 (e.g. , fever, cough, shortness of breath). If possible, check your temperature twice daily. If possible, stay at least 6 feet from other people and animals in your household. Even though quarantine may end after 10 days, n on-household c lose contacts should continue self -monitoring for symptoms and adhere to all recommended prevention measures for a full 14 days (i.e., mask use, social distancing, frequent and thorough hand washing, avoiding crowds, thorough cleaning and disinfecting of area a round them, using adequate indoor ventilation) . If COVID -19 symptoms appear, quarantine should continue for 14 days. Close contacts of a COVID -19 case who live or work in congregate settings must adhere to the original 10-day quarantine period. Congregate settings include, but are not limited to , the following: o Long -term care facilities o Group care homes o Assisted living facilities o Shelters o Military recruit housing o Residence halls (dormitories) Non-household close contacts who have received all doses of an FDA -approved COVID -19 vaccine ( two for Pfizer or Moderna, one for Johnson & Johnson) are not required to quarantine if all of the following are true: o They received their second vaccine dose at least two weeks prior to the earliest date of COVID -19 exposure. Page 20 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 o They have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID -19 exposure. Unvaccinated p erson who is a contact of a contact of someone with COVID -19 A contact of a contact is someone who has not come in close contact with a COVID -19 case but has come in close contact with someone who is a close contact with a COVID -19 case. Examples of this include the following: Co-workers of household contacts Spouse, children, household members, and co -workers of non-household contacts If the household/non -household contacts are not symptomatic, then the contacts of contacts who are healthy are not required to be in quarantine. That means they may leave the household as long as they follow recommendations for social distancing and face coverings. You can find more information on the isolation and quarantine guidelines at the following webpage: health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/files/2020/04/What -To-Do-If-You-Test - Positive -For-COVID19_040120.pdf . If I have been vaccinated, do I still have to quarantine or isolate if I am exposed to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID -19? Because of the more easily spreading Delta variant, guidance has chan ged for people who are fully vaccinated (i.e., at least 14 days has passed since their final vaccine dose). If you are full vaccinated and you've been around someone who has COVID -19, you should do the following: Get tested three to five days after your exposure, even if you have no symptoms . Wear a mask indoors in public for 14 days following exposure or until your test result is negative. Isolate for 10 days if your test result is positive . People who have been fully vaccinated for COVID -19 are not required to quarantine if they meet all of the following requirements: They have received all doses of an FDA -approved COVID -19 vaccine ( two for Pfizer or Moderna, one for Johnson & Johnson) . They h ave received their second vaccine dose at least two weeks prior to the earliest date of COVID -19 exposure. They have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID -19 exposure. They are not a resident o r inpatient in a healthcare setting or a congregative c are setting (e.g., nursing home, care home, etc.). NOTE: Even if you have been fully vaccinated, if you experience symptoms of COVID -19 within 14 days of exposure you should contact your healthcare provider for evaluation and possible testing for COVID -19. Page 21 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 If I have recently recovered from COVID -19, do I still have to quarantine or isolate if I am exposed to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID -19? If you have recovered from COVID -19 in the last 90 days and you have been around someone who has COVID -19, you will not need to quarantine or be tested for COVID -19 as long as you do not have symptoms . However, you should watch for symptoms for 14 days after your last contact with the person with COVID -19. If you develop symptoms, you should immediately self -isolate and contact your healthcare provider . Are the State of Hawaii and county governments mandating \"vaccine passports\" or requiring people to be vaccinated? Is vaccination required for any kind of activity? Vaccination requirements are not new in the United States. They are typically required for attendance in public schools from elementary school and o n up to college, for example, as well as military service, and even some types of travel or immigration documents. As the pandemic continues, some private -sector establishments and government organizations may require their employees , customers , or other m embers of the general public to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19 (or, in some cases, provide proof of a negative test result) to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. At this time there is no statewide or county -wide mandate to get vaccinated a nd no \"passport\" is required, although some institutions such as the University of Hawaii are requiring people be fully vaccinated in order to come to class in person , while State of Hawaii and county -level employees are required to get vaccinated or prese nt a negative test result on a regular basis. Some counties are also requiring vaccination or proof a negative test for some employees and customers. Detailed information can be found below. State -level mandates On August 5, 2021, Governor Ige announced that all state and county employees in Hawaii must provide their vaccination status to their department, office, or agency by August 16, 2021. Those employees who cannot provide proof of vaccination will be subject to regular COVID -19 testing. Employees will be responsible for covering the cost of testing, but they may also obtain testing from free testing sites to meet this requirement. Location of these sites can be found at hawaiicovid19.com/testing -isolation -quarantine . You can read more County of Honolulu .

Page 23 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Can I get a \"clearance letter\" after my isolation or quarantine is over? HDOH no longer provides clearance letters to inform your employer, school, etc., that you have successfully completed your isolation or quarantine and are able to return to work, study, etc. If I am working with COVID -19 patients or I know of someone who has COVID -19, what can I do to protect and help reduce stigma for that person? There are several things you can do to protect individuals and reduce stigma: Maintain privacy and confidentiali ty of those seeking healthcare and those who may be part of any contact investigation or other services (e.g., wraparound services) related to the COVID -19 outbreak. Raise awareness of COVID -19 while showing empathy for people's concerns and fears. Counte r myths and rumors by sharing accurate information about how the virus spreads. Speak out against negative behaviors, including negative statements on social media about groups of people, or exclusion of people who pose no risk from regular activities. Share with others the need for social support for people who have experienced stigma, who have returned from an area with ongoing spread, or who are worried about friends or relatives in affected areas. When there are cases in Hawaii, how are they isolated? What are the procedures and protocols , including for visitors to Hawaii ? HDOH coordinates closely with Hawaii's healthcare facilities to ensure any clinic, hospital, or other healthcare setting is ready to care for a person infected or potentially infected with COVID -19 with appropriate isolation precautions. Cases not needing hospitalization will be subject to at-home isolation with close monitoring by public health authorities and ready access to medical care. Tourists and other non -residents of Hawaii who have tested positive for the virus causing COVID -19 can call 1 -800-GO-HAWAII (1 -800-464-2924) to receive a list of hotels that are willing to take in individuals who are infected with COVID -19. It is the respo nsibility of the individual to pay for the hotel room and any other additional expenses related to staying at the hotel (including transportation, food, medication, etc.). If I need to isolate but cannot safely do so at home, how I can use the \"isolation and quarantine hotel\" that I've heard about ? Temporary housing is provided in some cases for residents of Hawaii who feel they cannot safely self -quarantine or self -isolate at home, while they are waiting for COVID -19 test results or if they have tested p ositive for COVID -19. Because the Delta variant spreads so quickly, it is safest for most residents of Hawaii to isolate or quarantine at home while following CDC guidelines for avoiding transmission within the household, rather than waiting for isolatio n/quarantine space to become available. (People in Page 24 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 congregate housing situations are an exception to this and should seek assistance with isolation/quarantine.) You can learn how to safely isolate or quarantine at home by going to this CDC page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/if -you-are-sick/steps -when -sick.html . You can learn how to safely care for someone with COVID -19 who isolating in your home at this page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/if -you-are-sick/care -for-someone.html . If you are a Hawaii resident and you feel you need isolation/quarantine assistance, you can request assistance or a referral for this service by calling the Hawaii CARES call center at 808- 832-3100 . A representative will help you complete a referral form over the telephone. Referral does not guarantee placement in a hotel or other facility . Your form will be assessed by HDOH to determine eligibility before placement. You can also fill out an online form to request these services directly at bhhsurgprod.powerappsportals.us . What is self -monitoring? People with travel history to areas where there is widespread community transmission but who have no symptoms of COVID -19 may be asked to stay home or in their hotel room and self - monitor for 10 days and check themselves for symptoms of COVID -19 (sometimes called \"self - quarantine\") . If they develop a fever , cough, or other symptoms of COVID -19, they should call their healthcare provider for guidance and tell them about their symptoms and travel history. Go to this website for information about travel during COVID -19: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/travelers/index.html . What is HDOH doing to monitor the situation with COVID -19? Vigilance and monitoring HDOH is actively working to detect potential cases of COVID -19 as early as possible by monitoring its disease surveillance systems to identify persons that require investigation and testing and are reviewing internal protocols to ensure proper management of cases. HDOH is working with its federal airport partners (U S Customs and Border Protections and CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine) who are performing enhanced screening to identify travelers from countries with widespread transmission of COVID - 19. Its dis ease investigation staff are actively monitoring these individuals with daily phone calls to record their temperature and confirm that they are avoiding contact with the public. HDOH is in constant communication with the CDC, public health partners in othe r jurisdictions, and local legislators and state officials to ensure Hawaii is aware of new developments in the COVID -19 outbreak. Page 25 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Over the past 15 years HDOH has been developing and refining its respiratory disease surveillance systems following CDC guide lines. This system includes sentinel influenza - like illness surveillance sites, virologic surveillance, pneumonia and influenza associated mortality, and cluster/outbreak investigations. HDOH is monitoring these systems on a daily basis looking for change s that might indicate the presence of COVID -19 clusters. Preparation and Prevention HDOH is working with the medical community to issue Medical Advisories and Alerts and to ensure that hospitals and providers are following infection control recommendatio ns and are prepared to detect and treat any patient with symptoms and travel history consistent with COVID -19. HDOH is communicating regularly with its local partners in the travel industry and schools to address their concerns and ensure the latest and mo st accurate guidance and information are being shared with their staff. What are hospitals in Hawaii doing about COVID -19? HDOH is sharing with and updating infection control guidance to healthcare facilities to ensure hospitals and healthcare providers are prepared should they encounter a person potentially infected with COVID -19. Hospitals and healthcare providers, in turn, are reviewing their infection control policies and stepping up their ability to handle COVID -19 cases. Hospitals and HDOH are in regular communication with federal partners to ensure supplies of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers are adequate. PREVENTION AND PROTECTION What measures are being done to prevent widespread transmission? Vaccinating as many people as possible against COVID -19 is the most important tool we have to prevent further spread of COVID -19. Federal, state, and local officials encourage everyone who is eligible to get the COVID -19 vaccine, which is widely available. Additionally, social distancing remains a key component of prevention. Across the country, many large events that attract multiple people, including sporting events, entertainment, etc., have been canceled or postponed. Even as the country \"reopens,\" e vents that are en couraged to practice social distancing (i.e., having people at least six feet apart). In many areas, including Hawaii, school had been temporarily canceled. Starting in mid- and late March 2020 , Governor David Ige issued several directives and restrictions to promote social distancing and control COVID -19 in Hawaii , some of which are still in place . They include the following: Page 26 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Quarantining all travelers arriving in Hawaii , including state residents, for 10 days. (See Is Hawaii quarantining travelers to our state who are arriving from elsewhere in the US? below for more information.) Encouraging only essential workers go to their jobs, while others work from home if possible. Limiting s ocial gatherings per CDC guidelines . Residents are asked to avoid any non -essential travel. Services and activities at places of worship are asked to worship remotely and/or employ social distancing for in -person worship. High -risk individuals are asked to stay home and take additional precautionary measures. Visitors are asked to postpone their vacations to Hawaii for the time being . These measures continue to be in place with various degrees of restrictions . To learn more, visit the Governor's news page: governor.hawaii.gov/category/newsroom . The State of Hawaii has plans to gradually reopen the economy as conditions safely allow. The guidelines and other information can be found at this website: recoverynavigator.hawaii.gov . Reopening of businesses and resumption of activities are based on the businesses' ability to keep both employees and customers safe and to continue following social distancing guidelines. They must implement physical distancing requirements such as capacity limits and ensuring 6 feet or more between individuals using floor markings and signage. They sh ould also limit in - person work when possible, reduce the number of high -touch surfaces and objects, and communicate health and safety protocols to all employees, customers, and visitors. In some businesses, proof of being fully vaccinated or a negative COV ID-19 test may be required. Is there a lockdown on Oahu because of high numbers of cases? The City & County of Honolulu had a system of restrictions based on four tiers , with tier 1 being the most restrictive and tier 4 being less restrictive. However, on September 20, 2021, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi announced that the City & County of Honolulu was moving away from the tier system to a more flexible system of indo or and outdoor restrictions called the Safe Oahu Response Plan. Among the current limits are the following: Social gatherings are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Parks, beaches, trails, and camping are limited to 10 people indoors an d 25 people outdoors Outdoor sports without a permit are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Organized outdoor sports with a permit may have other gathering size limits Organized indoor sports are allowed with limits and at 50% capacity Pools are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Page 27 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Shooting and archery ranges are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Real estate services are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Car dealerships are limited to 10 pe ople indoors and 25 people outdoors Spiritual services are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Funerals are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Movie theaters are limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors Restauran ts are allowed at 50% capacity aand re limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors, with no mingling between tables Other details about this plan can be found at the following website: www.oneoahu.org/safe - oahu -response -plan .

How can I prevent the spread COVID -19? The best way to prevent transmission of any respiratory illness (including flu) is to follow everyday preventive actions: Get vaccinated for COVID -19 as soon as you are eligible. Make sure to follow through with the second dose (of Moderna or Pfizer) if required. Practice social distancing. o Keep at least six feet away from other people (about two arms' length), to keep drop lets away from each other when speaking, coughing, or sneezing . o Avoid groups of more than a few people (local restrictions may prevent you from meeting in larger groups). o Limit close contact with others outside your household in both indoor and outdoor sp aces. o Avoid close contact with people inside your home who are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others. o Wearing a mask in public settings and when around people who don't like in your household, especially when other social distancin g measures are difficult to do, is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID -19. In Hawaii, at present, mask wearing is required even by fully vaccinated people Page 28 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 when in indoor public settings and is recommended when in crowded outdoor settings . Get your flu shot. With current seasonal flu activity, it is likely there will be confusion as persons with flu will exhibit some of the same symptoms as COVID -19, such as fever and cough. We strongly recommend residents ages 6 months and older protect themselves against flu by receiving the seasonal flu vaccination. CDC now recommends that you can even get your flu shot at the same time that you get your COVID -19 vaccination (see: www.cdc.gov/coronavir us/2019 -ncov/vaccines/expect.html ) . Read more about the benefits of the flu shot at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine -benefits.htm . Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating or preparing food ; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol -based hand sanitizer with at least 60% a lcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick , including at your home. Stay home when you are sick . Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue; then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. You can learn more about safely and effectively cleaning and disinfecting your home at t his CDC site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/prevent - getting -sick/disinfecting -your -home.html . When out in public or around other people, wear a mask , particularly indoors and in crowded outdoor settings . Disinfect objects you will touch, like the cart or gasoline pump, using a disinfectant wipe. Use online services instead of shopping in person when possible to avoid contact with other people. Monitor your health daily. Be alert for symptoms of COVID -19. Follow directions by state and local authorities, as well as HDOH and CDC. What kind of alcohol is safe to have in hand sanitizer? The only forms of alcohol that can be safely used in hand sanitizer are isopropyl alcohol and ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol ). Some hand sanitizers have been found to contain methanol which is dangerous if absorbed through the skin and deadly if ingested. The F DA has warned that some alcohol -based hand sanitizers may have been contaminated with methanol during manufacture and have since been recalled . More information on this warning and the recall , as well as a list of affected products, can be found at this safety concerns for alcohol -based hand sanitizers? Although alcohol -based hand sanitizers are safe when used as directed, FDA provides several warnings: Page 29 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Hand sanitizer should never be ingested by mouth. FDA urges consumers not to drink any of these products. Some hand sanitizers do not contain a sufficient amount of ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to be effective. CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol -base d hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol. Beware of false or misleading claims (e.g., prolonged protection for up to 24 hours, or \"FDA -approved\") Be careful about hand sanitizers packaged to appear as drinks, candy, or liquor bottles, as their appearance could result in accidental ingestion, particularly by children who may not understand the product's label. Small children are particularly at risk with these products since ingesting only a small amount of hand sanitizer may be lethal in a small child. Should I delay other medical care due to COVID -19? How can I safely get medical care? No, you should not delay care that you need to manage medical conditions or to address new health issues. However, you should take precautions to avoid unnecessary contact: Talk to your doctor online using \"telehealth\" visits , by phone, or through email when possible. If you must visit in person, protect yourself and others with preventive measures. If you need emergency medical care, seek it immedi ately. Make sure your children receive their vaccinations on time, so they continue to be protected from deadly vaccine -preventable diseases. Call your pediatrician's office to learn about the safety protocols they have in place. If possible, use drive -thru windows or curbside services, mail -order, or other delivery services to receive your medication. I am currently pregnant. What should I be aware of regarding COVID -19? Based on what is known at this time, pregnant people are at an increased risk for sev ere illness from COVID -19 compared to non -pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID -19. Therefore, if you are pregnant, be careful to protect your self and help reduce the sp read of the virus that causes COVID -19 by doing the following : Get vaccinated against COVID -19. The vaccines have been carefully studied for effectiveness and safety and they are considered safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. They have also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of serious illness, death, and other outcomes for both the p regnant person and their newborn. You can learn more at this CDC page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html . Please also visit the question Is the COVID -19 vaccine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women? at HDOH's vaccine - related site: health.hawaii.gov/prepar e/files/2020/12/DOH_COVID - 19_FAQs_VACCINES.pdf .

You can find out more about how pregnant women can protect themselves and their child from COVID -19 at the following CDC site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 Can I breastfeed my baby? You and your family should consult with your healthcare provider about whether to start or continue breastfeeding. Breastmilk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. It is not known if mothers with C OVID -19 can spread the virus to their babies in their breast milk, but limited data currently available suggests this is not likely. If you have COVID -19 and choose to breastfeed, take precautions to avoid spreading the virus to your infant: Get vaccina ted against COVID -19. The vaccines have been carefully studied for effectiveness and safety and they are considered safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. You can learn more at this CDC page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html . Wash your hands before each feeding Wear a cloth face covering while breastfeeding. If you have COVID -19 and choose to express your breast milk: Use a dedicated breast pump Wear a cloth face covering during expression Wash your hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and before expressing breast milk Follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use If possible, exp ressed breast milk should be fed to your baby by a healthy caregiver who does not have COVID -19, is not at high -risk for severe illness from COVID -19, and is living in the same home.

Yes. The federal government has approved or authorized several vaccines for COVID -19. Groups of people most affected by COVID -19 got the vaccine first, starting in mid -December 2020 , but the general public from age 12 and older is now able to get them . Even as people get vaccinated, it is important to continue practicing preventive measures, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, frequent hand washing, etc. To find out more, see When will a COVID -19 vaccine be available in Hawaii? at our vaccine FAQ page: health.hawaii.gov/prepare/files/2020/12/DOH_COVID -19_FAQs_VAC CINES.pdf . Does the flu shot provide any protection against COVID -19? The annual flu vaccination does not protect against COVID -19, but it is recommended for all persons age 6 months or older to protect against getting influenza ( \"the flu \"). CDC now recommends that you can even get your flu shot at the same time that you get your COVID -19 vaccination (see: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/expect.html ) . Read more about the benefits of the flu shot at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine - benefits.htm . The coming flu season (2021 -22) may be more active than the previous flu season as COVID -19 protective measures, which also reduced the number of flu cases, are relaxed. Why should I get the flu shot if it doesn't protect against COVID -19? If more people get their annual flu shot, it can help everyone in the fight against the COVID -19 pandemic, while preventing the spread of flu which can be deadly to some people , particularly the very young, older people, and those who are immunocompromised. Symptoms of COVID -19 a re similar to symptoms of influenza (\"the flu\"). Reducing the number of flu cases (by getting the flu shot) not only helps decrease the burden on healthcare providers and facilities, but having fewer patients with flu -like symptoms also makes it easier to detect those persons who might have COVID -19 infection. More importantly, the flu shot prevents you from getting flu and spreading it to others, especially very young people, elderly people, and those with compromised immune systems. For these people esp ecially, flu can be severe or even lead to death. Page 32 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 A flu shot may also reduce your risk of severe illness if you do get the flu, and that may help you avoid flu -associated hospitalization. This will keep you healthy and help our clinics and hospitals avoid being overwhelmed during the COVID -19 pandemic. Will wearing a mask protect me from COVID -19? Why should I wear a mask? CDC recommends that all people who are not yet fully vaccinated wear cloth face coverings (frequently referred to as \"masks\") in public settings when around people not living in their household, especially when other social distancing measures (like staying 6 feet apart) are difficult to maintain. Because the Delta variant can sometimes infe ct fully vaccinated people , they are also recommended to wear masks in indoor public settings and in crowded outdoor settings. In Hawaii, at present, mask wearing is required even by fully vaccinated people when in public indoor settings and is recommended in crowded outdoor settings. Masks, worn over both the nose and mouth, are a simple but very effective way to reduce the spread of COVID -19 when they are widely used by people in public settings (including on public transportation) . Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent our respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. Guidance to wear masks is based on what is known about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID -19, as well as emerging evidence about how well face coverings can reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID -19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so using masks to block respiratory droplets is especially important where people are close to each other or where maintaining social distancing is difficult , such as indoor settings or crowded outdoor settings. Whether you should wear a surgical mask, an N95 respirator (\"N95 mask\") , or a cloth facial covering (\"cloth mask\") depends on your situation: If you are sick , wearing a face mask can help prevent others from being infected by the droplets from when you cough, sneeze, or even talk . If you are a healthcare worker or are around COVID -19 patients , surgical masks or N95 respirators, used with other PPE (personal pr otective equipment), can help prevent infection and spread of COVID -19. For healthy or well people not in a healthcare setting , wearing a surgical face mask or N95 respirator is not recommended to prevent infection. However, CDC advises that cloth facial coverings provide significant protection against spread and recommends people wear them in settings where social distancing is difficult . o Because of shortages of surgical masks and N95 respirators in healthcare settings, which are \"critical supplie s\" during the pandemic, at this time it is important to save those for healthcare workers. Page 33 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 o The guidance to wear cloth face coverings (\"masks\") is because of evidence that some people who appear to be well may be infected with the coronavirus causing COVID -19 but are asymptomatic (having no symptoms) or pre - symptomatic (they haven't yet developed symptoms). This means that the virus can spread between people (through speaking, coughing, or sneezi ng) interacting in close proximity even if they don't have symptoms of COVID -19. o Cloth masks can be made out of handkerchiefs, scarfs, and other cloth items. o Local regulations and some businesses may require use of cloth facial coverings. Am I required t o wear a mask despite CDC's announcement that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks or practice social distancing ? On May 13, 2021, CDC had provided updated guidance saying that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or practi ce social distancing in any setting (indoors or outdoors), except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. (A personal is considered \"fully vaccinated\" two weeks after the final dose of their vaccine, which is two shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines or one shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.) However, in July 2021 studies showing that the Delta variant could spread very quickly even among some full y vaccinated people caused CDC to change its recommendations. Now even fully vaccinated people are recommended to wear masks in indoor public settings and in crowded outdoor settings. The State of Hawaii continues to require all fully vaccinated people in the state to wear masks and practice social distancing when around other people in indoor public settings, just as those who are not fully vaccinated are required to do. Effective May 25, 2021, masks are not required of anyone outdoors, regardless of vaccination status, but they are recommended in crowded outdoor settings. What other things should I know about wearing a cloth face covering (\"mask\") ? Important things to consider about wearing a cloth face covering: Wash your hands before putting on your face covering. Put your face covering over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin. Make sure you can breathe easily while wearing the face covering. Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mo uth when removing your face covering and wash your hands immediately after removing it. Wash your cloth face covering after using it . You can wash it with regular laundry, using the warmest water appropriate for the cloth and drying it completely afterward . When drying it, use the highest heat setting and leave it in the dryer until completely dry. If air drying, lay it flat \u2014 in direct sunlight in possible \u2014 until it completely dries. Try to fit your face covering snugly against the sides of your face. o Gaps can let air with droplets leak in and out around the edges of the mask. If the mask has a good fit, you will feel warm air come through the front of the Page 34 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 mask and may be able to see the mask material move in and out with each breath. o Pick a mask with more than one layer to keep other people's respiratory droplets from getting inside your mask and to keep more of your respiratory droplets from getting outside your mask. o If you do not have a mask with layers, consider wearing a disposabl e mask underneath a cloth mask. Wear the second mask so that it pushes the edges of the inner mask against your face. o Do not combine two disposable masks, since this generally does not help make the fit tighter. o If you are using a KN95 mask, you do not ne ed to use a second mask. Although masks can provide protection from droplets that contain the virus , it is important to remember that wearing a mask is just one of the critical preventive measures we have to prevent the spread of COVID -19. You should get vaccinated and also practice social distancing, wash your hands (especially before touching your face, nose, or mouth), cover your nose and mouth with your elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, limit your contact with sick people , and stay home if you are sick. CDC's guidance on wearing cloth masks or other facial coverings can be General Dr. Jerome Andrews demonstrates how to make a homemade cloth mask with household items: youtu.be/tPx1yqvJgf4 . Another helpful video on tightening masks can be found here: youtu.be/UANi8Cc71A0 . What is an N95 respirator? How is it different from a surgical mask? N95 respirators (sometimes call \"N95 masks\") are tight -fitting protective device s that cover the face and can filter out 95% of airborne particles, including droplets. They require fit testing to insure a proper seal on the user's face. Surgical mask s (also called \"face masks\") are looser fitting than N95 respirators, so they do not p rovide an effective barrier against particles. However, they can provide significant protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. You can find more information about N95 respirators and surgical masks at this CDC page: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/respirator -use-faq.html . Is it necessary to wear two masks? In February 2021 , CDC began recommend ing that masks may provide more protection if the masks are layered or if users \"double mask\" by using a medical mask underneath a cloth mask. This will improve fit and improve filtration, which will help keep droplets Page 35 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 from spreading between people.

OTHER QUESTIONS Should I be worried about products imported from China? There is no evidence you can become infected with COVID -19 from a product imported from China. COVID -19 appears to be related to coronaviruses like SARS and MERS which do not survive long on surfaces. Instead, they are usually spread from person -to-person through respiratory droplets. What about animal products from China? CDC currently has no evidence that animals or animal products imported from China pose a risk for spreading COVID -19. Information will be updated as it beco mes available. Page 50 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 Is my pet at risk of getting COVID -19? Do animals in Hawaii have COVID -19? Although this coronavirus seems to have come from an animal source, it is now spreading from person -to-person. We are still learning about how COVID -19 spreads , and there has been some evidence that a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, have bee n infected with the virus that causes COVID -19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID -19. To protect your pets, CDC suggests taking precautions similar to those you would take to protect yourself and family members: Do not let your pets interac t with people or other animals outside your household. o Keep cats indoors , if possible , to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people. o Walk dogs on a leash, staying at least 6 feet from other people and animals. o Avoid dog parks or other publ ic places where a large number of people and dogs may gather. Talk to your veterinarian if you r pet gets sick or you are concerned about their health. If you or someone in your household becomes infected with COVID -19, you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals just as you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick. Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them. Washing your hands after handling animals, their food, waste, or supplies is always a good idea. You can learn more about caring for pets during the COVID -19 pandemic at this CDC webpage: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/daily -life-coping/animals.html . If I think I or my family member has contracted COVID -19 but we have no health insurance due to a lost job or other situation, what should we do? Will we be turned away from a hospital? Hosp itals in Hawaii do not turn away emergency cases, regardless of insurance coverage. However, any individual or family that has lost health coverage due to job loss or other circumstances is encouraged to contact federal and Hawaii state resources to obtain health insurance, such as the federal government's healthcare marketplace or Hawaii's Quest. You can find out about your eligibility for free or subsidized healthcare coverage by visiting www.healthcare. gov/connect or humanservices.hawaii.gov/mqd or by calling Quest at 1 -877- 628-5076.

What is the correct name of this outbreak's disease and the virus that causes it? Global experts on viruses have officially named the virus causing the outbreak \"SARS -CoV-2.\" This is an abbreviation of \" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2.\" After researching the new coronavirus, scientists determined it is closely related to the vi rus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. The virus that caused SARS is known as SARS -CoV, so this new coronavirus is called SARS -CoV-2. Although the virus is known as SARS -CoV-2, the illness it causes is now officially called COVID -19 (short f or corona virus disease 2019). Shortly after the outbreak first started in Wuhan, China, the virus and illness were often referred to as \"2019 Novel Coronavirus,\" which was usually Page 52 of 52 RETURN TO MENU version 11/10/202 1 abbreviated as \"2019 -nCoV.\" The name \"COVID -19\" officially replaced Names like \"Wuhan Virus\" and \"Chinese Virus\" are not official or used by the medical or public health communities and are considered derogatory and inappropriate. What are coronaviruses? They are common in many dif ferent species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, these animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. Human coronaviruses are also common throughout the world and can cause mild to moderate illness (for example, \"the common cold\"). Some coronaviruses that infect humans are known to cause severe illness, like the coronaviruses that cause MERS and SARS. COVID-19 is a pneumonia -type illness caused by a new (or novel) coronavirus called SARS -CoV-2 that originated in Wuhan, China. It may have originated in animals, but it can now be spread from person -to-person . So is COVID -19 the same as SARS and MERS? No, they are different coronaviruses.
