I am 40years old now. God has blessed me with 2 wonderful children. I gradually realized that I did not look the way I used even after having 2 kids.

This bothered me a lot and I visited my regular homoeopathic doctor and shared with him my concern and without wasting time, he advised me to check my thyroid hormones. I was detected with Hypothyroid and he prescribed homoeopathic medicines with advice on exercise and diet. Slowly and steadily, I started feeling better and once again was back to my normal self.
