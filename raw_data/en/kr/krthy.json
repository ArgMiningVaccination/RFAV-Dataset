Perhaps, like so many people, you're skeptical. Yet both clinical studies and empirical research indicate that people who find ways to connect to the world can experience positive physical, mental, and emotional outcomes. Such practices may even work wonders on their personal relationships. This SteamTherapy chakra AromaTherapy guide explains. AromaTherapy: mankind's first medecine AromaTherapy has been recognized for centuries as having potentially profound healing effects. It was mankind's first medicine, a holistic practice of caring for the body using botanical oils. Essential oils can help awaken and stimulate, or relax and promote better sleep. But what, you ask, has this to do with Eastern spiritual practices? Well, by considering the connection of AromaTherapy and the body's chakras, you can thoughtfully use [MrSteam Chakra Oils](http://www.mrsteam.com/chakra-oils), specifically formulated to affect the spiritual centers of your body. Chakras? What are chakras? According to Indian beliefs, the seven basic chakras are the centers in our bodies through which energy flows. The word \"chakra\" is derived from the Sanskrit for \"wheel\" or \"circle,\" and is often described as a spinning wheel of light. Chakras reside in what is called the subtle body, which overlays the physical body. Chakras originated as an ancient tradition developed by the Yoga Upanishads (600 BCE) and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (200 BCE). Together with Kundalini yoga, use of chakras in whole body awareness became an integral part of the Tantric tradition during the first millennium CE. [Recent Western traditions associate colors and physiomotional functions for each of the seven main chakras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra#/media/File:Chakras_map.svg). Sometimes one or more of the main chakras can be unbalanced, or the energies flowing through them may be blocked. This can be detrimental to us physically, mentally or emotionally. Because the chakras are closely connected to the endocrine system, using essential oils that may affect the body's hormonal balance or trigger a particular gland can help stimulate the chakra's energy flow and restore balance. Restore well-being and bodily balance to the seven body centers or chakras with the right aromas But what exactly are these seven body centers and how can AromaTherapy help them restore your sense of well-being and good bodily balance? | | 1st Chakra: Muladhara Color: Red Located at the perineum, or the base of the spine, the Root Chakra Muladhara is associated with the Earth element. Muladhara is said to be responsible for our fight-or-flight response when our well-being is threatened. When this chakra is in balance, it enhances our instinct for survival, while improving strength, courage, health, vigor and sexuality. If you feel sluggish or overwhelmed, your Muladhara may be out of whack. Breathe in the essence of Red Vitality to feel energized and ready to take on life's challenges. This Aroma contains Cedarwood, Lavender, Clove Bud, Ho Leaf, Rosewood, Patchouli, Copaiba Balsam and Frankincense. | | 2nd Chakra: Svadhistha - Color: Orange Located below the navel and corresponding with the sexual organs, the Svadhista Chakra provides passion, confidence, enthusiasm, striving and self-motivation. No wonder this chakra comes from the fire element! If you need to enhance your feelings of motivation and confidence, or want to indulge in some sensual activity, Invigorating Orange chakra oil may be exactly what you need. This Aroma contains Ylang Ylang, Atlas Cedarwood, Clary Sage, Mandarin Orange, | | 3rd Chakra: Manipura - Color: Yellow Located behind the stomach, the Manipura Chakra controls our metabolic and digestive systems, while tapping into issues of personal power, fear, anxiety, introversion, the forming of opinions, and more complex emotions. Physically, Manipura governs digestion; mentally personal power, intellect and communication; emotionally expansiveness; and spiritually, it helps us grow into our potential. Concerned with issues of growth - emotional, spiritual, or even physical? Contending with anxiety and issues that seem beyond your control? Infuse your shower or steambath with the essence of Yellow Awakening to balance your Manipura Chakra. This Aroma contains Clary Saga, Sweet Orange, Patchouli, Ylang Ylang, Cardamon, Peru Balsam and Nutmeg. | | 4th Chakra: Anahata - Color: Green Located in the thymus, the center of the chest, the Anahata Chakra manages complex emotions, compassion for others, tenderness, unconditional love, self-forgiveness, hope and healing. The thymus is part of the immune and endocrine systems, where T cells fend off disease, and may be blocked by stress. If you feel an illness coming on, are experiencing too much stress, or need to reconnect with your love and compassion for friends and family, infuse the steam with Mr.Steam Green Harmony chakra oil. This Aroma contains Rosewood, Litsea, Cubeba, Chakra: Vishuddha - Color: Blue The Vishuddha Chakra, located in the throat, is associated with self expression, creativity, inner peace, loyalty, and truth and is related to the element of ether. This chakra is parallel to the thyroid, which controls growth and maturation. Physically, Vishuddha rules communication; emotionally, independence; mentally, fluent thought; and spiritually, a sense of security. Finding your voice - through creativity and self expression - is often a significant challenge. If you're experiencing an artistic block, consider breathing in the celestial Blue chakra oil. This essential oil, which contains Atlas Cedar, Lime, Vetiver, Grapefruit, Clove Bud, Lavender, Copaiba Balsam, Ginger, Spearmint, Lemongrass and Allspice, might not only allow you to tap into your creative side, but also help you speak more calmly and eloquently. | | 6th Chakra: Ajna Color - Indigo Located in the center of the forehead, the Ajna Chakra, also known as the Third Eye Chakra, is linked to the pineal gland and originates from the light element. This gland produces the hormone melatonin, regulating sleep patterns, as well as dimethyltryptamine, the only known hallucinogen natural to the human body. Ajna helps us balance our higher and lower selves and trust our instincts and intuition. Mentally, Ajna deals with visual consciousness; emotionally, with clarity on an intuitive level. Do you need help seeing \"the big picture\" or feel like your intuition is failing you? Infuse the steam with Mystic Indigo to regain clarity and enhance psychic awareness. This Aroma contains Lavender, Tangerine, Cedarwood Virginia, Clary Sage, Peru Balsam, Tanacetum and Frankincense. | | 7th Chakra: Sahasrara - Color: Violet Located above the head, the Sahasrara or Crown Chakra is associated with spiritual connection, inner voice, transcendence of self, and bliss. Derived from the element of air, this chakra is the state of pure consciousness. Sahasrara's inner aspect releases karma, combining physicality with meditation, mental activity with universal consciousness and unity, and emotions with the state of being. Striving for transcendence? Seeking spirituality and personal bliss? Violet Nirvana chakra oil may help you attain nirvana. This Aroma contains Orange, Mandarin Orange, Lime, Lemon, Myrtle and Green Myrtle. Combine aroma with color in your steam shower for true SteamTherapy It has been noted that several life practices - such as yoga, meditation, as well as the use of AromaTherapy - are synergistic, more powerful in combination than when practiced separately.
