VOWELL , Special Master: On May 14, 2003, Timothy and Maria Dwyer [\"petitioners\"] filed a \"short form\" petition for compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-10, et seq .2 [the \"Vaccine Act\" or on behalf of their minor 1 Vaccine Rule 18(b) provides the parties 14 days to request redaction of any material \"(i) which is trade secret or commercial or financial information which is privileged and confidential, or (ii) which aremedical files and similar files, the disclosure of wh ich would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\" 42 U.S.C \u00a7 300aa12(d)(4)(B). Both parties have waived their right to request such redaction. See Petitioners' Notice to Waive the 14-Day Waiting Period, filed February 1, 2010; Respondent's Consent to Disclosure, filed January 13, 2010. Acco rdingly, this decision will be publically available upon filing. 2 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755. Hereinafter, for ease of citation, all \"\u00a7\" references to the Vaccine Act will be to the pertinent subparagraph of 42 U.S.C.\u00a7 300aa (2006). 1son, Colin Dwyer [\"Colin\"].3 Subsequently-filed documents have clarified the injury claimed as a pervasive developmental disorder [\"PDD\"],4 substantially caused by Colin's exposure to mercury in thimerosal-containing vaccines [\"TCVs\"]. See Petitioners' Post- Hearing Brief [\"Pet. Post-Hearing Br.\"] at 1. To be eligible for compensation under t he Vaccine Act, a petitioner must either demonstrate a Vaccine Table5 injury, to which a statutory presumption of causation attaches, or prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a vaccine listed on the Vaccine Table caused or significantly aggravated an injury. Althen v. Sec'y, HHS , 418 F.3d F.2d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The petitioners in this case do not c ontend that Colin suffered a \"Table\" injury. Therefore, in order to prevail, they mu st demonstrate by preponderant evidence: \"(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logicalsequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate te mporal relationship between vaccination and injury.\" Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278. See , 940 F.2d 1518, 1525 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Colin's case was heard as part of the la rgest omnibus proceeding in the history of the Vaccine Act. It was one of three te st cases on the second of two theories 6 of 3 See Autism General Order #1, dated July 3, 2002, Ex. A, available at http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/Autism+General+Order1.pdf [\"Autism Gen. Order#1\"], 2002 WL 31696785 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. July 3, 2002). By filing such a petition, the filers averredthat: (1) the vaccinee suffered from an autism spectrum disorder [\"ASD\"], or an autism-like disorder, thathad persisted for longer than six months; (2) the petition was filed within three years of onset of thatdisorder; and (3) a vaccine listed on the Vaccine Injury Table, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3, was the cause of thecondition. 4 Pervasive developmental disorders is the umbrella term used in the D IAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS (American Psychiatric Association, 4th ed. text revision 2000) [\"DSM-IV- TR\"] at 69 to identify what are often referred to as ASDs. The terms \"pervasive developmental disorder\" and \"autism spectrum disorder\" are used interchangeably. Section IV, below, explains these disorders in greater detail. 5 A \"Table\" injury is an injury listed on the Vacci ne Injury Table, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3, corresponding to the vaccine received within the time frame specified. 6 At one time, the Petitioners' Steering Committee [\"PSC\"] advanced three theories of causation, but subsequently reduced that to two after determining t hat the evidence in support of the third theory, that the measles component of the measles, mumps, rubella [\"MMR\"] vaccine causes some ASDs, wasencompassed in in the first theor y of causation [\"Theory 1\"]. The Theory 1 cases posited that a combination of TCVs and the measles component of the MMR vaccine causes ASDs.Decisions in the Theory 1 cases may be found at Cedillo v. Sec'y, HHS , No. 98-916V, 2009 12, Cl. 158 ( 2009), appeal docketed , 10-5004 Mstr. Feb. 12, aff'd, Fed. Cl. 473 (2009), appeal docketed , No. 09-5128 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 21, 2009); HHS No. 01-162V, 2009 (Fed. 2\"] oners in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding [\"OAP\"]. Theory 2 is that the mercury in TC Vs can cause at least some forms of ASD, and that it did so in the three Theory 2 test cases,7 including Colin's. After considering the record as a whol e, I find that petitioners have failed to establish by preponderant evidence that Colin 's condition was caused or significantly aggravated by TCVs. They failed to demonstr ate either that the mercury component of TCVs can cause ASD or that it did so in Colin's case. None of the causation hypotheses advanced were reliable as medical or scientific theories. In essence, petitioners propose effect s from mercury in TCVs that do not resemble mercury's known effects on the brai n, either behaviorally or at the cellular level. To prevail, they must show that the exquisitely small amounts of mercury in TCVs that reach the brain can produce devasta ting effects that far larger amounts experienced prenatally or postnat ally from other sources do not. In order to account for this dichotomy, they posit a group of childr en hypersensitive to mercury's effects, but the only evidence that these children are unus ually sensitive is the fact of their ASD itself. In an effort to render irrelevant the numerous epidemiological studies of ASD and TCVs that show no connection between the two, they contend that their children have a form of ASD involving regression that diffe rs from all other forms biologically and behaviorally. World-class experts in the field testified that the di stinctions they drew between forms of ASD were artificial, and that they had never heard of the \"clearly regressive\" form of autism about which petitioner s' epidemiologist testified. Finally, the causal mechanism petitioners proposed woul d produce, not ASD, but neuronal death, and eventually patient death as well. T he witnesses setting forth this improbable sequence of cause and effect were outclassed in every respect by the impressiveassembly of true experts in their respecti ve fields who testified on behalf of respondent. Therefore, I hold that petitioners have fa iled to establish their entitlement to compensation, and their petition is denied. A brief history of omnibus proceedings under the Vaccine Act is necessary to explain what constitutes the \"record as a whole\" 8 upon which this case was decided. That history is set forth in Section I, below. (2009). 7 The other Theory 2 cases are King v. Sec'y, HHS , 03-584V, and Mead \u00a7 13(a): \"Compensation shall be awarded...if the special master or court finds on the record as a whole....\" See also \u00a7 13(b)(1) (indicating that the court or special master shall consider the entire record in determining if petitioner is entitled to compensation). 3Section I. Omnibus Proceedings in Vaccine Act Cases. A. Historical Use of Omnibus Proceedings under the Vaccine Act. The Vaccine Act contains no provision for class action suits or omnibus proceedings.9 However, the Act does permit the consideration of evidence without regard to formal rules of evidence and encourages flexibility in procedures. See \u00a7 12(d)(2)(A)-(E). Certain provisions of the Vaccine Act and its legislative history indicate that Congress contemplated t hat the special masters would develop expertise in the complex medical and scientific issues involv ed in actual causation claims and would then apply this expertise to the resolution of other cases.10 Vaccine Rule 8(a) provides: \"The special master will determine the format for taking evidence and hearing argumentbased on the specific circumstances of each case and after consultation with theparties.\" See also Lampe v. Sec'y, HHS , 219 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hodges v. Sec'y, HHS , 9 F.3d 958, 961 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). The Court of Federal Claims has noted that \"instead of being passive reci pients of information, such as jurors, special masters are given an active role in determining the facts relevant to Vaccine Act petitions,\" and that \"the special masters hav e the expertise and experience to know the type of information that is most probative of a claim.\" Doe v. Sec'y, HHS , 76 Fed. Cl. 328, 338-39 (2007). The Federal Circuit has commented on the \"virtually unlimited\" scope of the special master's authority to i nquire into matters relevant to causation (Whitecotton v. Sec'y, HHS , 81 F.3d 1099, 1108 (Fed. Cir. 1996)), and the deference properly accorded to their fact-finding ( Munn v. Sec'y, HHS , 970 F.2d 863, 871 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). See also J. Weinstein, Improving Expert Testimony , 20 U. RICH. L. REV. 9 Omnibus proceedings bear some resemblance to multi- district litigation in federal district courts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 (2006). However, unlike multi-district litigation, the parties in an omnibus proceeding are not bound by the outcome of the test cases . See, e.g. , Autism Gen. Order #1at 6-7 (permitting petitioners to opt in or out of the O AP and to introduce their own evidence to prove their individual case). 10 See, e.g. , H.R. Rep. No. 101-386, at 516 (1989) (Conf. Rep.) (Report on the 1989 amendments stated that \"[t]he system is intended to allow the proceedings to be conducted in what has come to beknown as an 'inquisitorial' format, with the master conducting discovery (as needed), cross-examination (as needed), and investigation.\" ). For example, medical acronyms need not be explained anew to a special master who has heard such acronyms in numerous cases. Basic scientific evidence is oftencursorily addressed by the experts, with the expectation that the special master will ask questionsconcerning any matters not completely clear. Howeve r, special masters are not doctors; thus they do not \"diagnose\" petitioners. Although due process concerns preclude the wholesale importation of evidence adduced in one proceeding to another proceeding without the consent of the parties, in omnibusproceedings the parties consent to import evidence fr om the \"test case\" into other individual cases. Absent such consent, special masters advise the par ties when they intend to consider evidence derived from their own efforts, usually in the form of medica l journal articles, and permit the parties to comment on such evidence. Institute of Medicine [\"IOM\"] Reports, learned treatises, medical textbooks, medicaldictionaries, or handbooks explicating medical abbreviati ons or tests are often consulted and referenced in the body of an opinion without formal notice to the parties. See, e.g. , Stroud v. Sec'y, HHS , 113 F.3d 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (special masters may rely upon an IOM report that neither party filed as evidence). 4473, 494-95 (1986) (encouraging judges presiding over non-jury trials \"to become familiar with the scientific background by r eading about the issues and discussing them with the experts\" and noting that \"[t]he court owes an obligation to the parties, to society, and to itself to assist in obtaining the best possible answers to the scientific questions before it.\"). Because cases involving the same vaccine and injury often involve the same body of medical expertise, the Office of Special Masters [\"OSM\"] developed omnibus proceedings to answer the common question of whether a particular vaccine can causethe injury in question-the general causation questi on. The issue of whether it did so in a specific case can then be resolved more expeditiously, based on a ruling in anomnibus test case. 11 The proceedings in the OAP test cases have followed the \"test case\" format developed for conducting omnibus proceedings under the Vaccine Act. This formatinvolves hearing evidence and issuing an opinion in the context of a specific case orcases, then applying the evidence developed to other cases involving the same vaccineand the same or a similar injury. See, e.g. , Capizzano v. Sec'y, HHS Cl. Mstr. rev'd on other grounds , 440 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (hepatitis B vacci ne and rheumatoid arthritis). By the agreement of the parties, the evidence adduced in the omnibus proceeding is applied to other cases, along with any additional evidence adduced in those particular cases. Theparties are thus not bound by the results in the test case, only agreeing that the expert opinions and evidence forming the basis for those opinions may be considered in additional cases presenting the same theory of causation. This method has proven efficient in resolving similar cases by se ttlement or dismissal, based on the special master's analysis of the scientific evidence in the test case. B. The Omnibus Autism Proceeding. 1. Creation of the OAP.On July 3, 2002, Chief Special Master Golkiewicz issued Autism Gen. Order #1 to address issues arising from the unprecedent ed filing of more than 300 petitions for compensation in a six-month period, all alleging that vaccines caused a 11 For example, the common issue of whether Vaccine A can cause Disease X might be heard in the context of an individual case. If the special master determines that Disease X could, indeed, be caused by Vaccine A, the special master would al so attempt to determine under what circumstances causation could be established, what specific sy mptoms would be required, and when those symptoms must manifest in order to attribute the disease or in jury to the vaccine. The findings, issued in the context of deciding an individual case, would then provide gui dance to the parties in other cases involving that vaccine and injury. Such findings might result in settlement or withdrawal of many pending cases without the necessity of additional hearings. 5neurodevelopmental disorder known as autism or an ASD.12 Autism Gen. Order # 1 established the OAP to process efficiently and expeditiously the current ASD petitions as well as the large number of anticipat ed petitions presenting the same claims.13 Autism Gen. Order #1 and the OAP grew out of meetings with an informal advisory committee comprised of members of the petitioners' bar and legal and medical representatives of the respondent in Vaccine Act cases, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Autism Gen. Order #1 noted that the large number of petitions already filed, and the even larger number of anticipated petitions,14 would stretch both the court's resources and those of the bar. Petitioners acknowledged that their cases were not yet ready for adjudication, as they were seeking discovery and additional time for the completion of scientific studies to bolster their claims. Conducting such discovery in the context of an omnibus proc eeding, rather than in individual cases, was clearly a more efficient use of res ources of both the bar and the court. Autism Gen. Order # 1 established t he PSC to represent the interests of petitioners. Membership on the PSC was determined by the petitioners' bar, with two attorneys selected by the PSC to serve as \"lead counsel.\" The PSC has representedthe general interests of autism petitioners cont inuously since the inception of the OAP. However, counsel of record retained responsibility for all other aspects of their ownindividual cases, including keeping client s informed about the process, and obtaining medical records and other pertinent documents. 15 Those petitioners with ASD petitions pending in the Program at the time Autism Gen. Order # 1 was issued were permitted to \"opt in\" to the OAP, while retaining the right to \"opt out\" at any time and return thei r cases to active status for resolution on an individual basis. Relatively few petitioners hav e availed themselves of this opportunity. New petitions filed after the issuanc e of Gen. Order #1 used a \"short form\" 12 Autism and ASDs are discussed in some depth in Section IV. 13 The publicly accessible website, www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/omnibus-autism-proceeding, contains the OAP Master File (under the \"docket\" link), which includes orders, decisions, and periodic updatesissued by the special masters assigned to the autism docket. Most of petitioners' and respondent's filings,including general causation evidence, are posted on th is website. Beginning in June 2007, audio files and transcripts of the Theory 1 hearings were also posted on this website . The Theory 2 hearing transcripts and audio files are also posted, along with the expert reports. 14 Well over 5,000 such petitions have been filed, approximately 4,800 of which remain pending. See Autism Update, OAP Master File, filed October 9, 2009. Since the OAP was established, over 500 petitions have been resolved by decisions, voluntary dismi ssals, or involuntary dismissals of petitions filed outside the statute of limitations. 15 A few law firms represent substantial numbers of OAP petitioners, with three firms each representing more than 400 petitioners. Other attor neys represent only a few petitioners or even a single petitioner. 6petition format set forth in the order, as petiti oners did in this case. Autism Gen. Order #1 at 7. In a subsequent order, filed into t he OAP Master File on July 8, 2002, Chief Special Master Golkiewicz acknowledged respondent's concerns16 that the short form petitions would not permit evaluation of cases for the statutorily-required documentation,17 but found that the OAP procedures represented the most efficient method for handling the overwhelming number of cases.18 2. The OAP Discovery Process. The discovery process in the OAP was initially handled by Special Master George Hastings, to whom all the case s were once assigned. Based on a draft proposed by petitioners' representatives, Auti sm Gen. Order # 1 established a master schedule for resolving the ASD cases, which included a discovery period, followed by ahearing on the general issue of causation, wit hin two years of the OAP's inception. However, delays ensued. Although the master schedule anticipated completion of discovery and designation of petitioner s' experts by August 2003, followed by petitioners' experts' reports in Novem ber, 2003, those deadlines were subsumed by disputes arising in the discovery process. Most of the discovery issues were amicably resolved, but some remained contentious. Rulings were issued in some matters that could not be resolved by the parties. See, e.g. , Autism Update and Order, OAP Master File, filed September 24, 2003. 3. Preparations for Hearing the Test Cases.Autism Gen. Order #1 was written in contemplation of a \"general causation hearing\" in March, 2004. At the request of the petitioners, this hearing date was postponed. In a lengthy Ruling issued on August 11, 2005, Special Master Hastings summarized reasons for the delay in the or iginal timetable and addressed a government 16 In the Vaccine Rule 4 reports filed in response to short form petitions, respondent continued to object to the short form procedure. 17 Section 11(c) of the Vaccine Act requires the petition to be accompanied by certain documentary evidence, including records pertaini ng to the vaccination and subsequent treatment. See also Vaccine Rule 2(c), RCFC, Appendix B. 18 The PSC, counsel for respondent, and the OSM have developed and implemented a plan to supplement the short form petitions and to resolve ex peditiously those cases with jurisdictional or other defects. Approximately 200 cases per month are added to the process, which entails the filing of sufficient medical records to make a determination whether the case was timely filed and whether the vaccinee hasan ASD or similar condition. Further filings then ensue in those cases filed within the statute of limitations and properly assigned to the OAP. Once all the statutorily-mandated documents are filed, the remainingcases will be resolved, at least in part, by the causation evidence filed in the three Theory 1 test cases andthe King, Mead, and Dwyer Theory 2 test cases. Of course, in accordance with Autism Gen. Order # 1, petitioners may withdraw from the OAP at any time, and may present evidence of causation on their own. 7argument that he lacked the authority to delay the proc eedings longer than 420 days. Although he declined to force petitioners to try their cases before they were ready to do so, he set a January 31, 2006 deadline for ident ification of expert witnesses. After requesting and receiving an enlargement of this deadline, petitioners filed a list of 16 experts on February 14, 2006, and filed a curri culum vitae [\"CV\"] for each of those experts on March 22, 2006. On April 21, 2006, Special Master Hastings deferred the filing of expert reports until December 31, 2006. On July 18, 2006, the PSC filed a propos al for conduct of the general causation proceedings. The PSC proposed a new heari ng date in June, 2007, with the hearing conducted over a two-to-three-week period in which petitioners would present evidence regarding all theories of causation. T he PSC opposed consideration of any specific case. In September, 2006, Special Master Hastings adopted the PSC proposal for a three-week general causation hearing. He ordered petitioners to file expert reports by February 16, 2007, with respondent's expert reports to be filed 60 days later.19 At this point, it was still unclear whether the gener al causation issues would be considered alone or in the context of a test case. The plan to consider all theories of causation at a single hearing was later modified. As early as May, 2006, it appeared that the petitioners might request to bifurcate the general causation issue into two proceedings, one addressing whether the MMR vaccine could cause autism and the other addressing whether TCVs do so. See Autism Update, OAP Master File, filed May 16, 2006. On January 9, 2007, the PSC proposed hearing a single actual case to test the theory that a combination of the MMR vaccine and TCVs caused ASDs. Subsequent hearings to address two other theories, one in which TCVs alone were causal (Theory 2), and the other in which the MMRvaccine alone was causal (Theory 3) were planned. 20 The January 9, 2007 PSC filing also address ed an informal proposal by the court that involved detailing two additional specia l masters to hear the general causation question. The PSC opposed the proposal. Nevertheless, on January 11, 2007, Chief Special Master Golkiewicz assigned two additional special masters to the OAP docket. Special Master Campbell-Smith and I were t he two additional special masters assigned. See Notice Regarding Assignment of Autism Ca ses to Additional Special Masters, OAP 19 The many delays requested by petitioners to f ile their expert reports resulted in a highly compressed schedule in the final four months before the Cedillo hearing began. Until the petitioners' expert reports were actually filed on February 20, 2007, respondent did not know precisely what petitioners' theory (or theories) of MMR-TCV causat ion entailed. Thus, respondent's experts had a very tight time schedule in which to review petitioners' expert reports and the scientific and technical literature upon which they were based, and to prepare their own reports and supporting materials. 20 The PSC later determined that test cases involving Theory 3 would not be necessary because the evidence pertaining to this theory had been presented during the Theory 1 cases. See PSC Notice Re: Theory 3, OAP Master File, filed August 7, 2008; Autism Update, OAP Master File, filed September29, 2008. 8Master File, filed January 11, 2007 (setting forth the reasons for detailing two additional special masters). a. The Theory 1 Cases. The procedural history of the Theory 1 te st cases was addressed in some detail in my decision in Snyder v. Sec'y, HHS , No. 01-162V, 2009 WL 332044 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Feb. 12, 2009),21 and only matters subsequent to the decision denying compensation will be addressed here. Motions for review in all three Theory 1 testcases were filed with the Court of Federal Claims in March, 2009. In published orders, all three motions were denied. On July 24, 2009, Judge Wiese denied the motion forreview in Hazlehurst and affirmed the special master's decision. 88 Fed. Cl. 473 (2009). On August 6, 2009, Judge Wheeler denied the motion for review in Cedillo and affirmed the special master's decision. 89 Fed. Cl. 158 (2009). In both of these cases (Cedillo and Hazlehurst) , appeals were filed with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Those appeals remain pending. On August 11, 2009, Judge Sweeney deniedthe motion for review in Snyder and affirmed my decision. 88 Fed. Cl. 706 (2009). Petitioners in the Snyder case did not appeal Judge Sweeney's decision. b. The Theory 2 Cases. Once it became clear that the PSC desir ed a separate evidentiary hearing on the theory that TCVs cause ASDs, the special masters instructed the PSC to identify and present three cases by September 30, 2008. Autism Update, OAP Master File, filed March 14, 2007, at 5-6. On June 25, 2007, the PSC submitted a scheduling proposal that outlined a process for i dentifying potential Theory 2 test cases, submitting expert reports, and holding evidentiary hearings in January, 2008. The deadline for identifyingthe test cases and submitting expert reports was initially set for August 31, 2007. Petitioners submitted three general causation expert reports by September 4, 2007, and requested and received an enlargement of time to identify their test cases and file their case-specific expert reports, with a due date of November 19, 2007. Order Concerning Schedule for PSC's \"Second Theory\" of Causat ion, OAP Master File, filed September 27, 2007. The hearing date was postponed to May, 2008. Id. After further requests for delay, the PSC identified three Theory 2 test cases and filed case-specific expert reports in January, 2008. Autism Update, OAP Master File, filed January 17, 2008, at 2. Respondent f iled expert reports on February 25, 2008, and March 14, 2008. In early April, 2008, the PSC informed t he court that petitioners wished to add Dr. 21 Decisions in the other two Theory 1 test cases, Cedillo and Hazlehurst were issued simultaneously with Snyder . In each case, the special master found that the petitioners had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the MMR vaccine, in combination with TCVs, can cause ASDs. 9Marcel Kinsbourne as an expert witness.22 Respondent did not object, and Dr. Kinsbourne's expert report was filed on April 22, 2008-one mont h before the general causation hearing commenced. See Transcript [\"Tr.\"]23 at 2041-42. The hearing and the weeks preceding it contained a number of additional surprises in terms of late-breaking events. On April 3, 2008, the three special masters were informed that the petitioners in one of the three Theory 2 test cases wished to withdraw from the OAP and proceed on a di fferent theory of causation. Order Concerning Case Processing, OAP Master F ile, filed April 16, 2008, at 2. Special Master Hastings, Special Master Campbell- Smith, and I ordered the PSC to designate a replacement test case prior to the commenc ement of the Theory 2 general causation hearing on May 12, 2008. Id. The undetermined third test case was to be assigned to me. On May 5, 2008 (the week prior to the start of the general causation hearing), petitioners filed more than 200 medi cal journal articles in the King and Mead cases. Tr. at 242. Additionally, at the hearing itse lf, one of petitioners' experts, Dr. Deth, presented considerable testimony about matte rs not contained in his expert report, including a substantial amount of evidenc e concerning unpublished research conducted at his laboratory.24 Because the change in the third test case occurred so close to the commencement of the general causation heari ng in May, 2008, the new case could not be identified in time for specific causation evidence concerning it to be presented at the May, 2008 hearing. Thus, in addition to the general causation evidence applicable to allTheory 2 cases, only the specific c ausation evidence pertaining to the Mead and King cases was presented at the May 12-30, 2008 hearing. Autism Update, OAP Master File, April 23, 2008, at 4. See also Autism Update, OAP Master File, filed July 8, 2008, at 2. The PSC finally designated the Dwyer case as the third test case during an OAP status conference held on June 12, 2008. Au tism Update, OAP Master File, filed September 29, 2008, at 2. 22 During the status conference in which the addition of Dr. Kinsbourne to petitioners' witness list was discussed, petitioners' counsel represented that Dr. Kinsbourne had approached the PSC, indicating that he could proffer an opinion on causation. See Tr. at 2041, 2044-45 (respondent's counsel discussing this status conference). At the hearing, Dr. Kins bourne testified that petitioners' counsel approached him about testifying in the Theory 2 cases, and that he became involved in the cases around March, 2008,shortly before he wrote his expert report. Tr. at 846. 23 The general causation testimony was almost exclusively presented during the May, 2008 general causation hearing. For that reason, references to this general causation testimony are identified using the abbreviation \"Tr.\" References to testimony in the Dwyer hearing use the same designation, prefaced by the case name [ i.e., \"Dwyer Tr. at __\"]. 24 This evidence is discussed in much greater detail in Section VII below. 10Respondent filed expert reports on general causation prepared by Drs. Clarkson and Magos, but neither was available to te stify at the May, 2008 general causation proceeding. Initially, respondent intended to call Dr. Clarkson and Dr. Magos to testify at the July, 2008 hearing, and petitioners in tended to recall Dr. Aposhian (and possibly, Dr. Kinsbourne) at that time to offer r ebuttal testimony. Tr. at 2039-41, 2150-52 (bench ruling indicating that petitioners could reca ll witnesses at the July hearing, but their testimony would be strictly limited to r ebuttal of Drs. Clarkson and Magos). On June 12, 2008, respondent's counsel informed the court and petitioners that Drs. Magos and Clarkson would not be call ed to testify at the July hearing. See Order Modifying Schedule for PSC's \"Second Theory of Causation\" Cases, OAP Master File, filed June 17, 2008, at 1. Petitioners maintained that they should still have an opportunity to recall Dr. Aposhian at the July hearing to rebut the doctors' expert reports, as they were still part of the record. Id. Respondent subsequently sought and received permission to withdraw Drs. Clar kson's and Magos' expert reports from the record. Order Concerning Theory 2 General C ausation Rebuttal, OAP Master File, filed July 3, 2008, at 2. The Dwyer case was heard on July 21-22, 2008. Petitioners submitted a supplemental expert report by Dr. Aposhian on April 2, 2009. Respondent filed a responsive supplemental expert report by Dr . Brent on May 8, 2009. The evidentiary record in Dwyer was closed on August 27, 2009.25 C. Evidence Constituting the Record as a Whole. The evidence before me thus includes a ll of the evidence, less the medical records of the other children, in troduced before, during, and after the King/Mead hearing, as well as all of the evidence filed in the Dwye r case itself. By orders filed November 16, 2009 and March 1, 2010, I f iled compact discs containing certain evidence adduced in King and Mead into the record of this case. To avoid the confusion the multiple ex hibit numbers for the same scientific or technical journal occasionally engendered in t he Theory 1 cases, the parties in the Theory 2 cases were ordered to maintain re spective \"Master Lists\" of medical and 25 I delayed closing the evidentiary record in this case for several months after receiving Dr. Brent's supplemental report because petitioner s had indicated at the conclusion of the Dwyer hearing that they anticipated filing several soon-to-be-published studi es that were expected to enhance their causation claim. Dwyer Tr. at 298-99, 332. No additional studies were filed after July 6, 2009, when petitioners filed an updated version of their master list of scientific articles. See Order, dated March 1, 2010 (crossfiling these additional studies into this case). As of the date of this decision, petitioners have not requested that the evidentiary record be reopened to consider any additional studies. 11scientific literature.26 Although some articles appeared on both petitioners' master reference list [\"PML\"] and respondent's master reference list [\"RML\"], this process generally worked well, avoiding the repetit ive filing of documents in each case.27 A similar process was employed with regard to ex hibits used at trial, with each party's exhibits being identified as \"trial exhibits.\"28 For example, Petitioner s' Trial Exhibit [\"Pet. Tr. Ex.\"] 2, the slides accompanying Dr. Aposhian's testimony, have the same trial exhibit number in each of the three test cases.29 The expert reports were assigned different exhibit numbers or letters in each case.30 Throughout this opinion, I will use the exhibit numbers and letters assigned expert reports in Colin Dwyer's case,31 even if a witness referred to it by one of the exhibit designations from the Mead or King cases. Accuracy problems with the original transcripts filed resulted in numerous changes. The parties filed a joint stipulation agreeing on corrections, and more 26 In citing to these articles, I used the page number in the article itself, rather than page numbers assigned at the time of filing. I note that it appears respondent's latest master list chronicled 522 articles(filed July 11, 2008), but an article labeled RM L 523 was subsequently filed on October 7, 2008. Respondent also filed medical literature with exhibit letters after the institution of the master list practice(see Res. Exs. FF-II, filed May 27, 2009) that were not listed on her master list. 27 The fact that a particular medical journal article was filed by a particular party or by both parties does not constitute a party's endorsement of the ar ticle's premise or conclusions. Special masters customarily require that a copy of any articles di scussed (favorably or unfavorably) in an expert's report be filed with the report. A special master is not required to accept an expert report at face value ( see \u00a7 13(b)(1) (indicating that \"[a]ny such diagnosis, conclu sion, judgment, test result, report, or summary shall not be binding on the special master or court\")) and may thus explore the basis for the expert's conclusions by reading and evaluating materials cited in the report. See also Perreira v. Sec'y, HHS , 33 Sec'y, HHS , 3 F.3d 415, 417 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 28 At each hearing, some expert witnesses used slide presentations to aid the court in following key points of their testimony. Other documents were used in cross-examination or in rebuttal testimony. These exhibits were designated as trial exhibits and assigned consecutive exhibit numbers, preceded by the designation of the party offering the exhibit. 29 In Dwyer , counsel refiled the trial exhibits using master reference list numbers. To correspond more closely to the transcript, which included frequent references to the trial exhibit number and page ofthe slides, I will continue to identify petitioners' tria l exhibits by the numbers assigned during the hearings. 30 For example, Doctor Deth's expert report was Petitioners' Exhibit 23 in the King case, Petitioner's Exhibit 17 in the Mead case, and PML 713 in the instant case. During the general causation hearing, testimony concerning his report might have referred to either the King or the Mead exhibit number. 31 Petitioners also filed their general causation ex pert reports using master reference list numbers, rather than assigning the exhibits the next-in-order exhibit number in the Dwyer case. I will use the master reference number for the expert reports and CVs, as no other exhibit numbers were assigned to them inthis case. 12accurate transcripts were subsequently filed. All transcript references are to these corrected and revised transcripts. The evidentiary record32 in this case thus encompasses, inter alia , the transcripts of more than three weeks of testimony and accompanying trial exhibits, including that offered in the general causation hearing; over 1200 medical and scientific journal articles; 20 expert reports;33 supplemental expert reports filed by both parties post- hearing; the testimony of fact witnesse s on behalf of Colin; and Colin's medical and educational records. D. Expert Witnesses and Their Qualifications. In addition to presiding over and hearing all of the testimony in Colin's own case, I was present for all of the expert testim ony in the general causation hearing, and thus had the opportunity to see and hear all of t he witnesses whose testimony pertains to Colin Dwyer's case. My evaluation of the testimony and the qualifications of the witnesses offering that testimony is based, in part, on the factors the Supreme Court set forth in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , 509 U.S. 579 (1993) and Kuhmo Tire Co. v. Carmichael , 526 U.S. 137 (1999). Although the Feder al Rules of Evidence, upon which Daubert and Kuhmo Tire are based, do not apply in Vaccine Act cases, the Federal Circuit has approved the use of the Daubert factors as a framework for evaluating the reliability of expert testimony in Vaccine Act proceedings. Terran v. Sec'y, HHS , 41 Fed. Cl. 330, 336 (1998), aff'd, 195 F.3d 1302, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The relative disparity in qualificati ons is not determinative on the issue of causation. A qualified expert with lesser qua lifications may offer an opinion that, for a variety of reasons, is more persuasive than t hat of a more qualified expert testifying on behalf of an opposing party. It is, however, a factor to be considered in determining the weight to be given to an expert witness' opinion. Nevertheless, witness qualifications ar e an important, and a largely objective, 32 The Vaccine Act requires the special master to consider the record as a whole. See \u00a7 300aa-13(a): \"Compensation shall be awarded...if the special master or court finds on the record as awhole....\" See also \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1) (indicating that the court or special master shall consider the entire record in determining if petitioner is entitled to compensation). 33 I reviewed the case-specific report filed by Dr. Rust in the Mead case, as well as the case- specific reports filed by Dr. Mumper in the King and Mead cases for information relating to general causation, but such general causation evidence was otherwise included in their testimony, in Dr. Mumper's case-specific report in Colin's case, or in the evidence from other witnesses. I have thus notconsidered their reports in the other cases in arrivi ng at my decision in this case. Likewise, I have not considered the withdrawn reports from Drs. Magos and Clarkson, or evidence that relied upon their reports. 13basis upon which to assess and weigh expert opinions. In virtually every area of specialization in science and medicine about which testimony was offered, respondent's experts were far more qualified to opine than those of petitioners. Speaking generally, the qualifications of the experts proffer ed by respondent, the relationship of those qualifications to the subject matter of thei r testimony, and the quality of their testimony far exceeded those of petitioners' experts. In terms of research, clinical experienc e, and publications in the subject matter of the testimony proffered, respondent's witne sses were truly experts, and some were world-class experts, in their fields. In contrast, most of petitioners' experts had few publications relating to the subject matter of their testimony and far less experience in the subject matter of their proffered opini ons. Respondent's experts were practicing physicians or research scientists (and so metimes both) who have taught and written extensively on the specific subject matter about which they testified. Although most of petitioners' witnesses had adequate, and occa sionally excellent, qualifications as physicians and scientists, most were either not engaged in research and treatment, orwere engaged in research that was, at best, tangential to the subject matter of their testimony. One of petitioners' expert witne sses had testified very frequently in Vaccine Act cases, and thus appeared to derive subst antial income from expert witness fees. In terms of clinical experience in diagnosing and treating children with ASD, every one of respondent's experts who tr eated children with ASD had more academic training and clinical and research experience than petitioners' experts. None of Colin's own treating physicians testified in this case , and to the extent that any of his medical records reflect any opinions on causation, they focused on a temporal connectionbetween onset of his symptoms and a purported second MMR vaccination. 34 Thus, there are no opinions of treating physicians to be considered on the causation issue. Of the three witnesses who specifically opined on the cause of Colin's condition, two were engaged in treating children with ASD, but re spondent's expert had far more years of experience in such treatment, more advanc ed training, and a record of research and publication in the field not possessed by petit ioners' expert. The third expert filed a very generic expert report, and did not testify. The responses of witnesses to questions, whether from opposing counsel or from the special masters themselves, was also a factor in weighing and evaluating testimony. In general, respondent's experts provided more responsive answers to such questions. Respondent's experts were generally more careful and nuanced in their expert reports and testimony. In contrast, petitioners' exper ts were more likely to offer opinions that exceeded their areas of expertise, to \"cherry-pi ck\" data from articles that were otherwise unsupportive of their position, or to draw conclusions unsupported by the data cited. When an expert relied on a specific medical or scientific journal article in testimony or referenced it in his or her report, I carefu lly compared the testimony or report to the 34 Colin's medical records, vaccinations, and treatment are discussed in more detail in Section X, below. 14article cited. Doctors Kinsbourne and Apos hian, in particular, on several occasions cited articles for propositions not contai ned in the publication. Several of these instances are set forth in greater detail in the sections dealing with their testimony. The expert witnesses included, inter alia , neurologists, toxicologists, pharmacologists, epidemiologists, psychia trists, and pediatricians. For purposes of comparison of qualifications, I have grouped the experts in subsections below by their primary field of expertise or the primary focus of their testimony; however, some experts offered opinions in more than one scientific discipline.35 1. Epidemiologists.Epidemiology is the science that studies the patterns or distributions of diseases in human populations, and attempts to identify risk factors for those diseases. Tr. at 3088-89, 3625. All three epidemiologists w ho testified, Drs. Greenland, Goodman, and Fombonne, had superb qualifications as exper t witnesses. Of the three, Dr. Fombonne had the most experience in conducting studi es and writing about autism's epidemiology. Additionally, Dr. Rutter, who performed some of the earliest epidemiological studies of ASD, was well qualified by his experience and publications to proffer opinions onepidemiology, but I have listed his qualifications below in the section pertaining to the psychiatrists and psychologists, because t hat area was the primary focus of his testimony. a. Doctor (Ph.D.) Sander Greenland. 36 Doctor Greenland is currently a professo r of epidemiology and statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has served on the faculty there since 1979. Tr. at 73. He has a Ph.D. in public health. Tr. at 73. He co-authored a textbook used in numer ous public health and medical schools, and has authored more than 300 peer reviewed37 articles . Tr. at 43-44, 73. Doctor 35 For example, one of respondent's witnesses, Dr. Rutter, offered opinions in psychiatry, genetics, and epidemiology, all areas in which he was extraordinarily well qualified. 36 Doctor Greenland's CV was filed as PML 714; his expert report was filed as PML 715. The slides he used during his testimony were Pet. Tr. Ex. 1. Although the table of contents for the transcript inthe general causation hearing identified Dr. Greenland (and every other witness, including two of the petitioners), as \"MD,\" (Tr. Index at 3) neither his testimony nor his CV reflected a medical degree. 37 In the peer review process, after a manuscript is submitted to a medical journal, an editor sends the manuscript out to experts in the field. The experts review the submission to determine if it is worthy of publication and whether there are any problems involv ing methodology, techniques, or conclusion. The peer reviewer's comments are presented to the editor in a report. After receiving comments from two orthree peer reviewers, the editor then determines if the article should be published, revised, or rejected. Tr. at 1786-87. As Dr. Brent added, the process is not perfect, but it is the best system available. Tr. at 1786. All good publications are peer reviewed. Tr. at 1786. 15Greenland lectures worldwide on epidemiologi cal methods and statistics and is a reviewer and an associate editor for epidem iology journals. Tr. at 73, 75. During his career, Dr. Greenland has served as a consultant on epidemiology and statistics for governmental agencies and private corporations, and as an investigator on more than 30 grants and cont racts from agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Rocke feller Foundation. Tr. at 74. b. Doctor Eric Fombonne.38 Doctor Fombonne is currently the head of t he division of child psychiatry for the McGill University system in Montreal, Q uebec, and heads the Department of Psychiatry and Director of the Autism Clinic at Montreal Children's Hospital.39 Tr. at 3614. He holds a federal appointment as a Canada Res earch Chair, and is a tenured professor of medicine at McGill, where he teaches medi cal students and residents. Tr. at 3614.

He served as the senior statistical editor for one of the world's leading medical journals and has performed editorial and reviewer roles for other medical and scientific journals. Tr. at 3071. Doctor Goodman has been a member of various IOM committees, including the IOM's Immunization Safety Review Committee.48 Tr. at 3072, 3076. 2. Toxicologists, Medical Toxicologists, and Teratologists.Toxicology is the science that explor es the adverse effects of chemical substances on living systems. Tr. at 1796; Res. Tr. Ex. 4, slide 2. Those who study these effects can be considered toxicologists. Tr. at 1796-97. The title of \"medical toxicologist\" has a specific meaning, because it is a subspecialty of medicine recognized by the American Board of Medi cal Specialties. To qualify as a medical toxicologist, a person must be a licensed physician who is boar d certified, has completed a two-year post-residency fellowship, and has passed a certifying examination, with periodic recertification. Tr. at 1797. Petitioner s' testifying expert, Dr. Aposhian, is a toxicologist. 49 Tr. at 246. In contrast, respondent's expert, Dr. Brent, is a medical 48 The IOM committees are comprised of indivi duals who are regarded as experts in a field relevant to the report being prepared. Committee members read through published reports, listen topublic testimony and other evidence, and develop conclu sions regarding the subject being studied. Tr. at 3074-75. Before being published, IOM reports are peer reviewed by a panel of scientists who commenton the committee's work. The committee responds to the review panel's comments, and must explain why any change recommended was or was not made. Tr. at 3075. At the time of the review, the identity of thereviewers is not known to the committee members. Tr. at 3075-76. The Immunization Safety ReviewCommittee was formed because of concern by Congress and the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention [\"CDC\"] about a variety of hypotheses concerning vaccine safety and the desire for a fair andunbiased review of these hypotheses. Tr. at 3076. T he committee has issued a series of reports involving various vaccines and autism and other developmental disorders. Tr. at 3077-78. 49 Doctor Aposhian debated the significance of this terminology. He claimed that \"the board\" uses the term \"clinical toxicologist\" rather than \"medical toxicologist.\" Tr. at 245. The American Board of Medical Specialities uses the term \"medical toxicologist,\" ( see www.abms.org), but perhaps Dr. Aposhian meant another organization, such as The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, which uses \"clinicaltoxicologist\" ( see www.clintox.org), but does not define the term and does not certify specialists. When challenged on this point during cross-examination, he testified that the terminology must have \"changed then...[b]ecause two of the members at the University of Colorado spent time in my laboratory, and one of them took time off to study for her board exams in c linical toxicology.\" Tr. at 245. In response to a question about whether he was a medical toxicologi st, Dr. Aposhian responded: \"It depends on how you define the term medical toxicologist.\" Tr. at 245. He then discussed several overseas consultations that involved his supervision of a team dealing with human to xicology issues. Tr. at 246. The Institute of Medicine draws a distinction between these terms: \"The term clinical toxicologist implies a more clinical orientation, but [like toxicologist] has no specific definition or implications. Medical toxicologists are physicians with specific training and board certification in the subspecialty of medical toxicology, which focuses on the care of poisoned patients.\" IOM, F ORGING A POISON PREVENTION AND CONTROL SYSTEM 1 18toxicologist,50 one of 350 medical toxicologists in the United States.

He described himself as \"a basic science bench investigator.\" He has not published any peer reviewed article on aut ism, mercury in the immune system, thimerosal toxicity, or ethylmercury toxi city. Tr. at 247-48. Nevertheless, he also described himself as an expert on the re lationship of mercury to autism. 52 Tr. at 248. b. Doctor Jeffrey Brent.53 Doctor Brent is a clinical professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. He is a board certified medical toxicologist, and n.1 (2004). I resolve this debate against Dr. Aposhi an. Although highly qualified in the general area of toxicology, he is not a medical toxicologist. 50 Doctor Haynes is also a medical toxicologist, but he did not testify. His qualifications are discussed, with those of the other non-testifying expert, below. 51 Doctor Aposhian's CV was filed as PML 710.

Neuropharmacology is \"that branch of pharmacology dealing especially with the action of drugs upon va rious parts and elements of the nervous system.\" D ORLAND 'S at 1258. Neurotoxicology is t he scientific study of poisons and their effects on nerve tissue. See DORLAND 'S at 1260, 1926 (defining neurotoxic and toxicology). Particularly in this area, the relative di sparity in the qualificat ions of the parties' experts was most apparent, with the qua lifications of respondent's experts overwhelmingly greater than thos e of petitioners' expert, Dr. De th. Doctor Deth testified about oxidative stress, sulfur metabolis m, and dopamine receptors, with relatively sparse and recently acquired qualific ations in each of those areas.61 Respondent's experts had superb and long-standing expertise, each in defined areas. To illustrate: Dr. Deth had one publication on oxidative stress, a review article. In contrast, Dr. Roberts, one of respondent's experts, has written approximately 180 publications on oxidative stress and holds several patents rela ted to oxidative stress. Much of Dr. Deth's testimony concerned dopamine receptor s (discussed in some detail in Section VII), but he had relatively little in the way of publications or research credentials on these receptors. In contrast, Dr. Mailman had more than 100 peer reviewedpublications on dopamine receptors. There we re similar disparities between Dr. Deth's qualifications and those of respondent's other experts in these fields. a. Doctor (Ph.D.) Richard Deth. 62 Doctor Deth is currently a professor of pharmacology in Northeastern University's Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Boston, where he has held a faculty appointment for nearly 32 years. Tr. at 493-94. He holds a Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of Miami, and completed a pos t-doctoral fellowship at the University of Leuven in Belgium. Tr. at 495; CV of Dr. Deth, PML 712, at 1. In conjunction with his faculty appointm ent, he maintains a laboratory where he has performed research, first in cardiovascu lar studies relating to hypertension, and more recently in receptors, the molecu les that respond to neurotransmitters. His 61 Each of these terms (oxidative stress, sulfur metabolism, and dopamine receptors) are defined and discussed in Section VII below. 62 Doctor Deth's CV was filed as PML 712, and his report was filed as PML 713. His slide presentation, used during his testimony, was Pet. Tr. Ex. 3. 22research has been supported by NIH63 and American Heart Association grants, as well as by autism advocacy groups.64 Tr. at 494-95. His research budget in 2008 was about $90,000. Tr. at 594-95. He trains doctoral students as well as undergraduates, and has approximately 70 peer reviewed publications. He has some work in press regarding autism. Tr. at 495- 96. He asserted that one of his books was clos ely related to his autism research. Tr. at 496. His discovery of a dopamine receptor signaling activity in 1998 prompted him toleave cardiovascular research and move into neuroscience and neuropharmacology. Tr. at 496-97. His research pertinent to the causation hypothesis he advanced is discussed in detail in Section VII below. b. Doctor (Ph.D.) Richard Mailman. 65 Doctor Mailman is currently a professo r of psychiatry, pharmacology, neurology, and medicinal chemistry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, where he did postdoctoral training in drug metabolism and neuropharmacology. Tr. at 1975. He earned his Ph.D. in physiology with a minor in toxicology from North Carolina State University. His position primarily involves research, but spends approximately 25% of his time teaching graduate students, medical students, and residents. Tr. at 1975-76. He has published more than 170 peer reviewed articles and about 85 book chapters. At least two-thirds of his pub lications involve work on dopamine receptors. Tr. at 1976-77. He sits on the editorial boards of three journals, and reviews papers for between 15 and 20 journals per year. Tr. at 1977. 63 These NIH grants apparently pertained to Dr. Deth's cardiovascular research. He testified that the two \"grants pending\" on his CV were never approved, including a grant proposal submitted to the NIH for funding for autism research. Tr. at 586-87; CV, PML 712, at 4. He testified that his NIH proposal wasrejected because the reviewer felt \"it was inappropria te to study thimerosal, because [the reviewer had already made up his mind that] it doesn't cause autism,\" based on the FDA's public position on the thimerosal-autism theory. Tr. at 588. Further information regarding the NIH approval process for grants isprovided in Section VII below. 64 Over the last five years, his funding has la rgely come from organizations composed of parents of children with autism, such as Autism Speaks, SafeMinds, the National Autism Association, and theAutism Research Institute [\"ARI\"]. Tr. at 595. SafeMinds contributed roughly one quarter of his budget forresearch in 2007 and 2008. Tr. at 596. I note that SafeMinds was formed by a group of parents whobelieved that mercury was responsible for their children's ASD. See J. Baker, Mercury, Vaccines, and Autism , A M. J. PUBLIC HEALTH , 98(2): 244-53, 251 (2008) [\"Baker\"], filed as PML 599. Doctor Deth had two separate grants from ARI during the calendar year prior to his testimony, one involving the importance ofmethylcobalamin in methionine synthase activity and another to investigate methods to measure homocysteine thiolactone. Tr. at 596. The latter study grant was for $35,000, and the former was similarin size. Tr. at 597. Doctor Mumper, one of petitioners' other experts, is a director of ARI.

Thereafter, he moved to Toronto to be a professor of child neurology, where he saw children with developmental disorders, incl uding autism, at the university clinic, and published a number of articles on various iss ues in developmental disabilities. Tr. at 773. Upon leaving the University of Toront o, he returned to the U.S. to become the chief of the Division of Behavioral Neurology at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center for roughly 11 years. During that period, his clin ical work and research was entirely in the area of developmental disabilities, and he saw hundreds of children. He also consulted with a state facility for child ren with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. Tr. at 773. He has reviewed articles for medical and scientific journals. Since the early 1970s, he has written and updated a chapter on developmental disabilities, including autism, in a textbook on child neurology. Tr . at 773-74. During the 1980s, he published two articles on autism. The 1980s articles, the book chapter, and one article,73 a study of certain autistic behaviors related to his hypothesis in this case and in the Theory 1cases, are the extent of his writing on autism in the last 30 years. Tr. at 910. He has also written two articles on \"overfocusi ng,\" which he now believes to represent high functioning autism, but which also appears to be present in normal children and in children with more severe forms of autism. Tr. at 774-75. Doctor Kinsbourne acknowledged appearing on behalf of petitioners in about 130 cases in the Vaccine Program and indicated that he was currently retained in 20-30 cases. 74 Tr. at 918-19.

Liss, et al., Sensory and attention abnormalities in autistic spectrum disorders , AUTISM 10(2): 155-72 (2006) [\"Liss\"], filed as PML 373. 74 Doctor Kinsbourne's participation in the Vaccine Program has been more extensive than the transcript describes. As I chronicled in Snyder , \"In the 20 years of the Vaccine Program's existence, Dr. Kinsbourne has appeared as an expert witness in at least 185 cases. This figure does not include hisopinions in the many unpublished cases adopting stipul ations of settlement, nor does it reflect pending cases in which he has filed an expert opinion.\" 2009 WL 332044, at *12. Although income from expertopinions and testimony is more difficult to esti mate, I note that Dr. Kinsbourne has been awarded $500 per hour in recent Vaccine Act cases. See, e.g. , Hall v. Sec'y, HHS , No. at *14 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Nov. 6, 2009). Based on my experience in awardi ng expert fees, it would not be uncommon for an expert with Dr. Kinsbourne's qualifications to have received well in excess of $1000 for writing an expert report,and substantially more for testimony, in a single case. 27b.

DwyerTr. at 252-54. 6. Non-Testifying Experts.Both parties retained experts who submitt ed reports but did not testify. Their qualifications are discussed below. A CV was also submitted in this case for Dr. Jean- Ronel Corbier as Pet. Ex. 1. No expert repor t was filed, and Dr. Corbier did not testify. Accordingly, I need not comment on his qualifications as an expert. 95 These studies examine how genes may predict re sponses to certain medications, leading to a better understanding of the disorder. Dwyer Tr. at 217. 34In evaluating matters contained in expert reports filed by the two non-testifying witnesses, I have considered the experts' qualific ations, as reflected in their filed CVs, the extent to which their opinions were s upported by other evidence or testimony, the bases for their opinions, and the nature of t he opinions offered in determining how much weight to accord the proffered opinions. I have also considered that these witnesses were not available for cross-examinati on or to answer questions posed by me or another of the special masters, recognizing t hat there is no right to a hearing nor any right of cross-examination in Vaccine Act cases. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2)(D); \u00a7 330aa-12(d) (3)(B). a. Doctor John F. Haynes, Jr 96 Doctor Haynes has held various academ ic appointments, and is currently an associate professor of emergency medicine and medical toxicology and Chief of the Division of Toxicology at Texas Tech University in El Paso. He is also an AdjunctClinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch- Galveston. CV of Dr. Haynes, Pet. Ex. 16, at 4. Doctor Haynes is the medical director of the West Texas Regional Poison Center, and he is the chief of toxicology services at R.E. Thomason General Hospital in El Paso . He also teaches emergency medicine and toxicology there. CV, Pet. Ex. 16, at 5. Doctor Haynes received his medical degr ee from the University of Texas and completed residencies in emergency medicine at the University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles and Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio. CV, Pet. Ex. 16, at 1-2. He completed a part-ti me fellowship in medical toxicology at the University of Texas medical branch. He is board certified in emergency medicine and medical toxicology. CV, Pet. Ex. 16, at 2. Doctor Haynes has various publications, but, based on their titles, none appears related to autism or mercury toxicity. CV, Pe t. Ex. 16, at 6-7. He has lectured nationally and internationally, but these engagements hav e not, based on their titles, concerned autism or mercury. CV, Pet. Ex. 16, at 8-13. The only reference on his CV to autism or mercury is one \"research activity,\" in the \"exploratory stages,\" concerned with the\"epidemiological study of the relationship of Thimerosal containing vaccines and the development of autism.\" CV, Pet. Ex. 16, at 13. Doctor Haynes' three page report concerned whether thimerosal caused injury to Colin Dwyer. It contains no citations to resear ch to support his assertions. Pet. Ex. 15. This lack of support, taken together with his lack of experience with mercury or autism, leaves me skeptical of his ability to opine re liably on the causation issues in this case. Accordingly, I have placed little weight on Dr . Haynes' report. I note that most of Dr. Haynes' opinions were contradicted by t hose of Dr. Brent, who was not only better 96 Doctor Haynes' CV was filed as Pet. Ex. 16, and his expert report as Pet. Ex. 15. 35qualified to opine, but provided evidence to support his opinions. b. Doctor Manuel F.

He has lectured nationally and internati onally on autism. CV, Res. Ex. D, at 10- 17. Doctor Casanova's report summarized res earch in the neuropathology of autism, including much of his own published research on brain pathophysiology in autism. Res.Ex. C. Section II. The Legal Standards to be Applied . This section addresses the legal standards to be applied in \"off-Table\" Vaccine Act cases. The legal arguments concer ning the application of these standards to Colin's specific case are addressed in Section X, below. When a petitioner alleges an \"off-Table\" injury, eligibility for compensation is established when, by a preponderance of the ev idence, petitioner demonstrates that: he received, in the United States, a vaccine set forth on the Vaccine Injury Table andsustained an illness, disability, injury, or c ondition caused by the vaccine or experienced a significant aggravation of a preexisting condi tion. He must also demonstrate that the condition has persisted for more than six months. 98 Vaccine litigation rarely concerns whether the vaccine appears on the Table, the si tus for administration, or whether the symptoms have persisted for the requisite time. In most Vaccine Act litigation, the issue to be resolved by the special master is whether the injury alleged was caused by thevaccine. This holds true for Colin's case as well. 97 Doctor Casanova's CV was filed as Res. Ex. D, and his expert report as Res. Ex. C. 98 Section 300aa-13(a)(1)(A). This section provi des that petitioner must demonstrate \"by a preponderance of the evidence the matters required in the petition by section 300aa-11(c)(1)....\" Section300aa-11(c)(1) contains the factors listed above, along with others not relevant to this case. 36To establish legal cause in an \"off-Table\" case, Vaccine Act petitioners must establish each of the three Althen factors: (1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that thevaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury. 418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The applicable level of proof is the \"traditional to rt standard of 'pr The preponderance standard \"requires t he trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence.\" In re Winship , 397 U.S. 358, 371-72 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring) (i nternal quotation and citation omitted). Althen 's medical theory factor does not require petitioners to establish identification and proof of specific biol ogical mechanisms, as \"the purpose of the Vaccine Act's preponderance standard is to allow the finding of causation in a field bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines affect the human body.\" Althen , 418 F.3d at 1280. The petitioner need not show that the vaccination was the sole cause, or even the predominant cause, of the injury or condition; showing that the vaccination was a \"substantial factor\" 99 in causing the condition and was a \"but for\" cause are sufficient for recovery. Shyface v. , 165 1355 (petitioner must es tablish that a vaccination was a substantial factor and that harm would not have occurred in the absence of vaccination) . Petitioners cannot be required to show \" epidemiologic studies, rechallenge, the presence of pathological markers or genetic di sposition, or general acceptance in the scientific or medical communities to estab lish a logical sequence of cause and effect....\" Capizzano , 440 F.3d at 1325. Causation is determined on a case by case basis, with \"no hard and fast per se scientific or medical rules.\" Knudsen v. Sec'y , HHS, 35 F.3d 543, 548 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Close calls regarding causation must be resolved in favor ofthe petitioner. Althen , F.3d at 1280. But see Knudsen , 35 F.3d at 550 (when evidence is in equipoise, the party with the burden of proof failed to meet that burden). The medical theory must be a reputabl e one, although it need only be \"legally probable, not medically or scientifically certain. \" Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49. The Supreme Court's opinion in Daubert likewise requires that courts determine expert opinions to be reliable before they may be considered as evidence. \"In short, therequirement that an expert's testimony pertain to 'scientific knowledge' establishes a 99 The recently approved Restatement (Third) of Torts has eliminated \"substantial factor\" in the factual cause analysis. Section 26 cmt j. (2010) Bec ause the Federal Circuit has held that the causation analysis in Restatement (Second) of Torts applies to off-Table Vaccine Act cases ( see Shyface v. Sec'y, HHS, F.3d 485 F.3d 1146, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2007)), this change does not affect the determination of legal cause in Vaccine Act cases: whether the vaccination is a \"substantial factor\" is still a considerat ion in determining whether it is the legal cause of an injury. 37standard of evidentiary reliability.\" 509 U. S. 579, 590 (1993) (footnote omitted). The Federal Circuit has stated that a \"special mast er is entitled to require some indicia of reliability to support the asse rtion of the expert witness.\" Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1324. Circumstantial evidence and medical opinions may be sufficient to satisfy Althen' s second prong. Capizzano , 440 F.3d at 1325-26. Opinions of treating physicians may provide the logical connection. See Capizzano , 440 F.3d at 1323. The requirement of temporal connection necessitates a showing that the injury occurred in a medically or scientifically r easonable period after the vaccination, not too soon ( see de Bazan , 539 F.3d 451 at 1358). Merely showing a proximate temporal c onnection between a vaccination and an injury is insufficient, standing alone, to establish causation. Grant , 956 F.2d at 1148. A proximate temporal relationship, even when coupled with the absence of any other identified cause for the injury, is not enough to demonstrate probable cause under the Vaccine Act's preponderance standard. See Moberly , 418 F.3d at 1278). In Vaccine Act cases, special master s are frequently confronted by witnesses with diametrically opposed positions on caus ation. When experts disagree, many factors influence a fact-finder to accept some testimony and reject other contrary testimony. As the Federal Circuit noted, \"[a]ssessments as to the reliability of expert testimony often turn on credibility determinati ons, particularly in cases ... where there is little supporting evidence for the expert's opinion.\" Moberly , 592 F.3d at 1325-26. Objective factors, including the qualificati ons, training, and experience of the expert witnesses; the extent to which their proffe red opinions are supported by reliable medical research and other testimony; and the factual basis for their opinions are all significant factors in determining what testimony to credit and what to reject. The Vaccine Act itself contemplates that the special masters will weigh the merits of the evidence presented in making entitle ment decisions. Special masters are not bound by any particular \"diagnosis, conclusi on, judgment, test result, report, or summary,\" and in determining the weight to be afforded to these matters, \"shall consider the entire record....\" \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1). A trial court is not required to accept the ipse dixit of any expert's medical or scientific opinion. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner , 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997) (noting that Daubert does not require a court to admit opinions connected to data only by the ipse dixit of n.6 (\"An expert opinion is no better than the soundness of the reasons supporting it.\"). The special master determines the reliab ility and plausibility of the expert medical opinions offered and the credibility of the exper ts offering them. Not all evidence carries 38equal weight with a trier of fact. A medical opinion on causation may be based on factually incorrect medical histories or it may be offered by someone without the necessary training, education, or experience to offer a reliable opinion. An expert's opinion may be unpersuasive for a variety of reasons. Courts, whether they deal with vaccine injuries, medical malpractice claims, to xic torts, or accident reconstruction, must base their decisions on reliable evidence. See Daubert , 509 U.S. at 594-96. Although Daubert interpreted Federal Rule of Evidence 702, an evidentiary rule not applicable to Vaccine Act cases, it, nevert heless, provides a useful framework for evaluating scientific evidence in such cases. Terran , 41 Fed. Cl. at 336; see also Sec'y, HHS , 65 Fed. Cl. 35, 40-41 (2005) (special master performs gatekeeping function when he \"determines w hether a particular petitioner's expert medical testimony supporting biological probability may be admitted or credited or otherwise relied upon\" and as a \"trier-of-fac t...may properly consider the credibility and applicability of medical theories\"). The special master's use of Daubert 's factors to evaluate the reliability of expert opinions in Vaccine Act cases has been cited with approval by the Federal Circuit more recently in Andreu , 569 F.3d at 1379 and Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1324 Special masters weigh the evidence found in the medical records ( see, e.g., Ryman , 65 Fed. Cl. at 41-42); consider evidence of bias or prejudice on the part of a witness, affiant, or expert ( see, e.g. , Baker v. Mstr. Sept. 26, 2003)); weigh opposing medicalopinions and the relative qualifications of experts ( see, e.g. , Epstein v. Sec'y, HHS , 37 Fed. Cl. 723, 726-27 (1996)); examine medical literature, studies, reports, and tests submitted by either party ( see, e.g., Sharpnack v. Sec'y, HHS , aff'd, 17 F.3d 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1994)); and may consider a myriad of other factors in determining the facts of the case and the mixed questions of law and fact that arise in causation determinations. Special masters decide questions of credibilit y, plausibility, reliability, and ultimately determine to which side the balance of the evidence is tipped. See Pafford , 451 F.3d at 1359. In an off-Table case, petitioners do not automatically shift the burden to respondent to prove an alternate cause merely by offering an opinion of a medicalexpert. Respondent may challenge the factual underpinnings of a causation opinion, the opinion itself, or both. See de Bazan , 539 F.3d at 1353-54. If the special master concludes that petitioner's evidence of causat ion is lacking, then the burden never shifts to respondent to demonstrate the \"factors unrelated\" as an alternative cause for petitioner's injury. See Bradley v. Sec'y, HHS , 991 F.2d 1570, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (when petitioner has failed to demonstrate causation by a preponderance, alternative theories of causation need not be addressed); Johnson v. Sec'y, HHS , Fed. Cl. 712, 721-22 (1995), aff'd, 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (even in idiopathic disease claims, the special master may conclude pet itioner has failed to establish a prima facie case). In de Bazan , the Federal Circuit explicitly stated t hat the special master may consider all 39of the evidence presented, including t hat of respondent, in determining whether petitioners have met their burden of proof. 539 F.3d at 1353-54. If merely an opinion supporting vaccine causation, without more, is all that is necessary to meet petitioners' burden of proof, Congress would have said so. Congress could have said that any injury temporally connected to a vaccine iscompensable. It did not. By specifying petit ioners' burden of proof in off-Table cases as the preponderance of the evidence, direct ing special masters to consider the evidence as a whole, and stating that spec ial masters are not bound by any \"diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summary\" contained in the record ( see \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1)), Congress contemplated t hat special masters should weigh and evaluate opposing expert opinions in determi ning whether petitioners have met their burden of proof. 100 In weighing and evaluating expert opi nions in Vaccine Act cases, the same factors the Supreme Court considered important in determining their admissibility provide the weights and counterweights. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael , 526 149-50 (1999); Terran , 195 F.3d at 1316. As the Court of Federal Claims noted: As fact-finders, Special Masters, like juries, are often faced with the \"battle of the experts\" when it comes to interp reting facts. And as fact-finders, they may find that truth lies so mewhere in between the opposing, uncompromising views of the partis an experts. Expert opinion testimony is just opinion, and the fact-finder may weigh and assess that opinion in coming to her own conclusions.... A fact-finder, especially one withspecialized experience such as a Special Master, can accept or rejectopinion testimony, in whole or in part. When the evidence is in, and it istime to apply the facts to the law, the expert's role is over. Partisan testimony then gives way as the Specia l Master evaluates the testimony in light of the entire record, based on reasonable inferences born of common experience or the product of special expertise.\" Sword v. United States , 44 Fed. Cl. 183, 188-89 (1999) (citations Moberly , 592 F.3d at 1325 (\"Weighing the persuasiveness of particular evidence often requires a finder of fact to assess the reli ability of testimony, including expert testimony, and we have made clear that the special mast ers have that responsibility in Vaccine Act cases.\") (citations omitted). Bearing all these legal standards in mind, I turn to the evidence presented on the issue of general causation: whether the va ccine component in question, shall be special master or court finds on the reco rd as a whole...\" ); \u00a7 13(b)(1) (indicating that the court or special master shall consider the entire record in determining if petitioner is entitled tocompensation and special master is not bound by any particular piece of evidence). 40cause ASD. Cf. Pafford question to Althen 's first factor). Section III. The General Causation Hypotheses. The evidence supporting the propositi on that TCVs can cause ASD was presented in the Theory 2 test cases in th ree different yet interrelated expert opinions on causation, those of Drs. Aposhian, Deth, and Kinsbourne.101 Petitioners' fourth expert witness in the general causation ca se, Dr. Greenland, provided testimony more focused on rebutting respondent's epidemiologica l evidence, rather than on causation itself. All three general causation opinions were based on the purported effects of TCVs on the brain, but the mechanisms of causat ion were either unstated (Dr. Aposhian's opinion) or had different foci from one another (the opinions of Drs. Deth and Kinsbourne). None of these experts offered c ausation opinions specific to the three test cases.102 Whether the opinions expressed rela ted solely to a specific type of autism-regressive autism-or to ASDs in general appears to remain open. Both Drs. Deth and Kinsbourne acknowledged that t heir proposed causation mechanisms were not limited to regressive autism, but other evidence, including virtually all of Dr. Greenland's testimony, focused on regressive autism. In addition to opining on causation, each of the experts offered opinions on other matters to support petitioners' assertion t hat TCVs can cause ASDs. These supporting opinions addressed such diverse issues as whether regressive autism (or a subset ofregressive autism called \"clearly regressi ve autism\") constitutes phenotype of ASD with an etiology distin ct from other forms of ASD; whether the mercury levels in TCVs are sufficient to provoke a neuroinflamma tory response in the brain; and whether children with autism are genetically predisposed to a hypersusceptibility to mercury or to oxidative stress. Doctor Aposhian provided background evidence on mercury toxicology. He discussed a number of in vitro , animal, and human studies of mercury's effects. Based on some of these studies, he calculated the amount of mercury from TCVs that would reach the brain. In addition, Dr. Aposhi an also offered a causation opinion himself, opining that mercury caused autism in so me individuals with a hypersensitivity to 101 Petitioners' Post-Hearing Br. and their Reply Br ief [\"Pet. Reply Br.\"] appear to rely only on the general causation hypotheses presented by Drs. Deth and Kinsbourne, relegating Dr. Aposhian's contributions to a supporting role. Petitioners' asserti ons regarding causation in Colin's specific case are addressed in much more detail in Section X, below. Because this is a test case, and other petitioners mayrely more on Dr. Aposhian's own causation opinion, I address Dr. Aposhian's opinion at greater length than I would otherwise. 102 Case-specific opinions on causation were offered by Dr. Mumper in each of the three test cases. Her opinion is addressed in Section X, below. 41mercury or with a \"mercury efflux disorder ,\" although he was not clear about how it did so. Doctor Deth testified that mercur y could impair a number of biochemical processes, inducing systemic metabolic abno rmalities, particularly in children with a particular genetic predisposition towards dev eloping oxidative injury. These metabolic problems produced oxidative stress and affe cted gene expression (the mechanisms by which genes are turned on or off). He asse rted that these effects interfered with neuronal function in the areas of attenti on and cognition, producing the major symptoms of ASD. Doctor Deth also opined t hat oxidative stress could induce the neuroinflammation seen in the brains of individuals with ASD. He relied in some measure on Dr. Aposhian's opinions regardi ng the amount of mercury in the brain produced from TCVs, but also based his opi nions on experiments performed in his own laboratory. Based on results from these experiments, some of which were, as yet, unpublished, Dr. Deth asserted that very sm all amounts of mercury could produce the effects he described. Doctor Kinsbourne's causation opinion focused only on neuroinflammation. Relying on the opinion of Dr. Aposhian that TCVs could produce sufficient mercury in the brain to induce a state of neuroi nflammation, Dr. Kinsbourne opined that neuroinflammation would result in the produc tion of excess levels of an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The result ing excitatory-inhibitory imbalance would produce a state of overarousal, to which he attributed most of the behavioral symptoms of ASD. Doctor Kinsbourne's causat ion opinion was not dependent on Dr. Deth's explanations of how oxidative stress was induced, but he indicated that Dr. Deth provided an explanation at a cellular level for the production of neuroinflammation. However, for Dr. Kinsbourne's opinion, precisely how the neuroinflammation was produced was not critical; he opined that any thing that could cause neuroinflammation could produce ASD's behavioral symptoms, in cluding the measles virus hypothesis he presented in the Theory 1 cases. Doctor Kinsbourne also provided background evidence about ASD. He discussed the phenomenon of regression in ASD , opining that those who experienced a loss of skills as part of the clinical pictur e in their development of ASD constituted a distinct subtype, with a distinct etiology. He did not dispute the evidence that ASDs are strongly genetic conditions, but opined that the genetic contribution rendered certain children more susceptible to environmental toxins, which produced ASD, rather than the genetic differences being directly responsible for ASD. All three of the opinions rested, to some degree, on Dr. Aposhian's testimony about a postulated genetic hypersusceptibility to mercury's effects, on Dr. Deth's testimony about metabolic abnormalities in children with ASD, and on Dr. Kinsbourne's views of gene-environment interactions. Petitioners used the evidence of genetic hypersusceptibility and metabolic abnormalities to explain why mercury induced theseproblems only in some children, while the va st majority of children who received TCVs 42were unaffected. Because a substantial number of epidemio logical studies had failed to detect any association between TCVs and ASD, the general causation evidence also included thetestimony of an epidemiologist, Dr. Greenland. Doctor Greenland's testimony was very limited, and largely represent ed an opinion based on a set of assumptions. Relying on evidence concerning the percentage of child ren with ASD who experienced a loss of skills, and on evidence that an even smaller percentage of those children had entirely normal development prior to the loss of skills , Dr. Greenland asserted that the resulting small subgroup had a condition he called \"clearly regressive autism.\" Based on the postulated existence of this subgroup, Dr . Greenland opined that the epidemiological studies finding no relationship between ASD and TCVs were irrelevant, because none of the studies could have detected an associ ation of TCVs with this small subtype. Implicit in Dr. Greenland's opinion was that this subtype actually existed as an etiologically distinct phenotype of ASD. W hether the general causation hypotheses are inclusive of all ASDs or limited to cases of regressive autism (or to \"clearly regressive autism\") remains unclear. The causation experts were questioned about causation as itpertained to regression in ASD, a broader ca tegory than that of \"clear regression.\" However, neither Dr. Deth nor Dr. Kins bourne limited his causation hypothesis to regressive autism, much less to \"clearly regressive autism,\" and both acknowledged that the mechanisms of injury they descri bed were not limited to those with regression. In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the TCV causation hypotheses presented, I begin in Section IV with background evidence explaining what is known about ASD. This includes diagnostic criteria, behavioral symptoms,pathophysiology (including the evidence concer ning neuroinflammation in the brains of autistic individuals). The epidemiological studies of TCVs and ASD are discussed inSection V. Next, in Section VI, I discu ss the evidence concerning the toxicology of mercury and thimerosal, and in particular, merc ury's effects on the brain. Doctor Deth's evidence regarding disruption of sulfur metabolism is in Section VII, followed in Section VIII by explication of the neuroinflammation hypotheses of Drs. Deth and Kinsbourne. My conclusions regarding the general causati on hypotheses are set forth in Section IX. Colin's specific causation claim is presented in Section X. Section IV. Autism Spectrum Disorders. A. Overview. This section provides background information on the definitions, diagnoses, presentations, and prevalence of disorders on the autism spectrum. It discusses what is generally accepted about the known c auses, genetic and otherwise, of ASDs. Thereafter, this section sets forth other evidence concerning the brain structures pertinent to the neuropathology of ASDs and t he causation hypotheses that follow in Sections VI, VII, and VIII. It addresses the pi votal issue of whether cases of ASD that include a loss of previously demonstrated sk ills (\"regression\") constitute a separate 43phenotype.103 After considering the evidence presented, I conclude that regressive ASD does not constitute a separate phenotype of ASD , and thus is extremely unlikely to have an etiology distinct from other forms of ASD. Most of the factual information contained in this section was not in dispute. The matters in dispute primarily involved regre ssive autism, but the experts also had some disagreements about the prevalenc e of ASDs; their known or postulated causes (other than the TCV hypotheses presented by petitioners); and the brain pathophysiology found in ASDs. The citations are primarily to reports and testimony by respondent's experts, largely because of their superior qualifications and greater expertise in autism research and diagnosis and the depth of the background in formation they provided. Several of respondent's experts are among the most frequently published in the field of ASD research and all of them are acknowledged experts in the field of ASD diagnosis or research.104 Two of petitioners' experts,105 Drs. Kinsbourne and Mumper, had qualifications that warranted consideration of their te stimony about autism's symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, and causes, but their testimony wa s not particularly helpful in providing the background information in this section. Although qualified to testify about autism by virtue of his general training and experienc e in pediatric neurology, Dr. Kinsbourne's practice never focused on children with ASDs. He no longer sees or treats patients and 103 Doctor Lord described a phenotype as a cluster of unique behaviors that are associated with each other. Tr. at 3587. 104 For example, Dr. Rutter appears as a primary author or co-author of about 50 articles or book chapters filed on petitioners' and respondent's master lis ts of scientific and medical journal articles, with publication dates ranging from 1965 ( see M. Rutter, Classification and Categorization in Child Psychiatry J. CHILD PSYCHOL . & PSYCHIAT . 434) to 2007 ( see M. Rutter, et al., Early adolescent outcomes of institutionally deprived and non-deprived adoptees: (2007), filed as RML 417). He and Dr. Lord were actively involved in creating the instruments used in ASD diagnosis. Tr. at 3549-50. Doctors Rutter and Fombonne wereinvolved in developing the DSM-IV-TR criteria fo r autism diagnosis and in negotiations between the WHO and the American Psychiatric Association to make the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria as comparable aspossible. Tr. at 3617-19. Doctor Kemper and his research partner, Dr. Bauman, conducted some of theearliest studies in the pathophysiology of the brains of autistic individuals; Dr. Kemper is still researching and publishing in the area. See, e.g. , M. Bauman and T. Kemper, Histoanatomic observations of the brain in early infantile autism , N EUROLOGY 35: 866-74 (1985) [\"Bauman 509; Tr. at 2797-99. Doctor Rodier's work in the prenatal origins of autism and her ongoing research are alsowidely cited. 105 Doctor Aposhian used a number of slides to illustrate what he called his \"introductory remarks\" about ASD. See Pet. Tr. Ex. 1, slides 14-21; Tr. at 147-52. Because he was not qualified to opine on the nature of autism or its diagnosis, I have accorded such evidence little weight. Although he did not concede a lack of qualifications, Dr. Aposhian himsel f acknowledged that he would \"take second place\" to a neurologist in answering questions about the neurol ogical aspects of autism. Tr. at 246-47. 44has conducted no research into autism's causes, diagnosis, or treatment, other than a review of medical literature. In many cases, his expert report (PML 717) lacked citations for the statements he made106 and, in some cases, his citations were simply incorrect.107 Doctor Mumper is a pediatrician, not a neurologist, psychiatrist, or psychologist, and has had only the standard training provided to pediatricians in these disciplines. Although she has considerable experience in treating children with autism, her testimony was largely anecdotal, rather than based on systematic research, and was thus less helpful in terms of input to this section. B. The Autism Spectrum. Autism spectrum disorders 108 are not new, although public and medical awareness of them has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The term \"autism\" first emerged in 1943, when Leo Kanner described a series of 11 children with distinctly unusual behavior.109 Tr. at 3250, 3257. The diagnostic criteria for ASD s are found in the DSM-IV-TR.110 In general terms, the DSM-IV-TR explains that these developmental disorders are characterized by \"severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development,\" and require qualitative impairments \"distinctly deviant relati ve to the individual's developmental level 106 E.g., PML 717 at 4 (\"[C]lassical...and regressive autism differ sharply with respect to their known medical causations.\"). 107 E.g., PML 717 at 6-7 (citing to PML 377 for a conclusion absent from and unsupported by that study). 108 The terms \"autism spectrum disorder\" and \"pervasive developmental disorder\" were used interchangeably by the witnesses. The DSM-IV-TR , the diagnostic handbook for mental disorders currently in use in the U.S., uses the heading of \"Per vasive Developmental Disorders\" in defining disorders on the autism spectrum. DSM-IV-TR at 69. To av oid confusion between the umbrella term of pervasive developmental disorder and its abbreviation, \"P DD,\" and the diagnostic category of \"pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified\" [\" PDD-NOS\"], a category of developmental disorder on the autism spectrum, I use the terms \"autism spectrum disorder\" or \"ASD\" rather than \"PDD.\" Theexception to this practice is when I directly quote a witness or article. Witnesses frequently used the term \"autism\" when referring to the broad category of ASDs. See, e.g. , Report of Dr. Casanova, Res. Ex. C, at 2 (indicating that he would use the terms \"autis m\" and \"ASD\" interchangeably). Where the evidence is applicable only to the narrower diagnostic category of \" autistic disorder,\" I use that term, rather than \"autism.\" 109 See L. Kanner, Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact , NERVOUS CHILD 2(3): 217-50 (1943), filed as RML 270. 110 See Tr. at 3617-18 (explaining how the criteria were developed). The section of the DSM-IV- TR pertaining to pervasive developmental disorders was filed as RML 123; one specific page was filed as RML 8. For ease in citation, the manual is simply referred to as the DSM-IV-TR throughout this opinion. 45or mental age\" to make a diagnosis. DSM-IV- TR at 69. The DSM-IV-TR also notes that the disorders are frequently associated with mental retardation and are sometimes associated with a diverse group of other m edical conditions, including \"chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infections, [and] stru ctural abnormalities of the central nervous system.\" Id. at 69-70. 1. Diagnostic Categories Included in the Autism Spectrum.A range of disorders comprise the autis m spectrum. The behavioral qualities are similar, but the severity of them may va ry, even within the same diagnostic category. Tr. at 3254. a. Autistic Disorder. A diagnosis of autistic disorder requires a minimum of six findings from a list of impairments divided into the three domains of impaired function: (1) social interaction; (2) communication; and (3) restricted, repet itive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. At least two findings related to social interaction and at least one each in the other two domains are required for diagnosis. DSM-IV-TR at 75. Additionally, delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following three areasmust have occurred prior to three years of age: \"(1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play.\" Id. The diagnosis is one of exclusion as well, since one of the diagnostic criteria is that the disorder must not be better a ccounted for by Rett's disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, both of which are discussed below. DSM-IV-TR at 75. Autistic disorder is frequently associated wit h mental retardation, but it can occur in individuals of normal intelligence as well. Tr. at 3256. It is approximately four to five times more common in boys and is the second most prevalent of the disorders on the autism spectrum. DSM-IV-TR at 73; Tr. at 3707-08. b. PDD-NOS. The DSM-IV-TR defines PDD-NOS as \"a severe and pervasive impairment in the development of reciprocal social intera ction,\" coupled with impairment in either communication skills or the presence of ster eotyped behaviors or interests. DSM-IV-TR at 84. The diagnosis is made when the criter ia for other autism spectrum disorders, or other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, are not met. Id. It includes what has been called \"atypical autism,\" which includes conditions that present like autistic disorder, but with onset after age three, or which fail to meet the specific diagnostic criteria in one or more of the domains of functioning. Id. It is the most prevalent of the disorders on the autism spectrum. Tr. at 3707-08. 46c. Asperger's Disorder.111 Asperger's syndrome is a form of high- functioning autism which presents with abnormalities in social interaction and communi cative functioning. There are no delays in language or cognitive development. Tr. at 3254; see also DSM-IV-TR at 84 (requiring two impairments in social interaction and one in restricted, repet itive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities for diagnosis). d. Childhood Disintegr ative Disorder [\"CDD\"].112 In CDD, children with apparently normal development by age two experience a profound loss of skills and disintegration of functioning after age three and before age 10. In later years, these children present similarly to children with severe autistic disorder. They usually have severe m ental retardation, an increased frequency of seizures, and EEG abnormalities. Tr. at 3255; DS M-IV-TR at 78. This is the rarest of the disorders on the autism spectrum. Tr. at 3707-08. According to Dr. Rutter, it is unclear whether CDD is a variant of autism or something that is confused with autism. Tr. at 3255. See also Volkmar Rett's Disorder.114 Rett's disorder differs from the other disorders contained in the PDD chapter of the DSM-IV-TR, in that its cause is known. Tr. at 3255. Rett's disorder is an entirely genetic condition, caused by X-linked mutations in the MECP2 gene.115 More than 95% 111 The DSM-IV-TR refers to this condition as \"Asperger's Disorder.\" Id. at 80. The witnesses frequently referred to it as \"Asperger's\" or \"Asperger 's syndrome,\" and, for consistency, I do likewise. See, e.g., Tr. at 388, 1197, 3254, 3558. 112 In his report, Dr. Kinsbourne referred to CDD as \"Heller's disease,\" a reference to the physician who first described it. PML 717 at 4; see also C. Hendry, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder: Should It Be Considered , PSYCHOL . REV. 20(1): 77-90 (2000), F. Volkmar and M. Rutter, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder: Results of the DSM-IV Autism 497 (discussing how CDD cases can be differentiated from those of autism, and similarities anddifferences in the two categories). 114 The DSM-IV-TR refers to this condition as \"Rett's Disorder.\" Id. at 76. This condition was variously referred to in testimony, reports, and journal articles as \"Rett's syndrome,\" \"Rett syndrome,\" or simply as \"Rett's.\" Shabazian, Rett Syndrome and MeCP2: Linking Epigenetics Function , AM. J. HUM. GENETICS 71(6): 1259-72 (2002), filed as PML 128. 115 R. Amir, Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG- binding protein 2 , NATURE GENETICS 23: 185-88 (1999) [\"Amir\"], filed as RML 10. See also M. Shahbazian and H. Zoghbi, Molecular genetics of Rett syndrome and 47of those with the condition are female.116 Unless otherwise indicated, in spite of the DSM-IV-TR's classification of Rett's disor der as a pervasive developmental disorder, discussion of ASDs does not include Rett's disorder.117 In its early stages, it presents with sympt oms similar to those of autism (Tr. at 3255), but a loss of hand skills may occur as early as five months of age. It ischaracterized by severe impairments in language development, psychomotorretardation, 118 and, frequently, severe mental retardat ion. It has a distinctive pattern of developmental regression. DSM-IV-TR at 76. 2. Domains of Impairment. Autism spectrum disorders involve unusual qualities of behavior in three areas or domains: (1) social reciprocity, (2) co mmunication, and (3) restricted behaviors and interests. Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 3; Tr. at 2362, 3253, 3588. Children with ASDs display behaviors in these domains that are qualitat ively different from those of typically developing children. The term \"qualitative\" describing these behavioral domains is significant. Tr. at 3250. The issue is more than a delay in functioning; the behaviorsdisplayed are abnormal \"in type, not just in degree or timing.\" Tr. at 3250-51. Issues regarding the social and communicative domains generally manifest earlier than the repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Tr. at 3253. Examples of impairments in the social reciprocity dom ain include impairments in eye contact and body language, and an inability to develop appropriate peer relationships. Impairmentsin the communication domain may include a delay in developing spoken language or ininitiating or sustaining a conversation. It also includes the use of repetitive or idiosyncratic language. Impairments in t he repetitive and restricted behaviors and interests domain include preoccupation with par ts of objects, abnormally intense interest in a subject, and repetitive motor mannerisms , such as hand flapping or twirling. DSM- IV-TR at 75; see also Tr. providi ng examples); 3251-53 (Dr. Rutter providing examples). One of the most important and early recognized symptoms is verbal and nonverbal language impairment. Tr. at 2362. 116 Although the DSM-IV-TR indicates that the disorder has only been reported in females, and Dr. Kinsbourne's report stated that it occurs only in females (PML 717 at 4), Dr. Rust testified that there werea very small number of cases in boys. Tr. at 2533- 34. His testimony is substantiated by Shahbazian, RML 446, at 173-74. I accept Dr. Rust's testimony as correct, given his greater experience in treating andresearching ASD, and in view of this article. 117 Those conducting ASD research often exclude those with Rett's disorder from studies. See, e.g., S. Rose, et al., The Frequency of Polymorphisms affecting Lead and Mercury Toxicity among Children with Autism , AM. J. BIOCHEM . & BIOTECH . 4(2): 85-94, as PML 430 (study excluded \"Rett syndrome\" and other genetic disorders associated with symptoms of autism). 118 Motor skills are generally not impaired in ASDs (Tr. at 3565), one factor setting Rett's disorder apart from ASDs. 483. Diagnostic Criteria and Tools. There are no objective tests to diagnose ASD. Tr. at 3267. Several subjective testing instruments are used to make the diagnosis.119 The ADI-R,120 initially developed by Drs. Lord, LeCouteur, and Rutter in 1989,121 is a long, semi-structured interview, in which caregivers are asked to describe observati ons of a child in specific contexts. The examiner uses the information obtained to assess whether the child has specific symptoms or behaviors, which are then coded into a standard format. Tr. at 3549-50. The ADI-R is used worldwide, primarily in res earch, but also clinically. Tr. at 3253-54. Doctors Lord and Rutter were also authors of the ADOS,122 which involves a standard series of activities for children, keyed to age and language ability. Tr. at 3253- 54, 3550-51. The ADOS is an observation tool used both in autism diagnosis and in research. Tr. at 3550-52. Even when clinic ians do not use the ADI-R and the ADOS, most follow the principles of these t ools in a modified way. Tr. at 3254. Other instruments used to evaluate ASD include the Childhood Autism Rating Scale [\"CARS\"] and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales,123 as well as various intelligence and developmental tests such as t he Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Re vised, and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. See Osterling and Dawson, RML 362, at 250124 (reporting on various tests used in assessing children for participation in an ASD study). 119 One of these instruments, the ADI-R, was listed as an exhibit on respondent's master list (RML 418), but was not actually filed. 120 See C. Lord, et al., Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised: A Revised Version of a Diagnostic Interview for Caregivers of Individuals with Possible Pervasive Developmental Disorders , J. AUTISM & DEV. DISORDERS 24(5): 659-85 (1994), filed as RML 311. Doctor Rutter was a co-author. 121 The current revised version was published in 1994. Tr. at 3550. 122 See C. Lord, et al., The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic: A Standard Measure of Social and Communication Deficits Associated with the Spectrum of Autism , J. AUTISM & DEV. DISORDERS 30(3): 205-23 (2000), filed as RML 310. I note that Dr. Leventhal was a co-author and Dr. Rutter was the senior researcher on the study. The last-listed author on a paper is usually the seniorinvestigator on the study. Tr. at 1913. 123 See A. Carter, et al., The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Sc ales: Supplementary Norms for Individuals with Autism , J. AUTISM & DEV. DISORDERS 28(4): 287-302 (1998), filed as RML 59. Adaptive behavior measurements are used to diagnose or rule out mental retardation and assess an individual'sability to relate to others. Id. at 289-90. 124 J. Osterling and G. Dawson, Early Recognition of Children with Autism: A Study of First Birthday Home Videotapes , J. AUTISM & DEV. DISORDERS 24(3): 247-57 (1994), [\"Osterling and Dawson\"], filed as RML 362. 494. Natural History and Prognosis. a. Recognition of ASD Behaviors. Typically, parents begin recognizing devel opmental problems at 18-24 months. The timing may vary, based on whether the child with autism is the first child, whetherthe parents have other children, or whether they know other autistic children. Tr. at 3259-60. Most parents note the communication problems and lack of social reciprocity first, but they may also have noted subtle si gns from periods very early in development that tell them their child's behavior is not quite right. Tr. at 3260. Subtle social abnormalities may be present at 12 months of age in many cases, but a diagnosis cannot readily be made at that ti me. Tr. at 3260. Doctor Rust testified that co-occurring cerebral palsy or mental re tardation may mask autism, resulting in a later diagnosis. Tr. at 2379-80. In general, autistic behavioral symptoms appear to worsen during the second year of life. See Dawson 2007, RML 108, 125 Table 4 (summarizing studies showing the loss or decline in skills at various ages). Home video126 and \"baby sibs\"127 studies demonstrate that at a group level, children with autism and those without it c an be reliably differentiated at about 12 months of age, but not generally before. Tr . at 3261. Earlier manifestations occur in individuals, but are difficult to assess reli ably, and at an individual diagnostic level, they are too varied to be of much use. Tr. at 3261-62. However, if videos demonstrate clearly abnormal behavior, \"that is r easonably good evidence that there were abnormalities present at that time.\" Tr. at 3262. Videos are less useful if they do not show abnormalities. Tr. at 3262. Doct or Rutter disagreed with Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion (PML 717 at 5) that the majority of children with autism exhibit some level of autistic behavior during the first y ear of life. Tr. at 3262. b. Prognosis. Autism spectrum disorders are generally recognized as a life-long impairment. Tr. at 3255-56. Although some children wit h ASDs grow up to lead independent lives, qualitative impairments persist. A very sm all minority of those with ASD appear to 125 G. Dawson, et al., Rate of Head Growth Decelerates and Symptoms Worsen in the Second Year of Life in Autism , BIOL. PSYCHIAT . 61:458-64 (2007) e.g. , Osterling and Dawson, RML 362; E.

DISORDERS 30(2): 157-62 (2000), filed as RML 509 (summarizing earlier home video studies and reporting on the use of videos to detect ASD behaviors in children aged 8-10 months of age). 127 These studies involve siblings of children with autism, who are at higher genetic risk of developing the condition themselves. Researchers a ssess the siblings at different ages throughout the child's early development to note when abnormalities first appear. Tr. at 3261. 50recover completely. Tr. at 3256. In general, ASDs are not static conditions. Tr. at 2358. According to Dr. Lord, children with autism improve, but the level of improvement varies from child to child. Tr. at 3568. Behavioral treatments make some di fference, but the difference is relatively small as compared simply to the natural c ourse of development. Tr. at 3569. Doctor Rust noted that improvements may be a result of the natural course of the disorder, rather than any treatments in the interim.128 Tr. at 2451. Most improve in language, with some children developing fluency. Tr. at 3569. The improvement in social skills is lower, with autistic children only rarely havi ng no social deficits. Tr. at 3569. About 25% of those with autism develop seizures in adolescence. Tr. at 3267-68. 5. Prevalence of ASDs. a. Measurements of Prevalence. The prevalence of ASD within the U.S. in 2002 can be expressed as 6.6 per 1,000; as 66 per 10,000; as 0.6%, or as one child in 152. Tr. at 3636; see also PML 586129 (2002 CDC data on ASDs in the U.S.) Thes e figures are highly consistent with studies in the U.K., Denmark (including the Faroe Islands),130 and Canada. All of these countries have prevalence rates in the 60-70 per 10,000 range. Tr. at 3636. However, within the U.S., ASD prevalence rates vary widely among states. For example, New Jersey has a rate of 1.06%, but Alabama r eported a rate of 0.33%. The rate from location to location also varies based on methods of case ascertainment. See Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 6; Tr. at 3636-37. Studies conducted since about 2000 are more precise than earlier studies because they use a scertainment methods across different populations with similar case definitions, pr oducing the more recent estimates of 66-70 per 10,000. Tr. at 3709-10. b. An Increase in Prevalence? One of the areas of controversy conc erns the dramatic increase in the 128 Doctor Lord's report indicated that, based on language level, social deficits, the frequency and severity of repetitive behaviors, and the nature of parental involvement in treatment, changes in behaviorover time can be predicted. Res. Ex. O at 2. Us ing observations made at ages two, three, and five, she and her team identified criteria that would accurate ly predict behaviors and diagnosis at age nine. Tr. at 3557-58. See C. Lord, et al., Autism from 2 to 9 Years of Age , A RCH. GEN. PSYCHIATRY 63: 694-701 (2006), filed as RML 309. 129 CDC, Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders - Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 Sites, United States 2002, M ORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY SURVEILLANCE SUMMARIES 56 at 12 (February 2007), filed as PML 586. 130 A. Ellefsen, et al., Autism in the Faroe Islands. An Epidemiological Study, J. AUTISM & DEV. DISORDERS 37: 437-44 (2007) [\"Ellefsen\"], filed as RML 130. 51percentage of children who have diagnoses on the autism spectrum. Some, including Dr. Deth, have called this an \"autism epidemic.\" E.g., Deth, PML 563, at 190.131 Doctor Kinsbourne asserted that \"the incidence of t he ASD diagnosis is rising spectacularly.\"132 PML 717 at 6. The parties were in agreem ent that the prevalence rates of ASD have increased, not only in the U.S., but also elsewhere in the world, but disagreed on whether the increase could be explained by fa ctors other than a true increase in ASD's prevalence. Petitioners asserted that a tr ue increase in the prevalence of ASDs would be circumstantial evidence t hat environmental factors ar e fueling the increase. See PML 717 at 7.133 However, Dr. Fombonne, who is both a psychiatrist treating children with ASDs and a specialist in the epidemiology of ASDs, test ified that it is difficult to determine if the prevalence of ASDs in the U.S. has actua lly increased in the last 20 years. Tr. at 3715-16. Diagnostic substitution, broadened diagnostic criteria,134 broader diagnostic concept,135 better case ascertainment,136 more aggressive efforts to find and diagnose children with the condition, and an increase in survival rates for premature infants137 have all played a role in the increased prev alence of ASDs. Tr. at 785-86; 3280-83; Res. Ex. Z at 4-5 (Report of Dr. Rutter); Re s. Ex. W at 5-6 (Report of Dr. Rust); Croen, 131 R. Deth, et al., How environmental and genetic factors combine to cause autism: a 132 Doctor Rutter criticized Dr. Kinsbourne's juxtaposition of two concepts in this assertion. He agreed that the diagnosis of autism has increased specta cularly, but disagreed that it means there is a true increase in the condition. Tr. at 3280-81. 133 Doctor Kinsbourne was unwilling to attribute any particular percentage of cases to TCVs. PML 717 at 7. 134 For example, a letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal reported on efforts to confirm the reported rate of autism in 1970. At that time, a cohort study identified only five children as havingautism at age five, for a prevalence rate of 0.45/1000. Applying current diagnostic criteria to records of individuals in that 1970 cohort, the researchers demonstr ated over an eight-fold increase in the prevalence rate to 3.76/1000. See H. Heussler, et al., Prevalence of autism in early 1970s may have been underestimated , B RIT. MED. J. 323: 633 (2001), filed as RML 234. 135 A broadened diagnostic concept refers to the fact that individuals with normal intelligence may be autistic. In earlier decades, autism was thought to be limited to individuals with mental retardation and there was reluctance to diagnose autism in individuals of normal intelligence. Tr. at 3282-83. 136 Better case ascertainment means that pediat ricians, family doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists have become more aware of early manifestations of autism. Tr. at 3281. 137 Doctor Rust pointed out that autism diagnoses are more likely to occur in children who were premature at birth, and more premature infants are surviving to be diagnosed with autism. Tr. at 2479. Doctor Rodier concurred. Tr. at 3022-23. 52RML 97, at 213-14.138 Doctor Kinsbourne conceded that changes in diagnostic criteria, improved ascertainment, and diagnostic substitution may all have contributed to the risein prevalence, but asserted that these fact ors could not account for the actual rise. 139 See PML 717 at 6-7; Tr. at 785-86. Doct or Rutter concluded that the increase in prevalence was \"mainly methodological,\" but t hat the possibility of a true increase could not be ruled out. Tr. at 3282. Petitioner s' epidemiology expert, Dr. Greenland, avoided opining on the issue. Tr. at 114. C. Known Causes of ASD. 1. Overview. A specific causal factor can be identifi ed in only about 8-20% of cases of ASD. 140 Virtually all the known causes involve either a genetic defect or a prenatal toxic insult or infection. In a few case reports, autis m-like syndromes have occurred after postnatal infections; the experts differed over whet her these cases truly represented cases of ASD, or simply what Dr. Rutter called \"phenocopies,\" disorders that mimic the symptoms of ASD. Tr. at 3266-67. The ex perts had few true disagreements regarding ASD's known causes, and agreed that ASD s are highly genetic, but not generally Mendelian141 conditions. They differed in whether an external factor was necessary to produce ASD in the presence of a genetic susc eptibility for the disorder. As the core 138 L. Croen, et al., The Changing Prevalence of Autism in California , J. AUT. & DEV. DISORDERS 32(3): 207-15 (2002) [\"Croen\"], filed as RML 97. 139 Doctor Kinsbourne included a citation to a 2002 article by Dr. Rutter (PML 377) for this point. PML 717 at 6-7. The article filed as PML 377, M. Rutter, Genetic Studies of Autism: From the 1970s into the Millennium , J. ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOL . 28(1): 3-14 (2000), was actually published in 2000, not 2002. The statement Dr. Kinsbourne attributed to Dr. Rutter is not contained anywhere in it. No 2002 article byDr. Rutter was filed by either party. Doctor Rutte r's CV (Res. Ex. AA) breaks down his publications by year and the titles of his 2000 and 2002 publications do not reflect any articles likely to contain the comment Dr. Kinsbourne attributed to him. See also Tr. at 2477-78 (Dr. Rust discussing Dr. Kinsbourne's citation to Dr. Rutter's work). 140 The experts varied only slightly in their esti mates of the percentage of cases in which a cause could be identified. Doctor Rust estimated 8-12%, a ra te similar to the rate of known causes for cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Tr. at 2531-32. Doctor Rutter estimated the rate at 10-15% (Tr. at 3266);Dr. Kinsbourne placed the rate at around 10-20% (Tr. at 851). 141 Mendelian conditions are named after Gregor Mendel, who first described patterns of inheritance. See DORLAND 'S at 1124. Conditions, such as Huntington's chorea, are called Mendelian when they are controlled by a single gene and t hose who inherit the gene eventually develop the condition. With the exception of a small number of cases involving single gene inheritance, ASDs are not Mendelian conditions. Tr. at 3275, 3288; see also C. Marshall, et al., Structural Variation of Chromosomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder , AM. J. HUMAN GENETICS 82: 477-88 (2008) [\"Marshall\"], filed as RML 326 (listing fragile X, Rett's disorder, and t uberous sclerosis as genetic conditions associated with ASD, and the maternally- derived duplication of chromosome 15q11-q13 as a cause of 1-3% of cases ofASD). Single gene defects that produce autistic symptoms are present in less than 6% of cases. Tr. at2396. 53issue in the Theory 2 cases is whether pos tnatal administration of TCVs can cause ASDs, I do not resolve the disagreement regardi ng postnatal causation at this point. To the extent that there is re liable evidence for postnatal causes for ASD, that evidence serves as circumstantial evidence that TCVs might be one as well. The converse also applies. 2. Heritability142 and Genetics. Doctor Rust commented that autism is among the most heritable of all neurological conditions. Tr. at 2394. Autism is about four to five times more common in boys than in girls, an early suggestion that ASD had a genetic component. See Tr. at 2377-78. Studies of ASD in twins confirm ed that ASD is a strongly genetic condition.143 In identical twins, the concordance rate144 for autism is about 60% for autism itself, and about 90% for the broader phenotype of ASD. Tr. at 789-90, 2595-96, 3272-73. That is, if one twin has autism, there is a 90% chance that the second twin will have either ASD or some behaviors that are found in those with ASD. See Le Couteur, RML 296.145 Siblings and fraternal twins have a concordanc e of 2-4% for autism and 10-27% for the broader spectrum of autistic disorders.146 This is a risk 20-50% times greater than that of the general population. Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 14. Because concordance rates between mono zygotic twins are not 100%, factors other than genes play a role, at least in some instances of ASD. Tr. at 3275. DoctorRutter testified that autism results from the combination of between three and twelve 142 There is a distinction between heritability and genetics. Tr. at 3592-93. Heritability refers to whether a genetic condition may be inherited or pass ed on to offspring. Genetics refers to gene determination of physical characteristics; genetic defects may be inherited or may arise spontaneously, and not all defects in genes result in the same outcome. See DORLAND 'S at 763, 840. In tuberous sclerosis, a genetic condition, the size, location, and e ffect of the tumors vary widely among individuals. Tr. at 3264. In ASD, even in identical twins, IQ measurements or autism diagnoses are not necessarilyconcordant. Tr. at 3595. 143 See, e.g. , A. Bailey, et al., Autism as a strongly genetic disorder: evidence from a British twin study , PSYCHOLOGICAL MED. 25: 63-77 (1995) [\"Bailey 1995\"], filed as PML 90. Doctor Rutter was the senior researcher on this study. 144 Concordance is the \"occurrence of a given trait in both members of a twin pair.\" D ORLAND 'S at 404. 145 A. Le Couteur, et al., A Broader Phenotype of Autism: The Clinical Spectrum in Twins Doctor Rutter was the senior researcher on this study. 146 Doctor Rutter testified that the concordance rate in dizygotic twin pairs is about 5% for autism diagnoses, and about 10% for the broader spectrum of autis tic disorders. Tr. at 3272. The Marshall study also used the 5-10% figures. RML 326 at 477. 54genes, and from non-genetic factors.147 Tr. at 3275-76. He noted that the rate of chromosome abnormalities is higher in autism than in the general population. There are more copy number variations148 in autism. Tr. at 3276. Do ctor Rust noted that because there are a number of genetic influences at work, the condition may be the result of varieties of gene expression or modifications that occur after the gene begins to express itself.149 Tr. at 2396. Autism is associated with several other genetic disorders, including fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Although ch ildren with tuberous sclerosis are more likely to have autism than children without this genetic disorder, Dr. Rutter was carefulto state that tuberous sclerosis played a part in causation, not that it caused autism. The risk of autism in those with tuberous sclerosis depends on the brain location where the tumors are found, and whether there is a ssociated mental retardation. Thus, it is not clear whether the genes for autism and tuberous sclerosis are interconnected, or only that the parts of the brain involved in tuberous sclerosis are involved with autistic behaviors. Tr. at 3265-66. Doctor Rodier concurred with this testimony, commenting that children with tuberous scler osis do not show autistic symptoms early on, but as the tumors cause more brain injury, they may develop them. Tr. at 3020. In families where there are multiple incidences of autism, members of the extended family often have a number of persona lity characteristics similar to those in autism. Tr. at 2392-93. These characteri stics were found in both parents in 38% of family clusters of autism. Tr. at 2392-93; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 13. See also Pickles, 147 Doctor Rutter preferred the \"non-genetic factor\" terminology to \"environmental factor\" because the non-genetic factor need not be an environmental hazard. Tr. at 3276; see also M. Fraga, et al., Epigenetic differences arise during the lifetime differences as one explanation for discordances in monozygotic twins). The disputes between the parties regarding the non-genetic factors are set forth below. 148 Copy number variations are small deletions or substitutions in small bits of the genetic code that are not the result of inheritance. Tr. at 3276. 149 \"Epigenetics\" is the term usually applied to this aspect of gene expression. Epigenetics has been defined as \"the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not change the DNA sequence but, rather, provide an 'extra' layer of transcriptional control that regulates how genes are expressed.\" D. Rodenhiser and M. Mann, Epigenetics and human disease: translating basic biology into clinical applications , CANADIAN MED. ASSN. J. 174(3): 341-48, 341 (2006) [\"Rodenhiser and Mann\"], filed as PML The authors further explained that \"[a]lterations in ... epigenetic patterns can ... result[] in profoundand diverse clinical outcomes\" and that \"genes can be expressed or silenced depending on specific developmental or biochemical cures, such as changes in hormone levels, dietary components or drugexposures.\" Id. at 341, 342. The MECP2 gene, which is responsible for Rett's disorder, is involved in controlling gene expression, and deficiencies in this expression have been found on autopsy in those with ASD. Id. at 341, 346. 55RML 381.150 This suggests that lesser degrees of expression of a genetic condition may be causing disturbances in other fa mily members. Tr. at 2393. See also Tr. at 3274-75 (Dr. Rutter describing the Pickles study , RML 381, which compared families with an autistic member to those with a Down syndrome151 member, finding families with an autistic member were more likely to exhibi t the milder conditions than those with a Down syndrome member). This phenomenon is know n as \"familial loading.\" Tr. at 3275. 3. Prenatal Insults.Doctor Rodier thalidomide, 152 valproic acid,153 ethanol, and misoprostol.154 All five are early prenatal exposure risks identified through population studies.155 Tr. at 3019. She also testified that the prenatal causes are most likely ones that occur in the first trimester. Tr. at 3020. Doctor Rodier did not include terbuta line on her list of environmental exposures because the information that suggests it is a risk factor for autism is not based on apopulation study. 156 The Connors study, PML 73,157 examined cases of autism in twin 150 A. Pickles, et al., Variable Expression of the Autism Broader Phenotype: Findings from Extended Pedigrees , J. RML 381. Doctor Rutter was listed as the senior researcher on this study. 151 The significance of using families with a Down syndrome member is that Down syndrome is a genetic condition arising from a spontaneous mutation, not an inherited defect. Thus, families with aDown syndrome member might be as aware of behavioral differences in the Down syndrome child as thefamilies with an autistic child, reducing reporting biases, but since autism is an inherited characteristic, the rates of family members with similar behaviors would be different in the two groups. Tr. at 3274-75. 152 Doctor Rust testified that prenatal thalidomide has been described as having an association with autism, but that he had not looked carefully enough at the data to have an opinion. Tr. at 2572-73. He had a similar opinion about valproic acid, noting that the most common defects associated with it wereneural tube defects. Tr. at 2573. Doctor Rodier testified she became interested in autism in 1983 or 1984,when reports of a possible connection between t halidomide and autism suggested a connection with teratology. Tr. at 2917. 153 Valproic acid (dilantin) is used to treat seizure disorders. D ORLAND 'S at 2004. 154 Misoprostol is used to prevent gastric ulcers and to terminate pregnancy. D ORLAND 'S at 1161. 155 Doctor Kinsbourne testified similarly, identif ying thalidomide, valproic acid, and rubella as causing autism if administered at specific points during gestation. Tr. at 792-93. 156 A population study would compare rates of autism in those exposed to a possible risk factor, such as terbutaline, to those of the general population. Tr. at 3020. 157 S. Connors, et al., 2-Adrenergic Receptor Activation and Genetic Polymorphisms in Autism: Data from Dizygotic Twins , J. exposed and unexposed to terbutaline, wit h at least one twin in the exposed pair with autism. Tr. at 3020-21. The study in itially found that there was no significant increase in the risk of the second twin havi ng autism. However, when a small subset of male twins with no other affected siblings was considered, terbutaline exposure appeared to produce an excess risk of autism. Tr. 3021. Doctor Rodier explained that the natur e of the exposure made it difficult to determine whether terbutaline produced the exce ss risk or if it was the reason for the terbutaline administration, i.e., the risk of premature labor. If the terbutaline not been administered, the twins might not have survived long enough to be diagnosed with autism. Tr. at 3021-22. Children with very lo w birth weights as the result of premature delivery have a greater risk of autism, which could be due to the birth weight itself, or the fact that a fetus with autistic injuries is more likely to have low birth weight. Tr. at 3022-23. It is difficult to separate whether terbutaline increases the risk of autism or preserves pregnancies with preexisting risk of autism.158 Tr. at 3023. Petitioners relied on the Zerrate rat study, PML 106,159 to demonstrate that a postnatal exposure could produce brain effect s similar to those found in individuals with ASD. See Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 39. The author s noted that the brains of the rat pups resembled \"those reported in post mortem examinations of corresponding brain regions in autistic individuals.\" Zerrate, PML 106, at 17. However, because rat pups are more immature at birth than humans, the period of comparable exposure would have involved late gestation in humans. Tr. at 3024. 4. Postnatal Events Other Than TCVs.Doctor Kinsbourne asserted, based on case reports, 160 that environmental 158 The authors of the Connors study agreed with Dr. Rodier's assessment. They wrote: Although twinning itself might or might not directly contribute to the development of autism, it might increase the risk of exposure to other environmental influences. Twinbirth rates increased over the past decade in the United States, rising 33% since 1990and the most pronounced increases occurred in older mothers...Multiple births withattendant uterine size and irritability also increase the risk of premature labor andtherefore the risk of exposure to a 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist drug, such as terbutaline for tocolysis. Connors, PML 73, at 881 (footnote omitted). 159 M. Zerrate, et al., Neuroinflammation and Behavioral Abnormalities after Neonatal Terbutaline Treatment in Rats: 160 See, e.g. , I. Gillberg, Autistic Syndrome with Onset at Age 31 Years: Herpes Encephalitis as a Possible Model for Childhood Autism , DEV. MED. & CHILD NEUROL . 33: 912-29 (1991), filed as PML 340 (describing several other case reports, in addition to this particular case). 57exposures occurring after birth, includi ng herpes encephalitis, can produce autistic syndromes. Tr. at Doctors Rodi er and Rutter agreed that herpes encephalitis occasionally causes autistic-like behaviors, but disagreed that it was a cause of ASD. Herpes encephalitis causes tremendous brai n damage; this damage, rather than the disease, causes the autistic behavior (Tr. at 3058). Doctor Rutter concurred, testifying that herpes encephalitis cases have \"some autisti c features of a kind that are parallel,\" but are different in the course and in the age of onset (Tr. at 3266). He also commented that he was unconvinced that the herpes enc ephalitis cases were \"the same sort of thing as autism as we ordinarily understand it.\" Tr. at 3324; see also Damasio, PML 328161 (describing the location of virus damage) . I note that the area of damage (the limbic system) described in the Damasio arti cle is similar to areas of anatomical abnormalities found in the brains of those with autism. See Section IV.G below. Doctor Rodier testified that case studies have associated malaria in young children with later presentation of autism (Tr. at 3044), but Dr. Rust expressed skepticism that malaria caused autism. He explained that malaria can produce a severe encephalopathy, but that the co-occurring moto r, sensory, and intellectual problems should preclude an autism diagnosis. Tr. at 2574-75. There are a few cases involving acut e postnatal encephalopathies with later development of autistic symptoms, but Dr. Rodier would classify those with the tuberous sclerosis cases: where there is sufficient in jury to the brain, some symptoms consistent with autism occur. Tr. at 3044-45. The postnatal damage causes behavior that mimics the symptoms of autism, but has a very differ ent etiology. Tr. at 3059. Doctor Rutter indicated that, on rare occasions, brain abno rmalities acquired postnatally can give rise to ASD-like features, but it was difficult to decide whether these were truly postnatal causes of autism or simply phenocopies. Tr . at 3266-67; Res. Ex. Z at 8. Doctor Kinsbourne called these diverse causes fo r autism \"functional convergence,\" producing clinical appearances of autism. Tr. at 793. Doctor Rust was skeptical that encephalopathies could result in a true autistic regression. See Tr. at 2568. Doctor Rutter summed up the evidence regarding known causes of ASD by saying that all of the evidence that is \"r easonably solid\" indicates prenatal causes. Tr. at 3267. He was not willing to rule out entir ely the possibility of very early postnatal causes, although he knew of no good examples of them. Tr. at 3267. D. Regression In ASD. 1. Overview.Initially at least, the phenomenon of r egression in ASD appeared to be at the 161 A. Damasio and G. Van Hoesen, The limbic system 58heart of petitioners' case.162 Doctor Kinsbourne opined that regressive autism is a separate and distinct condition, with environmental causes occurring after birth playing a role in its etiology. PML 717 at 6-7; see also Tr. at 780-82, 851-53. He also indicated that the causes of regressive autism ma y be distinct from those of non-regressive autism. PML 717, at 6. Petitioners' epidemiologist, Dr. Greenland, relied on the existence of a subset of regressive aut ism, termed \"clearly regressive autism,\"163 for his opinion that the epidemiological studies finding no association between TCVs and ASD were irrelevant to the issue of causation because they would have missed an effect ofTCVs on this small subgroup. See Section V.F. below. Doctor Aposhian postulated a small subgroup of children hypersusceptible to mercury's effects ( see Section VI below), although he did not expressly state that the subgroup must be composed of children with regression or \"clear\" regression. Petitioners intimated that Dr. Fombonne had validated the use of this term (Pet. Post-H earing Br. at 53), but this is either a misstatement or a misunderstanding of Dr. Fombonne's testimony. See Tr. at 3683-84. Both Drs. Kinsbourne and Deth presented test imony relating their causation opinions to regressive autism, although Doctor Deth acknowledged that there was nothing in the causal mechanisms he advocated that applied sole ly to regressive autism. Tr. at 64; see also Section VII below. Doctor Kinsbourne did so as well. Tr. at 901, 904 (acknowledging that his neuroinflammation hy pothesis was not necessarily limited to regressive autism); see also Section VIII below. Considerable testimony was devoted to ex plaining the nature of regressive ASD and how it differs from \"classic\" ASD. Several areas of consensus emerged. It is clearthat some proportion of children with autis tic disorder and PDD-NOS experience a loss of skills at some point in their development. However, the weight of the evidence is that those who experience regressi on are not otherwise biologically or behaviorally distinct from other children with ASD. 162 Regression occurs in children with classic autism and in those with PDD-NOS or milder forms of the condition. Tr. at 3669. Regression is a part of the diagnostic criteria for Rett's disorder and CDD. DSM-IV-TR at 76, 78. 163 Doctor Greenland defined \"clearly regressive autism\" as regressive autism in which there were no developmental problems prior to the regression. Report of Dr. Greenland, PML 715, at 6-7. Theexistence of \"clearly regressive autism\" as a diagnos tic subtype of regression is one of the matters in dispute. Aside from testimony by Dr. Greenland (who was not qualified to opine on its existence) and some testimony from Dr. Kinsbourne (Tr. at 784 (the percentage of cases where the child is clearlyregressive is below 20%); Tr. at 784 (explaining the concept as \"when a child is clearly regressive, that's very clear\")), there is no evidence that \"clearly regressi ve autism\" is recognized as a distinct entity. Doctor Kinsbourne's report did not refer to \"clearly regressive autism\" at all. It is not listed in the DSM-IV-TR. Doctor Lord, who has performed considerable research into the phenomenon of regression, testified thatshe had never heard the term and that it was not used in the published literature. Tr. at 3571; see also Tr. at 3683-84 (Dr. Fombonne testifying that he had never heard the term, and, contrary to Dr. Greenland'stestimony, he was not the source for Dr. Greenland's definition). 592. Existence of Regression. The terms \"classic\" or \"early onset\" are used to describe the majority of children with autistic disorder, as well as most children with other ASDs.164 Early descriptions of ASDs by Kanner and others165 included reports that some children with the condition experienced a loss of skills. Tr. at 3284, 3559- 60. At one time, there were concerns about whether these reports, largely based on parental recall, were accurate. Although it is now generally accepted that loss of skills occurs,166 there is still considerable debate about whether the children who experience lo ss of skills were developmentally normal prior to the loss, how widespread the phenom enon actually is, when regression begins, and how to define it. The general consensus is that it does not represent anetiologically distinct subtype of ASD. Tr. at 3284-85. 3. Definitions.Doctor Lord was involved in the early efforts to determine whether regression actually existed and to define it. Tr. at 3547-48. She defined the phenomenon of regression in autism as the loss of previous ly observed and demonstrated skills, or as a reduced frequency of demonstrating those skills. 167 Tr. at 3558. 164 In his report and testimony, Dr. Kinsbourne used the term \"congenital autism\" to refer to autism in which there is no loss of skills. \"Congenital\" is defi ned as \"existing at, and usually before, birth; referring to conditions that are present at bi rth, regardless of their causation.\" DORLAND 'S at 408. To the extent that autism is prenatally and genetically determined, Dr. Kinsbourne's use of the term may be technicallycorrect, but it would be very rare for autistic symptoms (as opposed to dysmorphology associated with autism) to be detectible at birth. Perhaps for this reason, Dr. Lord took exception to Dr. Kinsbourne's terminology. Tr. at 3584-85. She explained that autism cannot be diagnosed in a new born. In the process of development, autistic behaviors emerge, both in those with regression and in those without. She testified that a distinctionbetween \"congenital\" and regressive autism is a false one. Tr. at 3585. 165 See S. Wolff and S. Chess, A Behavioural Study of Schizophrenic Children , ACTA. 514 (reporting on a number of cases documenting loss of skills). Childhood schizophrenia was one of the terms then used to describe ASDs. 166 Doctor Lord was emphatic in stating that regressive autism does exist. Tr. at 3558. Doctor Rutter concurred, commenting that both home video and other studies confirm that regression happens. Tr. at 3285. He testified that he did not like to use the term \"regressive autism\" because of the implicationthat it is a distinct subtype of autism. Tr. at 3284. 167 How broadly or restrictively the phenomenon is def ined obviously affects the estimates of the percentage of those with regressive autism. Tr. at 3670. If the threshold for describing regression is howoften a child looks at people at nine months of age, compared to how often he looks at them at 15 monthsof age, then nearly every child with autism would be described as regressed. If the criteria are morerestrictive, then the percentage of autistic children wit h regression declines. Tr. at 3566-67. The length of time a skill loss must persist is another definitional variable. Tr. at 3567-68. Doctor Kinsbourne appearedto be in at least partial agreement with this evidence, as he testified that the definitions for regression vary. Tr. at 783. He noted that some studies use the criterion that a child had words and then stopped using 60Doctors Rutter and Lord explained that, in mo st cases, regression is simply one variable in the early development of those wit h autism. Tr. at 3579. There are children who experience a dramatic loss of skills, those in whom losses are minor and more difficult to spot, and those who fall somewher e in between. Tr. at 3284-85. Regression is not a condition that either exists or does not exist in a particular child; it is a matter of the degree and type of worsening that occurs. Tr . at 3284, 3579. Aside from the fact of regression itself, children with regression do not form a distinct group. Tr. at 3285. Doctor Fombonne explained that there is no standardized definition of regressive autism in the ADI-R and no subcategory in it for regressive autism. Tr. at 3769-70. Although there are questions pertaining to regression, they were added to aid in standardizing studies that might look at regr ession as part of the developmental course in autism, not to define diagnostic subtypes. Tr. at 3771-72. 4. Assessment and Timing of Regression.Regression typically occurs at the end of the first year or during the second year of life in children with autistic disorder or PDD-NOS. Tr. at 3285, 3558-59. It occurs later, usually after three years of age, in CDD. DSM-IV-TR at 77. It is typically assessed by careful interviews of parents to obtain very specific information about theskills that the children had and when they lost them. 168 Tr. at 3560. Although loss of words was once thought to be the primary manifestation of regression, research by Dr. Lord and others s uggests that what is most common is loss of social skills, such as waving or play ing peek-a-boo. Tr. at 3561-62, 3565-66, 3589. However, loss of words is the sympt om the parents most often agree upon when interviewed years later. Tr. at 3565-66. Lo sses in the play domain are less often found. The degree to which the child is losing im aginative play and gaining repetitive behaviors is difficult to quantify. Tr. at 3589-90. Trajectories of development and loss are sim ilar, but their timing may vary. Tr. at 3564. In some children, the loss of skills is precipitous; in others, it is much more gradual. Tr. at 3566-67. Regaining skills is also variable. Tr. at 3560, 3567. In them. Others use stricter language criteria or may look for a change in play or socialization patterns. Tr. at 783. He described \"clear-cut\" cases where a child who once had a significant amount of language quit talking, or a child who had been playing in a normal fa shion suddenly started lining up toys. If the criteria require this clear-cut demarcation, then the percentage of cases will be lower. Tr. at 784. 168 The skill of the interviewer may confound the data collected. Careful questioning is essential because parents are more likely to remember a dramatic loss, such as a child having five words and thennever speaking again, than they are to remember that a child stopped talking for a month. Tr. at 3568. Although parents have a wealth of information about t heir children, they may not understand everything that is relevant if simply asked about a loss of skills. Tr. at 3561. There is a huge variability in the skillschildren acquire between 12 and 24 months of age, and children with ASD are no exception. Tr. at 3560,3579. 61interviewing the parents of two-year-olds, Dr. Lord's group found children who lost skills for a month and then began regaining them. They also found children who lost language and who did not talk again for months or years. Tr. at 3568. Most children with regression regain language at levels sim ilar to those who do not experience a loss of skills, but have about a ten point lowe r verbal IQ than those without regression.169 Tr. at 3567. There is a large degree of vari ability in the time between word loss and regaining language skills. Tr. at 3567. At the time of the hearing, Dr. Lord had been involved for three years in a \"baby sibs\" study of infants who have risk factors for autism, to determine if regression can be detected as it happens. Tr. at 3548. Becaus e most of what is known about regression is based, at least partially, on retrospective reports, this study provides an opportunity toassess regression as it happens, and a different picture of regression is emerging. 170 Tr. at 3582-83. For almost all childr en who develop autism, eye contact worsens between 12-24 months. Social engagement and social responsiveness also gets worse. Tr. at 3581. The changes in dev elopment in children who are eventually diagnosed with autism are much more complicated than they were once thought to be. Tr. at 3582. 5. Regression and Prior Abnormal Development. Studies over the last 10 years demonstr ate that most children with regression showed deficits prior to the loss. Tr. at 3570-71, 3577. Some did not. Tr. at 3291; see also Tr. at 2467, 3290-91, 3570. Doctor Rust testified that about 80% of children with what has been called regressive autism had some abnormalities prior to the time theylost skills. 171 Tr. at 2388. Both Drs. Rutter and Lord indicated that reviewing pediatric records is not a 169 This 10-point figure is based on Dr. Lord's own research. Tr. at 3567. She noted that other studies have found no difference. Tr. at 3567. 170 Doctor Lord's testimony about this study was based on findings that have not yet been published and peer reviewed. Tr. at 3598-99. No peer reviewed study covering this data was submittedprior to the closure of the evidentiary record in this case. Doctor Lord disagreed with cross-examinationquestions suggesting that her testimony based on this study was merely anecdotal. She pointed out that her observations were not based on one child, but rather on 50 children who have been followed in a verysystematic way for three years. Tr. at 3602. She also noted that her testimony was largely based on herexperience over the last 35 years, not simply on the toddler study. Tr. at 3605. Although I haveconsidered this evidence (just as I have consider ed as evidence Dr. Deth's current unpublished research (see Section VII.C. below)), I have not accorded Dr. Lord's testimony about this study the same weight I would give a peer reviewed study published in an indexed journal. Nevertheless, three years of systematic personal observations of children by a tr ained observer with 40 years of experience in ASD are entitled to some weight. 171 Doctor Rust testified that this figure was consistent with the medical literature, but was also based on his own, as-yet unpublished research.

The ph ysicians creating the pediatric records are not focused on documenting early signs of autis m, and if abnormalities are not clear cut, they may not record them. A record that re flects concerns, such as assessments that a child has delayed skills, is likely to be valid, but a record that reflects no problems doesnot mean that no problems exist, as the ph ysician may not have noticed them or asked the correct questions, or she may simply have failed to record parental concerns. Tr. at3263, 3571-72. 6. Prevalence of Regression.Studies vary in the reported percentages of children who experience regression, but the range is about 15-50%. 172 Doctor Fombonne noted that the actual rate of regression depends on the criteria used to defi ne it. The questions in the ADI-R which document regression have been revised to detec t more subtle forms of regression, and thus rates may become higher. Tr. at 3670. The prevalence of regression as a percentage of those with autism does not appear to have changed over time.173 Using the same definition of regression, the Fombonne and Chakrabarti study,174 RML 147, examined the trend over time, finding very little difference in the percentage of regression in those born between 1992-95, and those born in 1980 or earlier.175 Tr. at 3673-74; Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 23. Doctor Kinsbourne did not challenge t he evidence regarding the prevalence of regression. However, he drew a causal conc lusion from the fact that the percentage of cases of regression had not changed over time. This conclusion is discussed below. 172 Doctor Kinsbourne's report contained a 20-30% figure. PML 717 at 7. Doctor Rutter testified that it was about 25-33%. Tr. at 3285. Doctor Fombonne estimated it at 15-35%. Tr. at 3670. See also R. Hansen, et al., Regression in Autism: Prevalence and Associated Factors in the CHARGE Study , AMBUL .

The Hansen paper is part of the CHARGE study.176 The study is a very recent examination of 333 California children wit h ASD diagnoses. When regression was defined as the loss of both social sk ills and language, 15% of the children were classified as displaying regression. When loss of either language or social skills was used as the defining criterion, an additional 26% of the children were classified as regressed, for a total of 41%. Tr . at 3671; Hansen, RML 223, at 28. The CHARGE study also looked at w hether regression has distinctive characteristics that would merit consideri ng regressive autism as a separate phenotype in terms of family history, a biological mark er, or a different response to treatment. Tr. at 3671-72. The CHARGE study failed, as have many other studies, to validate that regressive autism is different than non-regr essive autism. The study also examined gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, and sleep problems, and failed to find any differences between the early onset and r egressive groups. Tr. at 3672-73; Hansen, RML 223, at 29. The only areas of significant difference between the children with early onset and regression were in communication, ex pressive language, and lethargy. Although statistically significant, the differences were small. Hansen, RML 223, at 27-28. There were no statistically significant differenc es in demographics or clinical factors. Id. at 29. The authors concluded that the differences observed did not suggest any etiologic differences in the two groups. Id. at 30. b. The Richler Study,177 RML 397. Doctor Lord was the principal investi gator on the Richler study, which was authored by one of Dr. Lord's graduate students. Tr. at 3573. The study used data from a number of sites around the country to investigate whether regressive autism is a separate phenotype of autis m. Tr. at 3574-75. The study began with the hypothesis that ch ildren with regression constituted a 176 \"CHARGE\" stands for Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment. It is an ongoing case-control study with three categories of subjects: (1) children with either autistic disorder orASD; (2) children with developmental delays but not aut istic disorder or ASD; and (3) typically developing children. Hansen, RML 223, at 26. The Hansen study focused on children in the first category. Theauthors used standard ASD screening tests, the ADI-R and the ADOS, in preschool populations ofchildren with autistic disorder and those with ASD. Id. 177 J. Richler, et al., Is There a 'Regressive Phenotype' of Autism Spectrum Disorder Associated with the Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine? A CPEA phenotype, and attempted to det ermine how they were different. Tr. at 3575. However, the evidence did not suppor t the hypothesis. Tr. at 3578-79. They looked at language and the development and acqui sition of social skills before their loss, as well as at gastrointestinal symptoms,178 gender, ethnicity, and birth order in children with regression. These characte ristics were compared to children without regression and to typically developing children to determine if there were characteristics in the regressed children that set them apart. Tr. at 3575. They found only minor differences. Tr . at 3575. Children with regression had slightly lower verbal IQ scores when older , and there was a slightly higher frequency of parental reports of diarrhea and constipation in children with regression. Tr. at 3575-76, 3578. They did not find a clustering of the characteristics that had been suggested as defining regressive autism as a separat e phenotype. Tr. at 3578. The subgroup of children with regression who most closely fit the authors' postulated separate phenotype of regressive autism did not fit petitioner s' \"clearly regressive\" phenotype. This subgroup of children with regression had abnorma l development in the majority of the areas studied prior to their loss of skills. Richler, RML 397, at 313. The weight of the evidence is that child ren with ASD and regression do not differ in any significant respect from children with ASD who did not experience any loss of skills. There does not appear to be a biological difference between those whoexperienced a loss of skills and those who did not. Although most of the brain physiology studies discussed below did not identify whether the brains examined were from individuals with regression, the few that did buttress the conclusion that those who experienced regression and those who did not have the same disorder, not two different ones. E. Brain Physiology. 1. Brain Structures Pertinent to the Neuropathology of ASD. a. Overview. A general understanding of the gross anatomical and cellular structures discussed in the neuropathology studies is helpful, particularly in assessing thesignificance of differences between the brai ns of typically developing individuals and of those with ASDs. This section covers t he gross anatomy of the brain structures and systems discussed in the studies, and the pertinent cell types that comprise them. Most of the material in this subpart was not c ontested; following my usual practice, I have identified areas of disagreement. 178 Children with ASD have a high rate of gastrointestinal problems and dietary selectivity. M. Valicenti-McDermott, et al., Frequency of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders and Association with Family History of Autoimmune Disease , J. DEV. & BEHAV . PEDIATRICS 27(2): S128-36 (2006), filed as PML 299. 65A system refers to a number of structures in the brain that work together, such as the limbic system, discussed below. Autism is generally considered to be a \"systems disorder.\" Although ASD was once thought to be due to localized areas of brain abnormality or a focal brain lesion, current re search indicates that a systems problem is involved. A systems abnormality occurs when interconnections between different partsof the brain are not working properly. Tr. at 3268, 3338. The presence of systems abnormalities has been confirmed by imaging studies, such as a functional MRI, whichexamine brain functioning in relation to spec ific cognitive tasks. These studies have consistently shown a systems problem in ASD. Tr. at 3268-69. The parts of the brain that are working when specific tasks are per formed are different in individuals with autism, as compared to neurotypical individuals. Tr. at 3268-69. b. Anatomy of the Brain. Grossly, the brain consists of three major portions: the brainstem, the cerebellum, and the cerebrum. See Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 2, for an illustration of the parts of the brain. The cerebrum is the largest and most hi ghly evolved portion of the brain. It occupies the upper part of the cranium. 179 The outer portion of the cerebrum is covered by the cerebral cortex, which consists of a superficial, thin layer of gray matter.180 The cortex forms folded bulges, called gyri, with deep furrows or crevices, called sulci. In the cerebral cortex, there are six cell layers , which are sometimes referred to as the neocortex. The layers are numbered from br ain surface inward and include Layer I (the molecular layer),181 II (the external granular layer), III (the external pyramidal layer), IV (the internal granular layer), V (the inter nal pyramidal layer), and VI (the multiform layer). The brain's white matter lies underneath Layer VI.182 These layers include the most highly evolved type of cerebral tissue.183 Minicolumnar structures are found between Layers VI and II, consisting of pyramidal neurons184 ascending vertically, 179 See DORLAND 'S at 336. The cerebrum is subdivided into sections or lobes, but an explication of the subdivisions is not generally necessary to understanding the evidence. 180 Gray matter (\"substantia grisea\") consists primarily of neurons, dendrites, and unmyelinated axons. DORLAND 'S at 1781-82. 181 The subplate zone and Layer I of the cerebral cortex are illustrated on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slides 14, 15, and 17. 182 White matter (\"substantia alba\") consists primarily of myelinated axons and nerve fibers. DORLAND 'S at 1781. 183 See DORLAND 'S at 425, 1006, 1227 (illustration of the layers of the neocortex). 184 Pyramidal cells are triangular-shaped neurons that are found in the pyramidal layers of the cerebral cortex (Layers III and V) and in Layers II and IV. An illustration of pyramidal neurons appears onRes. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 15. synapses.186 cerebellum is an area of the brain lo cated at the back of the head below the cerebrum and behind the brainstem.187 The cortex of the cerebellum consists of three layers, including one of granule cells and one of Purkinje cells (discussed below). Studies relating to Purkinje and granule cells are some of the most significant in both mercury toxicity and the pathophysiology of ASD. The portion of the brainstem primarily discussed is the medulla (sometimes called the medulla oblongata), which is located in the back of the brain. Tr. at 2807. It is a cone of nerve tissue connecting the pons and the spinal cord. 188 The medulla is illustrated on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 5. The inferior olive is a structure found in the medulla, in an area with many neurons. Tr. at 2810. It is the source of the climbing fibers connecting to the Purkinje cells in t he cerebellum. Tr. at 2816. The arcuate nucleus is a small gray matter area of the medulla.189 It is illustrated on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 7.190 The thalamus is a large, dual-lobed mass of gray matter cells located at the top of the brainstem, near the cent er of the brain. It contains groups of nuclei that relay sensory impulses to the cerebral cortex.191 c. The Limbic System. The limbic system is a group of brai n structures involved with autonomic functions and aspects of emotion and behavior.192 It includes the hippocampus, 185 Dendritic arborization refers to the tree- branch appearance of projecting fibers from neurons. See DORLAND 'S at 122. 186 Report of Dr. Casanova, Res. Ex. C, at 5; M. Casanova, et pathology [\"Casanova 2002\"], filed as RML 62. Although he was scheduled to testify, respondent elected not to call Dr. Casanova as a witness for reasons not disclosed. See Tr. at 3235. 187 See DORLAND 'S at 336. 188 See DORLAND 'S at 246, 1113. 189 See DORLAND 'S at 1284. 190 The source of this illustration is A. Bailey, et al., A clinicopathologicial study of autism , BRAIN 121: 889-905 (1998) [\"Bailey 1998\"], filed as PML 220. 191 See DORLAND 'S at 1891. 192 See DORLAND 'S at 1843. 67amygdala,193 and cingulate gyrus.194 The amygdala is connected to the limbic cortex, and is connected by fibers to the hippocampus and thalamus. The cingulate gyrus is a part of the cerebrum near the co rpus callosum. The hippocampus195 is a sheet of neurons located within the temporal lobes of the cerebrum, adjacent to the amygdala. Tr. at 2831. Several of Dr. Kemper's s lides provided illustrations of these brain structures. See, e.g. , Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slides 2, 16, 19, 21. 2. Cellular Structure.The cellular structures of the brai n include neurons and neuroglial cells, which include astrocytes and microglia. Neurons per form the control functions of the brain, while neuroglial cells play a variety of supporting roles. Tr. at 795; D ORLAND 'S at 1254, 1256. In a normal brain state. the thr ee primary cell types-astrocytes, neurons, and microglia-exist in harmony. Tr. at 2241. Both microglia and astroglia are involved in cortical organization and contribute to the regul ation of immune responses in the central nervous system. Pardo, PML 72, at 489.196 Changes in astroglia and microglia can produce both neuronal and synaptic changes that contribute to central nervous system dysfunction. Pardo, PML 72, at 489. a. Neurons. A neuron consists of a cell body, several short arms (called dendrites), and a long arm (called an axon). The axon terminates in a number of small branches andmay have other branches projecti ng from it before its terminus. DORLAND 'S at 1256. The axon is covered with a sheath contai ning myelin and other materials. D ORLAND 'S at 1256; see also DORLAND 'S, Plate 36, at 1244. Prenatally, neurons are created in particula r areas of the brain and migrate along glial fibers to other areas. As they migrat e, they leave behind a trail of axons, which develop and lengthen. Neurons move in a particular trajectory, which can beinterrupted or changed by events such as ear ly damage to the brain. Tr. at 2548-50, 2554; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 77. An early stroke could cause migration to be abnormal, resulting in tangles of cells that do not reach their intended destination. Defects in neuronal migration may also be the result of genetics or other factors. Tr. at 2551-52. Astrocytes facilitate the migration of neur ons, as well as ensuring their survival. 193 See DORLAND 'S at 421 (corpus amygdaloideum). 194 See DORLAND 'S at 806. 195 See DORLAND 'S at 853. 196 C. Pardo, et al., Immunity, neuroglia and neuroinflammation , REV. (2005) [\"Pardo\"], filed as PML 72. 68Tr. at 2410. Neurons can be grown in cult ure without astrocytes, but once the neurons mature, astrocytes must be present or the neurons will die off. Tr. at 2410. (1) Purkinje Cells. Purkinje cells are a type of GABAergic197 giant neuron found in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellar cortex. They appear on slides as huge gray cells and are so large thatthey can be seen on slides with t he naked eye. Tr. at 2882, 3027; D ORLAND 'S at 325. Doctor Kemper called them the \"boss cell[s] of the cerebella r cortex.\" Tr. at 2812. Axons from other neurons in the inferior olive travel to the cerebellum and form a \"basket-like nest\"198 in which each Purkinje cell rests.199 Purkinje cells appear in discrete layers or rows and can be easily c ounted, in contrast to small neurons, which do not form such layers. Tr. at 2405. (2) Granule Cells. Granule cells200 are small neurons found in the gr anular layers of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. See also Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 9. They are associated with Purkinje cells such that destruction of Purkinje cells may lead to destruction ofassociated granule cells. Tr. at 2814. b. Glial Cells. 201 Neuroglial cells are the supportive tiss ue of the central nervous system. They include microglia and astrocytes, as well as several other cell types not discussed. DORLAND 'S at 324; Tr. at 509. (1) Astrocytes. Astrocytes (sometimes referred to as \"a stroglia\") are star-shaped cells that have caretaker functions in the brain. Tr. at 795. Astrocytes function as a barrier between 197 \"GABA\" is gamma aminobutyric acid. DORLAND 'S at 747. \"GABAergic\" refers to inhibitory neurons, those which secrete GABA, primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Tr. at 2812-13, 2882. Neurotransmitters are chemicals used by neurons to communicate cell to cell. Tr. at 795-96. 198 See DORLAND 'S at 318 (basket cell). 199 A photograph of Purkinje cells appears on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 9; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 11, slide 12; Tr. at 3028 (the axons forming the basket stain black when treated with an immunocytochemical stain for neurofilaments). Tr. at 2405. 200 See DORLAND 'S at 321. 201 The term \"glial\" is used to describe brain cells that are not neurons. Tr. at 509. 69microglia and neurons, communicating with both and trying to maintain a homeostatic state. Tr. at 2241-42. They comprise bet ween 25% and 50% by volume of the cells in the central nervous system.202 Astrocytes respond to and prevent the build up of neurotransmitters and affect the permeability of the blood brain barrier. Pardo, PML 72, at 489. In addition to their other functions, astrocytes chemically detect invaders and activate microglia. Tr. at 798-99. Gliosis is the proliferation of astrocytes. Tr. at 2243. In gliosis, the astrocyte's nucleus and cytoplasm enlarge and they are more readily stained with glial fibrial acidic protein [\"GFAP\"]. Tr. is the \"gold standard\" in identifying astroglial cells, because the stain reacts only with astroglial cells. It will not stain neurons or other types of glial cells. Tr. at 2879-80. Although Dr. Kinsbourne testified that glial scars are formed from dying astrocytes,203 Dr. Johnson testified that Dr. Kinsbourne was incorrect. Glial scarring is actually the result of activation of astro cytes moving into an area of the brain that has been damaged. Once there, astrocytes secret e proteins that lay down a matrix that forms the scar. Tr. at 2244. Astrocyt e death is not required for and is not a consequence of gliosis. See Tr. at 2852. (2) Microglia. Microglia play a number of roles in the brain. When activated,204 they function as the macrophages or phagocytes205 of the brain, as a part of the brain's innate immune system. Tr. at 2893. They also play a ro le in the development of the nervous system and brain. Tr. at 2426, 2850. Microglia are pr imarily dormant, in contrast to astrocytes and neurons, which are always active. Tr. at 798. When activated, microglia undergo chemical changes that cause them to sw ell. Microglia also emit cytokines206 and 202 See M. Aschner, et al., Involvement of glutamate and reactive oxygen species in methylmercury neurotoxicity, BRAZILIAN J. MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL RES. 40: 285-91, 286 (2007) [\"Aschner 2007\"], filed 203 Doctor Kinsbourne testified somewhat inconsistently about gliosis, calling it evidence of astrocytic death (Tr. at 876); \"an overgrowth which leads to a scarring\" (Tr. at 876); and an excess ofastrocytes, which die and leave the appearance of scars in the brain (Tr. at 877). 204 Microglial activation means that glial cells are more prominent within the tissue. The cytoplasm of the cells is enlarged and the nucleus may also be. Tr. at 2849. 205 Phagocytes are cells that engulf other cells. Microglia are sometimes called \"gitter\" cells. DORLAND 'S at 321, 323. As part of the brain's immune system, microglia clean up debris, such as dead or dying cells and toxins.

Microglia also emit reactive oxygen species, which can cause oxidative stress. Tr. at 799. These substances may damage any cell in the vicinity, not simply the invader. Tr. at 799-800. Microglia also work to repair damage to other cells, such as neurons. Tr. at 2242; Pardo, PML 72, at 489. Microglial acti vation can be beneficial, as a response to a disease process, dysfunction, or injury, rat her than its cause. Tr. at 2851; Pardo, PML 72, at 489. F. Developmental Abnormalities and Dysmorphology. 1. Overview. Physical findings, such as co-occurring minor physical abnormalities and increased head circumference and brain volume in some children with ASDs haveprovided clues to the processes by which ASD originates. Minor abnormalities, such as extra teeth, occur with greater frequency in a number of disorders, including schizophrenia, ADHD, and ASD, than in the gener al population. The nature of these disorders suggests a prenatal trigger for both the physical abnormality and the developmental disorder. Tr. at 3269-70. Increased head circumference and brain volume in many children with ASD during ce rtain periods of development after birth provide another clue to the origin of ASD symptoms. Tr. at 2389. This subpart discusses some specific developmental abnormalities that occur with greater frequency in children with ASD s, and when those abnormalities occurred. It also discusses the phenomenon of head and brain overgrowth, which suggests aproblem with the brain forming too many c onnections or failing to prune unneeded ones, which may cause both the brain overgrowth and some of autism's symptoms. The Courchesne 2005 207 literature survey contains a lengt hy discussion of studies of brain overgrowth in ASD and its possible connections to ASD symptoms. 2. Dysmorphology, Head Circumf erence, and Neuropeptide Findings. a. Dysmorpology. Doctor Rodier provided most of the testimony and other evidence concerning dysmorphology in ASD. Many children with autism have craniofacial dysmorphologies, 207 See E. Courchesne, et al., Autism at the beginning: Microstructural and growth abnormalities underlying the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of autism , DEV. & ear abnormalities and wide-set eyes,208 at a rate exceeding that of the general population.209 Tr. at 3028-29. She used the ear abnormalities to illustrate the probable timing for ASD's origins. During gestation, ears form low on the neck of human embryos, and as the embryo ages, the ears migrate and twist to an upright position near the eyes. Tr. at 3029. In many children with autism, a typi cal ear malposition is found, with the ears lower than the eyes and rotated posteriorly. Because the ears are in place at around the 12th week of gestation, low-set, posteriorly rotated ears are evidence of an insult to development that occurred ear ly in the prenatal period.210 Tr. at 3029-30. Doctor Rodier could not opine on whether the ear malpositioning was the result of a genetic defect or a prenatally-occurring environmental factor, but she concluded that the co- occurrence of this dysmorphology and aut ism suggested a common cause early in gestation. Tr. at 3049-50. b. Head Circumference and Brain Overgrowth. The brain grows in size between birth and three years of age, when the head is close to adult size. Tr. at 2402. Brain dev elopment continues until at least 24 years of age. Tr. at 2402. However, the brains of children with ASD and children with Rett's disorder enlarge at times when typically dev eloping brains do not, suggesting that there is an ongoing elaboration of neural interconnections. Tr. at 2403. Head circumference increases are not diagnostic indicators for autism, but they are distinctive findings that set ASD apart fr om other neurodevelopmental disorders. Tr. at 3331. This differs from the more cons istent reports of microcephaly seen in Rett's disorder and many cases of intellectual disab ility. Tr. at 3331-32. Virtually all of the studies of head circumference have found in creased head size in cohorts of children with ASD as compared to typically developi ng children, although the studies vary on when in the first two years of development t he increased head circumference manifests. 208 Although she did not discuss any studies on eye pos ition abnormalities, Dr. Rodier testified that more children with autism have eyes that are too fa r apart than the neurotypical population. Tr. at 3030. She provided pictures of two boys with ASD and wide- set eyes. Both boys were exposed in utero to valproic acid, an environmental cause of autism. Tr. at 3030-31. 209 Based on her own work, Dr. Rodier testified that about 50% of autistic children have some dysmorphology and that her estimate was similar to that of another investigator. Tr. at 3052. 210 One of her papers recounted a group of children in Nova Scotia with autism, 42% of whom had the ear rotation dysmorphology, versus 18% of the cont rol children. Tr. at 3048-49. P. Rodier, et al., Minor Malformations and Physical Measurements in Autism: Data from Nova Scotia , TERATOL . 55: 319-25 (1997), filed as RML 401. 72Some studies have shown a smaller head size at birth;211 others have found no differences in birth head size from typically developing children.212 Tr. at 2836-37. Doctor Kemper discussed several of these head circumference and brain volume studies.213 Tr. at 2835-38. Although the studies we re not entirely consistent concerning the precise time frame in which the growth occurs,214 increased head circumference in those subsequently diagnosed with ASD is a co mmon finding. Tr. at 2870-72. Nearly all the studies found that the increase in head circumference occurs before a diagnosis of ASD can reliably be made. See, e.g., Dawson 2007, RML 108, at 463. c. Neuropeptide Testing. 211 E. Courchesne, et al., Evidence of Brain Overgrowth in the First Year of Life in Autism , JAMA 290(3): 337-44 (2003) [\"Courchesne 2003\"], filed as RML 94. This study found that head circumference at birth was slightly lower than average. 212 See, e.g. , K. Hobbs, et al., A Retrospective Fetal Ultrasound Study of Brain Size in Autism , BIOL. PSYCHIATRY 62: 1048-55, 1053 (2007), filed as RML 239 (finding mean fetal brain size at mid- gestation to be normal in individuals later diagnos ed with autism, but an increased discrepancy between standardized biparietal diameter and head circumference, suggesting a subtle imbalance in brain growth, with brain width increased relative to brain growth as a whole).

[\"Lainhart RML 289. I note that Dr. Rodier was a co-author of this study. The Redcay and Courchesne meta-analysis, RML 391, demonstrated that, in the year after birth, there was a dramatic increase in brain growth in children with ASD, followed by a period when braingrowth slowed. By adolescence, brain size in autis tics was about the same as that of controls. Tr. at 2836. The Courchesne 2003 study, RML 94, showed that infants later diagnosed with autism had asteady increase in brain growth over the first five m onths of life, and by six to 14 months, had a significant increase in head growth. Tr. at 2837. The Dementieva study showed a remarkable level of head growthin autistic children from birth to one month of age. Tr. at 2837. The Lainhart 2006 study indicated thathead circumference relative to height tended to be larger in individuals with autism, and increased head circumference was associated with more severe social algorithm scores on the ADI-R.

PSYCHIAT . 62: 1366-76, 1371 (2005) [\"Hazlett\"], filed as RML 230 (finding normal head circumference at birth, with a significant ly increased rate of growth beginning at 12 months); Dawson 2007, RML 108, at 461 (head circumference in children with ASD was nearly one standarddeviation larger than national norms by one year of age). 73The Nelson study, RML 353,215 found neuropeptide abnormalities in umbilical cord blood of children who were subsequently diagnosed with autism, finding nodifferences in children diagnosed as having experienced early onset or regression. Nelson, RML 353, at 302. Doctor Fombonne commented that the similarity of the findings suggested biological similarity in children with and without regression. 216 Res. Ex. E, \u00b6 62. 3. Discussion. Although not by any means dispositive of the question of autism's origins, the dysmorphology findings suggest a time frame in common with the early gestationalorigin of the dysmorphology. Doctor R odier conceded that co-occurring conditions could have separate causes, with an event early in gestation causing the malpositioning and a later event causing the autism, but she indicated that a scientist would not propose a second event without evidence t hat it occurred. Tr. at 3050. Larger head circumference measurements and brain volume increases after birth in children with autism do not conflict with a prenatal origin for ASD. As Dr. Rust testified, at each phase of brain developm ent, genetic signals turn on processes that result in elaboration, development, and eliminati on of brain structures. Tr. at 2403. This may involve the over-elaboration of connections, which results in the forming of toomany connections between brain cells and neurons that are too densely packed. Tr. at 2412. This may account for the increase in head circumference and brain volume seenin ASD. Tr. at 2403. Doctor Rutter concurred, noting that there is an overgrowth of neurons and neuronal connections between birth and age two and a similar period of growth inadolescence in neurotypical individuals. Along with the growth, there is a pruning of connections that are not working or are no l onger necessary. Tr. at 3334. The increase in head size seen in ASD may be due to exce ssive overgrowth or a failure to prune connections. Tr. at 3335. Environmental in sults between birth and age two could affect the pruning or overgrowth, but there is no evi dence that indicates this is likely. Tr. at 3335. 215 K. Nelson, Toward a biology of autism: possible role of certain neuropeptides and [\"Nelson\"], filed as RML 353. 216 Although only 69 children with autism were studied, the values of two or more of the neuropeptides measured were higher in 97% percent of the children with autism than in any of the 54control children, a remarkably consistent finding. Nelson, RML 353, at Table 1. 74G. Pathophysiology in the Brains and Cer ebrospinal Fluid [\"CSF\"] of ASD Patients. 1. Overview. Much of what is known about the origins of autism and how the brains of those with the disorder differ from those of neurotypical individuals comes from autopsy studies 217 performed on a relatively small number of brains.218 Several such studies were filed on the master lists of scientific and technical journal articles, but two of the researchers involved in these studies also testified as respondent's experts, Drs. Rodier and Kemper. Doctor Kemper and his re search partner, Dr. Margaret Bauman, published their first paper on the neuropathology of autism in 1985. The prevailing view at that time was that autism was caused by poor parenting or some environmental factor. The autopsy studies found structural differences in the brains, establishing a biological basis for ASD. Tr. at 2798. The or igin of many of the differences found could be dated to early in the first trimester of pregnancy. See Tr. at 2833. The findings were relatively consistent among the various studies and research facilities. Although not all brains studied had all of the features that, as a group, distinguished the brains of those with autism from those of neurotypical individuals, there was consistency in the areas in whic h changes were observed and in the types of changes found. Almost all of the brains exhibited some of the pathological changes found in most autistic brains. Tr. at 2799-2800, 2803, 3056. This consistency extended across the age range of the brai ns examined. Tr. at 2800. Several caveats should be noted, in addition to the small numbers of brains upon which these findings are based. First, none of the brains autopsied were from children under the age of three, and thus the neuropat hological changes noted may not reflect findings present at the time autis m's symptoms first manifested. See Tr. at 2800. Second, some of the changes observed in only one or two brains may have been theresult of something other than ASD that mi mics ASD's symptoms. Third, particularly with regard to the Vargas study, 219 PML 69, some of the findings may, as the authors 217 The autopsy studies are important because they can look at brains with a level of detail not achievable in functional MRI scans and PET scans of living brains. Tr. at 2866. 218 By Dr. Kemper's account, a total of 23 brains have been studied. Tr. at 2864. Doctor Rodier concurred. Tr. at 3037-38. 219 D. Vargas, et al., Neuroglial Activation and Neuroinflammation in the Brains of Patients with Autism , ANN. NEUROL . 57: 67-81 (2005) [\"Vargas\"], filed as PML 69. The Vargas study examined brain tissue and CSF from autistic patients, looking for neuroglial and inflammatory reactions and for cytokine expression. PML 69 at abstract. Brain tissue from 11 patients was examined for cellular and inflammatoryreactions. Additionally, cytokine profiling was perfo rmed on fresh frozen brain tissue from seven deceased patients and on CSF from six living patients. A ll of the living patients had experienced developmental regression. Id. at abstract. The brain samples were compared to controls, none of whom had epilepsy or mental retardation. Id. at 68, Table 1. The CSF samples of the ASD patients were compared to control 75noted, reflect either a response to earlier injury, an on-going pathological process, or both. PML 69 at 78. The findings from the Bailey 1998220 and Hutsler221 studies, as well as those performed by Drs. Kemper and Rodier per sonally, discussed below, were not generally contested. The petitioners relied primarily on two studies , the Vargas study, PML 69, and the Lopez-Hurtado study, PML 446.222 Respondent also relied on the Vargas study, with the primary area of dis agreement being the interpretations placed on the findings. In this regard, a later paper, Pardo, PML 72, co-authored by three of the Vargas study researchers, provides some insights into interpretation of the Vargas findings. Additionally, a letter from Dr. Pardo to Dr . Kemper, generated as a result of their scientific discussions, was filed as Res. Ex. BB.223 The letter also helps explain what the Vargas researchers found. See Tr. at 2848-49. The only autopsy study that was serious ly criticized was the Lopez-Hurtado study. The criticisms ranged from the statis tical methods used to confusion regarding precisely what cells were counted. 2. Early Studies. Doctors Kemper and Bauman began publishing autopsy studies of autistic brains in 1985. See M. Bauman and T. Kemper, Histoanatomic observations of the brain in early infantile autism , N EUROL . 35: 866-74 (1985), filed as PML 509. A summary of their samples from much older patients who had no evidence of central nervous system inflammatory disorders or pathological processes. Id. at 69 and Table 2. 220 PML 220. Doctor Rutter was one of the researchers on this study. 221 J. Hutsler, et al., Histological and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Assessment of Cortical Layering and Thickness in Autism Spectrum Disorders , BIOL. PSYCHIATRY 61: 449-57 (2007) [\"Hutsler\"], filed as RML 249. 222 E. Lopez-Hurtado and J. Prieto, A Microscopic Study of Language-Related Cortex in Autism 4(2): 130-45 (2008) [\"Lopez-Hurtado\"], filed as PML 446. 223 In response to petitioners' concerns about whether Dr. Pardo's letter (Res. Ex. BB) constituted an expert report, respondent agreed to contact Dr. Pardo to determine if he would be available for cross-examination about the content of the letter. Tr. at 3374. However, it appeared that petitioners wanted toquestion him about other matters, rather than simply about the letter. See Tr. at 3374. In any event, respondent eventually decided not to call Dr. Pardo. Tr. at 3375. As there is no explcit right of cross-examination in Vaccine Act cases ( see \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2)(D)), the dispute over the admissibility of Dr. Pardo's letter is largely academic. Because he did not testify as a witness, I have not accorded the letterthe weight I would give to a testifying expert's report, and have considered it primarily as evidence clarifying matters contained in the Vargas study, PML 69, and the Pardo paper, PML 72. 76work appears in Chapter 7 of one of their books. See Bauman and Kemper 1994,224 RML 38, at 124. Although later papers hav e described additional brain studies and have reviewed the findings of other researchers in addition to their own ( see, e.g. , M. Bauman and T. Kemper, Neuroanatomic observations of the brain in autism: a review and future directions , INT'L. PML 306), the book chapter, RML 38, provides significant detail about the first six brains studied and appear s to be the source for a number of the photographs used as slides during Dr. Kemper's testimony. 3. Specific Neuroanatomical Changes in Brains of ASD Subjects. The Pardo paper provided a concise summary of the most prominent neuropathological changes in autism. T he authors characterized them as cytoarchitectural organizational abnormalities of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and other subcortical structures, including: (1) densely packed small neurons; (2) loss and atrophy of Purkinje cells, primarily in the neocerebellar cortex; (3) a curtailment of normal development of neurons in the limbi c system and changes in neuronal size and number in the nucleus of the band of Broca, ce rebellar nuclei, and inferior olive; and (4) more numerous, smaller, and less compact mini columnar structures in the frontal and temporal regions of the brain. PML 72, at 486-87. Many of these relatively consistent findings from the autopsy studies also indi cated when in the development of the brain the problems likely arose, based on when those brain structures were created or moved into permanent place.225 a. Densely Packed Small Neurons. In both the Hutsler (RML 249)226 and Bailey 1998 (PML 220)227 studies, the 224 M. BAUMAN AND T. KEMPER , Neuroanatomic observations of the brain in autism , in THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF AUTISM Ch. 7 (1st ed. 1994) [\"Bauman and Kemper 1994\"], filed as RML 38. 225 As the human brain forms, various structural changes take place. See Tr. at 2805; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 4 (template of brain developmental events). 226 The Hutsler study evaluated cortical layeri ng and thickness in postmortem brains of eight individuals with autism spectrum diagnoses and eight age- and sex-matched controls, using structural MRI to assess cortical thickness in frontal, parietal, and te mporal lobes. The researchers also used histological sections to assess the pattern of cortical layering in the superior frontal gyrus, the superior parietal lobule, and the middle temporal gyrus. Hutsler, RML 249, at 449. The Bailey 1998 and Hutsler studies foundvery similar pathological changes. Tr. at 2804; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 3 (tables comparing the findings from the two studies). 227 The Bailey 1998 study involved the more severe cases of autism in the neuropathology studies, examining brain tissue from six subjects with mental retardation and autism, matched with five controls. Tr. at 2875; Bailey 1998, PML 220, at 889, 891. The investigators performed neuronal counts on sectionsfrom the medial aspect of the superior frontal gy rus, the hippocampus, and the Purkinje layer of the superior aspect of the cerebellar hemisphere. PML 220 at 892. The whole brains were also visually 77researchers found an increased number of neurons in the white matter.228 Tr. at 2827. The neurons in the cerebral cortex are bor n between two zones, the subplate and Layer I (the top layer of the cerebral cortex). Tr . at 2822-23; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 14. The subplate, which is very important for the est ablishment of cerebral cortical circuitry, is present prenatally, but disappears shortly after birth; neurotypical adult brains have very few neurons in Layer I. Tr. at 2823. Autistic brains display an abnormal settling ordistribution of neurons within t he cerebral cortex. Tr. at 2824, 2828-29; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slides 15 and 17. These neurons should have disappeared shortly after birth. Tr. at2828. The increased number of neurons in Lay er I and in the white matter in autistic brains represents, according to Dr. Kemper, a persistence of the embryonic zone. Tr. at 2829. These defects likely occurred at 16-20 weeks of gestation. Tr. at 2830-31; see also Vargas, PML 69, at 79 (suggesting that thei r findings might represent a persistent fetal pattern of development). b. Loss of Purkinje Cells. A decreased number of Purkinje cells is one of the most consistent neuropathological findings in autism. Tr. at 2804, 2815. This consistency may be due both to the prevalence of the loss in the samples studied 229 and to the relative ease with which Purkinje cells can be detected and counted.230 When Purkinje cells are lost early in development, the comparable c ohort of granule cells decreases.231 Tr. at 2814. Based on a number of pathological clues, t he decrease in the number of Purkinje examined, with a number of abnormal findings grossly apparent. PML 220, Figures 2, 3, 8, 10. The study sets forth the pathological findings in a series of t ables, each focusing on a specific area of the brain. See PML 220, Table 2 (cerebral cortex and underlying white matter), Table 3 (brainstem), and Table 4(cerebellum). 228 The dark blue dots on the photograph at Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 17, are neurons. In the control brain pictured on this slide, there are only occasi onal neurons in the white matter, but a much larger number appear in the autistic brain. Tr. at 2827-28. The photographs also illustrate the lack of ademarcation between the cortex and the white matter in the autistic brain. Tr. at 2828. 229 The Vargas study found evidence of Purkinje loss in every brain sampled, except one. PML 69 at 71. The Bailey 1998 study found a decreased number of Purkinje cells in five of the six brains studied. See PML 220 at 898, Table 4. See also Bauman and Kemper 1994, RML 38, at 124 (noting a loss of Purkinje cells in all six brains studied). 230 Unlike smaller neurons, which are numerous and scattered throughout tissue, the much larger Purkinje cells form rows in the same layers of brain tissue. A series of photographs on Res. Tr. Ex. 10,slide 9, of Purkinje cells in autistic and control brain sections demonstrates the loss. Compare Box B (autistic brain) with Box C (control brain) . Box B shows a profound loss of Purkinje cells and an attendant loss of granule cells as illustrated by the light staining. Tr. at 2813-14. 231 The photograph on the right side of Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 9, shows a mild loss of Purkinje cells with relative preservation of granule cells. Tr. at 2813. Box B on the same slide shows a profound loss ofPurkinje cells and an attendant loss of granule cells. Tr. at 2813-14. 78cells can be traced to a specific period of prenatal development. The inferior olive projects climbing fibers to the Purkinje ce lls in the cerebellum, with one projection to about 15 Purkinje cells. Tr. at 2816. A clim bing fiber from the inferior olive surrounds the Purkinje cell, creating a basket ar ound it and the surrounding dendritic tree that connects the brain stem to the Purkinje ce ll. Tr. at 2807, 2816-17, 3028; Res. Tr. Ex. 11, slide 12. Climbing fibers reach Purkin je cells at about 29-30 weeks of gestation.232 If the Purkinje cells are lost after birth, the inferior olivary neurons are also lost. Tr. at 2817-18. Because the brains of autistic indi viduals show a loss of Purkinje cells but no loss of the inferior olivary neurons, the Purkin je cells were lost before the relationship between them and the olivary neurons wa s established. Tr. at 2818-20, 3028. Using GFAP staining,233 the Vargas researchers found marked reactivity of a type of astroglia in areas of Purkinje cell loss. PML 69 at 71. Other immunochemical studies and microscopic evaluations found \"that mi croglia and astroglia reactions in the cerebellum were both closely associated with degenerating Purkinje cells....\" Id. Purkinje cells displaying degenerative changes were strongly immunoreactive for ananti-inflammatory cytokine, tu mor growth factor [\"TGF\"]- 1. 234 Id. at 75. Increased levels of the MCP-1 chemokine235 were found as well. The MCP-1 chemokine is expressed in the cerebellum during prenatal development and may be associated with the maturation of Purkinje cells. Id. at 79. The authors sp eculated that the neuroglia reaction might indicate that the Pu rkinje cell damage continued beyond early development, and might result from the vul nerability of Purkinje cells to whatever pathogenic process caused the cells to be lost in the first place, or it might reflect \"persistent fetal patterns of brain development.\" Id. at 79. c. Other Neuronal Changes. Arrested neuronal migration236 in the inferior olive and arcuate nucleus in the 232 The development of the human cerebellar cortex from nine weeks of gestation through seven months after birth is illustrated by a series of sketches on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 11. Tr. at 2818-19. At 25weeks of gestation, the climbing fibers are presen t, but they have not yet formed connections with the Purkinje cells. Tr. at 2819. During the next five weeks of gestation, they envelop the Purkinje cells, and,by birth, have done so densely. Tr. at 2819-20. 233 GFAP measurements were used to assess astroglial activation. Vargas, PML 69, at 69. 234 The term \"transforming growth factor\" is also used to refer to TGF- 1. See DORLAND 'S at 1890. 235 Chemokines are small molecular weight cytokines. D ORLAND 'S at 344. In addition to their role in inflammation, they help regulate the immune syst em, and they may play other roles in the central nervous system. Id. 236 This migration pattern is illustrated by small arrows on the drawing on the right side of Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 5. Tr. at 2808. The arrested migration is illustrated on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 6. Tr. at 2808-09. 79medulla were reported by both Dr. Kemper237 and the Bailey 1998 study, PML 220. Tr. at 2808-09. This migration occurs ear ly in gestation. Tr. at 2807-08. The neurons in the inferior olive do not normally line up in rows. In autistic brains, the neurons show an abnormal layering or lined up appearance, reflecting aproblem in neuronal migration at up to 14-16 weeks of gestation. 238 Tr. at 2810-11. This finding has been present in all the brains that Dr. Kemper has examined. Tr. at 2811. There are distinct differences in the inferior olive itself in the brains of those with autism, with autistic children having larger neurons. Tr. at 2820-21; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 12 (age-matched autistic and control brai ns of children). A different pattern emerges in adult autistic brains, with large neurons absent and abnormal patterns of layering of small neurons in the same region. Tr. at 2821; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 13. What happens to induce this change between age 13 and adulthood is unknown. Tr. at2821. Doctor Kemper interpreted the findi ng as indicating abnormal circuitry in the cerebellum. Tr. at 2821. Changes that cannot be related to a spec ific period of brain development have been found in the hippocampus, with densely packed neurons found in the brains of autistic patients. Tr. at 2831-32; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slides 19-20. d. Minicolumnar Changes. Pyramidal cells form into vertical struct ures called minicolumns which are highly complex networks of neurons connected lo cally and at longer distances reaching through several layers of the neocortex. 239 See Res. Ex. C, at 5. Minicolumns are banded on both sides by the peripheral neurophil space, which contains few cells, but many unmyelinated axon fibers, dendritic arborizations, and synapses. Dendrites from pyramidal cells in Layer V ascend in bundles through or adjacent to the cell column. The edges of the minicolumns contain vert ical bundles of fibers containing GABAergic interneurons that distinguish one minicolu mn from its neighbors. Casanova 2002, RML 62, at 428. 237 See M. Bauman and T. Kemper, Structural Brain Anatomy in Autism: What is the Evidence? in THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF AUTISM 121 (2d ed. 2005 )[\"Bauman and Kemper 2005B\"], filed as RML 39. 238 This is illustrated on Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 8. 239 Information regarding the minicolumnar studies was presented primarily in Dr. Casanova's expert report (Res. Ex. C) and his studies. The Casanova 2002 study, RML 62, described the generaldesign of minicolumns. It included several photogr aphs and tables illustrating the differences between autistic subjects and neurotypical controls in minico lumns in the cerebellar cortex. The study compared the number of minicolumns, their width, and neuronal dispersion in the columns. Casanova 2002, RML62, at 428. 80In the brains of ASD patients, mini columns are narrower, smaller, and less compact, with reductions in the neurophil spac e. Casanova, RML 62, at 430. The neurons are present in equal numbers, but are more dispersed. Id. at 431, Fig. 3. The total number of minicolumns is determined at about five to six weeks after conception, before cells migrate from the cortex. Tr. at 2805. 4. The Vargas Study, the Par do Paper, and the Lopez-Hurtado Study. Because Drs. Deth and Kinsbourne relied heav ily on the Vargas study, the Pardo paper, and the Lopez-Hurtado study, these pub lications are discussed at somewhat greater length. a. The Vargas Study. The brains of the autistic patients s howed extensive microglial and astroglial activation. The most prominent histologica l changes were found in the cerebellum, with a patchy loss of neurons in the Purkinje cell la yer and in the granular cell layer. Vargas, PML 69, at 71. Staining for GFAP showed ma rked reactivity of astroglia in areas of Purkinje cell loss, and marked astroglial activation in the granular cell layer andcerebellar white matter. In the middle frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, prominent astroglia reactions were obser ved in the subcortical white matter. In the fresh frozen brain tissue, ther e was increased GFAP expression in the cerebellum. Microglial activation was m easured and was observed in the granular cell layer and white matter of the cerebellum. Vargas, PML 69, at 71. There were no differences in microglial or astroglial activation based on age, developmental regression, or retardation in t he autistic patients. Vargas, PML 69, at 71. Microglial activation in the cerebellar white matter was significantly elevated in patients with a history of epilepsy, but no differ ences were observed in other regions. Id. Astroglial activation was similar in aut istic patients with and without epilepsy. Id. There were consistently higher levels of certain cytokine subsets in the fresh frozen tissue of the autistic brains. Anti-i nflammatory tumor growth factor [\"TGF\"]- 1 was increased in several areas, and proinflammatory chemokines were increased insimilar areas. Vargas, PML 69, at 73. The researchers determined that reactive astrocytes were the main source of cytokines in the brains of the autistic patients. Id. at 74-75. Cerebrospinal fluid of patients with autism showed a significant increase in both proinflammatory and modulatory cytokines. Id. at 75. The authors concluded that the micr oglial and astroglial reactions were neuorinflammatory reactions associated wit h the central nervous system's innate 81immune response.240 Vargas, PML 69, at 75. The neuroglial activation was consistent with chronic and sustained neuroinflammation.241 The microglial responses resembled those seen in neurodegenerative disorders, in cluding Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS, and in those seen in HIV dementia. Id. at 77. Both microglia and astroglia are essential for neuronal activity and synaptic function, neuronal-glial interactions, and cort ical organization during brain development. Microglial and astroglial responses may both directly cause and protect against injury. The significant question that remains unanswered by this study is when duringdevelopment the activation of neuroglial cells occurred. Vargas, PML 69, at 78. The neuroglial reactions in the cerebellum were mo st prominent, a finding that is consistent with previous observations of prenatal dev elopmental abnormalities in the cerebellar regions of autistic patients (abnormalities in the inferior olive and a reduced number of Purkinje cells), but also indicating that the degenerative processes in the cerebellum continue postnatally and beyond. Id. at 78-79. The authors suggested that the cytokines and chemokines found in increased amounts in autistic patients provided clues to the pathogenesis of autism. Vargas, PML 69, at 79. They linked increased levels of a proinflammatory chemokine (MCP-1) to microglial activation and recruitment of macrophages to areas of neurodegeneration in the cerebellum. The increased levels of TGF- 1 in the cortex and cerebellum suggest a response to an injury, because this anti-inflammatory cytokine is involved in tissueremodeling after an injury. It is also ex pressed during cell death, perhaps to suppress local inflammation and prevent additional cell degeneration. TGF- 1 was found primarily within reactive astrocytes and neurons in the cerebellum. The pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokine profiles were markedl y elevated in the anterior cingulate gyrus, another area associated with dysfunctional brain activity in autism. Id. at 79. Several of respondent's witnesses comment ed on the significance of the Vargas study's findings. Doctor Johnson noted that brain trauma results in inflammatory responses, including massive microglial activation and gliosis associated with thatdamage. Tr. at 2245. He also noted that activated microglia may have both positive and negative aspects. Tr. at 2243. Doctor Kemper commented that a likely explanation for the neuroinflammatory process found in t he Vargas study is pathology that has its origin in events that occurred prenatally, al though postnatal insults are also possible. Tr. at 2895. Doctor Rutter commented that the changes observed were interesting, but their meaning was uncertain given the different ro les for glial activation in the brain. Tr. 240 There was no evidence of any significant B or T cell reactions; no immunoglobulins were deposited in any neuronal or neuroglial cells. Vargas, PML 69, at 72. Their absence indicates a lack ofadaptive immune response. See id . at 75. 241 Neuroinflammation reflects activation of micr oglia and astroglia and the chemicals they use to communicate with one another to suppress negative effects in the brain. Tr. at 2243. It is a dynamicsystem, and activated microglia may have both positive and negative aspects. Tr. at 2243. 82at 3336. The neuroinflammation does not show what changes are happening or when they are happening. Tr. at 3337. b. The Pardo Paper and Letter. Three of the authors of the Vargas study also collaborated on a subsequent article, Pardo, PML 72. This paper di scussed the neurobiology of autism and the Vargas' study's findings. The authors noted that neuronal dysf unction and cortical organizational abnormalities may lead to neuroglial activation. The activated neuroglial responses mayactually increase, rather than ameliorate , the magnitude of the neuronal dysfunction. Pardo, PML 72, at 489, 490 (suggesting t hat the neuroglial activation may have a dichotomous role in brain inflammatory responses). Although the authors suggested that the activated microglia might be a respons e to genetic or environmental factors, all of the possible environmental factors ident ified were ones that occur prenatally. Id. at 490; see also id. at 487-88 (discussing maternal ant ibodies affecting prenatal brain development). They concluded the paper by hypothesizing that environmental factors, including neurotoxins, infections, and maternal infe ctions, may, in the presence of genetic susceptibility, play a role in the developm ent of abnormalities in brain structure and in the neuroinflammatory changes they observed. Id. at 493. However, Dr. Pardo's letter indicated that the effects found were not cons istent with a toxic exposure. Res. Ex. BB at 1; Tr. at 2903. 5. The Lopez-Hurtado Study. a. Findings. This was an autopsy study comparing three brain regions associated with language and speech in individuals with autism to age-matched controls. PML 446 at130. The findings differed remarkably from those of other autopsy studies. Unlike other studies, the authors did not find evidence of altered neuronal migration in the areas examined. PML 446 at 140. Also unlike ot her studies, the investigators reported \"a striking reduction in neuronal density in [specific brain areas] in autism relative tocontrols.\" PML 446 at 140. Neuronal dens ity findings suggested that neuronal death ensues as a result of aging, a phenomenon also seen in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,and major depressive disorder. 242 See PML 446 at 140-41. The investigators reported 242 Doctor Johnson noted that neurodegeneration and chronic astrocytic and microglial activation leads to death, not autism. In autism, patient s plateau, but in the chronic neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases he studies, such as Alzheime r's and Parkinson's, the patients die. Tr. at 2255-56. 83a greater density of glial cells243 in the autistic brains, but not in the granular layers. They found a steep linear increase in glial ce ll density in the autistic subjects from ages seven to ten, followed by a plat eau through age 26. PML 446 at 140. Two findings similar to those noted in Rett's disorder were made, including increased lipofuscin-containing244 cells. PML 446 at 141. Since Rett's is considered an entirely genetic disorder, this suggests a response to neuronal maldevelopment, ratherthan an environmental agent at work. b. Doctor Kinsbourne's Interpretations. Doctor Kinsbourne testified that this st udy found a proliferation of microglia, 245 a diminution in the density of the astrocytes,246 gliosis, and the loss of some neurons. He noted that the older brains studied had mo re striking changes, suggesting an ongoing process. Tr. at 807-08. This, accordi ng to both Dr. Kinsbourne and the authors, would be compatible with the effect of a toxin on t he brain, since metals such as lead, iron, and mercury have been known to cause glial pro liferation. Tr. at 810. However, the authors noted that prolifer ation of glial cells also occurs in ischemia, trauma, toxins, and neurodegenerative disorders. PML 446 at 140. c. Doctor Kemper's Criticisms. Doctor Kemper had concerns about the Lopez-Hurtado study as well as considerable difficulty in locating it.247 Tr. at 2854-55. He summarized the study's findings as a decreased number of neurons, an increased number of glial cells, and an accelerated accumulation of lipofuscin. Tr. at 2856. However, there was no assurance in t he paper that the authors were careful in 243 Doctor Kemper commented on the use of the term \"glial\" as opposed to \"microglial.\" As used, the term could refer to both astroglia and microglia. Tr. at 2857-58. 244 The authors described lipofuscin as material originating from phagocytosed cellular components that had been engulfed by microglia acting as phagocytes. Lipofuscin is \"composed primarily of oxidatively-modified proteins and lipids.\" They noted that lipofuscin is a \"depot for metals, including redox-active and heavy metals.\" They indicated that higher levels of lipofuscin may be considered as a marker for increased oxidative activity. PML 446 at 141 (footnotes omitted). 245 The authors used the term \"glia\" rather than \"microglia,\" making Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion incorrect. See PML 446 at abstract. 246 This interpretation by Dr. Kinsbourne was inco rrect. The study did not report changes in the density of astrocytes, but did report morphol ogic changes in astrocytes. PML 446 at 140. 247 Doctor Kemper testified that he was unfamiliar with the journal in which the Lopez-Hurtado article appeared, and that the Harvard Medical School Li brary, the second largest in the nation, did not carry it. Tr. at 2854-55. 84identifying the areas they intended to exam ine; the paper did not contain a proper cytoarchitectonic definition of the areas examined, and thus the findings regarding cell types and density are unclear. Tr. at 2856-57. Additionally, the lipofuscin pigment varies from area to area, and if the researc hers did not look in the right area, their findings could be incorrect. Tr. at 2857. He commented that the method of cellcounting employed in the study would not be accepted in a critically-refereed journal. Tr. at 2857. The study did not mention microglia, in spite of using standard stains for neuron densities and GFAP, a stain specific for astrocytes. The way the term \"glia\" was used inthe study may encompass astrocytes. Tr. at 2857-58. Thus, its findings cannot be equated to the microglial activation reported in the Vargas study. Tr. at 2858. A report of increased astrocytic density would not be compatible with astrocyte death. Tr. at 2858. Doctor Kemper also commented that the authors had a very interesting idea, one he would like to have seen investigated by proper technique, but a reputable journal would not have accepted the paper, as written. Tr. at 2858. He would not rely on its findings for information about the neuropathol ogical basis of autism. Tr. at 2859. d. Doctor Johnson's Criticisms. 248 Doctor Johnson noted that the Lopez-H urtado paper, PML 446, had a significant methodological flaw. Tr. at 4317-18. The paper used statistical analysis and computed standard deviations to compare cell counts fr om brain samples within the same brain.249 It is improper to compute a standard devia tion based on one sample. Tr. at 4318-19. An examination of Table 1 in the Lopez-H urtado paper, PML 446, at 133, reveals that the authors did precisely what Dr. Johnson indi cated was improper. Thus, the statistical inferences are invalid. Tr. at 4319. Furthermore, Dr. Johnson testified that the appropriate way to analyze the data would be to compare the rate of change with age in cell numbers for glia, neuronal cells, and the lipofuscin-containing cells. When he analyzed the data, he noted that the rate of change in the control patients and in the autistic patients was almost exactly the same. Tr. at 4319. In the older autistic pati ents, the number of glial cells increased; the same increase was seen in the control patient s as a function of the age of the donor. The significant difference was not in the age-related changes, but in the baseline cell 248 Initially, when Dr. Johnson was cross-examined about the Lopez-Hurtado study, PML 446, he declined to comment on it, as he had not read it. Tr . at 2249-50. Between his cross-examination and his recall as a witness in the rebuttal case, Dr. Johnson had an opportunity to examine the paper and evaluatethe data contained in it, and in rebuttal, he proffered a number of criticisms. 249 The study counted the number of neurons in brain sections of an individual and computed an average number. The standard deviation computed is therefore based on counting errors. Tr. at 4318-19. 85counts. Although the starting points were diffe rent, the lines representing the increasing number of glial cells created from the dat a in the autistic and control samples were \"basically exactly parallel.\" Tr. at 4320. As the youngest samples were from children aged seven, the cell counts revealed little about the genesis of the initial differences. See Tr. at 4320. 6. Implications of Neuroanat omical Abnormalities in ASD. In summary, most of the structural c hanges observed in the brains of autistics most likely occurred prenatally.250 The prenatal origin of the structural changes observed buttresses the conclusions drawn from the testimony about dysmorphology in ASD, and in the neuropeptide findings. What goes awry in ASD most likely does soearly in gestation, producing abnormalities in all three major sections of the brain. The Vargas study indicates that brain systems that may respond to or be causal of injury are more active in the brains of those wit h ASD, reflecting an ongoing process. Whether the microglial and astroglial activation observ ed are the result of, or even consistent with, administration of mercury via TCVs was not addressed by the study, or even suggested by three of the Vargas study's authors in the Pardo paper. Petitioners' evidence that TCVs could be responsible is addressed in Sections VI, VII, and VIIIbelow. H. Regressive Autism as a Separ ate Phenotype with a Distinct Etiology. 1. Overview.The only evidence suggesting that regre ssive autism (or clearly regressive autism) is biologically and causally different from classic or early onset autism was provided by Drs. Kinsbourne and Greenland. In his testimony and expert report, Dr. Kinsbourne advanced a number of arguments for a biological distinction between regression and early onset autism, and assert ed that regression was consistent with environmental triggers. Doctor Greenland pointed to a few studies that he thought pertinent for the existence of clearly regressive autism as a distinct biological entity, but primarily argued that it was respondent's burden to show that clearly regressive autism was not distinct. I conclude that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that regressive autism is not a distinct phenotype, and ov erwhelmingly demonstrates that \"clearly regressive autism\" is, at best, only a hypothetical construct, unsupported by anycredible evidence. I likewise conclude that opi nions, such as Dr. Greenland's, that are based on the existence of this subtype la ck the factual underpinnings to be considered reliable evidence. Thus, I conclude that the impressive body of epidemiological 250 One finding relating to subplate neuronal migrati on could have occurred either before or shortly after birth. Tr. at 2833. 86evidence that TCVs are not causally a ssociated with ASD is relevant and should be considered in determining whether TCVs do indeed cause or substantially contribute to ASDs. That evidence is discussed in Section V, below. Not surprisingly, respondent's experts251 had sharp disagreements with the assertions of Drs. Kinsbourne and Greenland. Those assertions and the criticisms thereof are set forth below. With respect to Dr. Kinsbourne, respondent's experts noted that some of his assertions were made without any refer ence to supportive medical literature,252 were based on \"cherry-picked\" data, and conflicted wit h the weight of scientific and medical authority. Other aspects of Dr. Kinsbourne' s testimony made analysis of his assertions difficult. For example, he declined to define regr essive autism. Tr. at 846. In view of the numerous definitions discussed, Dr. Ki nsbourne's reluctance to specify what he considered to be regressive autism was tr oublesome. He could not state whether regressive autism was considered a separat e diagnostic category by either the DSM-IV- TR or the ICD-10. Tr. at 847-49. 2. Doctor Kinsbourne's Opinions.Initially, Dr. Kinsbourne testified tha t, based on his experience, children with cases of regression developed more severe fo rms of autism. Tr. at 780. Almost immediately thereafter, he retreated from th is position, testifying that there was no difference in the pattern of disabilit ies or behaviors between regressive and non- regressive autism. Tr. at 781. It was unc lear whether this was indeed his own opinion, or merely his response to leading questions. 253 Doctor Kinsbourne's opinions on regressi on in autism can be placed into four broad categories. They are: (1) regressive autism is not associated with any of the 251 During his testimony, Dr. Kinsbourne claimed that Dr. Rutter had written \"something along\" the lines of clearly regressive autism being a distinct dis ease category. Tr. at 848. He did not specify where Dr. Rutter made this statement. Doctor Rutter's te stimony clearly indicated that he did not consider regressive autism to be a separate disease category. See, e.g. , Tr. at 3284-85. 252 Petitioners cannot be required to have medical literature supporting their claims in order to prevail in establishing biological plausibility. Capizzano , 440 F.3d at 1325. However, when petitioners alone filed roughly 700 medical and scientific journal articles and textbooks, the fact that none were referenced for several contested points in Dr. Kinsbourne's report is a factor in assessing the weight to begiven to his specific assertions. 253 Formal rules of evidence do not apply to Vaccine Act proceedings. However, the prohibition in both the common law and Fed. R. Evid. 611(c) against asking a party's own witness leading questions hasa practical basis in the concept that testimony should come from the witness, not the attorney examiningthe witness. The frequency with which leading questions were used to steer Dr. Kinsbourne's testimonydetracted from its impact, and occasionally left me in doubt about who was actually presenting evidence-Dr. Kinsbourne or petitioners' attorney. 87known medical causes for non-regressive autism; (2) regression in autism has unique characteristics that set it apart from non -regressive autism; (3) the prevalence of regression is increasing faster than early onset autism; and (4) genetics cannot explain the phenomenon of regression in autism. a. Regressive Autism and Known Medical Conditions or Causes. Doctor Kinsbourne's report stated: \"Mor eover, with few exceptions, the known medical conditions that feature autistic behav ior do not do so in isolation, without other abnormalities. Nor do they feature the virtua lly unique time course of the developmental regression observed in many children who become autistic during the first 12-24 months of life.\" PML 717 at 4. In the next paragraph of his report, Dr. Kinsbourne continued: \"Classical ('congenital') and regressive autis m differ[] sharply with respect to their known medical causations. A large number of causative medical factors have been associated with children with non-regressive autism, and a differential diagnosis excluding those possible causes is possible.\" PML 717 at 4; see also Tr. at 902-03. He explained further: \"Only a few medical conditi ons that cause autism feature a regression with loss of previously attained development al skills, leading to an autistic endpoint.\" PML 717 at 4. He noted that loss of skills does not happen in most other developmental disorders, and \"ruled out\" three conditions that feature regression, but do not lead to an autism diagnosis: Rett' s disorder, Landau-Kleffner at 782; PML 717 at 4. In cases of regression, when these conditions are \"ruled out,\" \"a r easonable differential diagnosis would then consider other potential causes that mi ght have contributed to the regression.\" Id. at 5. Doctor Kinsbourne's logic is difficult to follow. Starting with the premise that an otherwise normal and healthy child suddenly loses skills, he lists disorders in which lossof skills appear, rules them out, and then looks for another cause. This processassumes the point that he seeks to prove: that loss of skills cannot be caused by ASD alone. Doctor Kinsbourne assumes the phenomenon of regression sets CDD, Rett's disorder, LKS, and regressive autism apart from other conditions with an \"autistic endpoint.\" And, because the process of differential diagnosis establishes that 254 Doctor Kinsbourne briefly described LKS in his report, PML 717, at 4-5. He noted that the first sign of LKS is typically seizures, which appear much late r in autism, and that onset of LKS is usually after three years of age . Id. at 4-5 (emphasis added). However, articles concerning LKS filed by petitioners indicate that Dr. Kinsbourne's description of LKS was not entirely accurate. According to the Connollypaper (A. Connolly, et al., Serum autoantibodies to brain in Landau-Kleffner variant, autism, and other neurologic disorders , J. PEDIATRICS 134(5): 607-13 (1999) [\"Connolly\"], filed as PML 501), LKS is acquired epileptic aphasia, and involves loss of language skills after 24 months of age , associated with epileptiform EEG or seizures. Id. at 608 (emphasis added). The Mikati study (M. Mikati, et al., Efficacy of Intravenous Immunoglobulin in Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (2002), filed as PML 376) described the syndrome as one \"characterized by loss of previously acquired language skills,auditory agnosia,\" and specific EEG findings \"of spike and slow wave activity more prominent in sleep.\" Id. at 298. Both studies noted that individuals who have bot h LKS and symptoms consistent with ASD are referred to as LKS variant [\"LKSV\"]. PML 376 at 298; PML 501 at 608. 88regressive autism cannot be CDD, Rett's disorder , or LKS, it is, therefore, a separate condition. However, this conclusion that regre ssive autism is different is dictated by the premise that regression alone is enough to es tablish it as different. Unlike ASD in general, Rett's disorder, CDD, and LKS a ll have additional factors, aside from regression, that lead to thei r separate diagnostic categories. As evidence for the proposition that r egression is a distinct phenotype, Dr. Kinsbourne claimed that regressive and non-regr essive autism \"differ[ ] sharply with respect to their known medical causations.\" PML 717 at 4. According to Dr. Rutter, there is no evidence for this statemen t, as there have been no systematic studies comparing regressive autism and non-regressi ve autism with regard to medical factors that might be causal. Tr. at 3291. Doctor Rust also noted that there was no basis for Dr. Kinsbourne's statement that classic and r egressive autism are epidemiologically and biomedically separate disorders. Tr. at 2391; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 58. Doctor Kinsbourne did not cite to any st udies demonstrating that the few known medical causes of autism are found solely or even predominantly in non-regressive cases. On the other hand, Drs. Rust and Ru tter did not offer any evidence that those known causes are also seen in cases in which regression occurs. Tr. at 3020. Withone side asserting one position, and the other par ty asserting the other, the disparity in the background and experience of the witnesses leads me to favor the opinions ofrespondent's experts. Doctors Rutter and Rust are likely to be better informed aboutthis issue, as they both see, treat, teac h, research, and write about patients with autism; Dr. Kinsbourne does not. Even if I concluded that the known medi cal causes of autism are not found in regressive cases, the small number of case s of ASD in which causal factors can be identified renders this point largely irrele vant. It would be only one small factor to consider in determining whether regressi ve autism is a separate phenotype, and thus may have causes distinct from the majority of the cases of ASD. b. Regressive ASD and \"Unique Characteristics.\" Doctor Kinsbourne's report referred to a number of characteristics that he believed set regressive autism apart from non-regressive autism. These included regressive autism as: (1) more frequently a ssociated with seizures (PML 717 at 5); (2) more often associated with gastrointestinal symptoms ( id.); (3) more likely to occur after \"a previously normal developmental trajectory\" ( id. at 6); and (4) having a \"sharply contrasting natural histor[y]\" fr om that of non-regressive autism (id. at 6). (1) Seizure Disorders. Doctor Kinsbourne reported t hat there are more overt seizures or epileptiform EEGs in children who have lost language skills. PML 717 at 5. He cited to two studies 89for this statement, Tuchman, PML 329,255 and McVicar, PML 375.256 Neither provided much support. The Tuchman study examined nearly 600 children, divided into those with and without epilepsy and compared the rates of regression within these two groups. About 12% of those with regression had epilepsy; about 11% of those without regression had epilepsy. In the group without epilepsy, 73% of the children with regression had EEGs performed, as compared to 61% of those wit hout regression. PML 329 at Table 1. The authors noted that because the EEGs were perfo rmed at different facilities, varied in number, were not independently reviewed, and ma y have differed in quality, their data \"must be interpreted with caution.\" PML 329, at 563. The authors found that in children without epilepsy, \"regression seemed to be a risk factor for an epileptiform EEG.\" Id. at 563. However, because not all of the childr en in the study had EEG records, and a disproportionately high number of the children who had EEG records also had regression, the study does not support Dr. Kinsbourne's statement. It is impossible to conclude from this study that more child ren with regression have overt seizures or epileptiform EEGs. Doctor Rust explained that the reas on more EEGs are performed on those with regression because an EEG can ru le out Landau-Kleffner syndrome.257 He asserted that there is no evidence that children wit h regression actually have more seizures.258 Tr. at 2390, 2468. Doctor Rust also test ified that EEG profiles do not distinguish between classic and regressive autism.259 See Tr. at 2390. He indicated that the issue of whether children with regression were more likely to have seizures or epileptiform EEGs had not been systematically studied. Tr. at 2468. 255 R. Tuchman and I. Rapin, Regression in Pervasive Developmental Disorders: Seizures and Epileptiform Electroencephalogram , PEDIATRICS 99(4): [\"Tuchman\"], 329. 256 K. McVicar, et al., Epileptiform EEG abnormalities in children with language , (2005) [\"McVicar\"], See supra note 254. Landau-Kleffner syndrome presents with regression, seizures, and characteristic patterns of discharge on an EEG, but onset generally occurs after age three. Because LKSis a condition that can be treated with some drugs, an EEG may be performed on a child under three whoexperiences regression in order to rule out LKS, accounting for the increased number of EEGs in childrenwith regression. Tr. at 2390. 258 He added that, even if they do, seizures are more likely the result of developmental brain abnormalities than toxic events. Tr. at 2468. 259 LKS and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are among the disorders that can be identified by EEG patterns. See supra note 254 (LKS); 1823 (Lennox-Gastaut). 90The McVicar study, PML 375, examined language regression, in children with and without ASD diagnoses. PML 375 at abs tract. It found that seizures and epileptiform EEGs were more common in those who had language regression but not ASD. PML 375 at 129. Because regression, with or without ASD, was required of all study participants, the study cannot support Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion that children with ASD and regression are more likely to have seizures or epileptiform EEGs than children with ASD and no regression. Neither the Tuchman nor the McVicar st udy support the proposition for which Dr. Kinsbourne cited them: that children with ASDs and regression have more seizures or more epileptiform EEGs than children with ASD s who do not experience regression. As Dr. Rust treats a large number of child ren with ASD and has specialized expertise in EEG research, his assertions regarding regr ession, seizures, and the similarity of EEG profiles in children with ASD carry greater weight than those of Dr. Kinsbourne, who misstated the support found in t hese two studies he cited. (2) Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Citing to the Richler study, RML 397, Dr . Kinsbourne asserted that the increased frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in ch ildren with regression than in those without regression was a factor that indicated r egressive autism was a separate phenotype. PML 717 at 5. Although this study did find more gastrointestinal symptoms in children with regression, Dr. Kinsbourne's use of this study as support engendered a comment by Dr. Rust regarding \"cherry picking\" data. See Tr. at 2469. The study's findings and conclusions amply support Dr. Rust's accusation. The authors concluded: [T]he few children who showed near-normal development prior to loss were not the same children who m anifested the \"possible regressive phenotype\" (i.e., regression, GI symptoms, onset of autistic symptoms after vaccination). In fact, the result s from the present study indicated that all those children who most clearly fi t the \"possible regressive phenotype\" showed abnormal development in the majority of areas on the[communication skills test used] prior to loss. If there is a \"regressivephenotype\" of ASD, then, it does not appear to be characterized by normalor near-normal early development. Richler, RML 397, at 313 (emphasis added). 260 Taken as a whole, the Richler study does not support the hypothesis that 260 The Richler authors further noted that the info rmation regarding gastrointestinal symptoms was based on parental reports and was not corroborated by medical records. RML 397 at 313. 91increased gastrointestinal symptoms occur with greater frequency in \"clearly regressive\" autism, or in regressive autism in whic h previous development was normal or near- normal. (3) Previously Normal Development. Doctor Kinsbourne's report described so me autistic children who \"develop relatively normally as infants, but regre ss in their developmental skills and begin to exhibit the behavioral hallmarks of ASD in the se cond year of life, or even later.\" PML 717 at 5; see also Tr. at 780. The fact that children regress is not contested, nor is it contested that some children who regre ss had \"relatively\" normal development during their first year of life. However, the we ight of the evidence, discussed in Section IV.D.5., above, is that most children who lose sk ills did not have completely normal development prior to their loss. There remains a small minority of child ren who regress in whom no previous abnormalities of development have been identified. This is not the same as saying that their development before the loss of skills occurred was entirely normal. Assuming, arguendo , that this small group truly had completely normal development prior to the loss of skills, there must be other factors that distinguish them from the larger group of children with regression in order to cons titute a separate phenotype or diagnostic category. See Tr. at 3585, 3588. Evidence of those factors was not produced. (4) Contrasting Natural History. Respondent's experts confirmed that a loss of skills could present very suddenly. Doctor Lord described regression as a very striking phenomenon, one that could be heartbreaking and hard to forget, but noted that subtler forms of regression were common. Tr. at 3576, 3579; see also Tr. at 3313-14 (Dr. Rutter explaining that dramatic regressions are unusual and that most case s involve subtle changes over time). However, Dr. Lord's research showed that there were no other clear-cut distinctions between regression and classic autism. Tr. at 3576-77, 3587. The reason that regression is not a separate phenotype is the lack of association of regression with any factors, other than the regre ssion itself. Tr. at 3588. In the large population of children with autism he treated, Dr. Rust did not see any meaningful distinction, biologically or behaviorally, between children with regression and children without it. Tr. at 2391, 2577. Loss of skills happens at a variety of ages and with no clear association with other ev ents. Tr. at 2592. The prognosis in regression does not differ from the prognosis in early onset of ASD. Tr. at 3569; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 12. The Vargas study found no differences in the immune responses in patients with regressive autism and those with early onset autism. Vargas, PML 69, at 71; Tr. at 2853-54. Aside from the Vargas study, t he neuropathological studies did not compare 92brains of ASD patients with regression to thos e without it. Tr. at 3042. I note, however, that the first neuropathological case study performed by Drs. Bauman and Kemper was that of a man who experienced regression.261 See Bauman and Kemper, PML 509, at 866. He shared most of the neuroanatomical features found in the other cases. See RML 38 at 125. The rate of head growth is not different in ASD children with regression versus those with early onset of the disorder. See Webb, RML 506. Both children with early onset and children with regression had similar increases in head circumference between four and ten months of age. Webb, RML 506, at 1187. Neuropeptide abnormalities at birth were not different in children later found to have ASD, regardless of whether they lost skills. Nelson, RML 353, at 302. In families with multiple incidences of autism, members of the extended family often have a number of personality characteri stics similar to those found in autism, a phenomenon often referred to as the \"br oader autism phenotype.\" Tr. at 2392-93; Lainhart 2002, PML 91.262 These characteristics include rigidity, aloofness, anxiety, deficits in speech and pragmatic language, and limited friendships. Such characteristics were found in both parents in 38% of family clusters of autism.263 Tr. at 2392-93; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 13. In these familial clus ters of ASD, both classic and regressive autism are found. Tr. at 2389-90; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 12; Lainhart, PML 91, at abstract. This indicates that the two are not biologically di stinct. Or, as the authors of the Lainhart 2002 study stated: Assuming that features of the [broader autism phenotype] represent genetic liability to autism, our data s uggest that genetic factors may be just as important in regressive autism as they are in nonregressive autism. Environmental factors, if involved in the pathogenesis of autism, do not appear to be preferentially involved in regressive vs. nonregressive autism in our sample. 261 If the regression status of the subsequent eight subjects was reported in any of the articles filed, I was unable to find it. Table 7.2 of RML 38 lists the first six cases Drs. Kemper and Baumanexamined; it appears that the initial case with regression is listed on the far right column of the table. 262 J. Lainhart, et al., Autism, Regression, and the Broader Autism Phenotype , AM. J. MED. GEN. 113: 231-37 (2002) [\"Lainhart 2002\"], filed as PML 91. 263 Doctor Rust cited a 1997 study by Piven for this figure. Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 13. Although a 1997 article by Piven was filed as RML 382, it does not stand for this proposition. I note that the Lainhart article, PML 91, cites to another 1997 study by Piven that was likely the study Dr. Rust had in mind, as it is entitled Cognitive deficits in parents from multiple-incidence autism families . I could not use Dr. Rust's references in his expert report, Res. Ex. W, to det ermine which article he meant because his report did not reference any article by Piven. This was likely because Dr. Rust's report was filed before that of Dr.Kinsbourne, and thus it did not include responses to Dr. Kinsbourne's assertions. 93Lainhart, PML 91 at 236 (citations omitted). Doctor also stated that \"autistic regression is self-limiting....\" PML 717 at 6. Once again, Dr. Rust disagreed. He noted that there is an additional deterioration during the second decade of life, wh ich is inconsistent with \"self-limiting.\" Tr. at 2474; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 60. Doct or Kinsbourne also stated that, as a result of the encephalopathy, autism \"may...become more se vere.\" PML 717 at 6. Doctor Rust noted that this statement is inconsistent with a self-limit ing condition. Tr. at 2472. Doctor Kinsbourne's assertions that regr ession has a distinct natural history and probable postnatal etiology were not suppor ted by the weight of the evidence. c. Prevalence and Regression. Because the percentage of cases of regression has not changed over the decades, Dr. Kinsbourne concluded that the real number of regressive cases must be rising. PML 717 at 7. He based this conc lusion on two factors: (1) the definition of regression has not changed; and (2) sudden regression is unlikely to be missed ormistaken for something else. Id. Thus, diagnostic substitution could not account for any of the increased cases of regression, even if it did account for some of the overall rise in the number of cases of ASD. In Dr . Kinsbourne's words, \"the rise in the number of cases of regressive autism is no artifact, but is very real.\" PML 717 at 7. Attributing regression to both genetic and environmental fact ors, he blamed the increase on the the environmental factors \"correspondingly increasing.\" Id. Doctor Rutter testified that there was a lack of evidence that the proportion of regressive cases had changed, \"rather than a so lid finding of no change....\" Tr. at 3287. He also stated, contrary to Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion, that the diagnostic criteria for regression had changed, but agreed that it was unlikely these changes accounted for any differences. Tr. at 3287. He also t ook issue with Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion that regression could not be mistaken for ment al retardation or developmental delay, commenting that this assertion indicated that Dr. Kinsbourne had little experience with patients with autism. Tr. at 2475-76; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 61. I conclude that Dr. Kinsbourne was correct in stating that \"striking and even shocking\" cases of regression could not be mi staken for anything else. However, there was ample testimony that these striking ca ses account for only a very small proportion of the cases of regression, and even in t hese cases, prior development may not have been entirely normal. Thus, there are many cases of regression that could be affected by diagnostic substitution, better ascertainmen t, and the other factors indicating that the increase in prevalence is largely artifa ctual. There is inadequate evidence for Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion that regressi ve autism is truly increasing. 94d. Genetics and Regression. Doctor Kinsbourne testified that, becaus e the concordance rate in autism is between 60% and 90%, some 10-40% of cases of autism cannot be explained bygenetics alone. Tr. at 790. In his words, environmental factors must account for the triggering of \"a strong susceptibility into a clinical actuality.\" Tr. at 791; see also PML 717 at 7. According to Dr. Kinsbourne, genet ic concordance may not be for a gene that causes autism, but for a gene that r enders the children susceptible to some environmental factor. Tr. at 791, 853. When both of a twin pair encounter the same factor, they succumb and develop autism. 264 Tr. at 791. Because regressive autism has a timing that is consistent with an env ironmental \"second hit\" and such a dramatic change, it requires an explanation, and, in most cases, there is no causal option other than a postnatal environmental in sult or exposure. Tr. at 901-02; PML 717 at 9,13. In his report, he indicated that regression and re lapse are more understandable if autism is the result of a disease rather than the re sult of congenital maldevelopment. PML 717 at 14. Although his opinion regarding environment al causes was not limited to cases of regression, he pointed to the sudden onset of regression as implicating a postnatal event. He testified that this concept of gene-environment interaction is generally accepted. Tr. at 791-92. Respondent's experts proffered more te stimony about Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion that genetics could not account for regressi on than about any of his other points, except the neuroinflammation hypothesis. The evi dence was overwhelming that genetics alone can account for regression, as regression is present in a number of entirely genetic conditions, some with striking similarities to autism. A postnatal environmental cause for regression is highly unlikely, but not impossible. The lack of 100% concordance in identical twins indicates that somethi ng other than genetics alone affects who develops ASD, but the \"something else\" is more likely epigenetic influences, rather than apostnatal toxic insult. (1) Twin Studies and Concordance. Doctors Rutter, Lord, and Fombonne made m any of the same points regarding the concordance rate in ASD. All three noted that even if both monozygotic twins have ASD, there can be huge variability between them in the severity of the affliction. One may be high functioning while the other may be mentally retarded. Tr. at 3264, 3595, 3777. The autism phenotype is not entirely genetic ally determined, but differences in twins may be simply the result of random effects in neuronal development. Tr. at 3776- 264 Doctor Kinsbourne did not account for the converse: if both twins share the same genetic predisposition, but only one has ASD, then the envir onmental trigger must be something that one twin encounters but the other does not. It is highly unlikely that in cases of ASD, one twin received TCVs butthe other did not. Both monozygotic twins would share the genetic susceptibilities to environmental toxins. 9577. Other variations between identical t wins do not require an external environmental cause. In tuberous sclerosis, an entirely genetic disorder, some individuals have skin abnormalities so subtle that only an expert can detect them. Others have large tubers in the brain that are associated with severe intellectual impairments and epilepsy. Tr. at 3264. Environmental factors do not cause t hese variations. Tr. at 3265. The genetic contribution in autism is very high, and, over all, genetic factors are more important than non-genetic ones. Tr. at 3279. (2) Gene Environment Interactions. Doctor Rutter also disagreed that, as Dr . Kinsbourne stated in his report, \"[t]he causal role of gene-environment interact ion has become firmly established in the mainstream of autism research and theory\" (PML 717 at 9). Tr. at 3279-80. Doctor Rutter commented that there is a distin ction between genetic and non genetic factors playing a role in ASD and the term \"gene-envir onment interaction.\" Tr. at 3280. Doctor Rutter agreed that genetic and non-genetic fact ors both play a role in autism. However, he disagreed with the way Dr. Kinsbourne used the term \"gene- environment interactions,\" and with his assertion that their causal role in ASD was firmly established. As Dr. Rutter put it: \"that 's not only not firmly established; it's not established at all.\" Tr. at 3280. He conc eded that it is a possibility, but one that is entirely speculative with respect to autism. Tr. at 3280. I note that Dr. Rutter has written and lectured about, and chaired high- level governmental committees regarding, gene-environment interaction. See Tr. at 3245. Doctor Kinsbourne has not demonstrated any similar expertise. In his report, Dr. Rutter explained the c oncept of developmental perturbations. Genetics sets a general pattern for developm ent, but the details may be modified by chance factors. The non genetic factors at work in ASD \"may involve random variations brought about by features that increase the risk of developmental perturbations, rather than by some specific environmental insult.\" Res. Ex. GG at 11. Gene expression can be affected by other genetic elements and env ironmental influences. Res. Ex. GG at 57. Respondent's experts agreed that environment al events can influence genetically determined conditions. Tr. at 3277. For example, human height has about the same heritability as autism, about 90%. Tr. at 3278. During the period 1900-1950, the average height rose significantly, by about 12 c entimeters. The cause is not certain, but environmental factors such as improv ed nutrition and reduced infections undoubtedly played a role. Tr. at 3278. They also agreed that environmental factor s play a role in the development of ASD, but asserted that they do so very early in gestation. Tr. at 2575. It is possible that some environmental factors may affect t he brain in the very early postnatal period, but the evidence indicates that prenatal effe cts are more likely. Tr. at 3278. Doctor 96Rust explained that the theory that postnatal environmental interactions could interact with genetic predispositions merits examinat ion, but there was insufficient evidence to indicate that it actually happens, other t han prenatally, in autism. Tr. at 2575-76. Doctor Rodier testified that there is an outside possibility that a late injury may result in autism, or the behavioral effects that are seen in autism. Tr. at 3051. (3) Regression in Genetically Determined Conditions. A great deal of genetic research demonstrates that genes influence developments later in life as much as they influence the beginning of development. Tr. at 3288. Huntington's disease is caused by a single gene, without an environmental contribution, and causes loss of sk ills in middle age. Tr. at 3288; see also Tr. at 2604, 3584. Genetics strongly influences when girl s reach menarche, an event that occurs long after birth. Tr. at 3288-89. Schiz ophrenia has high heritability, with the first manifestations (difficulties with l anguage comprehension and motor coordination) occurring in early childhood. Tr. at 3289. No environmental hazard in early childhood influences these events; they are simply a part of the genetically influenced condition. Tr. at 3290. Another example that contradicts Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion that an environmental trigger is necessary for regre ssion involves children with congenital nerve deafness. Although they are born deaf, they vocalize normally for about the first sixmonths of life before developing a guttural vo calization pattern characteristic of deaf children. Tr. at 3292. The change in their vocalization patterns at about six months of age is based on when the input of language becom es important to vocalization, and has nothing to do with when the deafness occurred. 265 Tr. at 3292. Brain systems that are necessary for specific functions change over the course of development, and, in thischange, skills may be lost or acquired as a result of biological programming. Tr. at 3293. Doctor Rust spent a considerable portion of his testimony discussing the parallels between Rett's disorder, an entirely genetic condition, and ASD. His testimony helped explain why, despite the lack of 100% conc ordance in autism, no external triggering event was needed to produce it. Rett's disorder manifests with regression, which is also present in a substantial minority of children with autism. See Tr. at 2399. Rett's disorder produces EEG abnormalities during the first phase of regr ession; similar abnormalities are seen in some autistic children in the second half of the first year of life. Tr. at 2400. Bruxism 266 265 Doctor Rutter also noted that the sounds babies make the world over are much the same during the first six months of life, but thereafter, the babies lose the ability to make the sounds that are nota part of their native language environment. Tr. at 3293. 266 Bruxism is teeth grinding. Tr. at 2444. 97is almost universal in Rett's disorder, and is commonly seen in autism. Tr. at 2443-44. The neuropathology of the brain found in Re tt's disorder has several similarities to the neuropathology found in ASD: abnormal development of the inferior olivary nucleus in early gestation, likely associ ated with language disturbances (Tr. at 2409); increased density of neurons, particularly sm all neurons (Tr. at 2411); less dendritic arborization in selected cortical areas (T r. at 2411-12); and dysregulated expression of GABA in some with Rett's disorder, leading to seizures, which are common in both disorders (Tr. at 2413). 3. Doctor Greenland's \"Clearly Regressive Autism\" Hypothesis.Using in Res. Ex . E, \u00b6 121(a), that regression or loss of skills occurs in about 20% of cases of autism, 267 and the findings from the Richler study268 that in about 72% of cases of regressive autism, some form of abnormal development preceded that regression, Dr . Greenland calculated that the maximum number of cases in which there were no signs of abnormal development prior to the regression was about 6% of all autism cases, and 28% of all regressive cases. Tr. at 78-79, 100. These are the cases to which Dr. Greenland referred when he used theterm \"clearly regressive autism.\" The evidence for regressive autism constituting a separate phenotype was singularly unpersuasive. The evidence fo r an even smaller subtype of regression, \"clearly regressive autism,\" was non-existen t. Doctor Greenland lacked the professional qualifications to opine that autism has distin ct \"clinically recognizable subtypes with distinct development[al] trajectories and different etiologies.\" Tr. at 76. Unlike Drs. Fombonne, Rutter, and Goodman, Dr. Gr eenland is not a medical doctor and his CV does not reflect any education, training, or experience in diagnosing or treating autism. See PML 714 (CV of Dr. Greenland). Doctor Greenland is thus not qualified to opine on subtypes of autism or whether subt ypes of autism have distinct causes. He acknowledged this lack of expertise himself. Tr. at 111. Other than Dr. Greenland's assertions, petit ioners offered absolutely no evidence that \"clearly regressive autism\" is cons idered a separate diagnostic category by anyone 267 Estimates of the extent of regression vary widely in the autism literature. See supra Section IV.D.6. 268 Richler, RML 397. Doctor Fombonne noted that Dr. Greenland misinterpreted the premise upon which the 28% figure was based. The authors did not conclude that 28% of children with ASD and regression were entirely normal before they experienc ed regression, just that no earlier abnormality could be documented. Richler, RML 397, at 306-07. Doctor Fombonne also referred to Dr. Lord's testimonythat the proportion of children with regression and evidence of some earlier abnormal development is likelyto rise to close to 100% with better and prospective a ssessments, such as in the baby sibs studies. Tr. at 3689, 3761-62; see also Tr. at 3570-71 (testimony of Dr. Lord) and Dwyer Tr. at 257-58 (testimony of Dr. Leventhal). 98with expertise in diagnosing autism. The medi cal literature does not use the term. Tr. at 3684. Doctor Greenland was unable to present any evidence indicating that regressive autism is biologically distinct from nonregressive autism. Tr. at 126-27. 4. Conclusions Regarding Regression.Most of Dr. Kinsbourne's assertions about regressive autism were simply wrong. He failed to demonstrate that regression is a separate phenotype. In Dr. Rust's words, his assertion that regressive and classic autis m are different conditions is an artificial one. Tr. at 2467. There are a very sma ll number of children with apparently normal development who suffer \"sudden and even shocking\" regression in their second year oflife. Aside from this regression, which is not unique to autism, there is nothing else that sets them apart from children whose regre ssion manifests more slowly or who have sudden regression after some slow or abnormal development. See Tr. at 3570-71. His assertion that regression is caused by a disease process rather than genetics does not follow logically from what is known about regression in other conditions. Tr. at 3313. Brain development in human infants occu rs in phases. At each phase of brain development, genetic signals turn on proce sses that result in elaborations, development, and eliminations of brain structures. See Tr. at 2403. These changes in the brain result in behavioral changes as well. The evidence establishes that whatever sets the development of the brain of an autis tic child apart from a typically developing peer likely occurs early in gestation. On a theoretical basis, some changes might be postnatally influenced, but the evidence for such postnatal events is scant. Even when disease processes such as herpes encepha litis postnatally induce autistic-like symptoms, the behaviors induced are similar to , but qualitatively different from, those seen in most children with autism. Regressive autism cannot be distinguished biologically from other forms of ASD. Tr. 3105-07, 3113-14. There is no evidence of any brain abnormality that sets those with regression apart from those wit h classic or early onset ASD. With regard to \"clearly regressive autism,\" it was petitioners' burden to demonstrate its existence as a separate phenotype. I find t hat petitioners failed to do so. Because the facts that formed the bas is for his opinion were not satisfactorily established, Dr. Greenland's opinion that t he existing studies cannot rule out a substantial causal role for TCVs in one form of autism is not relevant or persuasive. 269 269 See Proveris York , 414 F.3d 381, 399 n.13 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"[I]t is worth emphasizing that, because a witness qualifies as an expert with respect to certain matters or areas of knowledge, it by no meansfollows that he or she is qualified to express expert opinions as to other fields.\"). Doctor Greenland is a qualified expert on epidemiology, but he lacked the qualif ications to opine on the existence of \"clearly regressive autism.\" In the absence of evidence that the condition exists, opinions from someone unqualified to opine on its existence are neither relevant nor reliable. 99What follows in Section V is the epidem iological evidence that strongly suggests that TCVs are unlikely to be a postnatal cause of ASDs in general. Thereafter, the evidence upon which petitioners rely for thei r assertions that postnatal environmental exposure to mercury in the form of TCVs caus es or substantially contributes to ASD is set forth and critiqued in Sections VI, VII, and VIII. Section V. Epidemiology. A. Introduction. Petitioners began their case with the test imony of their epidemiologist, Dr. Greenland. Doctor Greenland's testimony was a pre-emptive strike in an attempt to render irrelevant the many studies that had failed to detect any relationship between TCVs and ASD. In addition to offering criticisms of many of these studies, Dr.Greenland attempted to carve out a hypothet ical phenotype of autism, which he called \"clearly regressive autism,\" and asserted t hat the epidemiological studies introduced as evidence would be unable to detect an association between TCVs and this smallsubgroup. Respondent's experts agreed that, in theory, a small subgroup could have escaped detection by the epidemiological studi es performed. However, they disagreed that there was any evidence that a s ubgroup such as the one hypothesized by Dr. Greenland actually existed. Because I have concluded that petitioners failed to establish the underlying premise for Dr. Greenland's opinion, I find that the published epidemiological studies are highly informati ve, albeit not dispositive, of the general causation issue before me. Doctor Greenland' s criticisms of individual studies are generally well-taken, and I have considered his criticisms in determining what weight to give the epidemiological studies on the issue of general causation. To place the expert opinions on epidemiology in perspective, I begin with a brief overview of the science of epidemiology. An explication of the different types of epidemiological studies, along with their inher ent strengths and weaknesses, follows. I then discuss some of the many studies of TCVs and ASD filed as evidence. In addition to petitioners' expert Dr. Gr eenland, three experts in epidemiology, Drs. Goodman, Fombonne, and Rutter, testifi ed for respondent. All were well-qualified as experts. The witnesses were in gener al agreement about epidemiology's strengths and weaknesses, including most issues related to specific studies. 270 Unlike Dr. Greenland, Drs. Fombonne, Goodman, and Rutte r are physicians. Additionally, Drs. Fombonne and Rutter have conducted a number of epidemiological studies of ASD, and they both diagnose and treat children with ASD. Thus, their opinions on the ASD epidemiological studies were generally be tter informed than those of Dr. Greenland. 270 Where there was disagreement, it largel y concerned the factual underpinnings of Dr. Greenland's opinion about a \"clearly regressive autism\" subgroup. 100B. Epidemiology as a Scientific Discipline. Epidemiology is the science that studies the patterns or distributions of diseases in human populations and attempts to identify risk factors for those diseases. Tr. at3088-89, 3625. Epidemiology undergirds virtually all of what we know about medicine. Tr. at 3089; see also Hodges v. Sec'y, HHS , 9 F.3d 958, 967 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Newman, J., dissenting). Observational epidemiology focuses on pa tterns of diseases in discrete groups, and attempts to determine if differences in disease rates are due to differences in exposures. Tr. at 3089-90. Thus, it is t he observational studies that have relevance to the general causation issue in this case: whether TCVs cause some types of ASD. 1. Selection Bias and Confounders. 271 Every observational epidemiological study has some weaknesses because such studies examine the world as it is. Tr. at 3089. Common weaknesses in observational studies include selection biases in the groups observed272 and the failure to account for confounding factors.273 In interpreting results from observational studies, epidemiologists must determine if the differ ences in outcome are due to differences in exposure, or to something about the indivi duals that determines or is linked to the exposure. Tr. at 3090. Whether something is a potential conf ounder depends on what is being studied. If, in a particular study of smoking, all the tall people in the study were smokers and all the short people were nonsmokers, height could be a confounding factor. Tr. at 3090. However, if the outcome being examined by the smoking study is lung disease, height may be an unlikely confounder, at least in the absence of some reasonable explanationabout why height might affect rates of lung disease. Tr. at 3090. 2. Statistical Analysis and Biological Plausibility.Epidemiology is not entirely about statistics; it is also about the biology of what is being studied. The factors studied must be rele vant to the disease. Tr. at 3091. When 271 A confounder is a variable that is not a caus e of the condition being studied, but is associated with the causal factor and outcome, and therefore creat es a misleading impression of causality. Tr. at 3298. 272 In examining ASD rates in an unvaccinated group versus a vaccinated group, selection bias in how the two groups are chosen may affect the outcome. A study must address the possibility that lifestylefactors might affect which children are vaccinated and when or if the vaccinations occur. 273 Confounding factors might involve birth weight, multiple births, maternal age, maternal education, medications used during pregnancy, and many others, and results must be analyzed to determine if such factors account for any differences observed between the two groups. 101unexpected findings occur, the underlying biology helps to determine which are spurious and which are not. Tr. at 3092. To illustrate this principle and the problem with subgroups, Dr. Goodman used an example of a study of a drug used to treat cardiac problems that reduced mortality by 30% in the group that received it. To demonstrate the problem with subgroups, one of the study's authors used astrological si gns of the patients to assign them to subgroups.274 Those in the treated group born under the signs of Gemini or Libra had an adverse effect from aspirin. Because there was no biological reason for Zodiacsigns to affect drug reactions, the subgroup effect detected was meaningless. 275 Unless subgroups are selected using scientific criteria, grounded in legitimate biological distinctions, a subgroup effect, such as the adverse response of Geminis and Libras toaspirin, is simply an anomaly. Res. Ex. G, Report of Dr. Goodman, at 5. 3. Effect of Multiple Studies. Although biases exist in each epidemiological study, their effects can be minimized by multiple studies done in diffe rent ways, in different populations, using different measurements. If the multiple st udies come to a similar conclusion about a particular risk factor, the likelihood that bias es affected the conclusion is considerably reduced. Tr. at 3091. 4. Statistical Significance.To make a causal inference between an exposure and an outcome, an 274 The study was identified in Dr. Goodman's report (Res. Ex. G at 5) and testimony (Tr. at 3111) as the Peto study. Two studies involving drug trials in heart disease were filed: (1) First International Study of Infarct Survival Collaborative Group, Randomised Trial of Intravenous Atenolol 57-66 (1986) [\"ISIS-1\"], filed as RML and (2) Second International Study of Infarct Survival Collaborative Group, Randomised Trial of Intravenous Streptokinase, Oral Aspirin, Both, or Neither Among 17,187 Cases of Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction , LANCET 259. The \"Zodiac sign\" subgroup analysis occurs at page 356 of RML 259, and precedes a discussion of subgroup effects. Thisdiscussion emphasized the need for biological plausib ility and other evidence before giving credence to subgroup differences, noting: \"'Lack of evidence of benefit' just in one particular subgroup is not good'evidence of lack of benefit.'\" ISIS-2, RML 259, at 356-57. Although Dr. Goodman's report discussed abeneficial effect on \"Leos,\" I could not find that discussi on in the article itself. However, the discussion of the Zodiac sign subgroups of Libras and Geminis makes the same point. 275 Doctor Greenland castigated Dr. Goodman's use of this example, and suggested that Dr. Goodman could not defend its use in a meeting of his peers. Tr. at 105-06. Either Dr. Greenland wasbeing disingenuous or he failed to understand the purpose for which the study was referenced. DoctorGoodman was not equating possible autism phenotypes to astrological signs; he was illustrating afundamental principle of epidemiology: there must be bi ological plausibility to make a finding credible. Tr. at 3111-12. The epidemiological principle of biological plausibility parallels the legal principle found in the first Althen factor: a theory must be biologically plausible and reliable. See Althen , 418 F.3d at 1281. 102epidemiologist must find a relationship that is beyond what might be found by chance alone. Epidemiologists refer to this concept as \"statistical significance.\" In performing an epidemiological study, a \"p-value\" (the probability of getting, by chance alone, a statistic as large or larger than the observed value) is com puted. If a p-value is smaller than 5%, the result is generally considered st atistically significant. Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence (2d ed. 2000) at 168. Lack of statistical significance does not mean that no association exists; it means that no association was detected. Tr. at 83-84. Any relationship found to be statistically significant should not violate biological or physical rules and, ideally, should have a coherent biological explanation. Tr. at 3092-93. If the relationship found is weak , the corresponding biological explanation must be much stronger in order to draw a causal connection. Tr. at 3093. 5. Risk Ratios and Confidence Intervals.Risk ratios are computed by comparing t he risk of exposure in two groups, one exposed to the factor under study and the se cond unexposed. If the risk ratio is one, the incidence of disease is unaffected by t he exposure under study. Tr. at 3626-27. A risk ratio of two or more would indicate that exposure is a probable cause of the disease. Tr. at 3627. A risk ratio under one i ndicates a protective effect. Tr. at 3362. A \"confidence interval,\" expressed as a range, is the margin for error in a computed result, such as a risk ratio. Es timates of a 95% confidence interval means there is a 95% likelihood that the true risk is between the numbers comprising the range. Narrow confidence intervals mean that the risk ratio is more likely to beaccurate; wide confidence intervals indicate a greater margin for error. If a risk ratio of 1 (no association) is report ed, but the 95% confidence interval is between 0.5 and 2.0, the actual risk ratio could extend to 0.5 or 2.0. Tr. at 83-85. A wide confidence interval means that many other outcomes are within the same range of possibility. Chance alone could have produced an observed ri sk ratio of 1.0, even if the true risk were as low as 0.5 or as high as 2.0. Tr. at 85-86. C. Types of Epidemiological Studies. The type of study performed affects the significance that may be attached to it and whether conclusions regarding causalit y may be drawn. The evidence included 103cohort studies,276 case-control studies,277 prevalence and incidence studies,278 and ecological studies.279 In observational epidemiology, the cohor t study is one of the strongest study designs because it does not involve retrospec tive reports of exposures, a factor that affects case control studies. Tr. at 3625. T he critical factor in a case-control study is selecting the controls to ensure that they mi rror the case group in any factor that might affect outcome, other than in the exposure under study. Tr. at 3628. A prevalence study first determines t he magnitude of the problem disease, and may then, depending on the study design, look at risk factors. Tr. at 3628-29. Doctor Fombonne described prevalence as a snapshot, documenting the extent of a condition at a particular time. Tr. at 3813. If, in a sample of 100 people, five have blue eyes, those with blue eyes are t he numerator and the total popul ation is the denominator, making the prevalence rate (or proportion) of blue eyes 5%. Tr. at 3814. If, however, 100 children are followed from birth to age 10, the number with the studied condition are counted at age 10. If 15 of the children have the disease at age 10, the incidence rate is 15%. Although this computation looks like a prevalence rate, it is subject tochange over time and, if measured at additional five-year intervals, the incidence rate would likely rise. See Tr. at 3814-15. Ecological studies often begin with a hypothes is. If the trend lines are similar for the outcome and the proposed cause, further study is warranted, but an ecological study cannot determine if one event is caused by another. Interpreting two similartrend lines in causal terms is called the \"e cological fallacy.\" Tr. at 3630-31. In Dr. Fombonne's example, illustrated on Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 3, similar trend lines are 276 In a cohort study, one group is exposed to the particular risk factor under study, and a second group, known as the control group, is not exposed. The two groups are followed over time to determine how many in each group develop new cases of disease, the incidence of which is compared in risk ratios. Tr. at 3626-27. 277 A case-control study involves a group of people with the condition (the case group) and a similarly situated group of people without the condition (the control group), and examines, retrospectively, their exposures to possible risk factors. If more of the case group has a particular exposure than thecontrol group, that risk factor can be identified as a possible or even a probable cause of the condition. Tr. at 3627-28. 278 A prevalence rate is the proportion of a populat ion that has a particular disease or condition at a given point in time. Tr. at 3634. In contrast, an incidence rate involves observations, made over time, in an at-risk population, with new onset of disease measured in the population at calculated intervals. Tr. at 3634-35. 279 Ecological studies use aggregate data to look at disease trends over time to find risk factors that may correlate with the disease. They are sometimes called time trend analyses. Tr. at 3630. Drawing causal inferences from an ecological study is problematic, because populations are examined in the aggregate, rather than examining diseases and risk factors person by person. Tr. at 3629-30. 104found for suicide rates and unemployment rate s. Attributing suicide to unemployment would be an ecological fallacy in the absence of data showing that the individuals who committed suicide were more likely to be unemployed. The population level data mustbe analyzed at the individual level in order to make a causal association. See Tr. at 3631. When the rates for two trend lines fluctuate in a similar fashion, a causal connection between the two events is more likely; if they do not similarly fluctuate, a causal connection is unlikely. Tr. at 3633; Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 4. In essence, anecological study can rule out a causal a ssociation in the aggregate, but cannot serve as evidence of causation. Ecological studies are not considered adequate substitutes for controlled studies. They are unable to reliably distinguish a small association from noassociation. Tr. at 92. Ecological studies are more subject to bias than controlled studies, and thus their conclusions are not ent itled to as much weight as controlled studies. Tr. at 3126. A meta-analysis involves aggregating t he data from two or more studies, providing a larger studied population and thus narrowing confidence intervals and increasing the power of the analysis to detect causal associations. The combinedestimate of risk is almost always more prec ise than the estimate of risk from any single study. Tr. at 3108. D. Epidemiological Studies of TCVs and Autism. Epidemiology is particularly relevant to the relationship of TCVs with ASD because epidemiology is the only science that looks specifically at humans exposed to thimerosal and an outcome involving autism to determine if there is a higher risk of autism based on such exposure. Tr. at 3094. Doctor Fombonne testified about ten separate studies of a possible relationship between TCVs and ASD, with nonedetecting any relationship. Tr. at 3635- 59. Doctor Goodman discussed how the Institute of Medicine used the studies published between 2001 and 2004 to conclude that the \"evidence favors rejection\" of the hypothesis that TCVs cause autism. Tr. at 3085. In Dr. Greenland's words, the epidem iological studies can be summarized as \"support[ing] the idea that the association of [mercury-containing vaccines] with autism is small or nonexistent.\" PM L 715, at 16; Tr. at 122. 1. Hviid Study, 280 PML 238. This very large 2003 cohort study ex amined all children born in Denmark 280 A. Hviid, et al., Association Between Thimerosal-Containing Vaccine and Autism , 290(13): 1763-66 1990 and 1996.281 Because thimerosal was not used in Danish vaccines after 1992, it was possible to examine retrospectively children who had received TCVs andto compare them to children who had not. Tr. at 3638-39. Children who had received no TCVs were compared to those who had received at least one TCV. The incidenceof ASD was the same in both groups, with a risk ratio of 0.85, with a 95% confidence interval [\"CI\"] of 0.6 and 1.2. Tr. at 88, 3640. The study also looked at dose response to determine if ASD diagnoses were higher in those who received more TCVs. There was no evidence of any increase indiagnoses at any level of exposure. Those who received the highest amount ofmercury in TCVs had a risk ratio of 0.96, wit h a CI of 0.63-1.47. Tr. at 88; 3640. Although Dr. Greenland criticized this st udy (Tr. at 88-89) because the thimerosal levels were lower in Denmark than in the U.S., 282 the thimerosal exposure levels in U.S. and Danish children were co mparable at three months of age. At the highest dosage levels (125 micrograms of mercury [\" g\"]), there was no observed effect from TCVs on ASD rates. Tr. at 3640-41. Although the study does not directly address the U.S. levels of thimerosal expos ure, a strength of the study is that the unexposed group was not self-selected, re moving one possible source of bias. See Tr. at 3641-42. The removal of thimerosal from Danish vaccines was based on a changein the vaccine manufacturing process, and thus the unexposed group was not self- selected. Tr. at 3642. 2. Verstraeten Study, 283 PML 247. This cohort study used the Vaccine Safety Datalink [\"VSD\"] database284 retrospectively to create cohorts of children. The cohorts were examined for exposure 281 The Danish national registry, which contains health data on the entire population of Denmark, includes both immunization status and diagnosis codes. 282 In view of the position of petitioners' causat ion experts that they could not determine how much mercury would be enough to tip a genetically susceptible child over the threshold into autism, Dr.Greenland's criticism carries less weight than it might otherwise. See Tr. at 622-28 (Dr. Deth's testimony); 859-60 (Dr. Kinsbourne's a hypersusceptible group of children, butwas likewise unwilling to say how much mercury might be enough to cause ASD.

Ex. 12, slide 10. Doctor Greenland noted that t he confidence intervals in this study were wide, from 0.62 to 1.46, and at the highest category of exposure from 0.55 to 3.48. He also pointed out that Dr. Verstraeten stated that an association between TCVs and ASD could neither be confirmed nor refuted by this study,286 and that Dr. Verstraeten recommended more study of the issue.287 Tr. at 90. According to Dr. Rutter, \"[t]he Verstraeten study is in many ways the most satisfactory of the studies....\" Tr. at 3301-02. For that reason, he looked very carefully for problems that might invalidate the findings . He found several strengths: a large sample, a standard methodology, and thor ough and appropriate analysis. It found no association between thimerosal and autism. Tr. at 3302. Doctor Rutter was aware that the preliminary findings may have been differ ent from the final ones. He noted that such discordance is usual when \"dealing wit h multivariate analyses of complex data sets....\"288 Tr. at 3302. Doctor Rutter was also critical of Dr. Verstraeten's failure to declare his pending employment with a pharmac eutical company at the time the study was published, but noted that he did so shortly afterwards. Tr. at 3303. Having looked very carefully at these issues, Dr. Rutte r nevertheless rated the Verstraeten study as 285 The seven month cut-off would measure cumulative exposure at ages when exposure to thimerosal would be the highest relative to body wei ght. Verstraeten, PML 247, at 1040. Additionally, the childhood vaccination schedule reflects that most TCVs were administered by seven months of age. Verstraeten, PML 247, at Table 1; See CDC, Past Childhood Immunization Schedules, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm#past [\"CDC Childhood ImmunizationSchedules\"] (providing links to the Recommended I mmunization Schedules for Persons Aged 0 Through 18 Years - - United States for each year beginning in 1995). No vaccines are scheduled between the six and 12 month vaccinations. As 12 months of age is cons idered the first point at which ASD can be reliably diagnosed ( see Section IV.B.4.), the vaccines most likely to be implicated as causal are those administered in the first six to seven months of life. 286 T.

Doctor Greenland's testimony accurately summarized Dr. Vers traeten's position regarding the study. 287 Doctor Rutter testified that these additional studies recommended by Dr. Verstraeten had been performed and all failed to show a connection. Tr. at 3380. 288 In 2005, Special Master Hastings granted a PSC discovery request ( see Discovery Order, OAP Master File, filed April 14, 2005) that Dr. Harlan Austin and Ms. Cathy Lally be permitted access to theVerstraeten study data in order to resolve some apparent discrepancies between the findings appearing inthe published manuscript and the findings in an earlier unpublished report. PSC Expert Reanalysis of theThimerosal Screening Analysis [\"OAP Ex. 91\"], OAP Master File, filed December 13, 2006, at 4. DoctorRutter noted that Dr. Austin and Ms. Lally came to the same conclusion as the Verstraeten researchers intheir reanalysis of the data. Tr. at 3302; see also OAP Ex. 91 at 5 (\"[W]e generally believe that the methodology employed by the CDC investigators was sound and that their findings are valid.\"). 107sound. Tr. at 3303. 3. Stehr-Green Study,289 PML 230. This ecological study examined trend lines between ASD diagnoses and levels of thimerosal in vaccines. Using data from California, where the amount of thimerosal increased during the time frame studied, and two Scandinavian countries, where the use of thimerosal in vaccines was discont inued in the early 1990s, the authors plotted the amount of thimerosal in birth year c ohorts against the incidence of ASD in children ranging from two to ten years of age. T he rate of increase in ASD in Scandinavia continued after the removal of thimerosal from vaccines. Tr. at 3305, 3646-47; Res. Ex. 12, slide 11. The authors concluded that the data were \"not consistent with the hypothesis that increased exposure to Thimer osal-containing vaccines [is] responsible for the apparent increases in the rates of autism in young children being observed worldwide.\" Stehr-Green, PML 230, at 106. In epidemiology, what happens when a particular risk factor is introduced into one population and not another, or when a risk factor is removed in one population butnot another, is particularly important. Accord ing to Dr. Rutter, the Stehr-Green results make it \"really rather unlikely that thimerosal played a role in the overall rate of autism.\" Tr. at 3305. 4. Madsen Study, 290 PML 239. This 2003 ecological study examined the rate of autism291 in Denmark from 1971-2000. Before 1970, children in Denmark were exposed to up to 200 g of thimerosal, amounts comparable to U.S. ex posure in the late 1990s. Tr. at 3648. Rates of ASD diagnoses from 1970 through about 1982 were essentially flat, but begangradually to climb in 1984, and climbed rapidly after about 1992. See Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 12. Although thimerosal was disconti nued in vaccines in 1992 in Denmark, the trend line continued to climb after its removal. If there were an effect of TCVs onautism rates, the complete discontinuance of TCVs would have produced a change inthe rate of autism, and none was observed. Tr. at 3648-50. 289 P.

Madsen, et al., Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence From Danish Population-Based Data , PEDIATRICS 112(3): 604-06 (2003) [\"Madsen\"], filed as PML 239. 291 Because the study used the ICD-10 codes for autism, 84.0 and 84.1, the prevalence rates did not include cases of PDD-NOS. Tr. at 3745-46. Although the prevalence rates found undoubtedlyreflected an underestimation of the actual prevalenc e of ASD in Denmark, Dr. Fombonne was confident than an effect in the reduction of the amount of thimerosal received would have resulted in a change in thetrend line if TCVs caused even a small number of cases of ASD. Tr. at 3745-46. 1085. Andrews Study,292 PML 4. This large 2004 cohort study from the U. K. was performed using a computerized database maintained by general practice ph ysicians in the U.K. It compared TCV exposure and autism rates, finding a relati ve risk below one, with narrow confidence intervals of 0.88 to 1.12. Tr. at 89, 3651-52. No effect from TCV exposure was observed, even in those exposed at earlie r ages when the dose per kilogram of body weight would be higher. Tr. at 3652. This study looked separately at preterm infants, who would have lower body weights at the time of vaccination, with similar negative results. Tr. at 89, 3651-52. The 75 g exposure level was similar to that of U.S. infants at four months of age, but U.S. infants would have received more TCVs later in infancy, for more than double the thimerosal exposure. See Tr. at 89, 3652; Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 13. However, finding no effect at levels up to 75 g exposure during the earliest, and presumably most vulnerable, periods of development suggests that this level of exposure does not cause ASD. The finding weakens any argument that even small amounts of thimerosal may causally affect the development of ASD. 6. Jick and Kaye Study,293 PML 92. Although both Drs. Greenland and Fombonne te stified about this study, I have not relied upon it. The results were reported in a letter to the editor, rather than in a peer reviewed article, and the study was performed by researchers who reported serving as consultants to a law firm r epresenting vaccine manufacturers involved in vaccine safety litigation. Therefore, I hav e accorded this particular study no weight. 292 N. Andrews, et al., Thimerosal Exposure in Infants and Developmental Disorders: A Retrospective Cohort Study in the United Ki ngdom Does Not Support a Causal Association , PEDIATRICS 114(3): 584-91 (2004) [\"Andrews\"], filed as PML 4. 293 H. Jick & J. Kaye, Autism and DPT Vaccination in the United Kingdom , N. ENGL. J. MED. 350(26): 2722-23 (2004) [\"Jick and Kaye\"], filed as PML 92. Similar to the Andrews study in using theU.K. general practice database, the Jick and Kaye study was a case-control, rather than a cohort, study. The authors identified 122 cases of autism, and matched the children to 587 controls, based on age, sex,and treating physicians. The sample size was relative ly small, which resulted in fairly wide confidence intervals (0.7-3.3), but no association between TC V exposure and autism diagnoses was observed. Tr. at 90, 3652-53; Res. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 14. As in the Andrews study, the exposed children received lowerlevels of TCVs than their U.S. counterparts. Tr. at 90. 1097. Heron Study,294 PML 14. This prospective cohort study of 13,000 women and their children did not directly measure autism rates. Instead, the study examined special educational needs and thimerosal exposure. Tr. at 3654-55. T he study adjusted for a number of confounding variables, including fish consumption, and found no relationship between thimerosal exposure and 68 of 69 measured outcomes, with the authors noting that the one positive correlation would be expected by c hance alone. Tr. at 3654-55; Heron, PML 14, at 580. Because the study did not separately measure ASD diagnoses and was also based in the U.K., where TCV exposure was lower, the study is less informative than others on the issue of TCV causation of ASDs. Tr. at 89-90. However, the study strongly suggests that TCV exposure is un likely to produce neurological effects in general. Tr. at 3301. 8. Fombonne 2006 Study,295 PML 40. Doctor Fombonne also discussed one of his own recent studies, an ecological study in Quebec of varying levels of thimer osal exposure (which were similar to U.S. levels at their highest) and ASD trends. He found a higher prevalence of ASD afterdiscontinuation of TCVs. Tr. at 3656-57. The study was small, and did not adjust for confounding variables, but was able to exam ine several different exposure levels, based on changes in vaccines. Tr. at 3655-57. No relationship between TCVexposure and ASD trend lines was observed. Tr. at 3656. The cohort that received entirely TCV-free vaccines had a significant ly higher prevalence of ASD diagnoses, 80.6 per 10,000, than did any of the TC V-exposed cohorts. Tr. at 3656-57. Doctor Greenland correctly noted that Dr. Fombonne looked broadly at PDD diagnoses, rather than focusing on autism alone, and that, as an ecological analysis,the study design did not require a determinat ion that children in the group purportedly exposed to thimerosal were actually vaccinated. Tr. at 93-94. 9. Schechter and Grether, 296 RML 439. This 2008 ecological study examined a database unique to California to 294 J. Heron & J.

Although thimerosal was removed from va ccines produced in 2001, the shelf life of vaccines meant that some children still re ceived TCVs until 2003 and trace amounts in vaccines thereafter. Tr. at 3657-58. Thus, although exact amounts of thimerosal exposure were difficult to ascertain during the period from 2000-2003, rates of exposure certainly declined from the beginning to the end of that period. If TCVs contributed to ASD rates, a decline in ASD rates beginning in 2004 or 2005 would beexpected, because children diagnosed then would have been exposed to lower 297 or only trace amounts of thimerosal. Tr. at 3658. No decline was noted between the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2007. Tr. at 3658- 59. I note that Dr. Deth commented that this study was \"troubling\" for his hypot hesis of Fombonne conc eded that the prevalence rates in the earlier years of this study were almost certainly underestimates, but he nevertheless believed the study accurately illustrated the lack of impact on prevalence rates from the removal of TCVs. Tr. at 3739-40. A strong e ffect of thimerosal would have resulted in a changed trend line, and no effect wa s observed. Tr. at 3741-42. 10. Thompson study,298 PML 192. This 2007 CDC cohort study did not look s pecifically at ASDs, but it examined neurodevelopmental outcomes, based on the leve l of thimerosal exposure by seven months of age. Tr. at 3659-60. The study included direct assessment of the children by psychologists blinded as to vaccine or thim erosal exposure. Tr. at 3660. Prenatal exposure, including the ions, receipt (which contained thimerosal preservatives), of dental amalgams, and diet, as well as postnatal exposure of the child to TCVs were measured. Thompson, PML 192, at 1283. Like the Heron study in the U.K ., Thompson found no evidence of a thimerosal effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Tr. at 3661. E. Additional Analysis of the Epidemiological Studies. 1. Analysis of Epidemiological Evidence Showing No TCV-ASD Relationship.Doctor Fombonne properly conceded t he limitations of each of the epidemiological studies showing no relationship between TCVs and ASD or neurologicaldifficulties. Tr. at 3661-62. He noted, how ever, that with the ex ception of the Young study, discussed below, none showed any increased risk of ASD associated with TCVs. 297 Influenza vaccine recommended for administration to children are available in single dose vials (without thimerosal) and multi-dose vials (with thimerosal). IOM, I MMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW : VACCINES AND AUTISM 55-62, 65 (2004) [\"IOM 2004 Report\"], filed as RML 255 298 W. Thompson, et al., Early Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years , N. ENG. J. MED. 357(13): 1281-92 (2007) [\"Thompson\"], filed as PML 192. 111All of the studies showed a risk ratio close to one, with most of the risk ratios falling below one, suggesting a protective effect. Tr. at 3662. Because there is no biologicallyplausible reason for TCVs to have a protecti ve effect, the studies showing risk ratios below one are interpreted as being inconsistent with TCVs causing ASD. See Tr. at 3101-02. The results are consistent across di fferent populations in studies with different designs. Tr. at 3662. These factors, taken together, make the findings of no relationship between TCVs and ASD robust, and favor rejection of any causalhypothesis. Tr. at 3662. Doctor Rutter commented on the time-tr end and ecological studies, noting that they have \"manifest strengths\" in that they were based on very large numbers, but they have important limitations, the most significant of which is that they are studies of populations, not individuals. Tr. at 3304. 2. Analysis of the Young Study, 299 PML 665. The only studies demonstrating a relationship between TCVs and ASD are those in which Dr. and Mr. Geier appear as co- authors, including the Young study published in May, 2008, and funded by the OAP PSC. Tr . at 3665; Young, PML 665, at 117. Because petitioners' own expert commented that the Geier studies were not reliable as evidence (Tr. at 122-23) and they were t hus not addressed by respondent's experts, I do not discuss the earlier Geier studies any furt her. In view of the numerous criticisms of the earlier Geier studies300 and petitioners' own expert's dismissal of them, I have placed no reliance on them. The Young study was an ecological analysis using the VSD database. Tr. at 3665. Doctor Greenland did not comment on th is study during his testimony, as the 299 H.

A number of judges have had similar concerns about Dr. Geier's work. See, e.g. , Graham v. Wyeth Labs. , 906 F.2d 1399, 1418 (10th Cir. 1990) (Dr. Geier's calculation error was of sufficient magnitude so as to warrant a new trial); Redfoot v. B.F.

Lederle Labs. Geier's affidavit as \"conclusory and scattershot\" and \"undermined by many of the materials submitted in support of it\"). See also S. Parker, et al., Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Critical Review of Published Original Data , PEDIATRICS 114(3): 793-804 (2004) [\"Parker\"], filed as RML 368. 112article was introduced after his appearance and excusal.301 The study found an increased risk of ASD, based on increasing exposure to TCVs. Doctor Fombonne offered several criticisms of this study.302 In a critique common to many of the studies performed by Dr. and Mr. Geier,303 Dr. Fombonne commented that the Young article did not pr ovide the data that would allow others to verify the calculations performed. Tr. at 3666. Doctor Fombonne reproduced one chart from t he article on Slide 20 of Res. Tr. Ex. 12. Using the chart, he explained that the birth cohorts used in the study did not all contain the same number of individuals, wit h most representing 40,000 children. Tr. at 3666-67. One birth cohort, that of children born in 1990, contains only 2,000 children. Tr. at 3667. When this \"outlier\" is remov ed, the purported statistical relationship between ASD and TCVs during the first four years of the sample disappears. Tr. at 3667. Doctor Fombonne was also highly critical of the authors' addition of invented numbers to the 1995 and 1996 data from the VSD.304 Tr. at 3667-68. If the adjustments are removed, there is no co rrelation at all between the increase in thimerosal exposure and increase in autism cases per 10,000. Tr. at 3668. Doctor Fombonne commented: \"It's dishonest to im pute like 45 new cases which are just invented to top up the prevalence in a way whic h is supportive of their hypothesis. It's clear that these investigators have a clear tr ack record to do with the data that supports their hypothesis. And I've seen that in their previous papers.\" Tr. at 3757-58. Doctor Rutter offered similar criticisms of the Young study, PML 665, calling it \"a poor study for several different reasons.\" Tr. at 3387. It began with a cohort design, but ended up being analyzed as a time trend study. That required the authors to make 301 The Young study did not appear on the master list of petitioners' medical and scientific journals filed as exhibits on May 5, 2008, although the final version of the PML notes that it was published electronically on May 1, 2008. As it was funded by t he PSC, it is unlikely that petitioners' counsel were unaware of its publication. It was not provided to t he special masters during the general causation hearing until after Dr. Greenland testified, and was finally filed as PML 665 on August 4, 2008. This timingprecluded any comment by Dr. Greenland on the study. 302 In response to some of the criticisms by Dr. Fombonne, Dr. Young provided a letter explaining restrictions placed on her access to the VSD data. Pe t. Tr. Ex. 17 at 1-2. She did not explain why the restrictions were placed on her use of the data, a matter explained in several of respondent's filings. See, e.g., Respondent's Response to Petitioners' Second Motion to Compel and Motion for Issuance of Third- Party Subpoenas, OAP Master File, filed Jan. 19, 2007, at 16 and attached declarations A and B. 303 See IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 55-62, 65. 304 The authors made adjustments to these numbers because they believed the follow up of these children was truncated, based on the numbers they expected. Therefore, they added in notional numbers,increasing the numbers of cases by 45 in 1995, and 80 in 1996. Tr. at 3668. 113adjustments to the first and last cohorts. Doctor Rutter described this as \"putting together chalk and cheese in the hope of gazpacho soup coming out.\" Tr. at 3387. The\"analytic design and strategy was not a satisfactory one.\" Tr. at 3388. He pointed to Table 3 as a striking exam ple of the poor design. Tr. at 3388. Table 3 compares \"neurodevelopmental diso rders\" to several control disorders, measuring the difference in rates of the diso rder developing in the cohorts that received 100 micrograms more mercury. The table s hows higher rate ratios for autism, ASD, ADD/ADHD, developmental or learning disor ders, disturbance of emotions, and tics. 305 Young, PML 665, at 4. Doctor Rutter called this table an example of demonstrating a statistical effect without showing a causal e ffect. Tr. at 3388. If the neuroinflammation hypothesis is correct, it is difficult to explain how neuroinflammation causes tics or disturbance of emotions. The study report ed TCV effects across a very broad range of unconnected disorders having different ages of onset, different genetic factors, and different disease courses. Tr. at 3388. The broad range of effects in these diverse disorders caused Dr. Rutter to be \"immediately skeptical as to what [the study] shows. Tr. at 3388-89. He also questioned why \"disturbance of em otions\" was listed in the category of neurodevelopmental disorders, noting t hat anyone knowledgeable about the field of neurodevelopmental disorders would not have categorized it as one, and would have placed it with the control disorders. Tr. at 3389-90. To prove their hypothesis that increased mercury exposure causes increases in neurodevelopmental disorders but not control disorders, the authors have to demons trate that mercury is associated with increased rates of one but not the other. If \"disturbance of emotions\" was properly placed with the list of control disorders, it would undercut the authors' hypothesis. Their comparison between the two groups is t herefore invalid. Tr. at 3390-92. Doctor Young's subsequently-filed letter indi cated that she reanalyzed the data to respond to Dr. Fombonne's criticisms. After she removed the 1990 birth cohort (the onecontaining only 2,000 cases) and the notional cases for 1995 and 1996, the results forautism, ASD, and unspecified developmental di sorders lost statistical significance. 306 Pet. Tr. Ex. 17 at 3-4. She nevertheless defended the use of the 1990 birth cohort and her adjustments to the numbers for 1995 and 1996. Id. For the reasons indicated in the critic isms proffered by Drs. Fombonne and Rutter, I have accorded the Young study little we ight. An additional reason for viewing 305 I note that for each of these disorders, the authors found a statistically significant increase based on mercury exposure. However, the confidence in tervals were extremely large. The risk ratio for autism, for example, was 2.87, with a confidence inte rval ranging from 1.19 to 6.94. Young, PML 665, at 4. 306 The results for ADHD, tics, and emotional distur bances retained statistical significance. Pet. Tr. Ex. 17 at 3-4. 114this study as unreliable is the conflict of interest generated by the PSC's funding of the study. In its opinion on remand in Daubert , the Ninth Circuit considered whether the matters an expert proposed to testify about flowed from research conductedindependently of involvement in t he litigation in question, noting that this factor provides objective proof that the research was conducted for scientific purposes.

Ct. 2605, 2626 n.17 (2008) (the Supreme Court declined to consider research funded in part by a party to the litigation). 3. The Institute of Medicine Report on TCVs and ASD.Doctor Goodman was a member of the IOM Immunization Safety Review committee that considered the effect of TCVs on ASD in both 2001 and in 2004. His testimony provided an unusual insight into t he IOM decision-making process. Although IOM reports on vaccine safety have received special deference in Vaccine Act cases,the nature of the IOM decision-making proc ess has not been discussed in the opinions. so holding. See Stroud v. Sec'y, HHS , 113 HHS , 68 Fed. Cl. 84, 91 n.11 (2005). The Institute of Medicine is an independent body chartered by Congress as a branch of the National Academy of Sciences. It is specifically tasked with providing independent, objective, expert scientific advice to Congress, federal agencies, and other official governmental groups, but it remain s independent of them. It is one of the most highly regarded organizations in the scientific community. Election to the Institute of Medicine is one of the highest honors that a sci entist can receive. Tr. at 3072-73. The Immunization Safety Review Co mmittee included a neurologist, a pediatric neurologist, a neonatologist, an immunologist, an epidemiologist, biostatisticians, and experts in risk communication, public health, and vaccine biology, but no toxicologist. Tr. at 3078. In 2001, it concluded that the evidence was inadequate to make a judgment on whether TCVs played a role in developmental disorders, because studies of the TCV hypothesis were fragmentary. A dditional studies were recommended. Tr. at 3079-80. The committee used the phrase \"biologically plausible\" to describe the hypothesis in 2001. Tr. at 3080. At that time, the term \"biologically plausible\" was used in the sense that the hypothesis was possible, in t hat it did not violate physical principles. See IOM, I MMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW 13 (2001) [\"IOM 2001 Report\"], filed as RML 254. Because mercury is a known neurotoxin, the idea that it could produce neurologic damage was quite possible, not biologically im plausible or impossible. Tr. at 3080-81. However, the term \"biologically plausible\" wa s later misinterpreted as stating that the hypothesis was likely or probable, which is not what the IOM meant. Tr. at 3081; IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 3. 115Because of this misunderstanding, the committee decided to be more precise about how it evaluated the biological evidence in the subsequent report. In evaluating a proposed biological mechanism of how vaccines cause injury, the committee used threecategories: (1) theoretical only (which is w here \"biologically plausible\" could fall); (2) experimental; and (3) proven 307 or demonstrated. Tr. at 3081-82. \"Theoretically plausible\" would not include \"crackpot\" theorie s; a minimum level of credibility would be necessary. Tr. at 3081-82; IOM 2004 Report, RM L 255, at 29. \"Experimental\" would involve theories, some parts of which had been experimentally tested, but the entire mechanism of injury had not been established. \"Experimental\" hypotheses would be rated as weak or strong. \"Proven\" would require that an exposure was virtually certain to have caused an outcome.308 Tr. at 3082. In reconsidering the TCV-autism hypot hesis in 2004, the committee examined more recent epidemiological evidence and animal studies, took evidence in publicsession, and considered written submissions. Tr. at 3083-84. The evaluation options available to the committee were: (1) no evidence; (2) a causal connection established;(3) evidence favors a causal connection; (4) evidence is inadequate to establish acausal connection; and (5) evidence favors rejection of a causal connection. Tr. at3084-85; see also IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 2-3. The committee concluded unanimously that the evidence favored reject ion of a causal connection. Tr. at 3085; IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 16. This c onclusion meant that \"all the evidence point[ed] away from a causal relations hip,\" with \"no countervailing biological or mechanistic evidence that...would contravene that evidence.\" Tr. at 3085. It did not absolutely rule out the possibility of a rela tionship, but indicated that one was highly unlikely. Tr. at 3085-86. It is unusual for an IOM committee to concl ude that the evidence favors rejection of a hypothesis. Tr. at 3086-87. The co mmittee recommended that research into the biology of autism and the risk factors for autism be conducted, but recommended against additional studies into the epidemiology of autism in the general population as results were unlikely to be different. Tr. at 3087-88; IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 16- 17. It was both the strength of the epidem iological evidence, which included some of the studies discussed above, 309 and the absence of any laboratory or mechanistic evidence controverting it that led to t he committee's conclusion. IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 13. Since that conclusion was iss ued, all of the major studies discussed above, except the Young study, PML 665, have buttressed the IOM's conclusion. 307 The IOM committee identified this category as \"[ e]vidence that the mechanism results in known disease in humans.\" IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 29. 308 Challenge-rechallenge reactions in a given individual would rise to this level of virtual certainty. Tr. at 3082. 309 These included the Hviid, Verstraeten, Stehr-Green, and Madsen studies. Tr. at 3650. 116F. Relating to Dr. Greenland's Opinions. 1. Doctor Greenland's Opinions.Doctor Greenland conceded that the epidem iological studies have not found any association between TCVs and ASD, while asserti ng that it is theoretically possible that such an association exists in a small subgroup. Tr. at 121. Any association would have to be either small or nonexistent. Tr. at 122. He correctly noted that none of the studies of TCVs and ASD considered regressive autis m separately. Tr. at 87. He asserted that, if TCVs only affected regressive autis m, the studies would be unable to detect it, based on the dilution effect. 310 Tr. at 76; PML 715, at 12. However, the main focus of Dr. Greenland's testimony was predicated on the existence of clearly regressive autism as a subgroup. Because I have determined that there is no evidence that such a subgroup with an etiology distinct from other forms of autism exists, it is unnecessary to consider his opinions about the inapplicability of the existing epidemiological studies to this subgroup. Assuming, arguendo , that it does, I would still find the epidemiological studies of TCVs and ASD to be relevant on the issue of general causation. Doctor Greenland explained that in each 100 cases of autism, only 6 would be in the clearly regressive subtype.311 Tr. at 80. If TCV exposure increased the risk of clearly regressive autism by a factor of 2,312 then exposure to TCVs would change the number of clearly regressive autism cases to 12. Pet. Tr. Ex. 1 at 13-14; Tr. at 79-80. These six extra cases would change the total autism cases to 106.313 Tr. at 80. The risk ratio would be 106 over 100, or 1.06, a figure which is not detectable by the 310 The failure to analyze the data separately by type of condition can dilute the association of the exposure with the disease category to the point that t he association is undetectable. Tr. at 77. In his report, Dr. Greenland used types of cancer to illustrate th is principle. Smoking is significantly associated with lung cancer, but not with skin cancer. PML 715 at 4. Thus, if smoking is subject to anepidemiological analysis with all forms of cancer, an effect will not be detected, but one will be detected ifsmoking is examined in conjunction with lung cancer. This analogy fails if the types of autism are more akin to types of lung cancer than to cancer in general. See also Dr. Goodman's discussion at Tr. 3105-06, indicating that it makes no sense to analyze data s eparately by categories unless there is something to indicate that the categories are different on a biological basis. 311 How this 6% figure was derived and criticisms of that process were addressed in Section IV.H.3., above. For purposes of this analysis only, I accept Dr. Greenland's calculations. 312 Doctor Fombonne testified that only when a risk ratio is greater than 2 is the exposure considered to have increased the risk of the outcome being examined. See Tr. at 3627. 313 The number of cases of autism attributable to TCVs based on Dr. Greenland's postulate would not be inconsiderable in human terms. If the risk of \"clearly regressive autism\" is in the range of a 6-10%increase in risk from TCV exposure, there would be \"hundreds and hundreds\" of increased cases ofautism. Tr. at 95-96. 117epidemiological studies of autism. Tr. at 94. If the studies consider ASD, or developmental delay, rather than just autistic disorder, the dilution is even greater, and the increased risk would be even closer to one. Tr. at 81-82. For purposes of his analysis, Dr. Greenl and assumed that an increased risk of autism from TCVs was only applicable to the \"c learly regressive\" group. Tr. at 125-26. This opinion required a specificity of association314 of TCVs to cases of clearly regressive autism. See Tr. at 77. He used the term \"pre-specified\"315 in his report to reflect that the term may have been defined a fter the introduction of the hypothesis that TCVs cause only that form of autism. Tr. at 127. He conceded that if there is an effect of TCVs on autism, \"it must be concentrated in a very small group to have goneundetected to this point in time.\" Tr. at 135. 2. Criticisms of Dr. Greenland's Opinions. a. Regression and TCVs. Doctors Fombonne and Rutter disagreed with Dr. Greenland regarding detection of an effect of TCVs on regression alone. They asserted that if TCVs had an effect on regressive autism, it was a large enough ca tegory that epidemiological studies would detect it. Res. Ex. E, \u00b6 121(f) (Repor t of Dr. Fombonne); Tr. (testimony of Dr. Rutter). Doctor Fom bonne noted that in the 2002 CDC study, the state with one of the lowest rates of immunization (Utah) had the highest rate of regression. The state with the highest immunization co verage (South Carolina) had one of the lowest rates of regression. Tr. at 3675-77; Re s. Tr. Ex. 12, slide 27. In view of Dr. Greenland's statements that the subgroup effe ct must be small in order to escape detection ( see, e.g. , Tr. at 122, 135), the estimates of the substantial percentage of all ASD cases involving regression, and the great er experience and research focus into the epidemiology of ASD by Drs. Rutter and Fombonne, I accept the position ofrespondent's experts. If regressive autism as a whole were affected by TCVs, at least some of the existing epidemiological st udies would have detected an effect. 314 Specificity of association means that an exposur e has little or no association with most types of a disease category, but some association with one or a few of those types. Tr. at 77. 315 According to Dr. Fombonne, the term \"pre-specif ied\" has a particular meaning in epidemiology, and Dr. Greenland's use in this context was incorrec t. \"Pre-specified\" is used when there is some preliminary evidence that a subgroup might react diffe rently to a drug or a treatment and a study might plan in advance to consider the subgroup separately. Tr. at 3682-83. This contrasts with post hoc subgroup analyses, which are, like the Peto astrology example, known to produce spurious associations. Tr. at 3681-82. Doctor Greenland's use of the term was incorrect because there is no evidence that his\"clearly regressive autism\" subgroup reacted differently to TCVs. Tr. at 3683. 118b. Doctor Greenland's Computations Are Correct, But One-Sided. Respondent's experts agreed with Dr. Gr eenland's calculations, if not the assumptions underlying them, but noted t hat his analysis was one-sided. Doctor Goodman began by explaining the concept of \"mathematical bounds,\" referring to the uncertainty in any estimate of risk. Tr. at 3097-98. If there is absolutely no effect, the estimate would be zero, but in any study or combination of studies, there is a small plus or minus around the estimate, and it is in that plus or minus that a rare individual case might fit. Tr. at 3098. The only way to rule out the possibility of a possible effect is to prove the existence of a protective effe ct. Tr. at 3099. Doctor Goodman agreed that the bounds calculated by Dr. Greenland were t he appropriate limits for how high a risk a TCV effect might be in any small subgr oup without affecting the largely negative evidence regarding an association between TCVs and ASD. Tr. at 3097-98. However, confidence intervals are two-sided. The estimate is in the middle; to each side is a range within which relationships ar e consistent with the data. Tr. at 3101. A protective effect is as consistent with the data as an excess risk for the small subgroup. Tr. at 3102. The larger studies t end to show a protective effect from TCVs. Because there is no biological basis for such a protective effect, epidemiologists do notcall it one. However, because the numbers t end toward protection, the conclusion that there is no excess risk of ASD from TC Vs is buttressed. Tr. at 3101-02. By taking the upper limit of the confidenc e intervals for each study individually, Dr. Greenland could \"fit in\" a small subgroup. While it is mathematically possible that such an effect exists, it is not probabl e that it does. Tr. at 3099-3100. The IOM committee examined whether it was likely that such an effect existed, and it concluded that it was not. Tr. at 3100. c. The Postulated Effect Requires Biological Implausibility. Claims of subgroup effects in medicine ar e common, but the evidence that they exist is scant. Tr. at 3115. Assuming, arguendo , that clearly regressive autism is a separate and distinct form of ASD, in order for TCVs to affect it while simultaneously having no effect at all on any other form of ASD, clearly regressive autism must have a biological basis distinct from all other forms of ASD. Tr. at 3104. To fit into the small niche he carved out, Dr. Greenland's mathematical calculations require that TCVs have an effect only on children with clearly regr essive autism and no effect at all on the remaining 90-95% of the ASD population. Tr . at 3103-04. What this requires from a biological standpoint is that t here is a dramatically different causal pathway for those with clearly regressive autism such that TCVs would trigger it, but not trigger any of the other forms of autism. Tr. at 3104. In essence, Dr. Greenland's hypothesis requires that those with clearly regressive autism have \"a fundamentally different biology than children who don't present with that phenotype.\" Tr. at 3104. Assuming an entirely different causal pathway for a subgroup of regressive 119autism is reasonable only if there is some reason to suspect a different causal mechanism at work. As Dr. Goodman poi nted out, neither Dr. Greenland nor any of petitioners' other expert witnesses present ed biological evidence that suggested a different biological basis for regressive autis m as distinguished from early onset autism. Tr. at 3127-28. To the contrary, there were ample reasons proffered for doubting that regressive autism has any separate biological mechanism. See, e.g. , Tr. at 3570, 3689- 91; Dwyer Tr. at 256-57. G. Conclusion. Epidemiological evidence has limitations. It cannot speak to causation in an individual case. It can, however, suffi ciently undermine a hypothesis or theory regarding causation, making reliance on su ch a theory unreasonable under all the facts and circumstances of an individual case. To use Althen's terms, epidemiological studies point out possible logical connections between two events; further scient ific effort must ensue to establish whether the connections are biologically plaus ible and therefore truly logical. After studying the evidence available, the IOM c oncluded that the evidence favored rejection of the TCV-ASD hypothesis. Since that 2004 conclusion, all of the reliable epidemiological studies have buttressed the finding of no relationship. Each epidemiological study filed has limit ations that affect the data acquired and may affect the conclusions drawn. However, when numerous well-designed studies have looked at a particular issue and arrived at the same or similar conclusions, thelikelihood that the studies' limitations have caused the negative results becomes vanishingly small. Epidemiology can never be direct proof that vaccines do not cause ASD, but it can be strong circumstantial evidenc e that causation is improbable. In this case, the epidemiological studies furnish powerful evidence refuting a causalassociation between TCVs and ASD. Section VI. Mercury and the Causation Theories. A. Mercury 316 Toxicology. 1. Overview.The causation hypotheses in the Theory 2 cases rest on mercury's effects on the brain. Doctor Deth theorized that merc ury affected the body's sulfur metabolism at several critical junctures, operating in such a way that small amounts of mercury could produce devastating effects. Doctor Kinsbourne relied on a mercury-triggered 316 Many of the scientific and medical journal articles and some of the expert reports used mercury's scientific symbol,\"Hg.\" 120imbalance in excitatory and i nhibitory neurotransmitters. Underpinning both causation theories were Dr. Aposhian's testimony and reports on mercury's toxicology.317 The very cursory report of Dr. Haynes added virtually nothing to the general causation case.318 Aside from a tendency to conflate the various forms of mercury, Dr. Aposhian's testimony on mercury's basic chemistry did not differ in most respects from that of Dr. Brent, respondent's medical toxicologist. Their areas of disagreement related to the effects of di fferent species of mercury, the importance of the dose-response relationship, their interpreta tions of the various studies of mercury's effects, and the quantity of mercury from TC Vs that would reach the brain. As a medical doctor who is board certified in m edical toxicology and who has treated patients for mercury and other heavy metal poisoning, Dr. Brent's testimony carried greater weight on matters relating to mercury's effects on the human body. Some aspects of Dr. Aposhian's testimony were troubling. He occasionally cited studies in support of his testimony, t hat, when examined, did not support that testimony.319 In spite of his acknowledgment that the various species320 of mercury had 317 Although Dr. Aposhian also offered causation opi nions, testifying that some autism is caused by the failure of cells to efflux mercury, and some is caused by a teratogen which producesneuroinflammation (Tr. at 234), he lacked the qualif ications in medicine in general and neurology or teratology in particular to proffer these causati on opinions. I have consider ed his opinions on mercury's causation of autism, but have placed little reliance on them, both because of his lack of qualifications to opine, and because of problems with the studies or other evidence he relied upon in reaching those opinions. See Section VI.D. A considerable portion of Dr. Aposhian's testimony was devoted to developmental biology and autism. Tr. at 147-52 (aut ism), 211-15 (developmental biology). The slides that accompanied this testimony were drawn from the IOM Forum on Autism and the Environment in April,2007. See, e.g. , Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 73 (footer). A review of Dr. Aposhian's CV, PML 710, establishes that the causation opinions he offered were outside hi s area of expertise. However, I have relied in some measure on Dr. Aposhian's testimony about mercury's to xicology, an area in which he is qualified to opine. 318 Doctor Haynes was not called as a witness, and his very short expert report appears to have been filed in an effort to bridge the gap created by Dr . Aposhian's lack of qualifications to testify about medical matters. As indicated in Section I.D.6 above, Dr. Haynes was less qualified to opine aboutmercury's toxicology and effects on the human body than Dr. Brent. He does not appear to havepublished any papers dealing with mercury, conducted any research into mercury's effects on the humanbody, or treated children or adults with mercury toxicity. His expert report (Pet. Ex. 15) is less than threepages long, is devoid of any citations to medical or sci entific literature, and consists primarily of conclusory statements. It does not address the critical factors of dose, speciation, or many of mercury's knowneffects, and does not address the Althen factors. Doctor Brent's opinions, which were based on his experience in treating children with mercury exposure and autism, well-supported by scientific literature,and cogently explained, were entitled to significant weigh t. Additionally, they were tested in the crucible of cross-examination and in questioning by the special mast ers. For all of these reasons, I did not find Dr. Haynes' report illuminating or persuasive on the general c ausation issue. His opinions specific to Colin's medical condition are addressed in Section X.G.3., below. 319 For example, although an article (G. Harry, et al., Mercury concentrations in brain and kidney following ethylmercury, methylmercury and 296) appears in the title area of Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 53, most of 121different toxicokinetics, he often attributed the effects of one species to another. Much of his direct testimony appeared scripted, cons isting of reading his slides (Pet. Tr. Ex. 2) verbatim.321 On cross-examination, he pr ovided wandering, anecdotal, and non- responsive answers. e.g. , Tr. at 248-49, tions with comments such as \"it depends on how you define ...\" (Tr. at 245) or \"this is a court of law and I must tell the truth\" (Tr. at 409). See also Tr. at 150, 244, 247, 256, 272-73, 380-81, 386, 408, 454. Because mercury's chemistry and toxicology provided the basis upon which the testimony of Drs. Deth and Kinsbourne rested, this section necessarily begins with a short discussion of mercury and its com pounds and how human exposure to mercury occurs. However, most of the section discusse s the studies that inform the critical issue in petitioners' case: the effects specific quantities of mercury have on human bodies. In examining and weighing the evidence submi tted, including the numerous scientific and medical journal articles filed and the test imony concerning them, I considered the following factors: (1) the species of mercury involved in the study; (2) the dose received;(3) the route of administrat ion employed; (4) the length of exposure; (5) the type of study ( e.g., human, animal, or cell culture and type of cell); (6) the effects measured; (7) how the effects were detected and in what tissues; (8) whether the reported effects could be or had been duplicated by other res earchers; and (9) whether the effects reported in experiments were c onsistent with those from other types of exposure to the same substance, such as those in accidental poisonings. Applying this methodology, I conclude that the brain levels of inorganic mercury produced by infant vaccinations are, as Dr. Brent testified, minuscule, compared to the brain mercury from other sources. Tr. at 1960. There is no evidence that these levels are high enough to generate thewidespread neuroinflammation found in t he Vargas autopsy study, PML 69. the data on the slide does not appear in the article cit ed. Only the first and last bullet points are drawn from that article. His report had similar problems. For example, he cited N. Morton, Genetic Epidemiology of Hearing Impairment , ANN. N.Y. ACAD. SCI. 630: 16-31 (1991), filed as PML 208, for the proposition that a genetic predisposition and a fever may increase the impact of a stress-causing agent. The article does not mention stress or fever. See Tr. at 273-74. 320 The term \"species\" refers to different mercury compounds. See Tr. at 155. 321 See, e.g. , Tr. at 204-05 (presiding Special Master's comments indicating that Dr. Aposhian did not need to read his slides). A comparison of Dr. Aposhian's testimony to the corresponding slides from Pet. Tr. Ex. 2 reflects the extent to which his testimony involved reading the prepared slides. E.g., Tr. at 170-73 and Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slides 32-33 (near verbatim reading of slide content as testimony). 1222. Mercury and Its Compounds.322 Mercury is the only metallic element to ex ist in nature in liquid form. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 610. It is extrem ely reactive and readily forms compounds with other substances, particularly thiols,323 and is present in varying concentrations in nearly all marine life. Id. at 612. Inorganic mercury324 compounds are those which do not contain carbon atoms, and, by this definition, include elemental mercury, mercuric mercury, and mercurous mercury. Clarkson 2007, PML 622, at 1.325 However, elemental mercury (\"metallic mercury\") is often put into a separate cat egory because its toxicological properties differ from those of other inorganic mercury compounds. Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 25;326 Tr. at 155- 56; Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 1-2. Organic mercury consists of mercury compounds containing carbon atoms, and includes methylmercury, ethylmercury, and phenylmercury compounds. Tr. at 157-58; , RML 6, on 2007, PML 622, at 1-2. Thimerosal, the vaccine component implicated in petitioners' theories of causation, consists of about 49.6% ethylmercury (Andrew s, PML 4, at 584), and is thus classed as an organic mercury compound. Thimerosal contains a mercury-sulfur bond that is broken very rapidly after injection into the body, where it metabolizes quickly to ethylmercury. Tr. at 173. Both methylmercury and ethylmercury are further metabolized in the body (ethylmercury is 322 Much of the information presented in this section is derived from Toxicological Profile for Mercury , published by the Agency for Toxic Subst ances and Disease Registry [\"ATSDR\"] (1999) [\"Toxicological Profile for Mercury \"], filed as RML 6, in addition to the testimony and expert reports from Drs. Aposhian and Brent. This publication is writt en in plain language, unlike many of the scientific and technical journal articles filed as exhibits. I have also relied heavily on T. Clarkson & L. Magos, The Toxicology of Mercury and Its Chemical Compounds , (it was also filed as PML 289). Doctors Clarkson and Magos are twoof the most widely published authorities on mercury toxi cology, and much of this overview is drawn from this review article. Although Dr. Aposhian made a disparaging comment about their work in his expert report (PML 711 at 9), he withdrew that comment during his testimony. Tr. at 374-76. 323 Thiols are sulfur-containing compounds. See Section VII.B.2. below. 324 Inorganic mercury is often abbreviated as \"Hg++.\" Doctor Kinsbourne used this abbreviation throughout his expert report, PML 717. 325 T. Clarkson, et al., Mechanisms of Mercury Disposition in the Body , AM. J. INDUST . MED. (electronic publication with no further citation provided) (2007) [\"Clarkson 2007\"], filed as PML 622. 326 This slide quotes from an article by Goyer and Clarkson in CASARETT & DOULL 'S TOXICOLOGY : THE BASIC SCIENCE OF POISONS (6th ed. 2001) [\"Goyer and Clarkson\"], listed as PML 664. Petitioners did not actually file this source. Respondent filed excerpted pages as RML 276, but the filed pages do notcontain this quotation. 123deethylated and methylmercury is demethylat ed), forming inorganic mercury, often called mercuric mercury. Tr. at 466-67. Once methyl- or ethylmercury has beenconverted to inorganic mercury, it is im possible to determine its original source. Mercuric mercury (inorganic mercury) is a mercury ion and all mercury ions areidentical. Tr. at 1804. 3. Measurements. One difficulty in analyzing the evidence in th is case is that the numerous studies in evidence used different quantities and spec ies of mercury in experiments, making it difficult to compare results. The studies al so referred to the same quantity of mercury in different ways. For example, one study mi ght refer to \"micrograms\" or \"mcg\" while another study would use the symbol \" g\" for the same quantity of measurement. Doctor Aposhian included a slide that compared quantities and covered standard abbreviations as Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 6. The following tables are extracted from that slide and other evidence. See, e.g. , Res. Ex. EE, Supplemental Report of Dr. Brent, at 2; Tr. at 1813 (discussing page 2 of Res. Ex. EE). Occasionally, I have translatedmeasurements in a study or testimony in accordance with this table to aid in comparisons to a study using a different term for the same quantity of measurement. a. Weight Measures. Unit Symbol Quantity kilogram Kg 1 Kg = about 2.2 pounds gram g 1 g = 1/1000 Kgmilligram mg 1 mg = 1/1000 gmicrogram g 1 g = 1/1,000,000 g or 1/1000 one millionth billionth of a gram. b. Liquid Measures. Unit Symbol Quantity liter L 1 L= approximately one quart milliliter ml or mL 1 ml = 1/1000 Lmicroliter l1 = 1/1,000,000,000 L c. Dose Measurements. Many of the studies involved doses of mercury based on body weight, or quantifications of the amount of a substance contained in a cell or a volume of fluid. E.g., T. Burbacher, et al., Comparison of Blood and Brain Mercury Levels in Infant Monkeys Exposed to Methylmercury or Vaccines Containing PML 26 (dose based on kilograms of body weight; measurements of mercury per gram of tissue). The following table illustrates those comparisons. Unit Abbreviation Quantity parts per millionppm 1 g per g (g/g); 1 mg per Kg (weight measures) 1 g per mL ( g/mL); or 1 mg per L (liter) (liquid measures) parts per billionppb 1 ng per g; 1 g per Kg (weight measures) 1 ng per mL; 1 g per liter (liquid measures) The studies and testimony also discussed dose over time. For example, an experimental animal might be administered 1 g/Kg/day (one microgram of the substance per kilogram of body weight per day). See, e.g. , M. Vahter, et al., Speciation of Mercury in the Primate Blood and Brai n Following Long-Term Exposure to Methyl as PML 60. d. Measurements Based on Molecular Weights. Some studies discuss concentrations of me rcury within certain solutions, such as blood, based on molecular weight. E.g., M. Pichichero, et al., Mercury concentrations and metabolism in infants receiving vaccines containing thiomersal : a descriptive study , LANCET 360(9347): 1737-40 (2002) [\"Pichichero 2002\"], filed as PML 223. Determining these concentrations involves the atomic we ight of the solute, in this case either mercury or thimerosal. The atomic wei ght of mercury is 200.59 atomic mass units [\"AMU\"]; the atomic weight of thimerosal is 404.6 AMU. The following table provides pertinent comparisons between nanam olar measurements and the \" parts per billion\" measurements in most studies cited. See Pet. Tr.

Sources of Human Exposure to Mercury. Human exposure to mercury begins in uter o. The fetus is exposed to mercury present in the mother's blood as the result of diet, dental amalgams, TCVs, and other medical products (such as immunoglobulins given to Rh negative women inpregnancy 327). Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 16; Tr. at 364-65. Of note, the fetus may acquire a higher or lower le vel of mercury than that of the mother, depending on the species of mercury to which the mother is exposed. Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 627; Clarkson PML 622, at 3. Dental amalgams (fillings), which cont ain approximately 50% metallic mercury, are the primary source of elemental merc ury exposure, with very small amounts coming from water and airborne sources, including power plant328 and volcanic emissions. Tr. at 158-59; Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 27; Cla rkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 625. Exposure to ethylmercury is almost exclusively from vaccines (Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 645) and other pharmaceuticals, although there have been some cases of exposure from ethylmercu ry-containing fungicides and treated grain products. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 647. 327 See S. James, et al., Thimerosal Neurotoxicity is Associated with use of aining \"Rho D in pregnancy); see also 1630 (RhoGAM). 328 According to Dr. Aposhian, coal-fired utility plants produce 70% of the mercury vapor in the general environment, which is highly concentrated in t he immediate area of the plant. Tr. at 159. An article by L. Trasande, et al., Public Health and Economic Consequences of Methyl Mercury Toxicity to the Developing Brain , ENVTL. HEALTH PERSP . 113(5): 590-96, 590 (2005), filed as PML 86, lists other sources as well as coal-fired utility plants: \"[A]nthropogenic em issions from coal-fired electric power generation facilities, chloralkali production, waste incineration, and other industrial activities now account forapproximately 70%...of mercury.\" 126However, most human organic mercury exposure comes from methylmercury, primarily in dietary sources. Tr. at 1803. Methylmercury enters the environment through natural sources (such as volcanic em issions), mining, and the burning of fossil fuels. Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 4. Once released from rocks and soil or precipitated from the air, mercury enters the food chain through the action of microorganisms that convert inorganic mercury to methylmercury. Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 5. In infants, dietary mercury is ingested through breast milk, which contains both inorganic and methylmercury.329 Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 16-17. If an infant is fed breast milk exclusively, infant hair and blood levels are in the same range as that of the mo ther. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 627. In older infants, children, and adults, the primary dietary sources of mercury are from fish, and possibly chicken.330 Tr. at 152-53; Tr. at 1802-04. Inorganic mercury is also present in food sources, but it is poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, and thus has a minimal effect on body burden ofmercury. 331 The WHO has estimated that t he European and North American general population ingests approximately 4 g of inorganic mercury per day, compared to a total daily intake of 6.6 g of all forms of mercury daily.332 Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 613. 5. Dose-Response Relationships. Notwithstanding Dr. Aposhian's testimony to the contrary (Tr. at 144, 253-54), 333 the dose-response relationship remains central to the science of toxicology. C ASARETT 329 Inhaled mercury vapor is also expressed in br east milk at concentrations of about 55% of blood mercury concentrations. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 622. 330 Doctor Aposhian testified that chicken is a source of dietary mercury exposure because chickens are often fed fish meal, which would cont ain methylmercury. Tr. at 152-53. He provided one citation for his statement ( see Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 24), but the article referenced was not filed. One of Dr. Aposhian's references, Committee on the Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury, Board on Environmental Studies, National Research Council, Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury (2000), [\" Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury \"], filed as PML 228, indicated that mercur y ingestion from poultry or other animals fed fish meal was possible, but that no data were available. Id. at 40. 331 According to Dr. Aposhian, about 15% of i ngested mercuric mercury is absorbed from the digestive tract. Tr. at 160; Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 28 (quoting Goyer and Clarkson, PML 664 (not filed), RML276, at 834). 332 The mercury content of many fish and marine mammals, as well as that of breast milk, is listed in Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 402-31 (fish and mammals) and 444-45 (breast milk). Estimates of daily mercury exposure from diet are found at Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 432-39. 333 Doctor Aposhian also acknowledged that dos e is an important consideration even though he denied that dose plays a central role. Tr. at 144, 253. 127& DOULL 'S TOXICOLOGY : THE BASIC SCIENCE OF POISONS [\"CASARETT & DOULL 'S\"] (6th ed. 2001), filed as RML 276. Doctor Brent emphasized that, although not everyone responds in exactly the same way to an i dentical dose of a substance, almost all processes are dose-related. With few exceptions, at very small doses even toxicsubstances are not harmful. The corollary is that at very large doses, almost everything can be harmful. Tr. at 1799. Other factors that may affect toxicity of a specific substance include: the chemical form of the substance; the age, 334 health status, genetic makeup, diet,335 and immune status of the individual; the route of administration; and the amount of the substance that reaches areas of vulnerability (the concentration at the site of action). See Tr. at 144-45. It may also depend on the effectiveness of the body's detoxification process. See Section VII below. Doctor Brent illustrated the concept of dose-response with examples of dose- response curves. Res. Tr. Ex. 4, slide 4. Most substances produce what is called athreshold dose-response curve. Tr. at 1800. At a very small dose, there is no effect inanyone. As the dose becomes higher, those most sensitive to the agent begin to show effects and, at higher doses, nearly all those exposed show effects. See Tr. at 1801. A threshold dose-response curve resembles a ski slope, with an initial flat area where noeffects are observed, and an increasingly st eep slope as the dose increases and more individuals experience an effect. See Tr. at 1800-01. The dose needed to produce a specified effect resembles a bell curve, as shown on slide 5 of Res. Tr. Ex. 4; Tr. at 1800- 01. A small number of people respond to a 334 In general, fetuses and very young children are the most vulnerable to toxic agents. Doctor Aposhian testified that it takes a premature neonate about four times longer than an adult to get rid of a chemical, citing a study by G. Ginsberg, et al., Evaluation of child/adult pharmacokinetic differences from a database derived from the therapeutic drug literature , TOXICOL . SCI. 66(2): 185-200 (2002), filed as PML 439, in support. Tr. at 146. Unfortunately, petitioners filed only one page from this article. A chartappearing on Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 13, was extracted from the filed page and reflects drug half-time for specific types of drugs, which included lorazepam, mor phine, and valproic acid. The study did not address mercury at all, but it is generally recognized that fetuses may be severely affected by maternal mercury levels that have little effect on the mother. The age-dependent effects of mercury are discussed infra . 335 Dietary factors play a role in mercury's toxi cology. Tr. at 168-69, 278; Report of Dr. Aposhian, PML 711, at 7. See S.

TOXICOL . 30(8): 703-08 (1992) [\"Hojbjerg\"], filed as PML 271. A diet of 50% of cod liver oil resulted in a retention of significantly lessmercury than a diet of 50% coconut oil. PML 271 at 705. The authors concluded that diet composition was of major importance in assessing the toxicokinetics of methylmercury and mercuric mercury. PML271 at 707; see also C.

Nearly everyone falls within two standard deviations of the dose at which most experience an effect. Tr. at 1801. 6. Toxicokinetics. a. Overview. Different species of mercury have different toxicological properties. They generally enter the human body through diffe rent mechanisms (metallic mercury through inhalation, methylmercury th rough the gastrointestinal system, and ethylmercury through injection), are excret ed in different amounts over time, and may have affinities for different organs. They may be metabolized to the same substance(inorganic mercury) but the transport and me tabolization mechanisms also differ. Mercury is generally acknowledged to be the me tal with the most diversity of effects among its species. C ASARETT & DOULL 'S, RML 276, at 834. A drop or two of dimethylmercury on the skin is fatal;336 a drop or two of metallic mercury on the skin is unlikely to have any effect at all, unle ss heated and the vapors inhaled. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 612; Tr. at 156-57. Both elemental and organic mercury co mpounds are metabolized in the body. Some of the mercury is excreted, primarily in feces and to a lesser extent in urine, and some is converted to inorganic mercury (mercuric mercury) which binds to body tissuesand is thus not readily excreted. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 611. Precisely how much mercury is excreted from a given dose is difficult to determine, because few studies attempted to quantify the mercury contained in feces. 337 Differences in toxicokinetics mean that effects seen in studies conducted on one species of mercury cannot be automatica lly extrapolated to another species, without some evidence that the two substances have similar toxicological properties and similar effects on human metabolism. Unfortunately fo r elucidation of the issues presented in the Theory 2 test cases, most studies have focused on the effects of methylmercury or metallic mercury, rather than the ethylmer cury contained in TCVs. In equal doses, methylmercury is more neurotoxic than ethy lmercury. Tr. at 1969 (discussing L. Magos, et al., The comparative toxicology of ethyl- and . About a 20-30 percent higher dose of ethylmercury is necessary to show the sa me neurotoxic effects. Tr. at 1969; Magos 336 See D. Nierenberg, et al., Delayed Cerebellar Disease and Death after Accidental Exposure to Dimethylmercury , N. ENG. J. MED. 338(23): 1672-76 (1998), filed as PML 3 (recounting the death of a laboratory worker who spilled one or two drops of dimethylmercury onto her gloved hand). 337 The Pichichero 2002 study, PML 223, conducted spot measurements of fecal excretion at the same time blood mercury levels were measured. This study is discussed in more detail below. 1291985, PML 175, at 260. However, unlike the Theory 1 cases, w here the petitioners were attempting to demonstrate immune system effects of ethylm ercury by relying on methylmercury studies, in the Theory 2 cases, the methyl mercury studies carry somewhat greater weight. Because the \"agent of action\" in the Theory 2 cases is inorganic mercury, and both ethylmercury and methylmercury are metabolized to inorganic mercury (mercuric mercury), anything that produces inorganic mercury may produce the postulated result. Thus, with certain caveats, studies of the e ffects of inorganic mercury in the brain are relevant to petitioners' theory, regardless of the species of mercury that produced the inorganic mercury. One caveat is that, although both methyl mercury and ethylmercury metabolize to form inorganic mercury, attributing ill effect s to TCVs is complicated by the vastly greater quantity of methylmercur y to which humans are exposed.338 A second caveat is that identical amount s of methylmercury and ethylmercury will not produce the same amount of i norganic mercury in the human body. See Magos 1985, PML 175, at 260 (based on a rat study ). Thus, in extrapolating from methylmercury studies to possible effects of ethylmercury, it is necessary to examine closely the dose required. A third caveat is that methylmercury demethylates to inorganic mercury much more slowly see Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 624), and thus the time period during which t he inorganic mercury is present and acting as hypothesized must be considered in extr apolating from methylmercury studies to ethylmercury's possible effects. Finally, the excretion rates of methyl- and ethylmercury differ dramatically, with ethylmercury removed from blood and tissue much more rapidly than methylmercury, leaving far less ethylmercury available in the body to be deethylated to inorganicmercury. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 646-47. 338 For example, in adult Americans, fish consumption results in the ingestion of 11,000 g of methylmercury annually (Tr. at 1805), compared to the very small amount of ethylmercury present in a single annual influenza vaccine (12.5 g) or which was once present in the series of hepatitis B vaccines (12.5 g in each of the three vaccinations recommended) (IOM 2001 Report, RML 254, at 28). Even when most non-viral vaccines contained thimerosal, breast-fed infants received more mercury from breast milk(estimated to be approximately 280 g over six months) than they did from TCVs administered during the first six months of life (187.5 g from the recommended vaccine schedule on average). Tr. at 1805; IOM 2001 Report, RML 254, at 28. 130b. Half-time.339 Half-times for mercury in the body vary based on species of mercury and the body tissue or fluid involved. Half-time in the brain differs from that in the blood and kidneys, with a generally biphasic pattern, a short initial half-time for organic mercury,followed by a much longer secondary half-time for the inorganic mercury produced bydemethylization or dealklyzation. Clarks on and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 617, 619. c. Measurement Methods. Urinary excretion rates (expressed either as g/g of creatinine 340 or as g/L) are the most frequently used measurements fo r total body burden of inhaled mercury.341 Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 618. Hair measurements are not useful in measuring excretion of inhaled mercury vapor because inorganic mercury is not readily accumulated in hair. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 618-19. Levels of total mercury in scalp hair ar e probably the best indicator of mercury levels in the brain after methylmercur y exposure. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 629. Hair mercury levels contain about 80% methylmercury and about 20% inorganic mercury after methylmercury exposure, wit h the inorganic mercury the probable result of metabolization of methylmercury in t he hair follicle, not other inorganic mercury exposure. Id.; see also Cernichiari, RML 72,342 at 1019-20. Brain mercury levels are about five times higher than blood mercury levels and scalp hair levels are about 250 times higher than blood concentration after 339 \"Half-time\" refers to the period of time required to reduce mercury levels by half. D ORLAND 'S at 810. Thus if the initial blood level of mercury is measured at 8 g, the half-time (sometimes called half life) is the number of days required before the blood level is reduced to 4 g. Half-time measurements do not necessarily mean that half the mercury was eliminated from the body, simply that half the mercury waseliminated from the tissue or fluid in which it was measured. 340 Adults excrete approximately 1.6 g of creatinine per day; therefore, 1 g of creatinine is equal to about 15 hours of urine flow. A mercury level of 1 g/g of creatinine is approximately the same as a mercury level of 1 g/L of urine. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 619. But see L. Bjorkman & M. Vahter, Letter to the Editor, T OXICOL . LETT. 169: 91-92 (2007), filed as PML 200. This letter describes factors that affect creatinine levels in urine, noting that \"there are major differences in urinary creatinine by gender, physical activity, and nutrition.\" Id. at 91. The authors suggest using specific weight of the urine samples to account for variations in the dilution of solutes in urine samples. Id. 341 Urinary mercury levels correlate with the number of dental amalgam surfaces. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 622. Ten amalgam surfaces cause, on average, an increase of 1 g/L of urinary mercury. Brain levels in the occipital lobe on autopsy also correlated with the number of amalgam fillings. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 622. 342 See E. Cernichiari, et al., The biological monitoring of prenatal exposure , at 1015-16. 131methylmercury exposure. Hair levels increase or decline commensurate with blood levels of 20 days earlier, reflecting the ti me required for hair growth. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 627. Howeve r, brain-to-blood concentration ratios343 for methylmercury are useful for estimating brain levels only when a steady state344 of mercury is attained. Cernichiari, RML 72, at 1018 (noting that the ratios also differ from species to species). Data on blood and brain levels in ethylmercury exposure are less well established. The available data come from studies discussed below. d. Symptoms and Damage. In general, the symptoms of methylmerc ury and ethylmercury intoxication are similar, but those receiving high doses of ethylmercury may also experience renal effects. Clarkson and M agos 2006, PML 35, at 646-47; see also Tr. at 194-95. Methylmercury has an affinity for the central nervous system, which is illustrated in the symptoms observed in victims, and in the brain damage found on autopsies. Paresthesia345 is the first symptom, but numbness, at axia, incoordination, loss of vision and hearing, and slurred speech are all common symptoms. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 630-31, 632. Constriction of visual fields is a frequently reported symptom. E.g., Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 630. A threshold dose must be received before toxic effects are observed. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 653. Onset of symptoms of paresthesia occurs at blood mercury levels in excess of 200 g/L of whole blood and at levels above 50 g/g of hair.346 Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 631. Human exposure to 200-500 g/Kg for 18 days or chronic 343 Doctor Brent described the brain-to-blood ratio as a ratio derived from a number of studies that allows an estimate of a brain level of mercury to be drawn from the actual blood level. See Res. Ex. EE,at 10 (describing how a ratio that Dr. Aposhian relied on was improper because of how it was derived). However, a ratio from one species of mercury shoul d not be used to estimate brain levels of another species of mercury. Tr. at 1876-80; Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 629. Problems also exist inusing brain-to-blood ratios from an animal study to estimate human brain-to-blood ratios. See, e.g. , Res. Ex. EE, at 7. 344 Steady state is the point at which blood levels cease to rise in response to additional mercury intake. It represents a state of dynamic equilibrium. See DORLAND 'S at 1755; see also Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at Fig. 6 (diagram representing steady state). 345 \"Paresthesia\" is defined as an abnormal touch sensation, such as burning or tingling. DORLAND 'S at 1371. 346 Onset of paresthesia occurred, on average, at 40 mg of exposure, although paresthesia occurred at doses as low as 25 mg of methylmercury. Threshold doses for ataxia, dysarthria, deafness,and death were 55, 90, 170, and 200 mg of Hg, respectively. F. Bakir, et al., Methylmercury poisoning in Iraq, S CIENCE 181(96): 230-41, 238 (1973) [\"Bakir\"], filed as PML 178. 132exposure to levels of from 90-125 g/Kg per day for 100 or more days produced clinical symptoms of mercury intoxication, includi ng ataxia, incoordination and weakness, and sensory disorders. Central nervous system damage-characterized by loss of sensation in hands, feet, and paresthesia around the mouth; ataxia; slurred speech; diminution of vision; and loss of hearing-was common, wit h extremity numbness and paresthesia as the first symptoms noted. Severe poisoni ng resulted in blindness, coma, and death. Bakir, PML 178, at 230, 236. Autopsies of adult methylmercury vict ims showed damage restricted to focal areas of the brain and included cerebellar co rtical atrophy involving the granule cell layer of the neocerebellum. Purkinje cells in the same area were largely spared. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 631. The symptoms of ethylmercury pois oning in the China seed rice cases347 observed in over 10% of the patients we re (in order of most frequent symptom): weakness, loss of appetite, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, fever, numbness of extremities, pares thesia, ataxia, vomiting, th irst, unsteady gait, tinnitus, headache, fatigue and sleepiness, heart palpitation, inability to walk, polyuria, and chest pain. See Zhang, PML 232, at Table I. Mild exposure cases were estimated to have ingested 0.5-1.0 mg/Kg body weight. Zhang, PML 232, at 253. e. Fetal and Neonatal Exposures. Elemental mercury inhaled during pregnan cy reaches the fetal brain through a circuitous route, passing from the mother's lungs to her blood, crossing the placenta, and then passing through the fetus' liver, w here some of the elemental mercury is oxidized. For this reason, after inhalation of mercury vapor, fetal brain levels of mercury are lower than maternal brain levels. Clarks on 2007, PML 622, at 3. The opposite effect occurs with regard to methylmercury. Brain levels in newborns may be as much as five times higher than those of the mother, based on animal studies.348 Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 627; see also Tr. at 2436. Both cord blood and maternal hair have been used to measure the infant's prenatal exposure to methylmercury. Cord blood measures the mercury level at the time of delivery, whereas maternal hair levels can be used to measure mercury levels 347 See J. Zhang, Clinical Observations in Ethyl Mercury Chloride Poisoning , AM. J. INDUST . MED. 5: 251-58 (1984) [\"Zhang\"], filed as PML 232. 348 Doctor Rodier helped determine why fetuses ar e more sensitive to methylmercury ingestion than their mothers. Methylmercury causes arrest of ce lls in the process of dividing (called mitosis) at a point called starry metaphase. Infant brains have many cells at this point, but adult brains have very few. See Tr. at 2914-15. 133over the course of the pregnancy.349 Clarkson and Magos PML 35, at 627, 629. Maternal exposures to ethylmercury occur primarily through vaccines administered during pregnancy, and through use of other pharmaceuticals, and are not a significant source of exposure. See Tr. at 364-65. More detailed information on fetal mercury exposure is contained in Section B.5 below. f. Comparing Toxicokinetics of Ethylmercury and Methylmercury. Clarkson and Magos substances, saying: \"Methyl- and ethylmercury differ shar ply in the patterns of tissue deposition and in the rate of metabolism to inorganic mercur y. These large differences in disposition and metabolism indicate that the data on meth ylmercury are not a suitable reference for risk assessment for thimerosal.\" Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 647. They also concluded that equivalent amount s of ethylmercury present a lesser risk to health than from methylmercury. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at methylmercury, \"[t]he peak value . . appears to determinant of toxic damage.\" PML 35 at 633. In contrast, although acute high levels of ethylmercury have been documented to caus e high brain levels of inorganic mercury and neurological symptoms, when t he ethylmercury was excret ed, the victims recovered from the neurological manifestations. Tr. at 3018. As is the case with methylmercury, most ethylmercury excretion thr ough the feces. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 647. B. Significant Studies of Mercury Toxicity. 1. Introduction.Petitioners' causation theories were bas ed on mercury's interactions with brain tissue. Petitioners' experts relied heavily on a series of adult monkey studies involving methylmercury and on an infant monkey study performed using both TCVs and methylmercury for their contention that i norganic mercury deposits in the brain are a cause of autism. Additionally, petitioners' experts also relied on murine and rat studies and in vitro studies of mercury's effects on cell lines. Respondent's experts discussed the same st udies, explaining why they were not relevant for the positions for which they were cited and why the conclusions petitioners drew from them were not supported by the studies. They emphasized the importance of examining the doses that caused the observ ed effects, in comparison to TCV doses and 349 A study of brain mercury levels in infants who died of natural causes within a few weeks of birth found that both maternal blood and maternal scalp hair correlated with infant brain levels of mercury. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 629. 134the levels of other common mercury expos ures. Additionally, Dr. Brent discussed several studies involving post-mortem human brain analyses and compared those results to those found in the adult monkey studies. When human data are unavailable, primat e studies are the closest to human studies in terms of mercury toxicokinetics. Doctor Aposhian testified that neonatal mice are also a good model for mercury's toxicokinetics in humans.350 Tr. at 186-87. 2. Adult Primate Studies. In the early to mid-1990s, a team of researchers from the University of Washington conducted a study of methylmerc ury toxicokinetics involving adult female monkeys. At least five papers were produc ed from this study, which reported on the metabolization of methylmercury and its subclin ical effects and disposition in the brain. Throughout the testimony, these studies were va riously referred to as the \"adult monkey studies,\" \"the adult primate studies,\" or by the name of one of t he two primary authors, Vahter or Charleston. The two Vahter studies 351 measured species of mercury in the blood and brain. The Charleston studies352 focused on mercury's effects at the cellular level in the brain. The study design for both sets of papers involved five test groups of monkeys and one control group. Four groups of m onkeys were given oral daily doses of 350 Doctor Aposhian testified that rat studi es may not be good models because rat hemoglobin binds more mercury, resulting in less mercury r eaching the brain than in humans, primates, or neonatal mice. Tr. at 188, Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 53 (citing Clarkson 1997 and 2002). A careful search of the scientificand medical exhibits filed did not disclose either of these references. One 2002 article by Clarkson was filed (T. Clarkson, The Three Modern Faces of Mercury , E NVTL. HEALTH PERSP . 110(1):11-23 (2002), filed as PML 182) but it did not stand for the proposition for which Dr. Aposhian cited it. There were no 1997 articles by Clarkson filed by either party. 351 See Vahter 1994, PML 60; Vahter, et al., Demethylation of Methyl Mercury in Different Brain Sites of Macaca fascicularis Monkeys during Long-Term Subclinical Methyl as PML 64. 352 J. Charleston, et al., Increases in the Number of Reactive Glia in the Visual Cortex of Charleston, et al., Autometallographic Determination of Inorganic Mercury Distribution in t he Cortex of the Calcarine Sulcus of the Monkey Macaca Charleston, et al., Changes in the Number of Astrocytes and Microglia in the Thalamus of Burbacher, whose infant primate study is discussedbelow, was the senior researcher on all five adult primate papers. 135methylmercury at 50 g/Kg of body weight.353 One group was dosed for six months, one for 12 months, and one for 18 months; after the conclusion of the mercury dosing,the monkeys were sacrificed. A fourth group (called the \"clearance group\") was dosed for 12 months, and then allowed six months without any mercury dosing as a clearance period before sacrifice. The fifth group of monkeys received continuous IV infusion of mercury chloride (a form of inorganic mercury) at 200 g mercury/Kg of body weight for three months. See, e.g. , Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 222. a. The Vahter Studies. In normal weight monkeys 354 exposed to methylmercury, the steady state of total mercury355 in the blood (1.1 g/g) was reached after about four months of daily doses. Tr. at 162. In contrast, in the control monkeys, the total blood mercury concentration was about 0.01 g/g. Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 224. The half-time in blood was 23 days, with variations between 13-30 days. Id. at 226. Not surprisingly, concentration of methyl mercury in the brain increased based on the length of exposure. The average concent ration of methylmercury in the occipital pole and thalamus was about 3 g/g at six months and 4.5 g/g at 12-18 months of exposure. Vahter 1994, PML 60, at abstract. The accumulation of inorganic mercury in the brain and conclusions regarding its source constituted the most significant findi ngs in the study. In the monkeys directly exposed to inorganic mercury, blood levels of 0.6 g/g of inorganic mercury produced inorganic mercury brain levels of about 0.1 g/g. Vahter 1994, PML 60, at abstract. However, exposure to methylmercury produc ed increasingly higher levels of inorganic mercury in the brain over time. Brain c oncentrations of methylmercury reached steady state at 12 months, but the level of i norganic mercury increased during the entire exposure period. Inorganic mercury constitut ed about 9% of total mercury in the brain 353 Doctor Brent called the 50 g/Kg dose very high. Tr. at 1932. In comparison to the average daily intake of methylmercury in humans (3.5 g per day in total, not per Kg of body weight, according to Toxicological Profile for Mercury , RML 6, at 10), his characterization was correct. The 50 g dose for the adult monkey studies was selected in order to examine mercury levels in body tissues that wereinsufficient to cause weight loss, renal toxici ty, or neurological problems, symptoms that had been observed in another study of long-term exposure of primates to daily doses of 70 g/Kg body weight. That study had also found focal damage to cortical r egions of the brain (including neuronal loss and increased and hypertrophic astroc ytes, and microgliosis). Vahter 1995, PML 64, at 282. The levels of exposure in the adult primate study were designed to examine methlymercury's effectson the brain in the absence of clinical symptoms. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 128. No clinical effectswere observed in any of the groups. Id. at 130. 354 Apparently, methylmercury does not mobilize to fat tissue. In heavier monkeys, a dose based on body weight resulted in higher blood total mercury levels (2.2 g/g) and higher brain total mercury levels (7-22 g/g) than those of normal weight monkeys. Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 225-26. 355 Total mercury levels include all species of mercury present. 136at 6-12 months, 18% at 18 months, and 74% at six months after termination of exposure. Mean Brain Inorganic Mercury Measurements356 (In g/g) 0.616Inorganic 0.106 (not provided) The elimination half-time of inorganic mercury was on the order of years. See Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 224; Tr. at 162. There was no correlation between inorganic mercury levels in the blood and in the brain. Blood inorganic mercury le vels reached a steady state at 0.08 g/g after four months of exposure, but brain levels of inorganic mercury increased over time to more than 30 times higher at six months of ex posure and more than 60 times higher at 18 months. Vahter 1995, PML 64, at 280. T he increasing amount of inorganic mercury indicated that organic mercury was demethyla ting in the brain. This conclusion was buttressed by the fact that the monkeys t hat received inorganic mercury had brain levels of inorganic mercury at 15-35% of the leve ls found in the monkeys who received only organic mercury, and by the findings in the clearance group that the amount of inorganic mercury continued to increase afer the me rcury dosing ended. Vahter 1995, PML 64, at 273. b. The Charleston Studies. The Charleston studies examined where the mercury collected in the brain and its effects on brain cells. The first two Charleston papers (PML 33 and PML 32) focusedon the cortex of the calcarine sulcus, a pr obable target for mercury because of elevated damage seen in this area after high levels of methylmercury exposure in adult humans 356 Data on the occipital pole measurements were taken from Charleston 1994, PML 33, Table 4; data on the thalamus measurements were taken from Charleston 1996, PML 116, Table 1. 137and prenatally exposed infants.357 Charleston 1994, PML 33, at 196; Tr. at 1964-65. These first two papers reported reactive glia358 in increased numbers in every treatment group, including those receiving inorganic mercury. Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 329. Because the inorganic merc ury group and the clearance group both had low levels of methylmercury and elevated leve ls of inorganic mercury, the authors concluded that inorganic mercury was responsible for the increase in reactive glia. Charleston 1994, PML 33, at 203. There were no significant changes in ce ll numbers of astrocytes or neurons. Charleston 1994, PML 33, at abstract. There was no degradation in the structure of the neurons, nor any of the chronic changes in glial cells commonly observed after highlevel mercury exposure. Char leston 1994, PML 33, at 198. The researchers found inorganic mercury depos its across all layers of the cortex in the methylmercury-exposed monkeys, wit h astrocytes and microglia accumulating high concentrations as compared to all other types of brain cells, and concentrations increasing with the length of mercury dosi ng. Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 326, 328-29. The authors attributed the mercury deposits in reactive glia to phagocytosis, which may have represented an effort to pr otect the neurons and other central nervous system cells. Charleston 1994, PML 33, at 203; s ee also Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 329, 331 (suggesting that microglia were accumulating the mercury as a protectivemechanism, particularly given that the number of glia increased over the course of the study). They could not determine what ty pe of cellular debris the activated microglia were phagocytizing. As none of the other cell types were decreased after mercuryexposure; the authors suggested that t hey might be dead astrocytes because dead astrocytes would be replaced. Charleston 1994, PML 33, at 203. Another possibility was that the reactive glia were collecti ng mercury from the extracellular fluid. Charleston 1994, PML 33, at 204. There was no observed increase in glial fiber acidic protein [\"GFAP\"] (Charleston 1994, PML 33, at 204), which suggests the lack of 357 Doctor Brent explained that the calcarine sulcus controls visual fields, and constriction of visual fields is a common effect of mercury intoxication. Tr. at 1964-65. 358 The study could not determine the precise type of reactive glia, but suggested that the increased reactive glia represented activated microglia rather than reactive microglia. Charleston 1994,PML 33, at 203. Microglia are phagocytes, and, once activated by the presence of a threat, mayaccumulate their mercury burden in the contex t of engulfing damaged or dead astrocytes containing mercury compounds or by removing mercury from the extracellular fluid. Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 331. The authors interpreted the increase in microglia to represent activated microglia, carrying out suchphagocytic functions as removal of dead astrocytes. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 134. 138gliosis.359 The authors theorized that when the am ount of mercury increased beyond the protective capacity of the astrocytes and mi croglia, mercury would begin to accumulate in the neurons. Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 331. The results were as predicted, but only in the 18-month exposure group. Neurons in the groups exposed to methylmercury for six and 12 months and the clearance group contained little mercury. As exposure time lengthened, neuronal mercury concentra tions increased. Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 326. The third Charleston paper focused on the thalamus. Mercury exposure caused no significant changes in the number of neurons or most other cell types, but there was a significant decline in astrocyte numbers in both the group exposed for six months and in the clearance group. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at abstract. The number of microglia increased in the 18-month exposur e group and in the clearance group. There were no chronic changes in the glial cells, su ch as hypertrophic astrocytes. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 130. As in the two studies looking at the calcarine sulcus, more inorganic mercury was found in astrocytes and microglia than in any other cell types. However, the Charleston 1996 study found a significant relationship between the concentration of inorganic mercury in the tissue and the changes in mi croglia. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 130, 135. The neurons and other cells had very limited deposits of inorganic mercury, particularly in the six-month, 12-month, and clearance groups. There were minor deposits of inorganic mercury found in the neurons of the 18-month exposure group. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 130-31. There was no gross damage to brain ti ssue nor any apparent degradation of neuronal structures. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 130. The histological staining of the neurons did not demonstrate any signific ant damage to them. The lack of neuronal damage was compatible with the lack of any clinically apparent neurologic symptoms. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 133. The proposed explanation for the decline in the number of astrocytes in the six- month exposure group, but not in the 12-and 18-month exposure groups, was that, over time, the astrocytes were proliferating in response to the mercury exposure. Because of the small sample size, it was also possi ble that the study had insufficient power to 359 GFAP stain reacts only with astroglial cells, and stains more readily during gliosis. It will not stain neurons or other types of glial cells. Tr. at 2879-80 . Several authors of the Vahter and Charleston studies commented on the lack of GFAP in the adult monkey studies as correlating with the lack of anincrease in the number of astrocytes. See N. Mottet, et al., Metabolism of Methylmercury in the Brain and PML 197. Doctors Vahter and Charleston were co-authors on this paper and Dr. Mottet was a co-author of theadult primate studies. 139detect a significant decline in the astrocytic population in the groups exposed for longer periods. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 133. Loss of astrocytes may impact on their ability to carry out supporting functions for neurons, and thus may affect central nervoussystem performance. However, there was no loss of neurons observed. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 134. The authors speculated that continued accu mulation of inorganic mercury in the thalamus might eventually lead to the loss of more astrocytes, which could affect the neuron population through an excitotoxic effec t. This long-term exposure effect might have a different mode of damage than that a ssociated with acute high level exposure. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 135. The author s suggested that the thalamus might be more at risk than the neocortex because the thalamus tends to accumulate moreinorganic mercury than other areas of the brain. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 136. The authors also noted that an increase in r eactive astrocytes is common after high- dose mercury exposure. They commented that an increased number of microglia could interfere with neuronal recovery after in jury. Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 134. c. Commentary on the Adult Primate Study. Doctor Aposhian testified about two primar y points drawn from the adult primate studies. First, inorganic mercury may be res ponsible for causing changes in astrocytes and activation of microglia. 360 Second, the loss of astrocytes and the increase in activated microglia might affect the func tionality and survivability of neurons in the thalamus after methylmercury exposure. Tr. at 202-03; Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slides 66-67. I note, however, that astrocyte levels show ed an absolute level of decline only in the thalamus. The decline in the calcarine su lcus in the six-month exposure group was not found in the longer exposure groups, suggesti ng that any destroyed astrocytes were being replaced. See Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 133. Doctor Brent agreed that inorganic merc ury was likely responsible for the changes in cellular structure found in the adul t primates. Tr. at 1888-89. However, he did not find the adult primate studies rele vant to the question of whether mercury exposure could cause autism. Tr. at 1890-91. His primary concern had to do with the dos es of mercury received by the adult 360 However, in their 2006 summary article, PML 35, Clarkson and Magos pointed out that the increase in reactive microglia in the occipital pole could not be correlated with brain levels of eitherinorganic mercury or methylmercury. Thus, they c oncluded that it was impossible to determine if the inorganic mercury was the cause or the consequence of the increased activity of the microglia because glial cells might be converting the organic mercury to inorganic mercury as a mode of defense. The 1996 Charleston paper, PML 116, did not report on any monkeys who receive inorganic mercury, but the 1994paper, PML 33, did. See PML 35 at 634 (recording that the highest increase in microglia was found in the monkeys who received inorganic mercury, and that this group had the lowest levels of inorganic mercuryand total mercury). 140monkeys, as compared to human exposure to mercury. Tr. at 1932. The monkeys received a dose of 50 g/Kg of body weight per day. A similar dose in an adult human weighing 70 kilograms, or approximately 155 pounds, would involve the administration of 3500 g of mercury per day. Based on an average human intake of methylmercury of 11,000 g annually, the adult monkeys received t he equivalent of the average human yearly exposure in three days. They continued to receive the same level of mercury forperiods of six, 12, or 18 months. Tr. at 1935-36. Doctor Brent noted the principle of dose-response, pointing out that at high enough doses of mercury or other substances, neurotoxicity would be expected. Tr. at 1938. A second point was the Charle ston 1996 thalamus study, PML 116, demonstrated astrocytic death, and thus a neur otoxic result, but the monkeys did not display any clinical signs of neurotoxicity. Tr. at 1932. This suggested that, even at these high levels of exposure, methyl mercury did not produce clinically-apparent neurotoxic effects. See Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 133. Further, he pointed out that if microg lial activation continued because of the presence of inorganic mercury, then nearly ev eryone would have increases in microglial activation over a lifetime as more mercur y is ingested and converted to persistent inorganic mercury in the brain. Tr. at 1968. Even at the levels of mercury used in the adult primate studies, no decline in astrocyt e numbers in the calcarine sulcus was noted. Tr. at 1964-65. Finally, two of the three papers reported findings from the calcarine sulcus, where mercury is known to accumulate. One of the common effects of mercuryintoxication is a constriction of visual fields , which are controlled by the calcarine sulcus, but such constriction is not found in ASD. Tr. at 1964-65. Doctor Brent testified that the cellular findings in the calcarine sulcus s upported his conclusion that the adult monkey studies were unrelated to toxic effects of merc ury as a cause of autism, but were related to known effects of mercury in the brain. Tr. at 1890-91. 3. Infant Primate Study.The Burbacher infant primate study, PML 26, was a logical follow-on to the adult primate study. Although there were some sim ilarities in the two study designs, there were also significant differences that affe ct the conclusions that the expert witnesses drew from this study. Because this is a pr imate study measuring mercury levels in the brain after doses of the two species of me rcury to which human infants are exposed, it provides the most data available about what may happen in human brains after TCV and other mercury exposure. a. Study Design. The Burbacher study involved the same type of monkey, Macaca fascicularis, involved in the adult primate studies. Fo rty-one infant monkeys were divided among 141three exposure groups at birth. Burbacher , PML 26, at 1016. One group was given vaccines typically administered to human infants, with doses of 20 g/Kg of ethylmercury (in thimerosal) through injections361 at zero, seven, 14, and 21 days of age, for a total of 80 g/Kg. A second group received 20 g/Kg of methylmercury orally at the same ages.362 Id. A third group of monkeys served as controls and did not receive any mercury.363 Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016. Unlike the adult monkey study, the infant monkey study was much more limited in the dose schedule (periodic versus daily dos es), the type of examinations conducted (blood and brain mercury levels, similar to t he Vahter studies rat her than the Charleston cellular studies),364 and the time frame over which the doses were received (a few weeks versus up to 18 months). The time frame allowed for \"clearance\" (the time between the final dose of mercury on Day 21 and the date of sacrifice) also differed substantially. As Dr. Brent testified, the purpose of the Burbacher study was to do a pharmacokinetic analysis of what happens when mercury is administered to infantprimates, rather than looking at any effect of TCVs on the brain. Tr. at 1807, 1859. Although the Burbacher paper indi cated that the dose levels were chosen \"based on the range of estimated doses received by human in fants receiving vaccines during the first 6 months of life\" (PML 26 at 1016), the study did not mirror human infant dosing. 365 361 The injections contained the same vaccines received at comparable life stages by human infants, but the thimerosal levels were altered by mixing thimerosal with thimerosal-free vaccines to achieve the 20 g/Kg body weight dose. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016. 362 The different methods of administration were chosen based on how humans are exposed to the two types of mercury (ethylmercury through TCVs by injection and methylmercury through diet). Tr. at 1816. 363 The study reported weight gain for the control infants (PML 26 at 1017), but did not contain any data on mercury levels in the blood or brain tissue of the control group monkeys. This raises an issue about one of Dr. Brent's assumptions in his supplemental report, that of a \"baseline\" mercury level. Res.Ex. EE at 5. This issue is discussed more fully in Section VI.C., below. 364 During the general causation hearing, petitioners' counsel suggested that cellular level studies of the brains of these infant monkeys, similar to those conducted on the adult primates detailed in the Charleston papers, were pending. See Tr. at 38. The Burbacher paper indicated that half brain samples were studied, but did not indicate what was done with the other half. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016. As ofthe date the evidentiary record in this case was closed, no such study was filed, nor have there been anyrequests to reopen the record to file one. 365 Human infants would have received one dose of a TCV (hepatitis B vaccine) administered at birth or shortly thereafter, followed by a second dose of TCVs (hepatitis B; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus [\"DTP\"]; and Haemophilus influenzae type b [\"Hib\"] vaccines) at two months; a third dose of TCVs(DTP and Hib) at four months, and a fourth dose of TCVs at six months (DTP, hepatitis B, and Hib). See CDC Childhood Immunization Schedules. The infant monkeys received one dose of hepatitis B at birth,followed by hepatitis B, DTP, and Hib at seven days, another dose of DTP and Hib at 14 days, and a 142The amounts of mercury received differed, and the time frame between vaccinations was shorter. Based on half-time of ethy lmercury in both monkeys and human infants, human infants would generally clear the ethy lmercury from their bloodstream by the time of the next dose. In the infant monkeys, the compressed dosing schedule (designed to coincide with human development al stages at vaccine administration), meant less clearance time and some accumulati on of mercury in the blood, although the amount accumulated was less than that of t he methylmercury-exposed infant monkeys. Tr. at 1807-08, 1817. The total dose per kilogram of body wei ght received by the infant monkeys was significantly less than that received by the adult monkeys. Over the period in which mercury was administered (birth to 21 days of age), the infant monkeys received a total of 80 g/Kg of either ethylmercury or methylmercury. See Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016. In contrast, the adult monkeys received 1050 g/Kg of methylmercury over the same period (50 g/Kg/day x 21 days = 1050 g/Kg). See Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 222. Blood was drawn prior to any mercury exposure, and drawn again at two, four and seven days after the initial and subsequent exposures. The monkeys weresacrificed between two and 28 days after the final mercury exposure, with blood drawn before sacrifice. 366 Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016. A fter sacrifice, brain mercury levels were measured. Id. at 1016-17. There was little disagreement between the parties' experts about what the Burbacher study found. However, there was a great deal of disagreement about what the study meant. b. Study Findings. There were no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups, suggesting that there were no clinical e ffects from the mercury administration. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1017-18. This was also true at the much higher levels of exposure in the adult primate study. Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 223. (1) Methylmercury-Dosed Monkeys. In the methylmercury-exposed infant monk eys, the highest blood levels of total mercury were recorded two days after adminis tration of the fourth dose. There was fourth dose (DTP, hepatitis B, and Hib) at 21 days. See Burbacher, PML 26, at Table 1; Tr. at 1808. 366 The study referred to the period between final mercury exposure and sacrifice as the \"washout\" period. In the adult monkey papers, the \"clearance group\" performed a similar function, albeit over a longer period. 143progressive accumulation of mercury in the blood, rising from between 8-18 ng/mL367 two days after the first dose to between 30-46 ng/mL two days after the fourth dose. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1018. The half-time of mercury in the blood was about 21 days, which is consistent with the blood half-time of the adult monkeys in the Vahter study. Id. The authors found no differences in methylme rcury's systemic distribution kinetics between adult and infant monkeys. Id. In the methylmercury-exposed monkeys, brain levels of total mercury were between 1.7 to 3 times higher than the levels in the blood. The half-time of total mercury in the brain was about 60 days, which was longer than that of the adult monkeys (37 days) in the Vahter studies. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1018. The highest levels of total mercury in the brain were over 100 ng/g,368 observed at about four days after the last dose. See Burbacher, PML 26, at 1018, Figure 3. Most of this was organic mercury; only about 6-10% was inorganic mercury. In half of themethylmercury-dosed monkeys sacrificed, t he concentration of inorganic mercury was below the detection threshold of the test used to measure it. These figures were consistent with t he adult monkey measurements at the same points reported by Vahter. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1018-19. The Vahter studies indicated that the ultimate disposition of the methylmercury left in the infant brains would involve conversion of substantial amounts to inorganic mercury. In the Vahter studies, the metabolization of methylmercury to i norganic mercury in the brain continued long after the last dose was administered, wit h 9% inorganic mercury at six months of exposure, an amount that climbed to 74% inorganic mercury six months after termination of exposure. Vahter 1994, PML 60, at abstract. A similar conversion would have occurred with the methylmercury in the infant monkey brains if there had been a longer period before sacrifice. See Tr. at 1815, 1873-75, 1911; Res. Ex. EE, at 3. (2) Thimerosal-Dosed Monkeys. Thimerosal-dosed monkeys had blood levels of total mercury of 6-14 ng/mL two days after the initial exposure, levels which were similar to blood levels in premature infants receiving 12.5 g of ethylmercury from thei r initial hepatitis B vaccine. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1019 (citing Stajich 369). Blood concentrations of mercury in the 367 Note that mercury was administered in micrograms ( g), but the body measurement levels were in nanograms (ng), a measurement level 1000 times smaller than micrograms. Burbacher, PML 26,at 1016, 1019. 368 There was no statistical difference between the brain level of methylmercury in the monkeys sacrificed on the first day and that of those sacrificed 28 days later. This indicated that the methylmercury was not being eliminated; it was being slowly converted to inorganic mercury. Tr. at 1912. 369 G. Stajich, et al., Iatrogenic exposure to mercury after hepatitis B vaccination in preterm infants , PEDIATRICS 136(5): 679-81 (2000) [\"Stajich\"], filed as PML 249. This comparison required converting the 7.36 g/L mean mercury level for preterm infants in the Stajich study to the ng/mL level 144thimerosal group declined rapidly between doses with minimal accumulation in the blood, unlike the methylmercury-dosed infant m onkeys. Half-times in the blood followed a biphasic model of an initial half-time of 2. 1 days, and a terminal half-time of 8.6 days. Id. Blood clearance rates were about 5.4 ti mes higher for ethylmercury than for methylmercury. Id. The half-time for total mercury in the br ain was 24.2 days, significantly shorter than the brain half-time for the methylme rcury-dosed monkeys. There was also a significant decrease in the organic mercury in the brain over the washout period, a half- time of about 14.2 days. However, there wa s more inorganic mercury in the brains of the thimerosal-exposed monkeys. Between 21% and 86% of the brain mercury in the thimerosal-exposed monkeys was inorganic, at levels of about 16 ng/mL (the equivalent of 0.016 g/mL). Burbacher, PML 26, at 1019. Twenty-eight days after the last administrat ion of mercury, the level of organic mercury remaining in the brain was more than ten times higher in the methylmercury- dosed monkeys. However, the level of inor ganic mercury was about three to four times higher in the thimerosal-dosed monkeys. Compare Figure 7 (thimerosal-dosed) with Figure 4 (methylmercury-dosed). Burbacher, PML 26, at 1018-19. Levels of both types of mercury were very low; the graphs at the two figures represent amounts in nanograms, or parts per billion. Id.; Tr. at 1813. In analyzing and summarizing their result s, the authors noted that mercury is cleared from the body faster after the adm inistration of thimerosal than after administration of methylmercury. Peak bl ood concentrations in the monkeys receiving methylmercury were nearly three times higher than those who received thimerosal. The brain concentration of total mercury was thr ee to four times lower in the thimerosal- exposed monkeys than in the methylmercury- exposed monkeys, and the half-time for total mercury in the brain was much shorter (24 days vs. 60 days) in the thimerosal-exposed infant monkeys. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1020. However, they also concluded that appl ying the methylmercury brain-to-blood ratio would not accurately predict brain le vels in thimerosal exposure. Inorganic mercury levels in the brain (and the kidney ) were twice as high in the thimerosal- exposed monkeys, at least over the per iod in which brain concentrations were measured. The authors noted that in t he adult monkeys exposed to methylmercury, inorganic mercury levels continued to rise as methylmercury levels declined and cleared. Burbacher, PML 26, 1020. Thus, as Dr. Brent testified, the ultimate amount of inorganic mercury in the brains of t he methylmercury-dosed monkeys would have increased over time. See Tr. at 1911-12. used in the Burbacher study. A 7.36 g/L level converts to 7.36 ng/mL, which was then compared to the 6-16 ng/mL level found in the infant monkeys. 145c. Commentary on the Burbacher Study. In their initial expert reports, their hearing testimony, and their supplemental reports filed after the Theory 2 hearings c oncluded, Drs. Aposhian and Brent disagreed on several points. On the whole, I find Dr. Brent's interpretations of the study to be more reliable and correctly reflective of the study's findings than those of Dr. Aposhian, who sometimes misstated them.370 Two significant areas of disagreement emerged: (1) whether the doses of ethylmercury via thim erosal in the Burbacher study were the equivalent of doses a human infant might rece ive through the first six months of TCVs; and (2) how much inorganic mercury in the brain would ultimately be produced by the administration of four 20 g/Kg doses of ethylmercury versus how much would be produced from the same doses of methylmercury. In answering these questions, bothDrs. Aposhian and Brent made reference not onl y to the Burbacher findings, but also to the Vahter and Charleston adult primate st udies and other studies discussed below. Because the resolution of the second issue (how much inorganic mercury in the brain would be produced from TCVs versus that of dietary and other exposures to methylmercury) depends on studies in addition to the adult and infant primate studies, I defer discussing the second issue until I discuss the additional studies. 371 Regarding differences in the dose levels of ethylmercury received by Burbacher's infant monkeys versus the dose received by human infants in early vaccinations, Dr. Brent's assertions were correct. His test imony that the higher amounts given to the infant monkeys were necessary to ensure t hat mercury levels would not be below the 370 See, e.g., Dr. Aposhian's testimony that more methylmercury than ethylmercury is excreted from the brain and that methylmercury is \"removed mo re rapidly from the brain, so that the amount of mercuric mercury formed from a given dose of methyl mercury is less than, the percentage is less than the conversion of ethyl mercury to mercuric.\" Tr. at 398. He also stated that \"methyl mercury is removed from the brain faster than ethyl mercury is removed from the brain,\" again citing to the Burbacher study, PML 26. Tr. at 398. However, that study actually found that three to four times more total brain mercury wasproduced from the same dose of methylmercury as from ethylmercury in thimerosal, and that total mercurywas cleared from the brain more rapidly after ethylm ercury exposure than after methylmercury exposure. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1020. Inorganic mercury levels were higher after ethylmercury exposure during thetime frame of the study, but Burbacher noted t hat the Vahter and Charleston adult monkey studies indicated that demethylation of the methylmercury continued for months after exposure ended. In the Burbacher study, the infant monkeys were sacrif iced between two and 28 days after their last exposure, too short a time for the inorganic mercury from me thylmercury exposure to peak. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016, 1020. Part of Dr. Aposhian's supplemental repor t involved calculations indicating why he believed that methylmercury would ultimately produce less i norganic mercury than similar doses of ethylmercury. See Pet. Ex. 21 at 3. Based on Dr. Brent's supplemental report and my own careful reading of the infant and adult monkey studies, I am convinced that Dr. A poshian's calculations of the amount of inorganic mercury that would ultimately have been produced were incorrect. See Res. Ex. EE at 1-3. 371 Both supplemental expert reports (Supplem ental Report of Dr. Aposhian, Pet. Ex. 21; Supplemental Report of Dr. Brent, Res. Ex. EE) contai n a series of calculations based on assumptions or conclusions drawn from the adult monkey studies, t he Burbacher studies, and several other studies. The calculations are complex, and criticisms of both sets of calculations cannot be readily understood without reference to the studies discussed below , particularly the human autopsy studies. 146detection limits ( see Tr. at 1808-09) was buttressed by the remarks of Dr. Polly Sager at the February 9, 2004 meeting of the Imm unization Safety Review Committee, RML 436.372 Doctors Brent and Aposhian were in agr eement that human infants who received TCVs according to the infant vaccination schedule would have received 187.5 g of ethylmercury by six months of age.373 See Pet. Ex. 21 at 11-12 (Dr. Aposhian's supplemental report) and Tr. at 1862 (testimony of Dr. Brent). In comparison, the infant monkeys received a total of 80 g/Kg (four injections x 20 g/Kg ethylmercury per injection), a fact that does not seem reasonably in dispute. See Burbacher, PML 26, at 1016. However, there is an im portant distinction between t hese two amounts. The first amount (187.5 g) represents a total amount (wit hout regard to infant weight) administered over a period of six months; the second figure represents an amount per kilogram of body weight adminis tered over a period of 21 days . A direct comparison between the two fi gures cannot be made without converting the 187.5 g figure into a dose per kilogram am ount. Doctor Brent performed a quick calculation at the hearing based on a body weight of a six-month-old child of roughly 8 kilograms, testifying that this would re sult in a typical infant receiving a 24 g/Kg exposure (calculated by dividing 187.5 g by 8 kilograms). Therefore, Dr. Brent concluded that the 24 g/Kg figure is less than 1/3 of the dose received by the infant monkeys in the Burbacher study.374 Even with extremely sma ll infants, exposure would 372 P. Sager, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Thimerosal Exposure from Vaccines and Ethylmercury Accumulation in Non-human Primates (Feb 9, 2004), filed as RML 436. Although this information does not appear in the Burbacher paper, Dr. Brent identified his source for thedata as an oral presentation from the preliminary data from the Burbacher study to the IOM in 2004. Tr. at1809. An audio version of this oral presentation was filed as RML 436; Dr. Brent read a portion of thepresentation into the record. The Burbacher study was submitted for publication in 2004, but not accepteduntil April, 2005, and not published until August, 2005. PML 26 at 1015. The preliminary data from theBurbacher study was furnished to the IOM for its report on TCVs and autism in 2004. See IOM 2004 Report, RML 255, at 135; Tr. at 1809. 373 The focus on six months of age reflects t he evidence that the brain changes in autistic individuals occur prenatally or, as petitioners asserted, in the first few months after birth. Thus, the TCV exposure by six months of age was the focus of mo st of the evidence, even though thimerosal exposure continued in vaccines administered later in infancy. 374 This impromptu calculation underestimated the mercury per kilogram received by the human infants because some of the TCVs would have been admin istered in early infancy, when the infants would have weighed three to four kilograms rather than eight. I do not think this was a deliberateunderestimation because the calculations were perform ed \"on the spot\" in response to questions during his testimony. Using Dr. Aposhian's table of mercury content per vaccine and timing for vaccine administration (see Pet. Ex. 21 at 4) and using the median infant weights rounded off to the lowest whole number ( see Pet. Ex. 1, p. 81 (Colin Dwyer's weight chart from his pediatric records)), at the time vaccines are normallyrecommended, I have refined Dr. Brent's rough calculati ons. Assuming an average infant weight of three 147not approach the 80 g/kilogram level administered to t he infant monkeys. Tr. at 1862- 63, 1966-67. An additional factor that bears mention is the time frame over which the divided doses were administered. In order to simula te the effects on infant brains at similar levels of development, the infant monkeys were dosed on a more compressed schedulethan that of human infants. They received f our doses over 21 days, rather than over a period of six months. The Burbacher study noted that the compressed dosing schedule for the monkeys meant that there would not be complete clearance of one dose of thimerosal from the blood before the next dose was administered. This would result in higher peak blood levels of ethylmercury in the infant monkeys than in infant humans, even if the doses of ethylmercury received were the same. The primary significance of the Burbac her study is the amount of inorganic mercury produced in the brains of the in fant monkeys from the doses of organic mercury received compared to inorganic merc ury levels in the brains of the adult primates, and the conclusions the parties dr ew therefrom. Those conclusions are discussed below, after consideration of t he rat and murine studies and some human autopsy data. kilograms at birth, four kilograms at one month, five kilograms at two months, six kilograms at four months, and eight kilograms at six months of age, I roughl y calculated that human infants would have received about 33 g/Kg (compared to Dr. Brent's calculation of 24 g/Kg). This is about 2.5 times less than the 80 g/Kg dose the infant monkeys received. The calculations Dr. Brent performed were based on the aggregate of mercury in vaccines, divided by the infant's weight at six months. My calculations were similarly performed, but were based on median infant weight and mercury content at the time the TCVs would have been received. Cf. Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States , No. 2008-5092, 2010 WL 569733, at * 13-15 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 19, 2010) (affirming the trial court's recalculation of damages based onits construction of an alternative harvest ing schedule not proposed by either party). 1484. Rat and Murine Studies. Two rat375 and two mouse376 studies discussed during the testimony were not particularly informative on the issue of organic and inorganic mercury's effects on the brains of human infants. In general, t he studies used extraordinarily high doses of mercury and methods of administration unr elated to human exposure. One of the Magos 1985 article's more relevant findings was ignored by Dr. Aposhian in his direct testimony and in his slides. Magos noted: In spite of the higher inorganic me rcury concentration in the brain of ethylmercury- than in the brain of methylmercury-treated rats, the granular layer damage in the cerebellum was widespread only in themethylmercury-treated rats. Thus inorganic mercury or dealkylation cannot be responsible for granular layer damage in alkylmercury intoxication . Moreover, histochemistry demonstrated no inorganic mercury deposits in the granular layer. Magos 1985, PML 175, at 260 (emphasis added). 5. Human Exposure Studies. a. Accidental Poisoning Data. The primary studies of mercury's effe cts in accidental poisoning involved 375 Magos 1985, PML 175; P. Gallagher, et al., Identity of Ultrastructural Effects of Mercuric Chloride and PML 588. The Gallagher study involved direct inject ion of very high doses of either mercury chloride (inorganic mercury) or methylmercury into the brains of living rats, resulting in neuronal necrosis. Tr. at 205-06. Enough mercury was injected directly into the br ain to produce clinically observable effects in the first six hours after injection and death in some rats within 24 hours. Gallagher, PML 588, at 262-63. Thus, the results of this experiment are not informative of human exposure, where organic mercury ismetabolized to inorganic mercury within brain cells or extracellular fluid. 376 Harry, PML 296; G. Zareba, et al., Thimerosal distribution and metabolism in neonatal mice: comparison with methyl mercury , J. APPL. TOXICOL .(electronic publication with no further citation provided) (2007) [\"Zareba\"], filed as PML 557. The Harry study, PML 296, measured the tissue distribution of anumber of mercury compounds administered to neonatal mice. Both ethylmercury and thimerosalproduced significantly less mercury in the brain than methylmercury. Harry, PML 296, at 187-88. This study demonstrated that methylmercury produced the highes t brain levels of mercury, but some mercury from all sources reached the brain. Tr. at 1806-07. Brain levels were less than one percent of the totalmercury administered. Tr. at 1881. The Zareba study involved the administration of thimerosal ormethylmercury to neonatal mice by injection. Be cause methylmercury is not injected in humans, the toxicokinetic findings from this study regarding methylmercury cannot be readily extrapolated to human exposure. Nevertheless, the Zareba study also f ound that brain levels of inorganic mercury were about the same for both the thimerosal and the methylmercury-exposed groups. Tr. at 192-93; Zareba, PML557, at 4-5. 149ingestion of food products contaminated with high levels of methylmercury.377 In the Minamata Bay disaster in Japan, childr en exposed prenatally to high levels of methylmercury developed a condition similar to cerebral palsy. Harada, RML 226, at (2000), RML In autopsies of infants exposed prenatally to me thylmercury who died shortly after birth, extensive disruption of the cellular structur e of the brain was observed, with effects in the entire brain. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 635. In the Iraq disaster, similar effects were observed, and the infants prenatally exposed had higher concentrations of methylmercury in their bl ood than did their mothers. Bakir, PML 178, at 239. The studies of the Minamata and Ir aqi disasters did not address speciation of mercury in the brain or the cellular level e ffects of prenatal or early infancy exposure to low levels of methylmercury. Postnatal exposure showed a different pa ttern of brain damage. In autopsies of postnatal victims from the Minamata Bay di saster, lesions were observed in both the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex. Harada, RML 226, at 18-19. In an autopsy performed on a mercury poisoning victim w ho worked at a fungicide plant, the damage was restricted to specific areas of the br ain: the granule cell layer of the neocerebellum, responsible for the ataxia observed in vict ims, and cortical atr ophy around the calcarine fissures, responsible for the constriction of visual fields. Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 631. The Zhang study, PML 232, of accidental ethylmercury poisoning in China involved oral ingestion of ethylmercury -contaminated rice, and did not focus on any prenatal or early infancy exposures. b. Lifestyle Studies. Three series of studies involving popul ations with high consumption of food containing methylmercury were filed: the Faroe Islands M. Harada, Minamata Disease: Methylmercury Poisoning in 178. 378 See P. Grandjean, et al., Cognitive Deficit in 7 Year-Old Children with Prenatal Exposure al., Methylmercury Exposure Biomarkers as Indicators of Neurotoxicity in Children Aged 7 Years AM. J. and the New Zealand studies.380 In terms of the adverse effects observed, the Faroe Islands study found very subtle, subclinical deficits in memory and language in children who were otherwise normal.381 The deficits were associated with higher maternal consumption of whale meat and blubber. See Meyers, PML 241, at 1691. The Seychelles Islands studies did not find similar effects from high fishconsumption. 382 E.g., Meyers, PML 241, at 1692; Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 642. The New Zealand study also f ound subtle effects associated with higher maternal hair levels, but confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and ethnic background produced similar results. See Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 637, 643. Doctor Rutter commented on the Seychelles Islands, Faroe Islands, and New Zealand studies, testifying that there is \"s ome suggestive evidence that there may be slight cognitive sequelae with these interm ediate levels\" and that most commentators agreed with him. Tr. at 3295-96. However, none of the studies identified autism as one of the sequelae. Tr. at 3296. Because these studies involved methylmercury ingestion by mothers during pregnancy, and there is insufficient information to establish a correlation withethylmercury's effects, these studies are not informative of any effects of postnatal administration of TCVs. However, bec ause exposure occurred during pregnancy, when the fetal brain is even more vulnerable than t he postnatal brain, they suggest that low level methylmercury exposure during that par ticularly vulnerable period does not cause ASD. 379 See G. Myers, et al., Prenatal methylmercury exposure from ocean fish consumption in the Seychelles child development study , LANCET 361: 1686-92 (2003) [\"Meyers\"], filed as PML 241; P.

Kjellstr\u00f6m, et al., Physical and Mental Development of Children with Prenatal Exposure to Mercury from Fish Stage 1: Preliminary Tests at Age 4, NATIONAL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BOARD REPORT 3080 (1986), filed as PML 214; T. Kjellstr\u00f6m, et al., Physical and Mental Development of Children with Prenatal Exposure to Mercury from Fish Stage 2: Interviews and Psychological Tests at Age6, N ATIONAL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BOARD REPORT 3642 (1989), filed as PML 215 [together \"New Zealand\"]. 381 The Grandjean 1999 study, PML 180, examined which biomarkers of mercury were associated with these subtle deficiencies. Cord blood mercury was the best predictor, suggesting that it is a prenatal effect of high maternal methylmercury exposure that produces the subtle differences found. See PML 180 at 303. 382 The whale meat and blubber consumed by t he Faroe Islanders contained higher levels of mercury than the fish meals consumed in the Seychelle s, but the Seychellois ate seafood more often than the Faroe Islanders ate whale products. One suggestion for the different results from the two studies is that micronutrients present in the fish offset any effects of mercury. Meyers, PML 241, at 1691. 151c. Autopsy Studies. (1) Adult Brains. A study of mercury accumulation in human brains, based on autopsy findings in individuals from Denmark and Greenland, was published in 1999.383 The autopsies of 17 Greenlanders showed large individual variati ons in total brain mercury levels, with mean individual concentrations ranging from 59 g/Kg to 4782 g/Kg.384 Pedersen, PML 603, at 100. The authors a ttributed the high variation to differences in lifestyle, noting that some Greenlanders eat traditional Arctic food (marine mammals) high in methylmercury, while others eat imported food. The two individuals with the highest concentrations of mercury were both hunters. Pedersen, PML 603, at 101,104-05. In spite of their high brain levels of mercur y, there were no signs of methylmercury poisoning. Pedersen, PML 603, at 106-07. There was a high correlation between the age of the individual at death and the concentration of mercury in the brain, i ndicating continued accumulation of mercury in the brain over a lifetime. The highest concent rations of total mercury were found in the cerebellum, with a median concentration of 492 g/Kg. Pedersen, PML 603, at 100. Speciation of the mercury disclosed that between 1-60% was organic, with a median organic mercury level of 32%. Pedersen, PML 603, at 102. In contrast, the Danes autopsied showed total mercury ranging from 1.2 to 11.8 g/Kg, with very small variations among the 12 brains studied. There was no correlation of mercury levels with age. Pedersen, PML 603, at 100-01. Autometallography studies were perform ed showing that the inorganic mercury was primarily located in glial cells. Inorgani c mercury was found in neurons only in the two Greenlanders who had the highest total mercury levels. Pedersen, PML 603, at103. In the adult monkey studies, a simila r effect was found, with mercury primarily found in astrocytes and microglia, and in neur ons only in those exposed to the highest total mercury levels. Pedersen, PML 603, at 106; Charleston 1996, PML 116, at 130- 31. 383 M. Pedersen, et al., Mercury Accumulations in Brains from Populations Exposed to High and Low Dietary Levels of Methyl Mercury: Concentration, chemical form and distribution of mercury in brain samples from autopsies , INT'L J. CIRCUMPOLAR PML 603. 384 By way of comparison, the mean adult monkey brain total mercury levels in the Charleston studies varied from 3282 g/Kg in the six-month exposure group to 4839 g/Kg in the 18-month exposure group. These figures are taken from the occipital pole, which had lower levels of total mercury than thethalamus. Charleston 1994, PML 33, at Table 4. The data in the table were converted from g/g to g/Kg by multiplying by 1000 (there are 1000 grams per kilogram). Of note, the Charleston figures represent amean calculated from the same site in several brains; the reported figures in the Pedersen study aremeans calculated from samples throughout an individual's brain. 152(2) Infant Brains. Doctor Brent discussed one of the most si gnificant studies filed, one involving the effects of normal and high maternal di etary methlymercury on infant brains.385 Thirty-two neonatal brains from Seychelles Islands infants were preserved on autopsy and analyzed. The findings were compared to those of 12 infants from the Rochester, NY, area who had died from causes not di rectly affecting the nervous system. Reference samples from infants who had died in the Iraqi grain disaster also provided comparisons. Lapham, RML 294, at abstract. There were no abnormalities in cerebral or cerebellar cortical organization and the neurons appeared normal in the Seychellois inf ants. In 22 of the 32 brains, variable numbers of reactive astrocytes were found in the cerebral white matter, and, in 24 of the brains, there were increased numbers of reacti ve microglia in cerebral white matter. Lapham, RML 294, at 691. The Rochester brains, which contained much less mercury,had similar findings. Lapham, RML 294, at 692. Total mercury levels in the Seychelles brains demonstrated variability among the brains and within different regions of the sa me brains. The mercury values were well above those of the Rochester brains, with values in the Seychelles brains generally between 50-250 ppb (nanograms per gram) and t he Rochester brains generally less than 50 ppb. 386 Lapham, RML 294, at 694. The highest brain mercury concentrations were found in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, and medulla. Lapham, RML 294, at 696. There was no correlation between mercury levels and the degree or type of histological changes (the reactive microglia and astrocytes) observed. Lapham, RML 294, at 697. A comparison of the gross anatomy of the Seychelles brains to reference samples from the Iraqi grain disast er did not disclose similarities.387 The Iraq brains also showed \"exuberant reactive gliosis in t he white matter as evidenced by numerous plump astrocytes,\" demonstrating a scarring response to injury, likely caused by the 385 L. Lapham, et al., An Analysis of Autopsy Brain Tissue From Infants Prenatally Exposed RML 294. 386 One Rochester brain contained total mercury levels similar to those in the Seychelles brains. Lapham, RML 294, at 696. 387 The Iraqi infants' brains exhibited a simplified gyral pattern, with fewer and shallower sulci, a short frontal lobe, and reduced volume of white matter. The Iraqi infants' brains demonstratedderangement in the laminar pattern of the cerebral cortex, including disorganization and a lack of definitionin the normal layers, with disorientation of cortical neurons and abnormal location of neurons in thecerebrum and cerebellum. The changes in the Iraqi infants' brains were indicative of disordered prenataldevelopment in the second and third month of gesta tion involving faulty neuronal migration. Lapham, RML 294, at 697-98. This disordered development is a fundamental characteristic of methylmercury exposure in the prenatal period. Lapham, RML 294, at 699. 153methylmercury exposure. Lapham, RML 294, at 699. Evidence of a low-grade destructive process in the form of variabl e numbers of reactive plump astrocytes and increased microglia in the white matter was found in the Seychelles brains. However,this could not be correlated to mercury cont ent, unlike in the Iraqi infants' brains. Lapham, RML 294, at 699. In comparison of mercury levels det ected in other studies of humans and animals, the authors noted that toxic effects of mercury have been shown in brain levels above 1,000 ppb. In the Seychelles brains, the highest levels were all under 300 ppb. In the Rochester reference brains (and in reports from Germany), the levels were under 50 ppb. The highest level in one of the Iraqi brains was 13,700 ppb. Lapham, RML 294, at 700. The study measured both inor ganic and total mercury levels, but did not report the inorganic mercury levels separately. See id . at 691, 694, 700. d. TCV Studies. Although there were no autopsy studies involving human brains and high ethylmercury exposure, several studies ex amined the effect of TCVs on blood mercury levels. (1) The Pichichero Studies. The two Pichichero studies 388 examined the metabolism of TCVs in human infants. The 2002 study measured concentrati ons of mercury in blood, urine, and feces of 40 full-term infants up to six months of age who received TCVs, as compared to 21 control infants who received mercury-free vaccines.389 Most of the thimerosal eliminated was through feces. Pichichero 2002, PML 223, at abstract. Mercury was undetectable in the urine samples from most of the infants studied. Id. at 1739. The authors noted that none of the infants had levels of mercury that exceeded those at which neurological effects had been observed.390 Pichichero 2002, PML 223, at 1740. Doctor Aposhian noted that the blood mercury samples had a broad range, with an almost ten-fold variation between the lowest level and the highest. Tr. at 178. Since the study did not measure baseline leve ls, it is impossible to determine whether 388 Pichichero 2002, PML 223. A subsequent study with Pichichero as the lead author was filed as PML 497 and as RML 379: M. Pichichero, et al., Mercury Levels in Newborns and Infants After Receipt of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines , PEDIATRICS 121(2): e208-14 (2008) [\"Pichichero 2008\"]. 389 Doctor Aposhian criticized the small sample size in the Pichichero 2002 study, noting that, based on the incidence of ASD, it was unlikely any of the children studied had an ASD. See Tr. at 177-78, 182, 185. 390 This may have been a reference to the Far oe Islands studies, which are commonly cited as evidence of the lowest level of observed effects, but the filed copy of the article does not contain the endnotes indicating which studies were referenced. 154this variation was based on the vaccines (or response to vaccines) or based on higher prenatal exposure. The Pichichero 2008 study involved a larger sample of 216 TCV-exposed infants in three age cohorts: newborns, two-month- olds, and six-month-olds from Argentina, where TCVs were still used. Newborns re ceived vaccines which contained either 12.5 g or 32.5 g of ethylmercury. The newborns all had cord blood samples taken before vaccination, and were randomly assigned to have samples of blood, urine, and fecestaken at various intervals after vaccinati on. The two-month-olds received vaccines containing 37.5-57.5 g of ethylmercury for a cumulative dose of 50-90 g. The six- month-olds received vaccines containing 37.5-57.5 g of ethylmercury for a cumulative dose of 112.5-162.5 g of ethylmercury. Both older groups had blood, urine, and feces samples collected before and after vaccinat ions, with infants randomly assigned to collection intervals similar to those of the newborns. Pichichero 2008, PML 497, at e209. Not surprisingly, the highest mercury c oncentrations were found in the blood shortly after vaccination: at 12 hours in the newborn group and at 24 hours in the two- and six-month groups. The highest detect ed level was 8.0 ng/mL in a newborn 12 hours after vaccination. Pichichero 2008, PM L 497, at e210-11. Inorganic mercury was found in all stool samples, but very little me rcury was detected in urine. Pre-vaccination blood samples found levels of mercury r anging from 0.3-5.0 ng/mL, with one newborn testing at 2.6 ng/mL before vaccination. The mercury in 23 post-vaccination blood samples was speciated, with methylmercury levels ranging from 1-50% of the total organic mercury detected. Because the vaccines were also tested for the type ofmercury, with only ethylmercury detected, t he presence of methylmercury in the blood samples indicated that mercury from source s other than thimerosal contributed to the total amount of mercury found. Pichichero 2008, PML 497, at e211. Pre-vaccination levels of blood mercury were about the same in six-month olds and two-month olds, indicating that TCVs did not cause an accumu lation of mercury in the blood. Pichichero 2008, PML 497, at e213. Doctor Aposhian's comments on the Pi chichero 2008 study included the eight- fold variation in mercury levels among the children in the same group, noting that it demonstrated that not all children process me rcury as fast as others. He suggested that this represented a difference in how they metabolized mercury, which could be genetically determined. Tr. at 179. He did not explain how this variation would differ from the bell curve of expected responses to drugs or toxins, much less that it constituted evidence of hypersusceptibility. Nor did he explain how very small all the measurements of mercury were. Because the blood samples in the 2008 study were taken at specific time intervals and the limit of detection was lower, the 2008 study results were more precise and accurate than those from the 2002 st udy. Pichichero 2008, PML 497, at e209. 155Doctor Aposhian called the Pichicher \"flawed\" because it measured mercury excretion in \"normal children.\" Tr. at 182; Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 49. Of course, at the ages of the children studied (from newbor n to six months of age), it would be impossible to determine whether a particular ch ild was autistic. As the effects on blood mercury levels from infant vaccinations c an only be measured in infants too young to be classified as autistic, the use of \"normal ch ildren\" can hardly be considered to be a flaw. Doctor Aposhian's criticism that the st udy did not provide any information about how much mercury stayed in the brain or other tissues was accurate (Tr. at 182-83; Pet. Tr. Ex. 2, slide 49), but brain biopsies of living children cannot be performed for ethical reasons and thus no study of living children woul d provide that data. Tr. at 184-85. The authors were not attempting to determine t he tissue burden of mercury, only the effect of ethylmercury on blood mercury levels. Doctor Aposhian cited to a website comment critical of the Pichichero 2008 study made by a Dr. Robert Indech,391 filed as PML 651, commenting that the reduction in blood mercury levels reported in the Pichichero 2008 paper did not measure whether any mercury was excreted.392 Other studies, however, have examined how much ethylmercury is excreted in feces, and have determined that a substantial proportion of the ethylmercury from TCVs is excreted in feces. E.g., Clarkson 2002, PML 182, at 16. The Pichichero 2008 researchers examined st ool and urine samples, determining that mercury was present, but they did not quant ify excretion through feces. Pichichero 2008, PML 497, at e213-14. The Pich ichero 2002 study reported the amount of mercury in fecal samples submitted at t he time of the post-vaccination blood draws. Mean mercury levels in the spot samples we re 82 ng/g in the two-month-old infants and 58 ng/g in the six-month-old infants. Pichichero 2002, PM L 223, at 1738. Compared to the blood mercury levels measured, the feca l measurements represented a significant elimination of mercury. The Pichichero 2008 paper may not have answered all the questions Dr. Aposhian would have liked (or have given answers that he hoped to see), but hisconclusion that it is \"flawed\" is not supported by his testimony. (2) The Stajich Study, PML 249. This study compared blood mercury levels in 15 preterm and five term infants after one hepatitis B vaccination. Baseline mercury levels were obtained, with mean blood mercury levels of .04 g/L in the term infants and .54 g/L in the preterm 391 The website comment was filed as PML 651. Do ctor Indech did not identify whether his title reflected a medical degree or any other relevant discipline. His letter was part of an open, on-line forumfor peer review comments made post-publication. Comments in this process are not themselves peerreviewed before publication. 392 Petitioners cited to the same website comment in their post-hearing brief at 22. 156infants.393 PML 249 at 680 (Figure). Blood mercury levels were measured again 48-72 hours after vaccination. Term infant mean blood mercury levels were 2.24 g/L and mean levels in the preterm infants were 7.36 g/L. Mean birth weights of the infants were significantly different as well, with the preterm at a mean of approximately .75 kilograms and the term infants at a mean of 3.6 kilograms. See PML 249 at 680. In a 2003 paper394 that compared a number of studi es of thimerosal, Dr. Magos commented that preterm inf ants in the Stajich study rece ived, on average, a 4.8-fold higher dose per body weight of mercury than the term infants received, but their blood concentrations after vaccination were only 3. 3-fold higher. Based on this, Dr. Magos concluded that the preterm infants act ually \"handled the ethylmercury load more efficiently than term infants did.\" Magos 2003, PML 564, at 266. He concluded, based in large measure on the Stajich and Pich ichero 2002 studies as compared to earlier work on adults, that mercury clears from the infant body faster than from the adult body. Magos 2003, PML 564, at 268. C. The Supplemental Reports. Petitioners filed a supplemental expert r eport by Dr. Aposhian (Pet. Ex. 21) on April 2, 2009, some nine months after the s pecific causation hearing in Colin's case, and over 10 months after the general causat ion hearing concluded. Respondent filed a supplemental expert report by Dr. Brent on May 8, 2009.395 Most of Dr. Aposhian's report concer ned a complex series of calculations designed to show that TCV-level doses of et hylmercury could produce brain levels of inorganic mercury396 closely related to those found in the adult primates in the Vahter and Charleston studies. Pet. Ex. 21 at 2-5. The remainder of his supplemental report largely reiterated matters addressed during hi s testimony concerning the evidence for a 393 Although this difference seems large, the authors determined that it was not statistically significant.

Magos, Neurotoxic Character Thimerosal and the Allometric Extrapolation of as PML 564. 395 These reports may have been filed earlier in the other two Theory 2 cases; I note that the signature page of Dr. Aposhian's report (Pet. Ex. 21 at 7) is dated 7/8/2008. 396 Doctor Aposhian had also calculated probable brain levels in his initial report. PML 711 at 13- 14. Those calculations were based on brain-to-bl ood ratios, a mechanism for estimating brain mercury levels from blood mercury levels. However, this method produces valid results only when the bloodmercury levels have reached steady state (Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 646; Cernichiari, RML72, at 1018), something that will not occur based on administration of TCVs at two-month intervals. See Pichichero 2008, PML 497, at e211 (observing that bl ood mercury levels drop to baseline between TCV injections in human infants). 157mercury efflux disorder in children with ASD.397 Pet.

Doctor Brent pulled no punches in his re view of Dr. Aposhian's supplemental report, calling it \"replete with incorrect stat ements, poorly researched science, incorrect calculations, and, hence, invalid conclusions.\" Res.

Citing the Burbacher, Stajich, and Pichichero 2002 and 2008 studies, Dr. Aposhian attempted to show that vaccine le vel doses of ethylmercury would produce an average brain inorganic mercur y level of 43.7 ng/g. See Pet. Ex. 21 at 3-4. In converting blood ethylmercury levels to brain mercury levels, Dr. Aposhian used aconversion factor of 6.0 for brain-to-bl ood mercury levels derived from Magos 1987, PML 666. 398 He then determined that 34% of the total mercury in the brain would be converted to inorganic mercury, thus deriv ing the 43.7 ng/g level. Pet. Ex. 21 at 4. Alternatively, using the highest blood conc entrations of ethylmercury from the Pichichero 2008 study, and applying the same brai n-to-blood conversion factor of 6.0 and the same 34% conversion factor for total mercury to inorganic mercury, Dr.Aposhian calculated a brain inorganic mercury level of 44.7 ng/g. Pet. Ex. 21 at 5. Doctor Aposhian then compared both calcul ated figures to a 60 ng/g level that the Vahter 1994 paper indicated w ould cause brain neuroinflammation, 399 and 397 He prefaced his rebuttal to Dr. Brent's testimony by indicating that new studies had been published since May, 2008. However, there were only two studies discussed that were published in 2008or later, and, although Dr. Aposhian referred to them by PML numbers (PML 667 and PML 670), thestudies themselves were never filed. I decline to pl ace much weight on Dr. Aposhian's recitation of these studies' findings or conclusions. 398 A copy of PML 666 was never filed. 399 As the Vahter 1994 study, PML 60, did not measure neuroinflammation, Dr. Aposhian's derivation of this figure requires referencing both the Vahter 1994 paper and the Charleston 1994 paper, PML 33. The Vahter study, PML 60, reported tota l mercury and inorganic mercury levels for individual monkeys, not mean levels. PML 60 at Table 2. Figure 6 from the Vahter 1994 study, PML 60, showsmean brain levels in a bar graph, but none of those amounts convert to 60 ng/g. One monkey exposed toinorganic mercury had a 60 ng/g (reported as 0.06 g/g in Table 2, PML 60) level of inorganic mercury in her brain. However, a conclusion regarding \"neuroinf lammation\" in this monkey's brain cannot be drawn because the Charleston 1994 paper, PML 33, reported group results for reactive glia, not results forindividual monkeys. The group's inorganic mercury level was 0.106 g/g. See PML 33, Table 4. Because the increase in reactive glia was reported at a group level, the appropriate reference point for determining the mercury level provoking the increase is the group's mean. Converting the reported 0.106 figure from g/g to ng/g involves multiplying by 1000 (1 g = 1000 ng), resulting in the lowest mean level of inorganic mercury at more than 100 ng/g. See Charleston 1994, PML 33, Table 4 (level of inorganic mercury in the inorganic me rcury group). Based on Table 4, PML 33, one cannot conclude, as Dr. Aposhian did, that 60 ng/g of inorganic brain mercury produces neuroinflammation. I note that the Charleston 1996 study, PML 116, did not mention the inorganic mercury group at 158concluded that TCV levels of ethylmercury would produce sufficient inorganic mercury for adverse effects on infant brains. Pet. Ex. 21 at 3, 5. With regard to ethylmercury's conver sion to inorganic mercury in the infant monkeys' brains, the two witnesses came to similar conclusions. Doctor Aposhian initially calculated that, based on the amount s of ethylmercury and inorganic mercury in the brain at the end of the washout per iod, the infant monkeys would have approximately 19 ng/g of inorganic mercury in the brain. Pet. Ex. 21 at 3. Doctor Brent calculated that the amount would not be above 20 ng/g.400 Res. Ex. EE at 4. However, that is where the agreement between the two witnesses ended. Doctor Brent reiterated his earlier test imony that the infant monkeys would have received 3.3 times the amount of ethylmercu ry received by human infants.401 Res. Ex. EE at 5. For the reasons indicated in note 374, I do not completely accept Dr. Brent's calculations. Instead, I conclude that the Burbacher inf ant monkeys received approximately 2.5-3 times more ethylmercury than human inf ants received through six months of age. Doctor Brent's next set of calculat ions used the baseline mercury data to compute that the amount of i norganic mercury in the brains of the infant monkeys that could be attributed to TCVs was only 4 ng/g (brain concentration of 20 ng/g asmeasured minus 16 ng/g at baseline = 4 ng/g). Res. Ex. EE at 5. He then applied his all. I also note that the Charleston 1994 study also reported that the group of monkeys that received inorganic mercury was the only group to experience edema. PML 33, at 202. 400 Doctor Brent also referred to a baseline of inorganic mercury in the brains of the infant monkeys of 16 ng/g, using data from the Vahter adult control monkeys from the same facility as theBurbacher infant monkeys. Res. Ex. EE at 5. I did not find the figure that Dr. Brent attributed to theVahter 1994 study, PML 60. The Vahter 1994 paper did not report mean mercury levels for controls, only individual levels for each monkey, and a mean calculated from the individual total mercury levels is not 16 ng/g. See PML 60, Table 2. Baseline data for the occipital pole of the control adult monkeys appeared in the Charleston 1994 study, PML 33, at Table 4. The inorganic mercury level for the control monkeys was 0.002 g/g, and the total mercury level was 0.008 g/g. Converting this data to ng/g involves multiplying the measured mercury by 1000, resulting in 2 ng/g for inorganic mercury and 8 ng/g for total mercury in the controlmonkeys (1000 ng=1 g). Because I cannot determine where Dr. Brent derived his data, and because of a concern that adult baselines might be different from infant baselines, I removed the baseline data from all of Dr. Brent's calculations. As this would resu lt in higher amounts of inorganic mercury in the brain attributable to TCVs, petitioners benefit from the removal of the baseline mercury levels Dr. Brent used. 401 He slightly refined the earlier off-the-cuff ca lculations he made during his testimony in this portion of his supplemental report (noting that female infants at six months of age would weigh slightly over seven kilograms, versus eight kilograms for male s). He divided the weight at six months of age into the total mercury received (187.5 g divided by 8 kilograms = 23 g/Kg). However, he did not correct for the fact that some vaccines would have been administered at the lower body weights of birth, one month,two months, and four months of age. By my calculations, see supra note 374, the human infants would have been closer to 33 g/Kg. 159correction factor of 3.3, accounting for t he lower human infant exposure, to the 4 ng/g level in the infant monkeys (4 divided by 3. 3), resulting in a 1.2 ng/g contribution of TCVs to human inorganic brain mercury levels. Res. Ex. EE at 5. In my own calculation, if I consider baseline mercury levels to be zero, and if I apply the 2.5 correction factor for lower hum an exposure, I calculate a TCV contribution of approximately 8 ng/g (20 ng/g divided by 2.5 = 8 ng/g). Because there is undoubtedly some level of inorganic mercur y in the brains of human neonates ( see Lapham, RML 294, Table 2),402 this calculation likely overestimates the TCV contribution to brain mercury levels.403 I note that 8 ng/g is more than seven times lower than 60 ng/g which Dr. Aposhian associated with neur oinflammation, and more than 25 times lower than the lowest mean level of inorgani c mercury reported in the methylmercury- dosed adult monkeys. See Charleston 1994, PML 33, at Table 4. I have no difficulty in accepting the rema inder of Dr. Brent's calculations, and concur with his criticisms of Dr. Aposhian' s calculations. He indicated that Dr. Aposhian's application of an old brain-to-blood ratio of 6 in humans was incorrect, for a number of reasons. The ratio was not only based on outdated, incorrect information (see Res. Ex. EE at 5-6), it was based on meth ylmercury, not ethylmercury. One of the strongest contributions of the Burbacher study was hard evidence that methylmercury's kinetics cannot be extrapolated to ethylmercury 's. Res. Ex. EE at 6 (point 1). The Vahter 1994 study established t hat the monkey brain-to-bl ood ratio of 2.6 that Dr. Aposhian used was also wrong. Res. Ex. EE at 6 (point 3); see also Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 226 (indicating the ratio is 3.2 at 6 months and 5.1 at 12-18 months). Brain-to- blood ratios are valid only when blood levels reach a steady state, something that does not happen with episodic vaccinations. See Res. Ex. EE at 10. Doctor Brent convincingly explained why Dr. Aposhian's calculations of probable brain mercury levels from the blood data in the Pichichero 2002 study were flawed. See 402 In the autopsy data from infants who were three days of age or younger at the time of death, total brain mercury levels ranged from below the limits of detection to as high as 38 ng/g in the infantsborn in Rochester, NY. See RML 294, Table 2. 403 Another study, not referenced by either party, examined the concentrations of total mercury in the occipital lobe of the brain of human fetuses and infants up to three months of age. See E. Lutz, et al., Concentrations of Mercury, Cadmium and Lead in Brain and Kidney of Second Trimester Fetuses andInfants , J. TRACE ELEM. MED. BIOL. filed as PML 198. Doctor Vahter was the senior researcher on this study. The study found mean levels of total mercury of 5 g/Kg in the fetal brains (Lutz, PML 198, at Table 4), which converts to 5 ng/g. Thus, Dr. Brent was correct in determiningthat infant brains are likely to contain a baseline am ount of mercury, but his estimates of the amount were probably too high (16 ng/g estimated by Dr. Brent, versus the 5 ng/g level found in the Lutz study). I notethat the Lutz study figures are lower than those from the same brain region reported for the control infantsin the Lapham study, but not by much. Aside from one control brain with much higher levels than any of the others studied (Lapham, RML 294, at 696 and Table 2), the total mercury in the occipital lobe of thebrains from infants three days old or younger r anged from amounts below the limit of detection (which varied from sample to sample) to 38 ng/g. Lapham, RML 294 at Table 2. 160Res. Ex. EE at 8-12. In addition to the ca lculation and assumption errors he noted, the infant autopsy study (Lapham, RML 294) found infant brain mercury levels in a chronically mercury-exposed population far lower than Dr. Aposhian's formula would indicate. See Res. Ex. EE at 11-12. D. Doctor Aposhian's Opinion Regarding Mercury Causation of ASDs. 1. Overview.As indicated above, Dr. Aposhian also offered his own opinion on mercury causation of autism. Although I have conc luded that he lacked the qualifications to proffer an opinion on ASD causation, I have, nevertheless, elected to discuss his opinion. His report and testimony 404 presented \"six pillars\" (points) upon which his opinion rested. See Tr. at 420. These six points ar e: (1) the Adams 2007 study, PML 138;405 (2) the hair studies by Holmes, PML 237,406 and Hu, PML 16;407 (3) the Bradstreet chelation study, PML 244;408 (4) the efficacy of chelation as a treatment for autism (PML 9);409 (5) the Hornig study, PML 15;410 and (6) the Courchesne 2005 paper, PML 104. Doctor Brent methodically dissect ed the studies upon which five of the six pillars were based.411 He also noted that these studies did not differentiate between children with early onset and regressive autis m, referring to petitioners' hypothesis that mercury was causal of regressive autism. Tr. at 1833-46; Supp. Report of Dr. Brent, Res. Ex. EE, at 8. Of note, of the st udies upon which Dr. Aposhian relied, only the Holmes study differentiated ch ildren with regressive autism from those with early onset 404 A similar hypothesis of mercury causation of autism was presented by Dr. Aposhian in the Theory 1 cases. My conclusions here are based solely on the Theory 2 evidence. 405 J. Adams and J. Romdalvic, Mercury, Lead, and Zinc in Baby Teeth of Children with Autism Versus Controls, J. TOXICOL . ENVTL.

Tr. at 1833, 1958. However, other witnesses addressed thatpaper. 161or typical autism.412 Thus, the findings from these studies, even if valid, would relate to most children with autism, not merely to thos e with regressive or \"clearly regressive\" autism. 2. Doctor Aposhian's Six Points. a. Higher Levels of Mercury in Baby Teeth As Evidence of a Higher Body Burden of Mercury. The Adams 2007 study, PML 138, measured levels of three heavy metals in baby teeth of 16 children with autism and 11 control children.413 The mean level of mercury in the teeth of children with autism was 0.15 g/g; the level in controls was 0.07 g/g.414 Adams, PML 138, at 1048-49. Ba sed on these findings, Dr. Aposhian concluded that autistic children hav e a higher body burden of mercury.415 Tr. at 420-21. However, he did not know if the mercury level in teeth had any correlation with blood mercury levels or brain inorganic mercury levels. Tr. at 425-26. Doctor Brent pointed out a number of pr oblems with reliance on the Adams 2007 study. Doctor Aposhian conceded that two of Dr. Brent's criticisms were correct, referring to the small number of participants and the failure to match carefully the control children to the case children by gender. Tr. at 422-24, 1836. Only 45% of the control children were male, compared to 81% of the children with ASD. Adams 2007, PML 138, at 1047. There is some evidence that males and females process mercurydifferently. See Tr. at 424,1836; see also Woods 2007, 416 PML 428 (showing gender differences in mercury retention). 412 Holmes, PML 237, at 280-81 and Table 3. Holmes reported the highest hair mercury levels in the children with regression, who were less severely affected by autism. However, the validity of the levels of mercury reported and the statistical methods used were criticized by Dr. Brent, as discussedbelow, and thus I do not find the Holmes study's results of much value. 413 Lead levels in children with autism were a mean of 0.38 with controls showing 0.29. Zinc levels were roughly the same in both case and control children. Adams, PML 138, at 1048-49. 414 The species of mercury present in the teeth in the Adams study was not determined. Tr. at 425; see Adams, PML 138, at 1049. 415 Doctor Brent pointed out that tooth mercury has not been correlated with body burden of mercury. Tr. at 1836. The only article Dr. Apos hian could reference for such a correlation was one demonstrating that lead in teeth was reflective of body burden of lead, by \"Needleman.\" Tr. at 421. No article by Needleman was filed by petitioners. However, the Tvinnereim study, ( see H. Tvinnereim, et al., Heavy metals in human primary teeth: some factors influencing the metal concentrations , SCI. TOTAL ENVTL. 255: 21-27 (2000) [\"Tvinnereim\"], filed as RML 488) i ndicated that teeth may be reflective of metal levels during early life. Tvinnereim, RML 488, at 21-22. 416 J. Woods, et al., The Contribution of Dental Amalgam to Urinary Mercury Excretion PML 428. 162The mercury levels found in both groups of children in the Adams 2007 study were much lower than those found in the larger Tvinnereim study, RML 488.417 Tr. at 1835, 1837. Also, the Adams 2007 study failed to control for the type of tooth. The Tvinnereim study established that molars had significantly higher mercury levels than other types of teeth.418 RML 488, at 23-24. There was no control for pica419 or for the amount of lead in the teeth, both potential confounders, in the Adams 2007 study. Tr. at 1837. Doctor Brent also pointed out errors in statistical analysis performed by the authors of the Adams 2007 study. Tr. at 1836; Res. Tr. Ex. 4, slide 23. b. Lower Mercury Levels in Hair as Evidence of Impaired Mercury Excretion. Doctor Aposhian relied on two hair studies, Holmes, PML 237, and Hu, PML 16, for his contention that children with autism do not excrete mercury as well as children without it. Tr. at 219-20. The Holmes st udy, which measured only hair mercury levels, found that hair from first baby haircuts of autistic children contained less mercury than that of control children, with the mean level in the aut istic group of 0.47 ppm and the mean level in the control group of 3.63 ppm . Tr. at 426; Holmes, PML 237, at 280. According to Dr. Aposhian, the Hu study (refe rred to by Dr. Aposhian as the \"study from the MIT Group\") was \"confirmation of the Holmes study.\"420 Tr. at 428. Doctor Aposhian acknowledged that only a very small percentage of mercury is excreted through hair. Tr. at 427. He also agreed that diet and chelation would affect the levels of mercury found in hair, and t hat neither the Holmes nor the Hu study controlled for diet. Tr. at 428-29. Howeve r, the strongest evidence undercutting Dr. Aposhian's reliance on Holmes and Hu was that five subsequent studies attempted to 417 The Tvinnereim study examined 1271 primary teeth without fillings and demonstrated that the heavy metal content, including mercury, in teeth was affected by the number of caries, the type of tooth,and the amount of lead present. Tvinnereim, RML 488, at 22-24; Res. Tr. Ex. 4, slide 21; Tr. at 1834-35. The mean mercury content of the 554 teeth tested for the presence of mercury was 0.267 g/g, with a maximum level of 5.293 g/g and a minimum level of 0.004 g/g found. Table 2 of that study reflected that teeth with caries had higher levels of mercury than teeth without caries, and the type of tooth affected the level of mercury found. Tvinnereim, RML 488, at 23-24. Mercury levels were affected by lead levels. Id. at 24. 418 Doctor Aposhian was unaware that mercur y levels varied depending on the type of tooth tested. Tr. at 424. 419 Pica involves the ingestion of non-food substances, and children with autism are disproportionately afflicted with pica. Pica can increase levels of heavy metals. Tr. at 1837. See also DORLAND 'S at 1436. 420 The Hu study was simply an abstract, which look ed at hair mercury levels in only three autistic individuals. Tr. at 1839. Two of the three were undergoing chelation and on a seafood-free diet. The one individual not undergoing chelation had a hair mercury concentration typical of that of the U.S. population. Tr. at 1839-40. 163duplicate the Holmes data, but were all unable to do so.421 These other studies constituted strong evidence of erroneous resu lts in the Holmes study. Tr. at 1840. A very large study422 of hair mercury levels among U.S. children showed a mean mercury level of 0.22 parts per million. NHA NES, RML 333, at Table 1. Based on this result, both the autistic and control children in the Holmes study had high levels of hair mercury, with the control children having merc ury levels almost 15 times higher than the mean U.S. level. Tr. at 1838-39. The Adams 2006 study, RML 2,423 found no significant differences in hair mercury levels between children with autism and control children. Adams 2006, RML 2, at 204. Doctor Aposhian offered no co mment on this study, and appeared unaware of it. Tr. at 432-33. The Adams 2006 study's authors commented:Overall, it appears that the child ren with autism do not have major differences in their levels of toxic metals compared to controls. Becausemercury toxicity has been suggested as a cause of autism, it is worthwhile to note that the autistic children in this study had levels that were very similar to those of the typical children. Adams 2006, RML 2, at 204. 424 Three other studies all failed to duplicat e Holmes' results. The Ip study, RML 421 In their supplemental expert reports, bot h Drs. Aposhian and Brent discussed an additional 2008 study by Adams (cited as PML 667) of mercury levels in hair. Pet. Ex. 21 at 6; Res. Ex. EE at 12-13. Because the study was not filed ( see supra note 397) and the experts differed in their interpretations of the study's findings, I have placed no reliance on it. 422 M. McDowell, et al., Hair Mercury Levels in U.S. Children and Women of Childbearing Age: Reference Range Data from as RML 333. 423 J. Adams, et al., Analyses of Toxic Metals and Essential Minerals in the Hair of Arizona Children with Autism and Associated Conditions, and Their Mothers , BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RES. 110: 193-209 (2006) [\"Adams 2006\"], filed as RML 2. The lead author appears to be the same person asthe lead author on the Adams 2007 teeth study, PML 138, as both are listed with initials \"J.B.\" and both listArizona State University as their academic affiliation. 424The authors stated that their results were not necessarily inconsistent with Holmes, if the Holmes data reflected a temporary inability to excrete mercury in young infants, perhaps based on ahigher use of oral antibiotics (citing to Rowland, PML 187). Adams 2006, RML 2, at 204. 164257,425 did not find a significant difference in hair mercury levels between autistics and non-autistics. Tr. at 429-30. The Kern study, RML 274,426 also failed to replicate Holmes' results regarding hair mercury levels in children with autism. This study found lower levels of arsenic, cadmium, and lead in the hair of autistic children, but did not find differences in hair mercury in such children to be statistically significant. Kern, RML 274, at abstract. Fido and Al-Saad, RML 138,427 found higher levels of mercury, lead, and uranium in hair samples in autistics than they did in controls. RML 138 at 293. They noted that \"the fetus can inherit heavy metals during pregnancy and these metals can remain in the body tissue for years.\" Id. at 295. Doctor Aposhian was reluctant to put much reliance on the Fido and Al-Saad study , but agreed that its results were the opposite of those from the Holm es study. Tr. at 431-32. c. Chelation Mobilizes More Mercury in ASD Subjects. The Bradstreet study found that autisti c children excreted substantially more mercury than control children when both we re administered succimer (also known as DMSA 428) for three days. Tr. at 433; Bradstreet, PML 244, at 77. Fifty-five children with autism were matched for age, sex, and vaccination status with eight, non-randomlyselected controls. Mean urinary mercury ex cretion after three days of chelation was 6.42 g/g of creatinine for the ASD children and only 1.08 g/g of creatinine for the control children. Bradstreet, PML 244, at 76-77. No pre-chelation levels were 425 P. Ip, et al., Mercury Exposure in Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder: Case-Control Study , J. RML 257. The Ip study's findings with regard to differences in blood mercury levels were challenged in a paper by DeSoto. M. De Soto & R. Hitlan,Blood Levels of Mercury Are Related to Diagnosis of Autism: A Reanalysis of an Important Data Set . However, DeSoto's reanalysis of the Ip findings with regard to hair mercury levels implied that there were no defects in that analysis. Doctor Aposhian stopped short of agreeing with this statement ( see Tr. at 431), but the DeSoto article itself clearly so states. See DeSoto, PML 423, at 1309. 426 J. Kern, et al., Sulfhydryl-Reactive Metals in Autism , J. TOXICOL . 70: RML 274. 427 A. Fido and S. Al-Saad, Toxic trace elements in the hair of children with autism , AUTISM 9(3): 290-98 (2005) [\"Fido and Al-Saad\"], filed 138. 428 DMSA is dimercaptosuccinic acid, a water-solubl e and relatively non-toxic chelating agent. Tr. at 433-34. A chelating agent mobilizes metals. DMSA is FDA-approved for the treatment of children withelevated blood lead levels, but is used off-label to treat mercury or arsenic intoxication because it has proven safe for administration to children. Tr. at 434. DMSA will chelate mercuric mercury, but itmobilizes methylmercury as well. When children are chelated to remove mercury, it is likely that bothorganic and inorganic mercury are excreted in urine. Tr. at 440-41. The majority of the mercury comesfrom the kidney, but some comes from other tissues. Tr. at 441. Studies by Dr. Aposhian performed onanimals exposed to mercury vapor (elemental mercury) demonstrated that DMSA does not removemercury from the brain. Tr. at 442. 165determined for either group.429 Tr. at 1843. The authors could not determine whether the higher mercury excretion levels in t he ASD children were the result of higher mercury intake or a reduced ability to excret e it without chelation. Bradstreet, PML 244, at 79. Doctor Brent had a number of criticisms of the Bradstreet study. He noted that the failure to control for diet was a pot ential confounder and that the control children were typically developing children brought to Dr. Bradstreet's practice based on parental concerns about mercury toxicity. Tr. at 1841- 42. Based on the data reported, Dr. Brent attempted to verify that the results were statistically significant, and was unable to do so. Tr. at 1842. He also noted that the range of values produced was huge and overlapping, as reflected on Table 1. PM L 244 at 77. The mercury concentrations in the case children varied from zero to nearly 59 g/g, and the control children's mercury levels varied from zero to 6 g/g. Id.; Tr. at 1842. This range is simply too large from which to draw any conclusions. The urinary mercury levels in the majority of the case children were consistent with those of anyone who is chelated. Tr. at 1843. The study also failed to verify that the chelator was actually administered per the study protocol, and it failed to exclude children who had prior chelation, which may have skewedresults. Tr. at 1843. Doctor Brent also challenged the study 's conclusion about \"body burden\" of mercury, commenting that chel ation primarily mobilizes me rcury stored in the kidney, and thus conclusions about body burden were overbroad. Tr. at 1843. Doctor Brent criticized the standards of t he journal in which the Br adstreet study appeared, noting that studies published in it were not peer reviewed and the journal was not indexed. He also noted that the editor of the j ournal was associated with SafeMinds. 430 Tr. at 1840- 41, 1843-44. 429 The failure to ascertain pre-chelation levels of urinary mercury is contrary to standard practice. Doctor Aposhian has performed a number of chel ation studies and has published between five and ten peer reviewed articles on chelation. Tr. at 434. Although some of his earlier studies may not have involved pre- and post-chelation measurements, in his later studies, he insisted on obtaining both measurements. Tr. at 435. The Bradstreet study did not take pre-chelation measurements and did not control for diet, which could affect mercury levels. Tr. at 436. However, in his supplemental report, Pet.Ex. 21 at 6, Dr. Aposhian appeared to excuse Dr. Bradstreet's failure to take a baseline test because ofthe difficulty in obtaining urine specimens from children with ASD. Doctor Brent called this excuseparadoxical because of the apparent ease with which post-challenge urine samples were obtained by Dr.Bradstreet and other researchers. Res. Ex. EE at 13-14. 430 The SafeMinds website describes it as a group \"founded to investigate and raise awareness of the risks to infants and children of exposure to mercury from medical products, including thimerosal invaccines.\" SafeMinds (Sensible Action for Endi ng Mercury-Induced Neurological Disorders) website, http://www.safeminds.org/ (last visited Feb. 20, 2010); see also J. Baker, PML 599, at 250-51 (describing SafeMinds as an advocacy organization created by a group of \"self-designated 'Mercury Moms'\"). 166Most significantly, the Soden study, RML 458,431 which was published in a peer reviewed journal, attempted to duplicate the Bradstreet study, while correcting for some of the defects noted in it.432 The Soden study found no evidence that the autistic subjects had excess levels of mercury or other heavy metals. RML 458 at 479. Onlyone of the autistic children 433 had a post-chelation urinary mercury level above the limits of detection434 and none of the typically developing control children did. Because of the small number of control subjects, no statisti cally significant comparison could be made. RML 458 at 479. d. Chelation Improves Autism's Symptoms. Doctor Aposhian's fourth point was bas ed on the 2005 Autism Research Institute Monograph, PML 9.435 He testified that he relied on this monograph as well as \"what parents told me at these think-tank meetings....\"436 He acknowledged that there were 431 S. Soden, et al., 24-Hour provoked urine excretion test for heavy metals in children with autism and typically developing controls, a pilot study , CLIN. TOXICOL . 45: 476-81 (2007) [\"Soden\"], filed as RML 458. 432 To correct for flaws noted in the Bradstreet study, dietary restrictions were imposed, pre- chelation (baseline) urine levels were measured, diagnoses of autism were confirmed, and those with previous chelation were excluded. RML 458 at 477-78. 433 This child was placed on a fish-free diet for one month, then chelated again. The post- chelation urinary mercury declined significantly in the second challenge. Soden, RML 458, at 479. 434 The limit of detection was 1 g per 24 hour-urine collection. Soden, RML 458, at Table 1. 435 This monograph included the disclaimer that it was not intended as medical advice and stated that it represented the consensus opinion of the list ed contributors, which include James B. Adams, Ph.D, the lead author of the Adams 2007 paper filed as PML 138; Mark Geier, M.D., Ph.D, who was listed as expert witness; Boyd Haley, Ph.D, listed as a petitioners' expert witness; Mumper,M.D., an expert witness for petitioners; Richard Deth, Ph.D., an expert witness for petitioners; and S. JillJames, Ph.D., the author of several articles filed by petitioners and relied upon by them duringpresentation of their case. Petitioners' Initial Disclosure of Experts, OAP Master File, filed Feb. 14, 2006(listing Drs. Adams, Geier, Haley, Mumper, and Deth as petitioners' The type the following statement: \"Overall, our consens us position is that removal of mercury and other toxic metals is one of the most beneficial treatments for autism and related disorders.\" PML 9 at 5. Theonly study cited in the monograph to support this cl aim of improvement after chelation is one by A. Holmes, who presented research results at a meeting, but apparently never published the results. PML 9at 13, reference 15. 436 Doctor Mumper also mentioned \"think tank\" meetings. See, e.g. , Tr. at 1193. They appear to be ad hoc , rather than standing, groups. Doctor Aposhian described them as \"by invitation only\" meetings of 20-100 people talking about autism. Tr. at 406-07. The guest list at one he attended involved parentsof autistic children, scientists, and physicians. He al so indicated that ARI hosted think tanks about twice annually. Tr. at 407; see also Tr. at 1199-1200, 1217 (Dr. Mumper discussing ARI-hosted and other \"think tank\" meetings). 167\"shortcomings\" in relying on parental views,437 rather than controlled clinical trials. Tr. at 437. He also noted that the ARI Monograph had never been published in a journal. Tr. at 438. He was unaware of any peer revi ewed study demonstrating that chelation improved the neurological manifestations of autism. Tr. at 438. The ARI Monograph also indicated that chelating agents did not remove inorganic mercury from the brain. PML 9 at 10, 14; Tr. at 442.438 In spite of the lack of efficacy of t he most common chelating agents in removing inorganic mercury from the brain, Dr. A poshian nevertheless relied upon the reported success of chelation in impr oving the symptoms of autism.439 He explained that the removal of mercury from other places in the body would have an effect on enzyme levels in other tissues, but did not explain why that would be significant. He agreed that chelation would not reduce the brain damage that he contended inorganic mercury caused. Tr. at 443. He could not other wise explain how chelation therapy could improve neurologic function in children wit h ASD, although their pur ported improvement was one of the points upon which his opinion r egarding mercury causation rested. Tr. at 444-45. Doctor Deth testified that because aut istic individuals have oxidative stress throughout their bodies, the chelation of peripher al mercury in tissues outside the brain \"can have useful effects by restoring normal metabolism and normal redox state peripherally, helping peripheral cells to work better. And as a result, the beneficial peripheral metabolism can affect [the] brain.\"440 Tr. at 579-80. The effect could be reducing the inflammatory cytokines in the blood that contribute to neuroinflammation, or it could be the result of increased ava ilability of specific amino acids affected by mercury. Tr. at 580. Doctor Deth did not identify whether his opinion was theoretical only, or whether it was based on evidence that chelation impr oved ASD symptoms. Additionally, his views on chelation were shaped by his theory that TCV levels ofmercury cause a chronic state of oxidativ e stress throughout the body, and thus did not 437 Respondent's experts noted more than \"shortcomings.\" On cross-examination, Dr. Rutter testified about a number of substances that were, anecdotally, effective in treating autism, but, when tested in a scientific study, were not efficacious. They included fenfluoramine and secretin. Tr. at 3342-43; see also Tr. at 3703-04 (anecdotal reports about secretin's efficacy contrasted with results from blinded studies showing no difference in efficacy from placebo). 438 Doctor Aposhian indicated that he was currently involved in a study of a chelating agent called D-Penicillamine, which decreased both organic and inorgani c brain. Tr. at 442-43 (the transcript reflects the testimony as referring to \"Depenicillamine\"). A ccording to Dr. Aposhian, the paper was being prepared for publication at the time of the general causation hearing, but it was never filed by petitioners. 439 Doctors Deth and Mumper supported Dr. Aposhian' s claim that chelation was effective therapy in autism, in spite of its inability to remove mercury from the brain. Tr. at 580, 1598-99. 440 The \"redox state\" of the body refers to the body's oxidative stress level. Doctor Deth's assertions regarding mercury's effects on oxidativ e status are discussed in Section VII, below. 168rely on brain mercury levels exclusively. Doctor Deth's theory of system-wide, mercury- induced oxidative stress was severely undercut by contrary testimony from experts with far superior credentials. See Section VII below. Doctor Mumper also testified that chelation was beneficial in treating some children with ASD. Tr. at 1216. Her pref erred method of chelation was to use substances other than chelating agent s to help the body excrete mercury.441 Tr. at 1336. She recognized that no controlled studies had been performed and indicated that she was working with NIH to devel op one. Tr. at 1199, 1336-37, 1599. Doctor Brent summed up his criticism of Dr . Aposhian's fourth point in testifying: \"I couldn't find a single study in the pee r-reviewed medical literature or scientific literature that demonstrat es that chelation therapy is benefic ial in autism.\" Tr. at 1845. Doctor Fombonne concurred. Tr. at 3702-03. He noted that no professional body recommends chelation as a treatm ent for autism. Tr. at 3703. See also Tr. at 2398, 2453 (Dr. Rust concurring that chelation was not effective). e. Genetic Susceptibility to Mercury.442 Doctor Aposhian asserted that child ren with ASD were hypersusceptible443 to mercury, stating that \"in some specifically susceptible subset of infants who received mercury-containing vaccines on the U.S. vaccination schedule in place from roughly 1991 to 2003, the ethylmercury probably caus ed the symptoms of autism in many of them.\" PML 711 at 24. He testified that \"many people accept the idea that there's a genetic predisposition to mercury toxicity, I th ink the effects of mercury, and there are a number of papers that prove that now.\" Tr. at 276. He specifically referred to the Hornig study, PML 15, in his report. PML 711 at 25. Elsewhere in his report, he relied on acrodynia, commonly known as Pink Dis ease, as evidence of hypersusceptibility. PML 711 at 19-20. In testimony, he \"Woods study,\" apparently referring to PML 45,444 as evidence of a polymorphism445 in some individuals occupationally 441 Some of her testimony about her chelation practices was unclear. At one point, she testified that she tended not to use it in her practice (Tr. at 1556) and, at another point, indicated that she did chelate children in her clinic but preferred to use \"natural chelators,\" rather than DMSA (Tr. at 1598). 442 In his report (PML 711 at 25), Dr. Aposhian' s fifth point mentioned only the susceptibility of genetically altered mice to mercury, citing the Hornig study (PML 15). A genetic susceptibility in mice tomercury, with mercury producing autism-like symptoms , would be relevant to Dr. Aposhian's assertions that children with ASD are hypersusceptible to mercury' s effects. Thus, this section discusses the Hornig study, as well as evidence not addressed elsewhere, regarding the purported hypersusceptibility. 443 He did not define what he meant by \"hypersusceptible.\" 444 See J. Woods, et al., The association between genetic polymorphisms of coproporphyrinogen oxidase and an atypicial porphyrinogenic response to Porphyrins are compounds involved 169exposed to mercury. Tr. at 213, 230-31. For reasons that have more to do with epidemiology than biology or pharmacology, petitioners postulated a sm all group of children with ASD who are unusually sensitive to the effects of merc ury or unable to excrete it properly. As indicated in Section V, a number of epi demiological studies have failed to find any evidence that thimerosal exposure plays any role in the development of autism.446 However, because epidemiological studies may be unable to rule out the effect of TCVson a small, \"hypersusceptible\" group of child ren, petitioners have argued that there must be such a group. However, acrodynia, pol ymorphisms affecting porphyrin excretion, and Dr. Hornig's mice all fail to demonstr ate the existence of hypersusceptibilty to mercury. 447 Although Aposhian's report and the urinary porphyrin studies by Woods449 as additional evidence of the existence of a mercury efflux disorder, neither was discussed at any length during his testimony. See Tr. at 141, 160 (Pink Disease) and 213, 230-31 (porphy rin polymorphisms). With regard to Pink Disease, the unavailability of evidenc e regarding the doses of teething powders in the biosynthesis of heme and are excreted in urine. See DORLAND 'S at 1488-89 (porphyrin and porphyrinogen). Doctor Woods, who was identified as an expert witness for petitioners ( see PSC's Unopposed Motion for Leave to Designate Additional Expert Witness Dr. James Woods, Ph.D., OAP Master File, filed Aug. 8, 2007), but who was not call ed, conducted several studies to determine if urinary porphyrins could be used as biomarkers for mercury in occupationally-exposed workers, primarily dentists. He noted that about 12-16% of these indi viduals had an atypical excretion pattern. See Woods 2005, PML 45, at 114. I note that this pattern did not involve me rcury excretion; it involved porphyrin excretion. It did not assert that such individuals were \"hypersusceptible\" to mercury. 445 Polymorphisms are variations of genes that are sufficiently common in populations that they cannot be considered mutations. See DORLAND 'S at 1481; Tr. at 619-20. 446 Parker, RML 368. This literature survey examined 12 studies of the relationship of thimerosal to autism. The authors concluded that there is no reliable evidence of a link between TCVs and autism and that the pharmacodynamics of ethylmercury make such an association unlikely. 447 Petitioners also argued that the \"wide variati ons\" in blood mercury levels in humans after administration of mercury indicate a hypersusceptibility. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 21 (citing Pichichero2008, PML 497). They failed to adduce any evidence t hat these variations are anything more than a typical dose-response relationship. I note that similar \"wide variations\" have been found in primate studies. See, e.g. , Vahter 1994, PML 60, at 226 (noting large variations in blood half time in individual monkeys, and reports of similar variations in hum an subjects); Burbacher, PML 26, at 1018-19 (reporting a two-fold variation in blood mercury levels after methylmercury ingestion and similar variation in the thimerosal-exposed monkeys). 448 See A. Dally, The Rise and Fall of Pink Disease , SOC'Y SOC. HIST. MED. 10(2): 291-304 (1997), filed as PML 184. 449 See Woods 2005, PML 45. This study ident ified polymorphisms on the CPOX gene. Woods2005, PML 45, at 119. 170used on the children who developed symptoms e ffectively precludes any conclusions regarding a supposed \"hypersusceptibility.\" Wi th regard to Woods' findings that 15% of dentists occupationally exposed to mercur y exhibit an unusual porphyrin excretion pattern ( see PML 45 at abstract), the Rose study, PML 430,450 indicates that the polymorphisms associated with this pattern are not present in greater numbers of children with autism. Doctor Aposhian did not address the Ho rnig study, PML 15, during his direct examination. His testimony about the st udy on cross examination could hardly be considered a ringing endorsement of the study's findings. When asked if he still relied upon it, he commented: \"That's a very difficult question now, because some peoplehave claimed that they can't repeat it.\" Tr. at 449. He added that, at the present, he had \"no firm opinion\" on the study's findings. Tr. at 449. Doctor Brent testified that the Hornig study's findings were non-replicable by other investigators. Tr. at 1845-46; Res. Ex. EE at 14. Because Dr. Aposhian's reliance on the Hornig study at the hearing was lukewarm at best, but Dr. Deth placedgreater reliance on it, further discussion of t he study and respondent's criticisms of it are postponed to Section VII below. In his supplemental opinion, Dr. Apos hian noted that the Laurente study, PML 668, 451 supported the Hornig study's findings. Pet. Ex. 21, at 6. In his supplemental report, Dr. Brent also commented on the Laurente study, noting that the dosing schedule was such that the study animals ( hamsters) were administered toxic doses of mercury as evidenced by the 50% weight disparity between t he treated hamsters and the controls. Weight loss is a symptom of mercury toxicity. Thus, he did not find itinformative on the effects of vaccine doses of mercury on human infants. Res. Ex. EE at 14. 450 This group of researchers built on Woods' work to examine the role the CPOX polymorphisms might play in the response of children with autism to heavy metals. The authors indicated that lead and mercury, among other substances, inhibited the role of the CPOX gene, and suspecting that CPOX polymorphisms might play a role in the susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity in neurodevelopment, thestudy investigated the prevalence of the CPOX pol ymorphisms in children with ASD. PML 430 at 86. However, the study was \"negative for both of the CP OX polymorphisms,\" indicating that autistic children were less likely to have the polymorphisms associated with atypical urinary porphyrin excretion patterns. PML 430 at et al., Neurotoxic effects of thimerosal at vaccines [sic] doses on the encephalon and development in 7 days-old hamsters , AN. FAC. MED. LIMA 68(3): 222-37 (2007) [\"Laurente\"], filed as PML 668. This study was initially identified as Pet. Tr. Ex. 11. I note that, with the exception of the seniorresearcher (a professor in the department of medicine and a member of the internal medicine departmentat a hospital in Lima, Peru), all the authors were medical students. Aside from any other criticisms of thisstudy, it suffers from some of the same defects in design as the Burbacher infant monkey study. Although it attempted to duplicate the vaccine-level doses of thimerosal, the mercury was injected at two-day, nottwo-month, intervals, allowing little or no time for the elimination of the first dose before the second and third doses were administered. PML 668 at Table 1. 171f. Postnatal Loss of Brain Cells in Autism. Doctor Aposhian's sixth point posits that autistic children experience a postnatal loss of brain cells, particularly in the cerebe llum. Report of Dr. Aposhian, PML 711, at 25. Tr. at 450-51. Doctor Aposhian could not recall the details of the study he cited in support of this point (Tr. at 450-51), but his report reflected that it was the Courchesne study, filed as PML 104, at 584. See PML 711 at 25. Doctor Kemper noted that Dr. Apos hian misread or misinterpreted the Courchesne 2005 paper. Tr. at 2834. The s pecific neurons reported as decreased in those with autism were Purkinje neurons. PML 104 at 584. These are precisely the neurons reported as decreased in most of the neuropathology studies and which are likely a prenatal loss. See Tr. at 2835; see also Section IV.G.3.b. Mercury exposure spares Purkinje cells . E.g., Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 631. 3. Evaluation of Dr. Aposhian's Causation Opinion.In his summary, Dr. Brent addressed five of the six points on which Dr. Aposhian's theory of mercury causation of autism rested. 452 He noted that none of the four studies (Adams tooth study, Holmes hai r study, Bradstreet chelation study, and Hornig mice study) upon which Dr. Aposhian primarily relied could be replicated, and that the benefits of chelati on in treating autism had not been substantiated in any peer reviewed study. See Tr. at 1846. Even if mercury is responsible for causing ASD, Dr. Aposhian himself acknowledged the ubiquity of non-vaccine mercury exposure,testifying that humans are exposed to approximately 6-10 g of mercury vapor from dental amalgams per day, and retain most of the methylmercury to which they are exposed through food, about 6-20 g per day. 453 Tr. at 461-62. The Courchesne 2005 paper likewise provided no real support for Dr. Aposhian's causation opinion. This paper summarized findings from many diverse studies andspeculated on their implications for autism' s causes and treatments, but the comments on cell loss merely reiterated the neuropathology findings. The authors did not attribute such cell loss to postnatal toxic exposures. E. Factual Conclusions Regarding Mercury. Doctor Brent referred to a scientific methodology for determining if a given substance was responsible for a particular toxic effect, in which four questions must be 452 He specifically declined to address the Courchesne 2005 paper, PML 104, because it was outside his area of expertise. Tr. at 1958 . 453 Doctor Aposhian took his data about me thylmercury ingestion primarily from Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury , PML 228. Tr. at 460. However, the data did not include any separate table for exposures of children from birth to age three. Tr. at 462. 172answered: (1) to what chemical was t he patient exposed; (2) how much of the substance was involved; (3) what conditions is the chemical known to cause; and (4) didthis exposure cause the condition from which the patient suffers? (a reformulation of Dr. Brent's testimony at 1798-99; and Res. Tr. Ex. 4, slide 3). Essentially, this methodology asks: what, how much, can it, and did it? Applying Dr. Brent's methodology, I conc lude that it is undisputed that human beings are born with some amount of mercury present in their brains. Throughout the first year of life, U.S. children have additi onal mercury exposure from diet, environment (air and water), and, prior to the removal of most TCVs from the U.S. market, TCVs. Mercury exposure continues throughout life, and some portion of the mercury to which human beings are exposed adds to brain mercury levels. Petitioners have contended that inorganic merc ury in the brain is responsible for at least some cases of ASD. However, the amount of inorganic mercury produced in the brains of infants who received TCVs is extremely low. Doctor Aposhian's calculations of the contribution of TCVs to brain inorganic mercury levels were incorrect, but even if I use his figures, TCVs produc ed far less than the amount of inorganic mercury in the brain that produced inflammatory responses in adult primates. Theactual TCV contribution was undoubtedly much smaller than Dr. Aposhian postulated. The evidence is clear that ethylmercury , in sufficient doses, is neurotoxic. The brain levels at which toxic effects hav e been observed are not well-established for ethylmercury, but total brain mercury levels associated with toxic effects are thousands of times higher than the levels produced by TCVs, and hundreds of times higher than baseline measurements in autopsies of human neonates. Through a series of accidental poisoni ngs, toxicologists have determined the neurotoxic effects from prenatal and early pos tnatal mercury exposure. Those effects are not ASDs. Through sophisticated test s administered to children in populations exposed pre- and postnatally to levels insuffi cient to produce toxicity, but sufficient to produce measurable cognitive effects, e ffects of lower dose exposure have been described. Once again, those effects are not ASDs. The levels of inorganic and total brain mercury at which widespread evidence of neuroinflammation was observed in the adult monkeys were far higher than the levelsfound in human neonates (baseline exposure) pl us any amount attributable to vaccines. Even in the adult primates, the cellular changes in the brain produced no observable neurological effects after months of daily ex posure. Every two days, the adult primates received approximately as much mercury as is contained in all the mercury in the first six months of TCVs, calculat ed at a dose per kilogram. Methylmercury has an affinity for certai n areas of the brain. The brain areas most affected by mercury are not the areas affected in ASD patients. The brain cells most vulnerable to mercury's effects are largely unaffected in ASD patients. 173Conversely, the loss of Purkinje cells is the most consistent pathological finding in the ASD autopsy studies, but mercury exposure spares Purkinje cells while damagingothers. The neurological symptoms caus ed by mercury exposure do not resemble ASD's symptoms and behaviors. The evidence that some individuals are hypersusceptible to mercury's effects is singularly unconvincing. There is no reliable evidence that mercury levels in childrenwith ASD, with or without regression, differ from those in the general population. There is no reliable evidence that children with ASD respond differently to mercury than neurotypical children do. The studies upon which Dr. Aposhian relied were, in general, poorly performed, and in all cases, their re sults either had not been or could not be duplicated. Through Dr. Aposhian, petitioners attemp ted to demonstrate mercury's probable causal role in ASD. Similarly, thr ough Dr. Aposhian, petitioners attempted to demonstrate that vaccine levels of TCVs, al one or in combination with other sources of mercury exposure, would produce brain levels of mercury sufficient to provoke oxidative stress, oxidative injury, and neuroinflamma tion. The evidence presented by Dr. Aposhian failed to do either. Section VII. The Disruption of Sulfur Metabolism Hypotheses. A. Overview. Petitioners identified Dr. Deth's three majo r contributions to the general causation case as: (1) describing the biochemical process by which mercury can create anoxidative environment in the brain; (2) descr ibing the biochemical processes involved in neuroinflammation; and (3) identifying \" genetic and epigenetic differences between individuals\" to explain why TCVs produce autistic symptoms in only a small number of those exposed to TCVs. Pet. Post-Hearing Br . at 44. This section examines the evidence underlying Dr. Deth's opinion that \"the most critical problem in autism\" involves maintaining a normal \"redox\" 454 status in cells (Tr. at 505) and attempts to explain the complex aspects of cellular metabolism involved in the \"biochemicalprocesses\" to which petitioners' brief referr ed. It also examines the evidence regarding Dr. Deth's assertions that children with autism have an impaired ability to handle oxidative stress. Although Dr. Doctor Deth opined on a re lationship among autism, mercury, oxidative stress, and cellular metabolism, hi s qualifications as an expert in several of 454 \"Redox\" refers to the balance between red uction and ox idation in cells (Tr. at 2170), concepts explained in more detail below. 174these areas were lacking.455 The effects of oxidative stress were central to his causation hypothesis, but Dr. Deth's only publication on oxidative stress was a review article456 which set forth much of the same hypothesis regarding the relationship between mercury, oxidative stress, and autism presented in his testimony. His research into the effects of mercury began four or five years prior to his testimony but, as of the May 2008 hearing, he had published only one peer reviewed article on mercury.457 Tr. at 599-600. He had conducted no research on autism. He has a Ph.D. inpharmacology, teaches at Northeastern Univ ersity, and maintains his own laboratory there, but his research efforts have focused, not on neurotoxicology, neuropharmacology, autism, or sulfur metabolism, 458 but rather on hypertension and cardiovascular problems. See Tr. at 495; see also PML 712. Arrayed against Dr. Deth were five witne sses, including a medical doctor with a specialty in clinical pharmacology (Dr. Roberts, Tr. at 2154-55); a pharmacologist with specialties in environmental toxicology and molecular neuroscience and a researchfocus on neurodegenerative diseases (D r. Johnson, Tr. at 2198-99); a neuropharmacologist with a research focus on dopamine receptors (Dr. Mailman, Tr. at 1975, 1977); a molecular biochemist with a research focus in molecular toxicology,sulfur metabolism, and oxidative stress (D r. Jones, Tr. at 2692-93, 2696-98); and Dr. Brent, a medical toxicologist, who treats adul ts and children for metal toxicity (Tr. at 1782, 1792). Each of respondent's experts offered relatively brief testimony 459 focused on specific (and different) aspects of Dr. De th's hypothesis, with their testimony carefully restricted to their own areas of expertise. Each had impeccable academic and research credentials in the areas in which they opi ned. Taken individually and as a whole, respondent's witnesses were far more qualified than Dr. Deth to opine on the matters inissue. This became very apparent as they pointed out deficiencies in his understanding of the subcellular processes involved in hi s hypothesis, as well as deficiencies in his own experimental work. 455 At least one court, albeit one that applies the Frye standard rather than Daubert , has excluded Dr. Deth's testimony on the thimerosal-autism hypothesis. See Blackwell v. Wyeth , 971 A.2d 235, 265, 268 (Md. 2009) (affirming trial judge's ruling that Dr. Deth's opinions were not reliable). 456 Deth, PML 563. He acknowledged that this was his only publication on oxidative stress. Tr. at 598. 457 M. Waly, et al., Activation of methionine synthase by insulin-like growth factor -1 Doctor Deth was listed as the senior researcher. He testified that the Walyarticle was rejected by three journals before the fourth agreed to publish it. Tr. at 3967-68. Doctor Dethhas also published a monograph, which was not peer review ed, and not filed as evidence. Tr. at 600-01. 458 \"Sulfur metabolism\" refers to that part of the body's metabolic processes involving sulfur- containing compounds. 459 Doctor Brent's overall testimony on mercury toxicology was not brief, but he addressed only certain aspects of Dr. Deth's hypothesis pertaining to mercury's effects. 175Summarizing Dr. Deth's opinions on the causal role of mercury in autism is difficult. Not only were the biochemical pr ocesses allegedly affected very complex, his explanations of those processes lacked coher ence. He opined that very small amounts of mercury had a scattershot effect on a num ber of biochemical processes, inducing systemic metabolic abnormalities and oxidative st ress. PML 713 at 2. He also opined that these metabolic abnormalities resulted in interference with neuronal functioning in attention and cognition, causing t he major symptoms of autism. Id. at 2, 4. His entire hypothesis rested on a s peculative \"genetic susceptibility\"460 to environmental toxins, such as heavy metals in general, and mercury in particular. Heasserted that children with autism have polymor phisms-variations in genes that are not considered mutations--that render them more s ensitive to mercury's effects by impairing their ability to eliminate ethylmercury, maintain normal oxidative and methylation balance, and maintain synchronization in neuronal signaling. PML 713 at 2. The scientific studies upon which he reli ed provided, at best, only tangential support for his hypothesis. His own research, most of which was unpublished,unduplicated, or mentioned for the first ti me during the Theory 2 general causation hearing, was poorly performed and scient ifically implausible. Based on in vitro effects of mercury on \"neuronal cells,\" 461 he claimed that mercury had the same effects on human brain cells. PML 713 at 2; see also Tr. at 2204 (Dr. Johnson's summary of Dr. Deth's testimony). In addition to his own unpublished research,462 Dr. Deth relied heavily on his one article on mercury, the Waly study, PML 257. Tr. 3967-68. He relied on two studies 460 Although it is widely recognized that ASD has a strong genetic basis ( see, e.g. , Bailey 1995, PML 90), there is virtually no evidence that those with ASD have any genetic susceptibilities orsensitivities to any particular chemicals or toxins not also present in similar proportions of typically developing children. 461 The cells used in Dr. Deth's unpublished work were actually neuroblastoma cells from a tumor that had originated, not in the brain, but elsewhere in the body. Tr. at 2204-09. This is a common cell lineused in research, but peculiarities of this cell line rendered many of Dr. Deth's conclusions highly questionable. See discussion at Section VII.C.3.b., infra. 462 Petitioners intimated that Dr. Deth's inability to complete and publish his research was hampered by governmental efforts to suppress research funding into the role of TCVs in autism causation. See Tr. at 588; Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 8. Considerable testimony was devoted to the NIH process for approving research proposals. Tr. at 415-06, 587-89 , 656-60, 2203-04. However, there was a dearth of evidence that Dr. Deth's research proposals were turned down due to any malign governmental action. Doctor Johnson was part of the NIH study section that reviewed a grant proposal submitted by Dr. Deth in2003. His recollection was that Dr. Deth's hypothesis was weak, the preliminary data did not support it,and the proposed experiment was poorly designed. Doct or Johnson convincingly testified that research proposals are evaluated solely on their scientific me rit by a group of subject matter experts, not NIH employees. Tr. at 2203-04. 176conducted by Dr. S. Jill James,463 calling them the strongest evidence in support of his hypothesis. Tr. at 583-84. He also claimed that the \"strongest evidence\" in favor of his hypothesis derived from his own unpublished wo rk on post-mortem brain samples from individuals with ASD. Tr. at 582-83. Perhaps his most extravagant claim involv ed the quantity of mercury required to induce the claimed effects. He claimed t he ability to detect the effects of mercury on cells at levels 100-1000 times lower than levels used by other researchers. See Tr. at 2223-24. He testified that mercury, in am ounts at or well below the amounts contained in TCVs, could induce some individuals to enter into and remain in a state of oxidative stress. See Tr. at 514-15, 622-23. In the course of the hearing, nearly ever y premise of his causation theory, other than that of the ubiquity of mercury exposur e in children (with or without autism), was seriously undermined, where not completely demolished. Mercury, and a number of other heavy metals, can affect cellular metabolism, but Dr. Deth's assertions thatmercury does so in the manner and at the le vels of exposure postulated and with the effects claimed were not scientifically support ed. His assertion that oxidative stress in children with autism is causal of their autism was pure speculation. Some background information on oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism follows, and primarily focuses on the amino acids and processes that are implicated in Dr. Deth's hypothesis and experiments. Thereafte r, I discuss the studies upon which Dr. Deth relied and the criticisms of them. B. Background Information. 1. Oxidative Stress. a. Physical Chemistry of Oxidation. Molecules are composed of atoms of one or more elements. Tr. at 2167. Oxidation is the removal of one electron from an atom's outer ring, leaving behind an unpaired electron. Tr. at 2167. An oxidated at om (or the molecule of which it is a part) is referred to as a \"free radical.\" Tr. at 2168. Free radicals are unstable and highly 463 Doctor Deth identified the two James studies upon which he primarily relied as S. James, et al., Metabolic biomarkers of increased oxidative stress and impaired methylation capacity in children with autism AM. J. James, et al., Metabolic Endophenotype and Related Genotypes are Associated with Oxidative Stress in Children withAutism , A M. J. . 947-56 (2006) [\"James 2006\"], filed as PML 49. Tr. at 583-84. Two additional research papers co-authored by Dr. James were filed as exhibits: James 2005, PML 7;and S. James, et al., Cellular and mitochondrial glutathione redox imbalance in lymphoblastoid cells derived from FASEB 1-10 (2009) (epublished) [\"James 2009\"], PML 760. Her book chapter, S. James, Oxidative Stress and the Metabolic Pathology of Autism , in A UTISM : CURRENT THEORIES AND EVIDENCE (A. Zimmerman ed., 2008), was filed as PML 705. 177reactive; they try to capture electrons from other molecules to restore their stability and balance. Tr. at 2168. If a free radical encounters a lipid464 containing a hydrogen atom, it will extract the hydrogen atom from the lipid. The lipid then becomes a free radical with an unpaired electron. Tr. at 2168. T he lipid radical will immediately react with oxygen in the body, but it will still have an unpair ed electron, and thus remains a radical. If it oxidizes another lipid to restore its ow n balance, it creates yet another free radical lipid. Tr. at 2169; Res. Tr. Ex. 6, slide 5 (illustrating the chain reaction). This chain reaction process continues until it is termi nated by an antioxidant molecule donating an electron, a process called reduction. Tr. at 2169. Antioxidant molecules can donate an electron without becoming highly reactive them selves, stopping the chain reaction. Tr. at 2169-70. The state of natural balanc e between oxidation and reduction (redox) is called homeostasis.465 Tr. at 3900. b. Sources of Free Radicals. Free radicals are produced by the simple act of breathing, because about 1% of the air that we breathe is converted to hydrogen peroxide.466 Tr. at 518-20, 2702-04. In the process of creating ATP molecules,467 mitochondria, subcellular organelles present in every cell of the body, also release hy drogen peroxide. Tr. at 521. The innate immune system also produces ROS as a defense against invading microorganisms; microglial cells in the brain perform the sa me function and also release ROS. Tr. at 511-12; see also Tr. at 2191. c. Oxidative Stress and Oxidative Damage. There is a distinction among oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and oxidative damage with adverse consequences, although they are on the same continuum. Tr. at 2172, 2193, 2195-96. Oxidative stress is defi ned as an imbalance in the cell in favor of oxidation, and is a normal part of human met abolism. It can be the cause or the effect of an injury. Exposure to infectious agent s, bruising, and exercise may all cause oxidative stress. In the brain, oxidativ e stress may be produced by a brain disease or by a traumatic brain injury. Oxidative st ress is a normal part of human metabolism, and 464 A lipid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid. Res. Tr. Ex. 6, slide 5; D ORLAND 'S at 1055. 465 DORLAND 'S at 859. 466 Hydrogen peroxide is one type of reactive oxygen, which are collectively referred to as \"ROS\"-reactive oxygen species. These ROS can attack and damage other cells, in addition to invading pathogens. Tr. at 521. 467 \"ATP\" stands for adenosine triphosphate, the body's primary energy source. D ORLAND 'S at 30; Tr. at 2788. Although ATP can be produced in other ways, mitochondria act as energy factories and arethe main source for ATP. Tr. at 530; see also PML 713, at 4. 178the human body has evolved a battery of protective mechanisms to deal with it.468 Tr. at 606, 614, 2170-71, 2174-75. Oxidative st ress can be beneficial, because a modest degree of it upregulates antioxidant defenses, ma king them available to combat further oxidative activity. Tr. at 2170-72. Normally , the body senses when its redox status is altered, and responds to oxidation by synt hesizing more antioxidant enzymes. Tr. at 2172-73. Some degree of oxidative damage is normal; runaway oxidative damage is not. Tr. at 2196. When oxidative stress is causal of an injury, it is referred to aspathological. See, e.g. , Tr. at 2761. Oxidative damage is found in neurodegenerative diseases occurring later in life, such as Al zheimer's and Parkinson's disorders, but the precise role oxidative damage plays in such disorders is not established. See generally Tr. at 523, 2174, 2189, 2493. 2. Sulfur Metabolism and Oxidation. a. Natural Responses to Oxidative Stress. The human body has evolved sophisticated mechanisms for dealing with both naturally occurring levels of oxidative stress and the increased oxidative stress produced by disease or injury. Tr. at 614, 2171-72, 2174-75. Glutathione [\"GSH\"], a small peptide present and synthesized in every cell of the body, is the body's primary antioxidant defense mechanism. Tr. at 2701-02, in prot ecting against oxidative stress ( see Hansen, Pet. Tr. Ex. 6, at 138; 469 Tr. at 2761), but many other antioxidant s also exist in the body. Tr. at 2761. b. Glutathione. Glutathione is a thiol, a sulfur-containing compound,470 and the most abundant thiol in the body.471 Tr. at 2699-2700. It is composed of three amino acids: 468 Doctor Deth conceded that the human body has numerous compensatory mechanisms for dealing with oxidative stress. Tr. at 614. 469 J. Hansen, et al., Differential oxidation of thioredoxin-1, thioredoxin-2, and glutathione by metal ions, FREE RADICAL BIO. & MED. 40: 138-45 (2006) [\"Hansen\"], filed as Pet. Tr. Ex. 6. Doctor Jones was the senior researcher on this study. 470 Sulfur is the fifth most abundant element in biological systems. Nearly all life on earth depends upon sulfur. Tr. at 2699. A thiol is often represented in scientific nomenclature as \"-SH.\" See Rose, PML 430, at 90. 471 Doctor Deth testified that the normal concentration of glutathione in a cell is 10 millimolar, which is roughly equivalent to the amount of sodium present in cells and bodily fluids. Tr. at 507-08. Doctor Jones offered more nuanced testimony, explaini ng that cellular concentrations of glutathione vary, based on the cell type. It is present at 10 millimolar in the liver and kidneys, but red blood cells and smallintestine cells in a fasting state have much less, only 0.2 and 0.1 millimolar, respectively. Tr. at 2705. 179glutamate,472 cysteine, and glycine, with cysteine in t he middle. Tr. at 506-07, 523-24. In a reduced state, the sulfur in a thiol has one hydrogen atom attached. Tr. at 504, 506. When two thiols both have their hydr ogen atoms removed through oxidation, the sulfur atoms join together to create a disulfide, or an oxidiz ed form of the thiol. Tr. at 506. When a glutathione [\"GSH\"] molecule is oxidized, it loses a hydrogen atom, becoming \"GS.\" Two oxidized glutathione molecules will combine, creating oxidized disulfide glutathione [\"G SSG\"]. Tr. at 2176. Deth's experiments involv ed mercury's interference with cysteine transportation and production. Cells obtain cystei ne from extracellular sources, with the cysteine transported across the cell membrane; they also obtain it intracellularly, through transsulfuration473 of homocysteine.474 Deth, PML 563, at 191; Tr. at 524. Cysteine's oxidized form is cystine. James 2005, PML 7, at 2. The cysteine component of glutathione contains the thiol group to which mercury475 and other heavy metals bind when glutathione detoxifies heavy metals . James 2005, PML 7, at 2. d. Glutathione's Functions. Glutathione has three major detoxificat ion functions within the human body as: 472 Glutamate is the substance Dr. Kinsbourne identif ied as responsible for brain overexcitation in his hypothesis, discussed in Section VIII below. 473 There was a great deal of testimony, primarily from Dr. Deth, regarding the transsulfuration process by which glutathione and other amino acids are created. To summarize and simplify his complexand sometimes confusing testimony, I note that the transsulfuration pathway is an intracellular process inwhich homocysteine, an amino acid, is converted to cy stathionine, which in turn is converted to cysteine, which is converted to glutathione. See James 2005, PML 7, at 2 and Fig. 1. 474 A third source, protein catabolism, was not implicated by Dr. Deth's causation hypothesis. Deth, PML 563, at 192. 475 There are two states for mercury, bound and free. Tr. at 3925. Free mercury, in the form of mercury ions, is the mercury available to form compounds; bound mercury has already formed a compound with another molecule or element. Mercury binds easily to sulfur compounds because theelectrons in mercury's outer ring easily replace t he hydrogen atoms in thiols, creating a strong bond called a mercaptan. Tr. at 499-501. However, virtually any heavy metal, not just mercury, will bond to any thiol. Tr. at 2709. Mercury preferentially binds to serum albumin, rather than the thiols present in red bloodcells. See Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 635. The toxicity of mercury may stem from its ability to form stable compounds with sulfur molecules. C. Carvalho, et al., Inhibition of the Human Thioredoxin System: A Molecular Mechanism of Mercury Toxicity , J. BIOL. CHEM. 283(18): 11913-23 (2008) [\"Carvalho\"], filed as Pet. Tr. Ex. 7, at 11913. The bi nding of mercury to a thiol permits methylmercury to pass the blood brain barrier and enter the brain. See id. at 11913. 180(1) an anti-carcinogen;476 (2) an antioxidant; and (3) a co-enzyme for metabolism.477 Tr. at 2701-03; Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 3. S ubstantial testimony concerned glutathione's antioxidant role, which involves eliminating r eactive chemicals, including ROS, as part of the body's primary defense against oxidat ive stress. Tr. at 504, 507, 2701-02. Glutathione eliminates most of the hy drogen peroxide produced in the body. Tr. at 2702-03; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 4 (left center box). There are natural variati ons in glutathione content,478 and a large number of reactions in which glutathione is involved. These mechanisms have evolved to work despite fluctuations in glutathione content, and despite the simultaneous nature of these many reactions. Tr. at 2704-05. e. Glutathione Production in the Brain. Doctor Deth's hypothesis and experiments fo cus on oxidative stress in the brain, and the effect of mercury on glutathione, t he primary antioxidant. Although most cells can manufacture cysteine, the precursor to glutathione, astrocytes and neurons cannot. Astrocytes are dependent on cyst eine produced in the liver 479 for their synthesis of glutathione. Once produced, cysteine is circul ated in the plasma, where it is oxidized to cystine. James 2005, PML 7, at 2 and Fig.1. Cystine is taken up by astrocytes, which convert it to glutathione. Tr. at 509. Astrocytes produce more glutathione than they need, and export the excess into the area around neurons.480 In this extra-cellular environment, glutathione is converted back in to cysteine, which is taken up into neurons by a transporter molecule. Neurons use the cysteine to make their own glutathione. Tr. at 509-10; see also James 2005, PML 7, at 2. Thus, astrocytes control the amount of 476 Glutathione is the most important anti-ca rcinogenic chemical in the body, forming part of numerous anti-carcinogenic compounds. Tr. at 2702-04; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 4 (right side boxes). 477 An example of glutathione's coenzymatic acti vity concerns the elimination of formaldehyde through a catalytic reaction. An extensive list of other coenzymatic uses for glutathione is provided on Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 4, in the center bottom box. Tr. at 2704. 478 In a peer reviewed study performed by Dr. Jones' laboratory, the glutathione levels in the adults tested varied by 25-30%, depending on the time of day, producing changes in redox status (the GSH/GSSG ratio). Tr. at 2715-17. Doctor Jones did not identify the study by name or citation. 479 This process involves the production of glutathione in the liver. Glutathione enters the bloodstream, where it breaks down into cysteine and cy steinylglycine. The cysteine is oxidized into cystine, and in that form passes the blood brain barrier. James 2005, PML 7, at 2; see also Tr. at 509 (Dr. Deth discussing this cycle in more detail); Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 4. 480 The process of taking up and exporting chemicals from a cell is accomplished through transporters or antiporters on the cell membrane. Transporters may be unique to a specific class of aminoacids or other molecules. Antiporters exchange an amino acid outside the cell membrane for a differentamino acid on the inside of a cell. See generally Tr. at 510-11, 547, 2749. 181cysteine available to the neurons, and ultimate ly, the amount of gl utathione that neurons can produce. Tr. at 510; see also James 2005, PML 7, at 2. f. Homocysteine, the Methioni ne-Methylation Cycle, and the Transsulfuration Pathway. Doctor Deth testified at some length about the transsulfuration pathway and the methionine-methylation cycle, and the pivota l role he believes that homocysteine plays in these two metabolic processes. The James 2005 paper, PML 7, at 12, contains a diagram of these two processes at Fig. 1; a simplified version follows: (1) The Methionine-Methylation Cycle. The methionine-methylation cycle begins with the sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine. All proteins, which constitu te about 20% of the human body, contain methionine.481 Tr. at 2699. Methionine is obtained ei ther from dietary sources or as the result of recycling from homocysteine. See Tr. at 526, 2752-53. Within the methylation cycle, methionine is activated by well. Tr. at 2699. 182adenosylmethionine [\"SAM\"].482 SAM donates a methyl group to produce methylated products for DNA,483 proteins, phospholipids,484 and neurotransmitters.485 James 2005, PML 7, at 2 and Fig. 1; James 2004, PML 5, at 1611-12. In the process of donating the methyl group, SAM is converted to S-adeno sylhomocysteine [\"SAH\"]. SAH is thereafter synthesized into homocysteine. James 2005, PML 7, at 2 and Fig. 1; Tr. at 516, 525; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 8. Thereafter, hom ocysteine either enters the transsulfuration pathway or is remethylated by methionine synthase486 as one source of methionine. James 2004, PML 5, at 1612. (2) The Transsulfuration Pathway. Homocysteine production begins with the amino acid methionine and other essential amino acids present in the diet. Tr. at 525. Once homocysteine is created, it may enter the transsulfuration pathway to make cystathionine, which is converted to cysteine, which is in turn converted to gl utathione. Alternatively, homocysteine may be recycled into methionine via the action of methionine synthase. See James 2005, PML 7, at 2 and Fig. 1. This transsulfuration process is a one way street for homocysteine; if it enters the transsulfuration pathway, it is irreversibly removed from the methionine cycle. James 2006, PML 49, at 948. Doctor Deth testified that there are multiple mechanisms that control the flow of homocysteine toward or away from the transsulfuration pathway. Tr. at 571-72. C. Doctor Deth's Views Regarding Mercur y, Methylation, and Oxidative Stress. 1. Overview of Matters in Dispute.The information regarding the transsu lfuration pathway and methionine- methylation cycle presented above did not appear to be in dispute. However, Dr. Deth presented additional testimony about homocystei ne, the transsulfuration pathway, and 482 SAM is also a sulfur-containing amino acid. Tr. at 515. 483 Methylation of DNA is the process by which genes are turned on or off. The failure of a gene to be turned on (\"expressed\") during development can have significant consequences. Tr. at 516-17. This happens in conjunction with another set of proteins in volved with DNA, called histones. DNA methylation and histone methylation are involved in gene silencing, or the epigenetic regulation of genes. Tr. at 517. Interference with DNA methylation as a result of problems with methionine synthase activity was part of the mechanism of injury Dr. Deth postulated as causal of ASD, discussed below. See generally Rodenhiser and Mann, PML 459 (explaining DNA and histone methylation). 484 Phospholipids are phosphorus-containing lipids and are the major form of lipid in cell membranes. D ORLAND 'S at 1428. 485 Neurotransmitters are methylated to te rminate their activity. Tr. at 517-18. 486 This involves the transfer of a methyl group from methylfolate (which is produced in an ancillary metabolic process) to homocysteine via methionine synthase. James 2004, PML 5, at 1611. 183the methionine-methylation cycle that Dr. Jones testified was incorrect or for which there was insufficient evidence. I set forth Dr. Deth's views first, followed by Dr. Jones' criticisms of those views. To summarize Dr. Deth's views, mercury depletes glutathione levels.487 Decreased glutathione causes increased ox idative stress because there is less glutathione available to combat it. Oxi dative stress turns off methionine synthase activity, resulting in the production of less methionine. PML 713 at 5. Lowered methionine levels result in reduced SAM production, which means there are fewer methylated products available for DNA meth ylation, which affects gene expression. Impairments in gene expression can produce autistic symptoms. PML 713 at 5-6. Reduction in methionine synthase activity affects D4 dopamine488 receptor on neuronal cells, adversely affecting neuronal signaling ability, resulting in lesssynchronization for neuronal activity. Accord ing to Dr. Deth, the effect on dopamine receptor activity can produce aut istic symptoms. PML 713 at 5. Both the dopamine receptor effects and reduced gene expression would be enhanced in children with mercury hypersusceptib ility because smaller levels of mercury would affect them more. Likewise, childr en with a genetic predisposition to oxidative stress would be more affected by additional incr eases in oxidative stress levels. Tr. at 3900-01. In his report, his article on autism, meth ylation, and oxidative stress (PML 563), and in much of his testimony, Dr. Deth focused on how these purported effects of mercury on DNA methylation and dopamine re ceptors caused or contributed to ASD. However, in the more recent experiment s, and in his rebuttal testimony, Dr. Deth appeared to shift his focus to the persistence of mercury in the brain. In addition to the effects on methylation activity, Dr. De th opined that mercury blocked cysteine transporters, and thus affected the ability of neurons to acquire sufficient cysteine for production of the amount of glutathione needed. This effect was enhanced in human brains because neurons lacked the capability to use methionine synthase. As heexplained, mercury in the brain stresses ce lls, affecting their redox status, but also 487 The fact that mercury binds to glutathione as part of the body's process for detoxifying mercury is not in dispute. See Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 627 (discussing the binding of mercury to glutathione before elimination in the feces). Whet her vaccine-level amounts of mercury can materially affect glutathione levels is addressed below. 488 Dopamine is manufactured by nerve cells. About 80% of nerve cells use dopamine to communicate with other cells. Tr. at 1986. A dopamine nerve cell fires when electrically excited, releasinga small amount of dopamine. After release, the dopamine binds to proteins called dopamine receptors located on cell membranes. Tr. at 1987. There are two families of these receptors, the D1 family(consisting of the D1 and D5 receptors) and the D2 family (consisting of the D2, D3, and D4 receptors). Tr. at 1987-88. 184interferes with the process by which normal redox status is restored. Tr. at 3916-17. Neurons with depleted glutathione levels cannot maintain homeostasis, resulting in a state of oxidative stress manifesting as the neuroinflammation described by the Vargas study, PML 69. Tr. at 571, 655. He equated inflammation to oxidative stress, representing evidence of oxidativ e injury. Tr. at 655, 3912-13. Doctor Deth relied on the Waly study, as well as several unpublished experiments performed in his own laborator y to support the hypotheses he advanced. Additionally, he relied on his discovery concer ning an extracellular methylation process involving a receptor for the neurotrans mitter dopamine, and the purported inability of human neurons to use methionine synthase in their methionine-methylation cycle. Doctor Deth's views of dopamine receptor methylation and neuronal disabilities shaped much of his research and the conclusions he drew therefrom. Doctor Mailman, an expert on dopamine receptors, challenged this receptor \"discovery\" and both Drs. Jones and Brent testified that the methionine syn thase deficiency was one peculiar to the neuroblastoma cells Dr. Deth used and was not a deficiency in human neurons. These issues affected the reliability of t he causation opinions he proffered. They also influence the weight I have accorded to Dr. Deth's laboratory's experiments and conclusions that he and his research team drew therefrom. Although Dr. Deth's testimony was superficially coherent, the def ects pointed out by true experts revealed the critical flaws in Dr. Deth's presentat ion, and, ultimately established that his hypothesis of causation was not reliable. 2. Disputes Regarding Control of the Methionine-Methylation Cycle. a. Doctor Deth's Assertions. Doctor Deth explained that methioni ne synthase is extremely sensitive to oxidative stress.489 Tr. at 535; PML 563 at 191. W hen oxidized, cobalamin stops the process by which methionine synthase converts homocysteine into methionine. Tr. at540. Less methionine means less SAM is produced, leading eventually to lowerproduction of homocysteine, and lowe r levels of glutathione. See Tr. at 541; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 15. 489 The mechanism for this sensitivity involved a fairly convoluted explanation. Doctor Deth testified that methionine synthase has five distinct parts or \"domains\": homocysteine, methylfolate, cobalamin, SAM, and \"CAP\" domains. Tr. at 537-39; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 14. At the heart of thecobalamin domain is a cobalt atom. Homocysteine is converted to methionine by the methylfolate group transferring a methyl group to the cobalt atom thr ough methionine synthase, creating methylcobalamin. Methylcobalamin then transfers the methyl group to hom ocysteine, which creates methionine. This cycle continues unless interrupted by oxidation. Tr. at 538- 39. The portion of methionine synthase that is most easily oxidized is cobalamin's cobalt atom, which acts as an oxygen sensor. Tr. at 539. According to Dr. Deth, oxidized cobalamin stops methionine synthase from reacting with homocysteine because the methyl group cannot be transferred from methylfolate to oxidized cobalamin, and, thus, no methylcobalamin iscreated. The \"CAP\" domain limits oxidation of cobalamin, but it is not present in all cells. Tr. at 539-40. 185When the redox environment improves, ox idized cobalamin is repaired by SAM, but glutathione is necessary to produce methylcobalamin,490 the substance used by SAM to repair the oxidized cobalamin. See Tr. at 541; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 16. Doctor Deth called methylcobalamin synthesis \"glu tathione-dependent.\" Tr. at 541. According to Dr. Deth, glutathione ultimately contro ls the methionine-methylation cycle because it controls whether methionine synthase is turned on or off. Tr. at 557. If methionine synthase is not present or is turned off, homocysteine is involved only in glutathione production, not the methi onine cycle. Doctor Deth called this a \"switch mechanism.\" Tr. at 526. When me thionine synthase activity is inhibited by oxidative stress, methylation activity wit hin the cell is inhibited, causing reduced methylation of homocysteine, phospholipid s, and DNA. Decreased DNA methylation increases the expression of certain genes, including genes that promote DNA and glutathione synthesis. Deth, PM L 563, at 193; Tr. at 534-35. b. Doctor Jones' Views. Doctor Jones disagreed with Dr. Deth's explanation about glutathione's role in regulating methionine synthase and thereby regulating the methionine-methylation cycle. He testified that t he oxidative pathway is controlled by dietary methionine, not glutathione. Tr. at 2752-53. He also testified that Dr. Deth's hypothesis about glutathione's effect on methionine synt hase was incorrect. Tr. at 2757. As Dr. Jones noted, an essential part of Dr. Deth's hypothesis about mercury's effects is that glutathione determines whic h of the two pathways homocysteine takes. Tr. at 2752. According to Dr. Jones, the scientific literature491 establishes that the degradative or oxidative pathway is actua lly controlled by the amount of dietary methionine. Tr. at 2752. If there is an ex cess amount of methionine in the diet, the system works to stimulate the degradative or oxidative pathway to degrade (get rid of) the excess methionine by transforming it in to homocysteine and eventually glutathione. Tr. at 2753. Another point established by the scientific literature is that SAM regulates two enzymes. One of these enzymes, not glut athione, determines whether homocysteine is degraded or recycled. Tr. at 2753-54. As summa rized on Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 25, \"the scientific evidence does not support regulati on of trans[s]ulfuration in response to downstream effects of [glutathione], but ra ther to control by methionine and SAM.\" 490 Doctor Deth's slides and testimony used the terms methylcobalamin, vitamin B-12, and methyl B-12 interchangeably. For consistency, I use the term methylcobalamin. 491 The Rodenhiser and Mann article, PML 459, at 343 supports Dr. Jones' position (the methyl groups used in DNA methylation \"are acquired thr ough the diet and are donated to DNA through the folate and methionine pathways\"). 186c. Resolution. I accept the testimony of Dr. Jones as correct. Not only did Dr. Jones possess far greater expertise than Dr. Deth in the areas of cellular methylation and oxidative stress, but also Dr. Jones' explanation of t he control mechanism was, unlike Dr. Deth's, logical. Doctor Deth's explanation of how oxidative stress affects cellular metabolism had internal inconsistencies492 and would result in the process winding down due to an insufficiency of homocysteine. Under his view of the process, lower glutathione levels caused by oxidative stress would reduce methionine levels, which would result in lesshomocysteine available to produce glutathione. Tr. at 535. This view may account for his statement that the effect of mercury is stoichiometric. 493 See Tr. at 3896. However, the cycle does not wind down under conditions of oxidative stress because, as Dr. Jones pointed out, dietary sour ces of methionine inject methionine into the cycle at a point before the methylati on process that produces, not only cellular methylation products via SAM, but homocysteine as well. Other reasons for rejecting his views of cellular metabolism are discussed below. 3. Doctor Deth's Assertions Regar ding Dopamine Receptor Methylation and Human Neurons. a. The D4 Receptor Methylation Hypothesis. Doctor Deth testified that, in the course of his research involving cardiovascular systems, he discovered that the D4 receptor494 for the neurotransmitter dopamine has its own methylation cycle.495 Tr. at 528. All other methylation cycles occur inside the 492 On one hand, Dr. Deth asserted that oxidative stress triggers increased glutathione production, because homocysteine is diverted into transsulfurati on because methionine synthase is turned off. Tr. at 535. On the other, he testified that \"what we should expect to see during oxidative stress is [too] little glutathione, associated with [the] lower activity of the methylation pathways.\" Tr. at 537. 493 He did not explain what he meant by this c oncept, which is defined as \"the study of numerical relationships of chemical elements and compounds and the mathematical laws of chemical changes; the mathematics of chemistry.\" D ORLAND 'S at 1763. 494 Receptors are proteins located on cell membranes that recognize and bind to certain chemicals. Tr. at 1987. Dopamine receptors recogni ze dopamine, as well as other chemicals. Tr. at 1997. However, dopamine will also bind to other receptors, including those for similar chemical families,such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Tr. at 1997. Not all cells have a D4-type dopamine receptor, but such receptors are present in most neuronal cells, and, in particular, in the \"GABA-ergic\" or inhibitoryneurons. Tr. at 528-29. See also Tr. at 803 for testimony from Dr. Kinsbourne about GABA-ergic receptors, such as the D4 receptor. 495 See also Waly, PML 257, at 359. All three of the studies cited in the Waly article for the proposition that a separate D4 dopamine receptor methylat ion cycle exists are studies from Dr. Deth's own laboratory. See Waly, PML 257, at 359, 368 n.15-17. Two of the three studies cited were filed as exhibits: 187cell; this was the first instance ever found of regulation of methionine synthase. Waly, 527-28. Dopamine's role as a neurotransmitter suggested to him that interf erence with methylation activity in the D4 receptor might play a role in brain d ysfunction because disruption of neurotransmitter functions would impact attention and awareness.496 Tr. at 531-34. Determining why nature allows \"this one receptor, and only th is one dopamine receptor, to carry out a methylation activity\" prompted his research. Tr. at 528. Because methylation is necessary for dopamine receptors to synchronize the firing of neural networks in the brain (Tr. at 522), Dr. Deth hypothesized that disruptions of the methylation cycle by an environment al trigger would interfere with normal neuronal functioning.497 The \"environmental trigger\" dovetailed neatly into Dr. Deth's hypothesis that the D4 receptor could be affected by oxidative stress caused by neurotoxins such as mercury. Deth, PML 563, at 193-94. He testified that impaired methylation results in \"impaired attention, impaired gamma synchronization, as well as problems during development with inappropriate gene expression.\" Tr. at 535. He extrapolated from the connection between a D4 polymorphism and ADHD to suggest that a similar mechanism was responsible for autism.498 See Tr. at 495. Doctor Deth testified that the D4 recept or has a methionine molecule sticking out from the cell's surface. Dopamine reaching the D4 receptor activates this methionine molecule, causing it to give up its methyl group to the phospholipids on the cellmembrane, making the membrane more fluid. Tr. at 527, 529, 531-32. In cells other than human neurons, methionine synthase is t hen reactivated by a methyl group from SAM. Tr. at 527-28; PML 713 at 5. b. Defects in Human Neuronal Cells. Based on research in his laboratory, Dr . Deth asserted that human neurons are A. Sharma, et al., D4 dopamine receptor-mediated phospholipid methylation and its implications for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia , MOL. PSYCHIATRY 4: 235-46 (1999) [\"Sharma\"], filed as PML 152; R. Zhao, et al., Relationship between dopamine-stimulated phospho filed as PML 151. The third study, which was not filed as an exhibit, also had Sharma as the prim ary author. Doctor Deth was listed as the senior researcher on the two articles filed. 496 Sharma, PML 152, suggests such a role in mental illnesses. 497 See T. Demiralp, et al., DRD4 and DAT1 Polymorphisms Modulate Human Gamma Band Responses , CEREBRAL CORTEX 17: 1007-19 (2007), filed as PML 143. This study found that a genetic variant in the D4 dopamine receptor is a risk factor for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [\"ADHD\"], increasing the risk of ADHD by three to five times. Doctor Deth testified that the polymorphism, combinedwith an environmental risk factor or trigger, results in ADHD. Tr. at 532-34. 498 However, the Deth paper, PML 563, at 194, noted that the polymorphism involved in ADHD is not increased in autism. 188incapable of reactivating methionine thr ough SAM's donation of a methyl group, and must rely on glutathione to reactivate methionine synthase through synthesis ofmethylcobalamin. see also Tr. at 528; PML Thus, the availability of glutathione to reactivate methionine synthase affects all cellular methylation processes in the brain. If Dr. Deth's assertion is accurate, the inability of human neurons to activate methionine synthase other than through glut athione would make brain methylation processes highly dependent on glutathione levels . However, Dr. Deth's laboratory supplied the only evidence that human neurons are incapable of reactivating methionine synthase, from experiments on rat br ains and on \"human neuronal cells.\" See Tr. at 541-42. Although his experiments were conduc ted upon what he described as human neuronal cells, Dr. Deth actually used human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells).They were not human neurons (brain at 2205-07, 3935-36; Waly, PML 257, at 359. The distinction is significant becaus e the cells used have differences from human neurons that cast considerable doubt on whether his experimental results, even if valid, can be ascribed to effects on human neurons in vitro , much less in vivo . Defects in these neuroblastoma tumor cells also affect the assertion that neurons cannotreactivate methionine synthase. c. The Waly Study, PML 257. The Waly study examined the effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 [\"IGF-1\"] 499 and dopamine on methionine synthase activity. Doctor Deth claimed the results supported his hypothesis concerning the dopamine receptor methylation cycle and defects in human neurons. See PML 713 at 5. The first part of the study measured phospholipid methylation and DNA methylation activity in cultured cells at a basal rate.500 The basal measurements were then compared to the activity after the cells were incubated with either dopamine or IGF-1. Tr. at 564-65; Waly, PML 257, phospholipid methylation. Wa ly, PML 257, at 360. To confirm the D4 receptor involvement in this process, cell membrane proteins were separated and radiolabeled. A single protein corresponding to the D4 receptor was identified using gel electrophoresis. Id. at 361. The authors therefore concluded that Deth testified that this is a growth factor \"which acts similar to other brain growth factors, neuronal growth factor, brain derived growth factor, and stimulates the signaling pathway that activates the cysteine uptake.\" Tr. at 565. 500 \"Basal rate\" indicates measurements taken in the cellular culture with nothing added to the cells. See DORLAND 'S at 202. 189IGF-1 also stimulated an increase in folate-dependent phospholipid methylation. It increased methionine basal level. Waly, PML 257,at 360. Similar effects on DNA methylati on were observed, with a six-hour exposure to IGF-1 increasing DNA methylation by more than and it by 41%. Waly, with Dr. Deth's \"Discoveries\" and the Waly Study. a. Dopamine Receptors and t he Separate Methylation Cycle. Doctor Mailman, an expert on dopamine receptors ( see Tr. at 1977), identified a number of problems with Dr. Deth's assertions regarding dopamine, dopamine receptors, the postulated presence of an ex tracellular methylation cycle, and the Waly study. In general, he described it as a poor study and one he would not haverecommended for publication. Tr. at 1999. (1) No Evidence for Methionine Synthase at the D4 Receptor. In summary, Dr. Mailman testified that the only data demonstrating that the D4 dopamine receptor has a separate methylati on cycle came from Dr. Deth's laboratory and the papers containing that data did not in clude information sufficient to establish that the cycle actually exists. Tr. at 2029. He testified that the D4 receptor does not contain methionine synthase nor any remnant of methionine synthase. Tr. at 2018. Also, there was no evidence that methionine synthase directly interacts with the D4 receptor, that methylation changes the physical properties of cell membranes, or that the type of methyl group transfers described by Dr. Deth actually happen at the D4 receptor. Tr. at 1990-91. (2) Lack of Appropriate Experimental Controls. Doctor Mailman described the Waly study as \"poorly controlled, even by Dr. Deth's own standards.\" 501 Tr. at 2015. Dopamine will, at various concentrations, bind to any dopamine receptor, as well as to receptors for other neurotransmitters such asserotonin. The neuroblastoma cell line used has other receptors for dopamine andserotonin; thus the need to use antagonists 502 to block receptors other than the D4 501 The reference to Dr. Deth's own standards stems from other research done by his laboratory that employed appropriate controls. Tr. at 1997; Res. Tr. Ex. 5, slide 23. 502 \"Antagonist\" is used to describe a compound that binds to a receptor, blocking its action and preventing other drugs or compounds from turning it on. Tr. at 1996. 190receptor should have been obvious.503 Tr. at 1997. Also, the Waly study used an antagonist that is known to bind to more than a dozen different receptors as an experimental control, rather than using a more selective antagonist, as Dr. Deth's laboratory did in earlier work. The Waly study used only dopamine as an agonist504 in examining effects, and used only one antagonist. Tr. at 1996-97. These failuresmarkedly weaken the Waly study's conclusi ons. Tr. at 1997, 2014-16; Res. Tr. Ex. 5, slide 23. Doctor Johnson echoed Dr. Mailman' s comments, noting that the study failed to use selective inhibitors to knock out or target the specific proteins being studied. See Tr. at 2220-21. (3) The Biology of the D4 Dopamine Receptors. The Waly study attempted to prove that the D4 receptor was responsible for phospholipid methylation. However, the researchers failed to determine which ofseveral different forms of the D4 receptor were present in the cells studied. The antibodies they used in the process combi ne with several related proteins, making the conclusion that the gel electrophoresis actua lly measured activity in a D4 receptor highly suspect. Tr. at 1998; Res. Tr. Ex. 5, slide 24. b. Neuroblastoma Cells, Human Neurons, and Methionine Synthase. (1) Drawing Conclusions from Poor Experimental Design. Doctor Mailman explained that an experim ental model should be selected based on how it will produce information relevant to the questions being addressed by thestudy. Tr. at 1994. To adequately test Dr. Deth's hypothesis under appropriate scientific standards, the experiment s hould have been performed on cultured brain neurons. Tr. at 1995. The failure to do so fu rther weakens Dr. Deth's conclusions. Tr. at 1995-96. Doctor Johnson buttressed Dr. Mailman' s critical comments about the use of neuroblastoma cells and the conclusions draw n from these cells' responses. Tr. at 503 Doctor Mailman also pointed out that Dr. Deth's hypothesis failed to account for the large number of signaling mechanisms involved with the D4 receptor and related receptors. Tr. at 1992. Henoted that the receptors omitted from Dr. Deth's diagram of the D4 receptor interact with dozens ofproteins, including what are called scaffolding proteins , signaling molecules, and other receptors. Tr. at 1991-92. In evaluating the effects of a single compound on a receptor, the researcher must consider all of these interactions. Doctor Deth did not do so. Tr. at 1992-93; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 5, slide 19 (reflecting the abundant variety of signaling mechanisms involved in the D4 receptor). Doctor Deth's study designdid not account for the known interactions of the D4 receptors with other classes of receptors throughoutthe brain. See Tr. at 2001-02. If thimerosal were having an effect on the D4 receptor, it would affect a number of other pathways, and there is no evidence that it does. Tr. at 2001. 504 Pharmacologists use the term \"agonist\" to describe a drug that binds to a receptor and turns it on. Tr. at 1996. 1912219-20. Because the Waly researcher s used a cell line derived from peripheral neuronal tumors, their results do not reflect what would happen in normal neurons. Tr.at 2219-20. Doctor Mailman also criticized the study for using only one type of cell, thus limiting any conclusions to that cell type. Given that Dr. Deth's laboratory has used multiple cell lines in past studies, the res earchers were clearly aware of the value of parallel studies. Tr. at 1995. (2) Neurons and the Purported Methionine Synthase Deficiency. Doctor Johnson, an expert on neurodegenerativ e diseases, pointed out that Dr. Deth's assertion that human neurons cannot use SAM to reactivate methioninesynthase was based on his experiments with neuroblastoma cells. Those cells are mutated and do not have the same type of methionine synthase found in normal cells,including astrocytes and neurons. Tr. at 2219. As one of the principal purposes of the Waly study was to determine effects on methionine synthase activity, the use of cellswith an abnormal form of methionine synthas e presented a significant problem. Although the precise impact of the methioni ne synthase mutation on the Waly study's results cannot be determined, the mutation r enders their results even less applicable to what happens in vivo than most in vitro studies. Tr. at 2219-20. Doctor Brent buttressed Dr. Johnson's te stimony that these neuroblastoma cells are defective in methionine synthase, un like normal human neurons. Tr. at 1827-28. He testified that conclusions drawn from experiments on methionine synthase activity in neuroblastoma cell lines cannot be used to draw conclusions about human brains. Tr.at 1827-28. c. Conclusion. The discovery of an extracellular methyl ation cycle, when all other methylation cycles take place inside cells, is so highly unusual that it warrants independentconfirmation. That confirmation is lacking. The assertion in the Waly study that the D4 receptor was the site of the methylation ac tivity was based on gel electrophoresis, but a critical failure in that process was noted by Dr. Mailman. In view of Dr. Mailman's many publications on dopamine receptors, his test imony regarding them carries exceptional weight. As Dr. Deth had not conducted studies on human brain cells, other than his unpublished work discussed below, his testim ony that human neurons lack the ability to use SAM to reactivate methionine synthase lacks scientific support. He based hisfindings on experiments conducted on cells with a known methionine synthase mutation. In summary, Dr. Deth and his colleagues designed an experiment around two 192faulty premises: the existence of the only extracellular methylation cycle, and a purported defect in human neuronal cells . In view of these problems, and the other issues noted by Drs. Jones and Mailman, any conclusions drawn from the first part of the Waly study are so unreliable as to render its evidentiary value virtually nil. D. Mercury's Effects on Cell Metabolism. 1. Overview.Doctor Deth asserted that mercury would stress cells to a more oxidized level. Tr. at 3915-16. For mercury to cause neurologi cal symptoms, it must be present in the brain. However, Dr. Deth was unable to st ate how much mercury in the brain would be necessary to cause effects on sulfur met abolism. Tr. at 622-23. He contended that small effects might be demonstrated from levels as low as 1 nM of mercury in the brain, but he \"guess[ed] it would be the administr ation of equivalent concentrations that produce 30 nanomolar\" as, based on the monkey studies, human brain levels are in that same range. Tr. at 624. Thus, he \"woul d guess that in the range of 10 to 100 nanomolar, in that range, would be sufficient to cause a loss of function.\" He emphasized that this was not based on an ex perimental measurement. Tr. at 624-25. He acknowledged that most mercury in t he brain would be chemically bonded to other molecules and, based on the strength of the bonds formed by mercury with many substances, these bonds would be unlikely to break. Only mercury in free form wouldbe available to react with other cells, and that amount in the brain was unknown and likely to be low. Tr. at 625-27. Most of Dr. Deth's opinions about how mercury affects cellular metabolism are derived from the second part of the Waly st udy and from a series of other experiments in his own laboratory. On May 13, 2008, during the Theory 2 general causation hearing, much of Dr. Deth's research was disclos ed to the court and respondent for the first time. 505 Building on the findings of the Waly study, and using the same type of neuroblastoma cells,506 Dr. Deth and his colleagues developed a series of experiments 505 Doctor Deth indicated that he had finished his research on methionine synthase in November, 2007, but he did not discuss any of it in his expert report. Tr. at 561, 649-51. Although his report wasdated August 24, 2007, it was not filed in the Theory 2 cases ( Mead and King), until March 20, 2008. The data on Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slides 24, 26, 28, 31, 34, 35, and 37 were all available by November, 2007, at thelatest. Tr. at 649-51. The data appearing on slide 36 only became available a few weeks prior to Dr.Deth's testimony. Tr. at 651-52. When recalled in rebuttal, Dr. Deth testified that he and his colleaguesneeded to be \"more complete in our understanding of these changes in the sulfur metabolism that occur\"and to develop \"a more satisfying story\" before submitti ng the research results for publication. Tr. at 3907. As of August 27, 2009, the date the evidentiary reco rd was closed, no publication pertaining to these results had been filed, and, to date, there has been no request to reopen the evidentiary record. 506 Doctor Deth again referred to these cells as \"cultured human neuronal cells\" in explaining his unpublished research results. Tr. 547. As the testimony of Drs. Mailman and Johnson clearly established,this was an incorrect characterization. 193to determine how neurotoxins inhibit the ac tivity of the dopamine methylation system. Using the data presented on slides 21-28, 31, 34, and 35-37 of Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, Dr. Deth described the experiments and their results. These experiments included measurements of the effects of mercury on: (1) cysteine uptake; phospholipid methylation in lymphoblasts.507 He also presented more recent work involving comparisons of the amount of methionine synthase messenger RNA [\"mRNA\"] in brain tissue from autism pat ients to that of neurotypical controls. In discussing a study's findings and the conclusions drawn by Dr. Deth therefrom, I have also included criticisms specif ic to that study in the same section. To avoid repetition, I have included respondent's ex perts' criticisms pertaining to more than one study in Section VII.E. 2. The Waly Study, Part 2. The second part of the Waly study exami ned the inhibitory effects of ethanol and selected heavy metals on the stimulated activity of both phospholipid and DNA methylation. Doctor Deth characterized the experiments as investigating how \"several neurodevelopmental toxins...interfere with this novel mode of regulation.\" 257, at 359, 363. He used the study's findings to conclude that very small amounts of mercury could disrupt the pertinent cellular me tabolic processes, and thus contribute to oxidative stress. PML 713 at 5. The results reflected inhibitory effects from very small amounts of mercury and thimerosal. 508 Tr. at 564-65: Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 30. a. Findings. The study found an IC50 effect509 from 15 nM of methylation. Wa ly, PML 257, at 363. It also found an IC50 effect from 1 nM of thimerosal on basal, IGF-1-stimulated, and dopamine- 507 Lymphoblasts are cultured white blood cells. Tr. at 566. 508 Ethanol and lead also had significant effects on me thylation, although their effects were not as pronounced as those of mercury and thimerosal. Waly, PML 257, at 361, 363. A dose of 8.8mM (0.04%)of ethanol produced \"one of the most highly et hanol-sensitive responses reported to date.\" Id. at 361. It is significant that the Waly study found effects of both ethanol and thimerosal at doses much lower than those reported by other laboratories. See Section VII.E.2. below. 509 \"IC\" stands for \"inhibitory concentration.\" An IC50 value for a substance represents the dose at which the substance inhibits 50% of the reaction being measured. See http://goldbook.iupac.org/I03036.html (last visited Feb. 22, 2010) (based on IUPAC, C OMPENDIUM OF CHEMICAL TERMINOLOGY each reduced methionine synthase activity to a nearlyundetectable level and completely blocked the stimulatory effects of IGF-1 and dopamine. Waly, PML 257, at 363. The author s attributed these effects to an inhibition of methionine synthase activity. Waly, PML 257, at 363-64. The authors commented that mercury levels of 15 nM, about half of what they called a \"toxic exposure,\" 512 had a potent inhibitory effect on IGF-1-stimulated methylation in cultured cells. Waly, PML 257, at 367. Noting that a single TCV \"produces acute ethylmercury blood levels of 10-30 nM, and levels of 3.8-20.6 nM 3-20 days after vaccination (citing to Stajich, PML 249, for the acute exposure level,513 and Pichichero 2002, PML 223, for the later blood levels514), they commented that potent thimerosal effects were observed in their ex periment at a 1.0 nM dose. They concluded that thimerosal could, at concentrations well below the levels produced by a single vaccine, adversely affect methionine synt hase activity. Waly, PML 257, at 367. b. Conclusions. In discussing their results, the authors stated:Our studies also provide evidence that ethanol, heavy metals and the vaccine preservative thimerosal potently interfere with [methionine 510 This is an extremely small dose, a fact that figures significantly in the critical comments of respondent's experts, below. 511 Divalent copper ions were added, along with the IGF-1, based on a paper showing that the signaling activity of IGF-1 was copper-dependent. Tr. at 565. This addition of copper, and the failure toadd copper in one of the unpublished studies, figure in respondent's experts' criticisms. 512 The authors asserted that the EPA had recommended a definition of \"toxic exposure\" to mercury as a blood level of 29 nM. Waly, PML 257, at 367. The document cited in the Waly paper for thisstatement about EPA recommendations was not filed as an exhibit in this case, and thus I cannotdetermine what was meant by a \"toxic dose\" or whether the EPA recommendation pertained to anotherspecies of mercury. Of course, a blood level of mercury is not equivalent to the dose administered. 513 The Stajich study actually reported the range of blood mercury levels at 48-72 hours after vaccination. They ranged from 1.3-23.6 g/L in the preterm infants and from 1.4-2.9 g/L in the full-term infants. PML 249 at 680. 514 The Pichichero 2002 study actually measured blood mercury levels in the two-month-old infants between three and 21 days after vaccination. See PML 223, Fig. 1. Mercury concentrations were below the detection limit in five of the 17 samples from this group. In the remaining 12 samples, bloodmercury levels ranged from 4.5-20.55 nM. Only one of eight control samples had measurable mercury,4.9 nM. PML 223, at 1738-39 (but note that at one point, the control's blood mercury level is reported as 4.65 nM, and at another as 4.9 nM ( compare 1739 with table at 1738)). 195synthase] activation and impair folate-dependent methylation. Since each of these agents has been linked to dev elopmental disorders, our findings suggest that impaired methylation, par ticularly impaired DNA methylation in response to growth factors, may be an important molecular mechanismleading to developmental disorders. Waly, PML 257, at 365. The paper concluded by once again setting forth Dr. Deth's theory: the rise in autism and ADHD could both be a \"mani festation of vaccine-associated neurodevelopmental toxicity, since the D4 dopamine is linked to ADHD,\" and the receptor's phospholipid methylation function is dependent upon methioninesynthase. 515 Waly, PML 257, at 368. 3. The Effects of Thimerosal on Cysteine Uptake. a. The Experimental Data. Doctor Deth and his colleagues incubated neuroblastoma cells in various concentrations of thimerosal516 for one hour and then measured the activity of the EAAT3 cysteine transporter517 by the uptake of radioactive cysteine in the cells. Tr. at 515 The authors caveated their findings by noting that molecular events in tumor-derived cell lines might not resemble those in normal cells, and that cultured cells do not represent the complex in vivo environment, where other metal ions, redox status, and ot her factors could affect methylation. They noted that further study would be needed to \"evaluate the possibility that vaccine components...may havecontributed to the risk of autism, ADHD and other developmental disorders.\" Waly, PML 257, at 368. 516 Doctor Mailman noted that this experiment involved the use of thimerosal, not ethylmercury. Tr. at 2012. In vivo , humans are injected with thimerosal, but the body rapidly metabolizes it to ethylmercury. It is ethylmercury that reaches the brain, not thimerosal. Once in the brain, ethylmercury is either excreted or converted to inorganic mercury. Tr. 2011-12. He called the use of thimerosal on the neuroblastoma cells a \"cardinal defect,\" noting t hat Dr. Deth did not apply his understanding of the biochemical process to his own experiment. Tr. at 2012-13. 517 Cysteine, like other amino acids, is transported across cell membranes by transporter proteins. Doctor Deth testified that in neurons, the trans port is accomplished by the excitatory amino acid transporter-3 [\"EAAT3\"], which also transports glutamate, the primary excitatory amino acid. Tr. at 510-11,547; Deth, PML 563, at 191. He intimated that this is the only cysteine transporter available in neurons (Tr. at 545), a point with which Dr. Jones disagreed. Tr. at 2748-49. Two studies indicate that Dr. Jones is correct. See L. Mutkus, et al., Mercuric Chloride Inhibits the In Vitro Uptake of Glutamate in GLAST- and GLT-1--Transfected Mutant 267-80 (2006) [\"Mutkus\"], filed as PML 571. The study indicated t hat there are five glutamate transporter subtypes, with EAAT2 comprising about 1% of all brain protein and acc ounting for over 90% of glutamate uptake in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Although the article did not specifically state that these transporters also transport cysteine, it did indicate that cystei ne residues were found in several of the transporters. PML 571 at 268. The Aschner 2000 article, PML 568, indicates that there EAAT4, and EAAT5. PML 568 at It seems unlikely that the EAAT3 transporter is 196547-48; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 21. They confirm ed that they were measuring the activity of the EAAT3 transporter through the use of pharmacol ogical inhibitors. Tr. at 547. As Dr. Deth described the effects, \"exquisitely low concentrations\" of thimerosal (nanomolar amounts) caused a two-thirds reduction in the uptake of cysteine. Tr. at 548, 3934. Thimerosal inhibited the uptake of cysteine as a function of its concentration (a dose- response effect). Tr. at 547. Doctor De th compared the reduction of cysteine uptake from nanamolar amounts of thimerosal to the reductions produced by similar amounts of lead, arsenic, aluminum, and mercury (all metals with an affinity for thiols). Thimerosal showed the greatest effect. Tr. at 548-49; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 21. Doctor Deth testified that 30 nM concent rations of thimerosal, a level that has been measured in plasma and which has been estimated to occur in the brain aftervaccination, caused a two-thirds reduction in cysteine uptake. 518 Tr. at 548; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 21. Doctor Deth was relying on Dr. Aposhian's estimates of brain mercury concentrations in human infants as evidence that vaccines could produce a 30 nM level of mercury in the brain.519 Tr. at 548. b. Evidence of a \"Cystathionine Block\" in Human Brains. Building on this unpublished data showing that mercury impeded cysteine uptake, Dr. Deth opined that the effects of mercury's interference with cysteine uptake would be greater in humans than in monkeys, in an apparent reference to the cellular effects of mercury found in the adult monkey brains (the Charleston studies). Tr. at 549-50. He based this opinion on a 1958 paper showing higher levels ofcystathionine 520 in human brains than in monkey or other animal brains. Tr. at 543, 2225-27; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 17. From t he difference in cystathionine levels in human versus animal brains, Dr. Deth concluded that there was a \"block in human brains afterthe cystathionine that limits its ability to go all the way to cysteine and glutathione.\" Tr. at 543. He opined that this phenomenon makes human neuronal cells more dependent the only one of the three to transport cysteine, parti cularly in view of the continued, albeit reduced, cysteine uptake found in Dr. Deth's own experiments. See Tr. at 548. 518 He indicated that a 30 nanomolar level of thimerosal was represented on his chart at a point between the 10-7 and10-8 entries. 519 The estimate of 28.7 nM appeared in Dr. Aposhian's initial report. PML 711 at 14. In his supplemental report, Dr. Aposhian's calculations we re performed using nanograms per gram. Regardless of the measurements used in his computations (molecular weight or weight), I do not consider Dr.Aposhian's estimates of brain mercury concentrati ons caused by TCV administration to be valid, as discussed in Section VI. Thus, Dr. Deth's assertion that a 30 nM level of mercury in the brain could beproduced by TCV administration is likewise invalid. 520 Cystathionine is the first of the two intermedi ate steps on the transsulfuration pathway between homocysteine at one end and glutathione on the other. Cysteine is the second intermediate step, fallingbetween cystathionine and glutathione. Tr. at 543. 197on the uptake of cysteine from outside the cell, primarily from the astrocytes, through their release of excess glutathione. Tr. at 544. c. Conclusions Drawn by Dr. Deth from Cysteine Uptake Data. Doctor Deth concluded that the effect s of mercury on the neuronal cysteine and glutamate EAAT3 transporter would make human cells especially vulnerable to oxidative stress. When neurons are subject ed to oxidative stress, they respond by taking up more cysteine to synthesize more gl utathione. Deth, PML 563, at 191. If there is a block inside human brains at the cystathionine level, then taking up cysteine from extracellular sources becomes mo re critical to producing glutathione and maintaining a normal oxidative state. Becaus e mercury interferes with this extracellular intake by its effects on the EAAT3 transporte r, the neuronal ability to deal with oxidative stress would be significantly impaired. Tr. at 545, 547. According to Dr. Deth, his own work and studies involving mouse brains521 demonstrate that the EAAT3 transporter is \"absolutely critical for survival and normal function of neurons.\" Tr. at 545, 3933-34. d. Criticisms Specific to the Cysteine Uptake Experiments. (1) No Evidence for a Metabolic \"Block.\" The only support for Dr. Deth's conclusion that human brains have some type of metabolic block between cystathionine and cyst eine is 1958 data. Even assuming that these data are accurate (an assumption challenged by Dr. Johnson ( see Tr. at 2225- 26)), Dr. Deth jumped from high cystathionine le vels to the conclusion that there was a blocked metabolic process without any data that such a block actually exists. He did not rely on any measurements of lower cyst eine and glutathione levels in human brains; he simply concluded that they must be low as a result of high cystathionine levels. It is equally likely that cysteine and glutathione levels are also higher in human brains. Tr. at 2225-26. Noninvasive measurem ents of brain glutathione levels by MRI are possible. See Tr. at 2700-01. (2) Transport Mechanisms. Doctor Deth relied upon an inhibition of cysteine transport through the EAAT3 transporter as a critical aspect of his hypothesis. According to Dr. Jones, Dr. Deth'shypothesis did not account for basic cell physiology. Cells constantly manufactureproteins, and to do so, they need all 20 amino ac ids. Tr. at 2748. All cells have multiple amino acid transporters and antiporters to keep them supplied with appropriate 521 In mice, when the EAAT3 transporter is knocked out, there is a major decrease in glutathione levels, and the mice suffer neurodegenerative consequences. According to Dr. Deth, in mature neurons,the literature indicates that the EAAT3 transporter is the source for more than half of cysteine uptake. When this transporter is blocked, Dr. Deth's studies demonstrated that two-thirds of the uptake of cysteine was blocked. Tr. at 3934. 198concentrations of all amino acids. Tr. at 2748-49. A high concentration of one amino acid in the cell will result in its transporta tion outside of the cell, while a second amino acid the cell needs is transported into the cell. Tr. at 2749. Doctor Deth's own data on cysteine uptake in the presence of various concentrations of thimerosal illustrated this point: Over a very broad range of concentrations of thimerosal, there was littl e to no change in cysteine uptake, reflecting the presence of other cysteine transporters. Tr. at 2750. Based on similar experiments in other cells and other culture conditions, even the highest concentrations of thimerosal Dr. Deth used permitted enough cysteine to enter the neurons to allow them to synthesize sufficient glutathione and produce prot eins. Tr. at 2750-51. Thimerosal may have inhibited cysteine transport in this cell li ne, but not sufficiently to support Dr. Deth's hypothesis of an ultimate effect on glutat hione synthesis in the human brain. Tr. at 2751. 4. Effects of Thimerosal on Glut athione and Methylcobalamin Levels. Doctor Deth's unpublished work also examined the effects of mercury and thimerosal on glutathione and methylcobal amin levels, and on measurements of methionine synthase activity. a. Findings. In this experiment, a one-hour incubation of human neuroblastoma cells in thimerosal at various low concentrations reduced glutathione levels, with reductions increasing as the dose increased.522 Tr. at 553; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 24. A 30 nM concentration of thimerosal reduced glutathi one levels by about two-thirds. A one hour pretreatment of neuroblastoma cells with a 100 nM concentr ation of thimerosal reduced methylcobalamin levels to almost zero. Tr. at 556. Measurements of methionine synthase activity after incubation of the ce lls in various concentrations of thimerosal demonstrated a complete loss of methionine synthase activity at very low doses ofthimerosal in the presence of hydroxyl-B-12, and a substantially reduced activity level at higher levels of thimerosal in the presence of methylcobalamin. 523 Tr. at 559-60. See Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 28 (chart in lower le ft corner illustrating the methionine synthase activity in the presence or absence of meth ylcobalamin). Inorganic mercury also had a potent effect, only slightly less than t hat of thimerosal. Tr. at 561. b. Conclusions. 522 Referencing again the incorrect assumption t hat TCVs could produce a 30 nM brain mercury level, Dr. Deth noted that the 30 nM level effects were represented by the mark between the 10-7 and 10-8 levels on slide 24, Pet. Tr. Ex. 3. Tr. at 555. 523 Doctor Deth explained the effect of having meth ylcobalamin as a co-factor was that glutathione did to reactivate methionine sy nthase because the methylcobalamin did. See Tr. at 558. 199According to Dr. Deth, a reduction in gl utathione levels would predict a reduction in the synthesis of methylcobalamin, precisely the result Dr. Deth obtained. Tr. at 556. He testified that, without methylcobalamin, methionine synthase would be effectively turned off in the brain and would remain tu rned off until normal oxidative status was regained. Without methionine synthase, the D4 receptor's methylation activity would be inhibited. Persistent inorganic mercury in the brain would perpetuate this effect, and if normal oxidative status were not regained, t here would be a persistent loss of the role of the D4 dopamine receptor. Tr. at 557-58. c. Criticisms of the Data and Conclusions. (1) Timing is Everything. Doctor Johnson explained that Dr. Deth 's selection of a one-hour exposure period was calculated to demonstrate the maxi mum effect on glutathione levels. In studies of this nature, the standard prac tice would be to measure the effect of thimerosal (or ethylmercury or other heavy me tals) over time. In response to exposure to a toxin, glutathione levels are initially reduced as the glutathione binds to the toxin. Reduced glutathione levels trigger the manufac ture of more glutathione, restoring and eventually exceeding baseline levels. Tr. at 2229-30. It is this response to oxidizing agents that caused Dr. Johnson to comment that mild oxidative stress is actually good for the body. Tr. at 2229. By picking a one-hour time frame, what Dr. Deth and his colleagues measured was a very acute depletion of cellular glutathione.524 Tr. at 2229. At 24-48 hours after exposure, the basal level of glutathione ma y be doubled or even tripled over baseline, making the exposed cells more resistant to toxi city. By selecting only one time point to measure effects, Dr. Deth ignored the effect of dose over time. Tr. at 2230. What Dr. Deth's data represented is a preconditioning re sponse, demonstrating that a little stress is good because it triggers compensatory mechanisms. See Tr. at 2230-31. Doctor Jones concurred with Dr. Johnson's testimony, describing in more complex terms how the body reacts to lowered glutathione levels and what types ofsubstances trigger these effects. See Tr. at 2739-43. (2) Basal Levels of Glutathione. Doctor Johnson testified that the basal le vels of glutathione Dr. Deth reported in his unpublished work on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were inconsistent and wrong. On one slide, Dr. Deth reported a basal gl utathione level of about 700 nM per milligram 524 Doctor Johnson clearly identified Res. Tr. Ex. 7, slide 11, as containing hypothetical data to illustrate this well-known effect. Tr. at 2230. 200of protein.525 On another, he reported a basal leve l of over 1500 nM of glutathione per milligram of protein for the same cells.526 Tr. at 2228. In a number of other papers that measured glutathione levels in these same SH- SY5Y cells, Dr. Johnson found that the basal level of glutathione was reported as between 12 and 30 nM per milligram of protein. Tr. at 2228-29. He testified that the discrepancy between Dr. Deth's results and t hese other studies could simply be a calculation error, but it evinced a \"carele ss nature\" regarding evaluation and reporting of data. Tr. at 2229. Someone with familiari ty with glutathione levels, the published literature, and these cells \"would have notic ed that these numbers are extremely high and far off base.\" Tr. at 2229. Doctor Jones was also critical of Dr. Deth's report of thimerosal's effects on glutathione levels because the glutathione levels Dr. Deth reported did not make sense. Tr. at 2737. Liver cells contain the highes t levels of glutathione in the body at approximately 10 millimoles of glutathione, but the graph appearing on Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 24, reflects 750 nanomoles per milligram of protein, a figure that would require a level of 20 millimoles of glutathione in tissue.527 There is no body tissue that contains glutathione at that level.528 Tr. at 2738. Doctor Deth responded to the criticisms by saying that he found conflicting reports in the literature concer ning glutathione levels in the cells he used. He indicated that he would return to his lab and check the calculations.529 Tr. at 3922. Nevertheless, he contended that thimerosal resulted in a 40% decrease in glutathione levels, reflecting thimerosal's interference with su lfur metabolism. Tr. at 3922. 5. Phospholipid Methylation in Lymphoblasts. 525 See Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 24. 526 See chart \"f\" on Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 28. 527 Doctor Jones computed the amount taking the amount of protein (20%) and the amount of water (70%) in mammalian tissue. For one milligram of protein, there would be 3.5 microliters of water,then converted the figures to milimolar concentra tions. He testified that there would be about 750 nanomoles in about 3.7 microliters. Tr. at 2737. 528 Doctor Deth's explanation was that Dr. Jones misunderstood the graph. He explained that his graph represented a 300 mole per milligram change in glutathione level based on a one nanomole change in the amount of thimerosal. He indicated that this was evidence of the \"big multiplier\" effect of thimerosalon regulatory proteins. Tr. at 3920-21. However, that is not what the slide indicated. The axis is clearly labeled as nanomoles of glutathione per milligram of prot ein, not as a change in the amount of glutathione. Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 24. If the slide correctly reported the findings, there is something wrong with the data. If the slide, which is clear on its face, does not represent what the study found, this is simply one morereason to give little weight to Dr. Deth's unpublished work. 529 No additional information was provided to the court. 201Based on the findings of the Waly st udy regarding thimerosal's effects on phospholipid methylation in neuroblastoma cells, Dr. Deth's decided tomeasure the effect on lymphoblasts to dete rmine the relative sensitivity of two cell types. Although affected by thimerosal, lymphoblast phospholipid methylation wasabout 10 times less sensitive than that of the neuroblastoma cells used in the Waly experiment. Tr. at 566; see also Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 31. Doctor Deth attributed this effect to transsulfuration being less efficient in the \"most vulnerable cells types,\" such as neurons. Tr. at 566-67. 6. Brain Tissue Studies.Doctor Deth's laboratory received brain tissue samples from the Autism Tissue Program, which included \"the same samples in most part used by Vargas, et al, [PML69] in their study.\" Tr. at 568. He de scribed the evidence from his laboratory's work with messenger RNA derived from these samples as the strongest evidence in favor ofhis hypothesis. Tr. at 582-83. Doctor Deth explained the rationale behind these studies, but his explanations were not coherent. According to Dr. Deth, the availability of methionine synthase \"depends upon its gene in the DNA, which is transcribed to...messenger RNA, which then gives rise to thefinal protein enzymes.\" Tr. at 567. Thus, methionine synthase activity can be regulated at the protein level. Tr. at 567. He attempted to explain this concept: For instance, the cofactor can be oxidiz ed of B12, it can be exerted at the level of the messenger RNA, which can be, for example, determine (sic)how much messenger RNA is translated into protein. Or it can be at thegene level itself, how much original product from the gene is made intomessenger RNA that is transcription. So we can see that nature can regulate the activity of methionine synthase in very short microseconds ormillisecond waves, that's a level of the co-factor, or for days or hours at a time, depending upon which level of control is chosen. Tr. at 567-68. Although there may be some tr anscription errors, this particular excerpt is more incoherent than most of Dr. Deth 's testimony. It appeared that Dr. Deth was attempting to measure the quantity of mRNA present and available to code for the proteins that are a part of methionine syn thase, and thus compare methionine synthase activity in the brains of those with ASD to control brains. a. Findings. Using PCR, Dr. Deth's laboratory amp lified the mRNA samples and estimated the amount of mRNA available for methioni ne synthase in both individuals with autism 202and controls.530 Tr. at 569. Instead of using pr imer sets directed against the entire mRNA gene, the laboratory dev ised primer sets directed against each of the component proteins (domains) in methionine synthase. Tr. at 569-70. A comparison of the amounts of mRNA for the CAP and cobalamin dom ains in autistic brains versus controls is set forth on Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 34. The amounts of mRNA for these two domains were significantly lower in the autism samples. Tr. at 570. The amount of mRNA for the CAP domain varied by age, with more differences between case samples and controlsat younger ages, but less difference between t he case and control samples in the older patients. Tr. at 572-73; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 36. b. Conclusions. To Dr. Deth, this suggested \"the possibilit y that there is a relationship between lower levels of the messenger RNA of methionine synthase, and the presence of inflammation.\" However, he did not measur e inflammation in the samples he tested. Tr. at 570-71. Reasoning very indirectly , he concluded that less mRNA meant less methionine synthase, which meant that homocysteine would be diverted to making glutathione, which fights oxidative stress. 531 Tr. at 571. Because methionine synthase is a sensor for oxidative stress, reduc ed methionine synthase would indicate the presence of oxidative stress in the br ain, and would be evidence of an adaptive response to oxidative stress and neuroinflammati on. Tr. at 571. The presence of both neuroinflammation and reduced methionine synthase suggested to him that the twooutcomes are related. Tr. at 571. He interpreted the CAP domain findings as suggesting that the reduction in methionine syn thase had a greater impact in the young. Tr. at 573. c. Criticisms. Doctor Johnson had significant concer ns about the unpublished data pertaining to PCR testing in these brain samples. Tr . at 2235-37. He noted that the presentation did not include information that would be ex pected in a peer reviewed study before any scientific weight would be accorded the data. This included: (1) the number of samples analyzed; (2) the amount of RNA in the assa y; (3) the standards for the PCR reaction; (4) the use of a housekeeping gene as a control; 532 and (5) the quality of the RNA. Tr. at 2235-37. Having experienced difficultie s in obtaining reliable RNA samples from Down syndrome postmortem samples, Dr. Johnson was concerned about the RNA 530 On rebuttal, Dr. Deth testified that the mRNA in the samples was converted in the laboratory to complimentary DNA [\"cDNA\"] at a lab in Rome. The cDNA was then amplified. Doctor Deth's teammeasured the mRNA levels of methionine synthase. Tr. This reflected Dr. Deth's view that methionine synthase controlled what happened to methionine and homocysteine, rather than dietary methionine levels. See supra Section VII.C.2.a. 532 Doctor Deth testified on rebuttal that a housekeeping gene was used. Tr. at 3906. 203quality in this case. Without RNA gels and analysis to determine that the RNA is good, running the assays is pointless. Tr. at 2237. Doctor Johnson found it impossible to get a sufficient yield of high-quality RNA from which to run PCR. Tr. at 2237. The data presented in Dr. Deth's slides and testimony did not indicate how many samples were analyzed, or how the assay was run. Tr. at 2235. There is no indication of the RNA quality, and, according to Dr. J ohnson, \"if there's any RNA breakdown in the samples before you run this assay it can co mpletely mess up what you're trying to interpret.\" Tr. at 2237. In the Purcell study, PML 567,533 researchers examined cerebellar tissue samples using high-density microarrays to measure gene expression.534 The authors noted the difficulties of analyzing RNA from postmortem brains in terms of quality and the effects of events that preceded death. They described the efforts they used to confirm the quality of the tissue, using measurements of pH and gel electrophoresis. Purcell, PML 567, at 1618-19. Doctor De th did not describe any methods used to confirm tissue quality, and I note that his CV does not reflect any publications with titles reflecting the use of PCR in research. He did not describe any research background inPCR. I find Dr. Johnson's concerns about the reliability of this evidence very persuasive. 535 Without the type of data Dr. Johnson referenced and which would be contained in a peer reviewed paper, I cannot accord this evidence other than minimalweight. S ee Snyder , 2009 WL 332044, at *110 (noting problems in PCR testing that occur even in the laboratories that us e it frequently and the need for redundancy in quality control measures). E. General Criticisms Proffered of t he Waly Study and the Deth Unpublished Work. 1. Apples and Oranges: Neurons vs. Neuroblastoma Cells.Doctor Deth's use of neuroblastoma cells, and his efforts to equate them to human neurons, 536 were roundly criticized by the witnesses who responded to his 533 A. Purcell, et al., Postmortem brain abnormalities of filed as 534 Doctor Johnson described microarray analysis as \"a fancy way of [doing] PCR.\" Tr. at 4322. 535 Because this evidence was presented for the first time in Dr. Deth's testimony, I do not fault respondent for failing to respond to it at greater length. 536 In his expert report and testimony, Dr. Deth stated that \"thimerosal is toxic to human cortical neurons and neuronal cells grown in culture.\" PML 713 at 3; see Tr. at 613-14. In his report, Dr. Deth cited to three studies for this point: (1) M. Herdman, et al., Thimerosal Induces Apoptosis in Some criticisms were discussed above; others follow. Doctor Johnson explained that the neuroblas toma cell line is a self-renewing cell line, usually produced from a tumor, that demonstrates uncontrolled growth. Such cell lines often have aberrant numbers of ch romosomes and frequently contain multiple genetic mutations. Tr. at 2205-06. Neuroblastoma cells have a specific defect called dedifferentiation. Most neuroblastoma cell lines have characteristics of glial cells, and express glial proteins, ones not normally found in neurons. They are cheap and easy to use, and experiments in them can be performed quickly. Tr. at 2206. However, it is impossible to extrapolate from results in these cells to resu lts in human neurons. Tr. at 2206-07. The two primary authors of the Char leston and Vahter papers co-authored a paper which noted that neuroblastoma cells we re more susceptible to methylmercury than other cell types. See Mottet, PML 197, at 385. The James 2005 study also reported that neuroblastoma cells were much more sensitive to mercury thanglioblastoma cells. PML 7 at 3 (reporting a 48-hour toxicity threshold in theglioblastoma cells versus a three-hour toxi city threshold in the neuroblastoma cells). In his rebuttal testimony, Dr. Deth acknowledged that the cells he studied were not brain cells, but because they were cell lines used frequently in biological studies, they would yield important information that can be further considered in neuronal cell cultures. Tr. at 3935-36. While it is true that neuroblastoma cells are used frequently in preliminary work, Dr. Deth failed to rebut the evidence demonstr ating that the neuroblastoma cells contain characteristics that significantly undercu t his conclusions. They have abnormal methionine synthase, are more susceptible to mercury's effects, and behave more like glial cells than neurons. 2. Effects Too Small to Be Measured. In his report, Dr. Deth stated that \"[t]he threshold effect for thimerosal reduction of [glutathione] is approximately 0.1 nanomolar , indicating a remarkably potent influence [\"Herdman\"], filed as PML 24; (2) D. Baskin, et al., Thimerosal Induces DNA Breaks, Caspase-3 Activation, Membrane Damage, and Cell Death in Cultured Human Neurons and Fibroblasts , TOXICOLOG and (3) D. Parran, et al., Effects of Thimerosal on NGF Signal Transduction and Cell 86(1): 132-40 (2005) [\"Parran\"], filed as PML 21. Doctor Johnson correctly pointed out that the Herdman and Parran studiesinvolved neuroblastoma cells, not human cortical neurons. Tr. at 2208-09. He was incorrect in socharacterizing the Baskin study, which did involve the use of human cortical neurons in culture, albeit at much higher concentrations of thimerosal than were used in Dr. Deth's experiments. 205on cellular redox status in human neuronal cells.\"537 Pet. Ex. 713 at 4. Doctor Jones commented that this statement caught his attention because 0.1 nanomolar is \"such a remarkably low level that there's no analytical technique that I know of that would be sensitive enough to pick up that type of an effe ct on a glutathione system.\" Tr. at 2720. Since he developed one of the major methods in use for detecting effects onglutathione, Dr. Jones was well aware of the s ensitivity of the methods in use. Doctor Jones stated that there is no method available to detect the effect reported. Tr. at 2721. Because he was unaware of any method to detect such a small change, Dr. Jones reviewed the literature, finding remarkably similar levels of thimerosal used in the studies he examined. 538 Tr. at 2721-22. The published work on thimerosal toxicity shows results at the microm olar level. Tr. at 2724. Doctor Johnson was also highly critical of the results reported from nanomolar amounts of thimerosal. He noted that one adv antage of using readily available cell lines is that other researchers across the country are using the same cells. If relatively consistent results are obtained from several different laboratories using the same cells, the results are likely to be reliable. Tr. at 2223. An effect at two or three orders of magnitude lower than those reported by ot her laboratories is not understandable or expected. Tr. at 2223. Doctor Deth's laboratory is the only one reporting effects at levels 100 to 1,000 times lower than those of other laboratories. Tr. at 2223-24. Doctor Deth acknowledged that the doses of thimerosal at which the Waly paper showed effects were extremely low, at t he nanomolar or even subnanomolar level. Tr. at 3937. He acknowledged that he was the only researcher to find effects at such low levels. Tr. at 3969-70. However, Dr. De th noted that another paper, Carvalho, Pet. Tr. Ex. 7, showed inorganic mercury's effects at nanomolar levels on thioredoxin. Tr. at 3941. The Carvalho study involved mercury chloride and methylmercury, not thimerosal or ethylmercury, and measured e ffects on proteins, not cells.539 Tr. at 2779-81. 537 Doctor Deth did not identify which of his studies produced this figure. 538 A non-exhaustive list of the studies he examined appears on pages 11 and 12 of Res. Ex. K. Tr. at 2721-22. As examples, the Park, Herdman, and Humphrey studies all used low micromolar doses. See E. Park, et al., Evaluation of Cytotoxicity Attributed to Thimerosal on Murine and Human Kidney Cells, J. TOXICOL . ENVTL. HEALTH , Humphrey, Mitochondrial Mediated Thimerosal-Induced Apoptosis The Parran study used nanomolar doses, but they we re administered to cells already dying, and thimerosal enhanced the toxic effect of a missing growth factor. PML 21 at 135. Tr. at 2722-23. TheJames 2005 study also used micromolar levels of thimerosal. PML 7 at 3. 539 Doctor Jones testified that it would not be good science to extrapolate from such studies to what would happen in a cell culture, much less in an entire organism. Tr. at 2781-83. 2063. Too Much Glutathione to Be Affected. Doctor Jones convincingly refuted Dr. Deth 's contention of significant effects on sulfur metabolism from TCV-level doses of mercury by demonstrating that the amount of glutathione available so greatly exceeds t he amount of thimerosal in vaccines that no real effect on glutathione levels could occur or persist. Doctor Jones testified that the total thiol level540 in the body is approximately 20,000 micromoles ( mol) per kilogram of body weight. Total glutathione is approximately 800-1000 mol per kilogram of body weight. Tr. at 2707-08; Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 6. The recommended daily dietary inta ke is about two-thirds to half of the total glutathione content of the body. Tr. at 2709; Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 6 . A cumulative dose of thimerosal from all vaccines would be approximately 200 g, or about 1 mol per kilogram of body weight.541 Tr. at 2711-12; Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 6. For comparison purposes, food products also contain materials that, like thimerosal, react with and bind to glutathione. The reactive material in four ounces of milk contains 10 times the reactive material in 200 g of thimerosal; four ounces of apple juice contains four times the amount of reactive ma terial in vaccines. Tr. at 2713-14; Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 7. Natural fluctuations in glutathione levels vary from 25-30% over the course of a day. Tr. at 2715; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 8. This natural variation is far greater than the effect of a response to all the thimerosal received via TCVs, even if administered all at once. The rate at which glutathione cycles in and out of blood and cells is approximately 1 mol per kilogram of body weight per minute. Tr. at 2717. Thus, the amount of glutathione being turned over as t he result of normal metabolism per minute is more than would be needed to detoxify the total load of thimerosal received in sixmonths of vaccinations. Tr. at 2718. The receipt of a TCV would not change the amount of glutathione in the body in any detec table way. No instrumentation is good enough to detect the effect, if any, of a TCV on glutathione levels. Tr. at 2718. Even if the entire amount of thimerosal received in si x months were administered at one time, it would take less than one minute for the body to replace the glutathione necessary tobind to and deactivate that thimerosal. Tr. at 2719. Doctor Deth challenged Dr. Jones' test imony that apple juice would deplete 540 Because heavy metals can bind to any thiol, the total thiol content of the body provides binding sites for any heavy metal, including mercury. Tr. at 2709. 541 Doctor Jones was quite generous in his computations, as the 200 g figure he used is higher than the cumulative amount of thimerosal contained in vaccines received by most children by one year of age. He used the assumption that this dose was received by a 1-kilogram child (2.2 pounds), which is afar lower body weight than that of most newborns. Based on these figures, he calculated the 1 mol/kg of body weight figure, which clearly overestimates the amount, probably by a factor of 10. Tr. at 2712. 207glutathione, pointing out that the effect of apple juice would be transient, while the mercury would remain. Tr. at 3898. It ma y be more accurate to state that some mercury will remain; a substantial part will be excreted. Doctor Deth was correct in asserting that glutathione does not bind to and detoxify all mercury ingested or injected. If it did so at 100% efficiency and remai ned bound and excreted, mercury toxicity would not be a problem. However, the point made by respondent's experts was not that glutathione would bind to all the mercury avail able; it was that all the mercury available would not impact glutathione leve ls in any measurable way. In responding to Dr. Jones' criticism of the glutathione depletion aspect of his theory, Dr. Deth explained that the concept of stoichiometry applied. In testimony that appeared to shift dramatically from his gl utathione depletion causing oxidative stress hypothesis, he explained that the effect s he postulated did not depend on glutathione interacting with a given amount of thimeros al. Tr. at 3896. Because mercury enters and remains in the brain,542 it is obvious that glutathione does not inactivate or bind with all the mercury available. Tr. at 3896-97. The target of the thimerosal is not glutathione; it is the small am ount of regulatory proteins in the brain to which thimerosal binds. These proteins are taken up by astrocytes, neurons, and microglia. Tr. at 3897. Thus, it is not the quantity of glutathione that is relevant; it is the amount of the proteins that are mercury's primary targets. Tr. at 3897-98. He postulated that the interaction of cells to the mercury bound to thiols was res ponsible for the neuroinflammation found in the Vargas study: \"So the point I just made, that the provocation of the inflammatory response is not because there's so much me rcury that it depletes the glutathione one for one, that's not it. It's because those cr itical regulatory mechanisms are built upon sulphur (sic) and thiols binding the mercury, and it's their interaction that's causing the inflammation.\" Tr. at 3898. Doctor Deth's late-in-the-game switch fr om mercury's impact on glutathione to its binding to otherwise unidentified \"regulator y proteins\" was unpersuasive. After considerable testimony about mercury's effe cts on transsulfuration and the methionine- methylation cycle and his many experiments t hat purported to measure these effects, Dr. Deth's new focus on \"regulatory proteins\" was disingenuous at best. Given theubiquity of thiols and sulfur in the brain and elsewhere in the body, the tiny amounts of mercury administered through TCVs, and t he even smaller amounts that will reach and remain in the brain, are unlikely to deplete t he thiols available. Most mercury in the brain is already bound ( see Tr. at 625-27), and only the small amount not already bound to thiols would be available to r eact with these \"regulatory proteins.\" 4. Fluid Volume Measurement s and Calculations of Effects. Another significant problem with Dr. Deth 's work involved how effects on cell 542 There is some evidence to indicate that t he inorganic mercury in the brain remains there because it forms strong bonds with selenium. See Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 628. 208cultures were calculated. In summary, re spondent's experts indicated that, by varying the volume of fluid added to the cell cultur e, the researchers could manipulate the effects produced. This problem woul d be exacerbated when the substance added would affect only the cells, and not any component of the fluid. As Dr. Deth explained, the cultured ce lls used in his experiments were grown until they were confluent, meaning that there was a single layer of cells at the bottom of the well in a petri dish. A solution was added to measure the biochemical changesbeing examined. The volume of the solution va ried, but it had to cover the cells. In the wells used in Dr. Deth's experiments, the minimum amount required was 600 microliters (L). Tr. at 3924. The actual amount used in the experiments was 2 milliliters (mL). Tr. at 3925. Doctor Jones explained that this system exaggerated the effect of small doses of thimerosal on the cells. Because the study design involved thimerosal, which has a high affinity for thiols, the thimerosal w ould accumulate in the cells rather than remaining in the solution. Thus, the volume of the culture medium becomes relevant to the measurements of effects. See Tr. at 2725-29. To explain, Dr. Jones gave an example in which the culture medi um and cells together constitute 1000 M in volume. When 1 M of toxic substance is added, a ratio of 1 to 1000 would be reported. However, if that toxic substance is entirel y absorbed by the cells, it would be incorrect to call this a 1 to 1000 ratio because the entir e amount of added substance would be taken up by the cellular fraction, without regard to t he amount of fluid in the culture medium. If the cells constituted 1 M of the 1000 M total volume, the ratio of toxic substance to cells would actually be 1 to 1. Tr. at 2725-27; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slides 9-10. In essence, the cells bear the full burden of t he toxic substance, regardless of the amount of culture medium. Tr. at 2730-31. High toxicity of thiol-reactive chemic als occurs when the total amount of the chemical is similar to the total thiol content of the cells. The toxicity threshold can bemanipulated by changing the ratio of the volume of culture media to the number of cells in culture. Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 11. The fe wer the cells in the culture medium, the lower the toxicity threshold will be because each cell is receiving more of the administeredsubstance in the cultures with lower cell c ounts. Tr. at 2729. If, instead of using 1,000,000 cells, only 100,000 are used, only one-t enth the amount of toxic substance is needed to produce the same effect. This does not mean that the substance is moretoxic, only that the toxic effects are concent rated on fewer cells. Tr. at 2729-30. Thus, studies of this nature show a dose response curv e such that there is no toxicity at lower concentrations, but once toxicity begins, most of the cells die at the same time, reflecting that all of the cells have the same mechanisms of response to the toxic substance. Tr. at 2729. I note that Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 616, supported Dr. Jones' testimony in this regard. They reported: 209Numerous reports on in vitro actions of mercuric mercury may be found in the literature. In vitro , mercury can affect numerous cellular processes such as inhibition of enzyme function and blockade of cellular receptorsand ion channels. These actions in turn can change both intra- andintercellular signaling processes of considerable significance to thenervous system. Such effects have been observed at an impressively lowconcentration of mercury in the inc ubating media. The problem with all these studies is that the cellular concentrations of mercury were notmeasured. Cells or subcellular com ponents contain many binding sites for mercury, such as the ubiquitous -SH [thiol] ligands. The medium, on theother hand, usually contains few mercury binding sites. Consequentlymercuric mercury rapidly leaves the incubation medium to attach tocellular components. How much binds to the cell depends on the ratio ofthe number of cells to the volume of the media. A relatively low cell number suspended in a large volume of media usually means the cellularconcentrations will be much higher than the concentration that was addedto the media. It is therefore virtua lly impossible to translate such findings to equivalent levels in human target organs . PML 35 at 616 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).543 As Dr. Jones explained, studies of toxic substances that bind to thiols will show effects in the low micromolar range because t he toxic effect is concentrated in the cells only, while the effects are being measured on the cells plus the culture medium by weight or volume. Tr. at 2728. These amounts are \"grossly out of line with what you would see in vivo .\" Tr. at 2728. In Dr. Deth's unpublished experiments, t here is no way to know whether the conditions selected enhanced the reported toxici ty. Tr. at 2730. Adding more culture medium or reducing the number of cells can m anipulate the threshold for toxicity. Tr. at 2729-30. Doctor Johnson noted that Dr. Deth did not include dose curves in the Waly study, PML 257. 544 Tr. at 2218-19. 5. Use of In Vitro Data to Predict In Vivo Effects. Doctor Roberts testified about his years of studying oxidative stress, including in vitro, animal, and human studies. Tr. at 2183. He commented that it was \"very, very, 543 Although Clarkson and Magos were discussing mercuric mercury rather than ethylmercury or thimerosal, all three species have an affinity for thiols and would be expected to bind to them . See Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 652. 544 Doctor Johnson also noted that dose curves are essential in understanding the differential sensitivity of toxins. Dose curves allow comparison of the dosages at which different toxins first show an effect and at what dose the maximum effects are observed. Tr. at 2218-19. 210very difficult\" to extrapolate from in vitro data to what actually occurs in vivo . Tr. at 2184. A study on cultured cells can determine only if additional studies, such as animalstudies, might be worthwhile. Tr. at 2184. Eventually, human studies will be necessary because \"that's where the real answer is.\" Tr. at 2185. Doctor Johnson concurred. He testified that in vitro studies have complications and drastic limitations. Tr. at 2204. Cell li nes are grown in an environment that is not natural. Cell to cell communication is disrupted. Tr. at 2205. If an effect is found in a cell line such as a neuroblastoma cell line, then the next step is to see if the same effect obtains in a primary culture, such as mouse neuronal cells. Tr. at 2207-08. In vivo , there would be extracellular materi al and different types of cells that would modulate the effects of the toxic substance. 545 In a monocellular in vitro culture, these protective mechanisms do not ex ist, and thus, the results from an in vitro experiment cannot be extrapolated to in vivo systems. Tr. at 2731. For example, omitting albumin from a culture would shift the toxic ratio for glutathione. Albumin, found in human plasma, has 200-400 times more thiols than in glutathione in humanplasma. Tr. at 2731-32. Omitting nerve growth factor also shifts the toxic ratio. Without data regarding the culture medium , it is impossible to assess the validity of Dr. Deth's work, particularly given that his results are three or four orders of magnitude, or 1,000 to 10,000 times lower, than those reported in ot her papers. Tr. at 2732-33. The results in the published papers would be given \"more cr edibility than an unpublished report where you didn't have the understanding of why the systems were different and why the bulk of the published literature was wrong.\" Tr. at 2734. Doctor Mailman concurred, noting that conclusions from even well-designed in vitro studies cannot be extrapolated to demonstrate clinical effects. Tr. at 2004. In this case, the only evidence available is from Dr. Deth's laboratory. That evidence was obtained in the course of ex periments that were not well-designed or controlled and that have not been replicated by other laboratories. Using such evidence to make the jump to causation in a complex human disorder would give the evidenceweight it has not earned. Tr. at 2004-05. T he fact that Dr. Deth had to explain that a housekeeping gene was used as a control in the PCR testing during his rebuttaltestimony illustrates the difficulties inherent in relying on unpublished data, particularly data generated using PCR. Given the difficult ies with PCR testing, details of how the testing was conducted were important, and t hose details were not supplied in the testimony. PCR evidence should not be reli ed upon without knowing key details. Tr. at 2000. 545 The effects of a lack of copper in the cell medium was illustrated in the Waly study. The thimerosal inhibition on methionine synthase primar ily occurred in the copper-free medium. When copper was added, the effects of thimerosal on the neuroblastoma cells were considerably reduced. Unlike theneuroblastoma cells in culture, the human body contains copper in abundance. Tr. at 1827-28; Waly, PML257, at 363. Copper was not added to the cell cultures in the unpublished experiments, although the fetalbovine serum used to feed the cultured cells contained some copper. Tr. at 3919. 2116. Reliance on Unpublished Data. Doctor Mailman quoted one of his mentors as saying: \"[I]t ain't science until it's published.\" Tr. at 1999. Much of Dr. Deth 's testimony was based on unpublished data. When a paper is submitted for publication, other scientists have a chance to review the experimental design, the natur e of testing performed, the methods used, and the results obtained. The reviewers form their own conc lusions based on the data submitted. Tr. at 1999-2000. When the data upon which a wit ness relies is unpublished, this control for validity is unavailable. The many pr oblems noted by respondent's experts with the unpublished data amply illustrate the role of peer review, and the reasons for greater reliance to be placed on published data. F. Genetic Predispositions and Oxidative Stress. 1. Overview.This section covers the evidence concerning Dr. Deth's assertions that children with ASD have genetic differences that adversely affect their ability to handle oxidative stress and are unusually susceptible to environm ental toxins such as mercury that may generate oxidative stress. Doctor Deth relied on several small studies showing biomarkers of oxidative stress in childr en with ASD to demonstrate their propensity to sustain oxidative injury and to show that ox idative stress might be causal of their ASD. He also relied on studies indicating that children with ASD have polymorphisms that suggest their ability to methylate DNA and re spond to oxidative stress is impaired. From these findings, he concluded that childr en with ASD are more susceptible to the effects of mercury, and that the mercury in TCVs caused or contributed to the oxidative stress found. Doctor Deth also relied on a study demonstrating that mice with immune deficiencies are more vulnerable to TC Vs, resulting in behavioral symptoms and pathological findings similar to those found in ASD. Respondent's experts on oxidative stress, mercury, and sulfur metabolism were highly critical of Dr. Deth's assertions and many of the studies upon which he relied. The studies finding biomarkers of incr eased oxidative stress and/or impaired methylation in children with autism were sm all and characterized by their authors as preliminary. However, the most basic diffi culty with these studies can be characterized as a \"chicken or egg\" question. Even if thei r findings are correct, the studies contribute little, if anything, to the issue of autism' s causation because biomarkers of oxidative stress are found in most injuries and diseas es, and oxidative stress in peripheral tissue says nothing about the oxidative st ate of the brain. Thus, they have little relevance to the causation issue. The findings pertaining to polymorphism s are, according to their authors, preliminary. Even if they are found to be more applicable generally to children with ASD, at best, they demonstrate some susceptibilit y to metabolic problems; they say little to nothing about a susceptibility to mercury or other environmental toxins. The study 212demonstrating the effects of TCVs on autoimmune sensitive mice could not be duplicated by a better performed study, and, fo r that reason, even Dr. Aposhian, who once cited the Hornig study as evidence for one of his \"six pillars,\" no longer relied uponit. 2. Metabolic Evidence.Relying on the James 2004 and 2006 studies 546 and work by the Geiers,547 Ming,548 and Chauhan,549 Dr. Deth testified that plasma levels of methionine cycle and transsulfuration metabolites are abnormal in autistic individuals. Tr. at 536-37; see also Deth, PML 563, at 191. His testimony about plasma levels was supported by several small studies, but the conclusions he drew from the studies were not. a. Ming Study. The Ming study found that one F2 isoprostane,550 as measured by an immunoassay,551 was elevated in autistic children, as compared to controls, and markedly elevated in a subgroup of autistic children. Tr. at 2180; Ming, PML 124, at 380-81. The authors acknowledged that diet ary supplements, vitamins, and medicines may affect oxidative stress measurement s and that medical disorders such as epilepsy,552 allergies, and inflammation may incr ease oxidative stress. Ming, PML 124, 546 PML 5 and 49, respectively. 547 Doctor Deth testified that he had relied upon work by Dr. and Mr. Geier, but did not specify which articles. Tr. at 604-05. In the Deth article, PML 563 at 195, he cited to a 2006 Geier article that wasnot filed as an exhibit in the Theory 2 cases. 548 X. Ming, et al., Increased excretion of a lipid peroxidation biomarker in as PML 124. 549 A. Chauhan, et al., Oxidative stress in autism: Increased lipid peroxidation and reduced serum levels of ceruloplasmin and transferrin - antioxidant proteins 2539-49 (2004) [\"Chauhan\"], filed as PML Another article by A. Chauhan in autism , PATHOPHYSIOL . 13: 171-81 (2006), a literature review, was filed as PML 48. 550 Isoprostanes are prostaglandins, which are small lipid molecules. D ORLAND 'S at 958; Tr. at 2181-82. Prostaglandins have been a major research focu s for Dr. Roberts for a considerable part of his career. Tr. at 2161-63. 551 An immunoassay is created by developing an anti body, usually against a protein, that binds to the substance to be measured. Tr. at 2181. By measuring how much of the antibody binds to the substance, it is possible to determine how much of t he protein or other substance is present. Tr. at 2182. Antibodies against large proteins are generally more s pecific than antibodies against lipids. Tr. at 2181. 552 I note that about 25-40% of those with autism have epilepsy, with epileptic discharges often found on EEGs performed early in childhood in autistic ch ildren without clinically overt seizure activity. See Tr. at 3267-68; Pardo, PML 72, at 486. Doctor Kinsbourne acknowledged that seizure activity was a 213at 382. They did not find any associations of these factors wit h increased excretion of oxidative biomarkers in their study, but unlik e the children with autism in the study, none of the control children had epilepsy, gastrointes tinal disorders, or sleep disorders. Ming, PML 124, at 381-82 and Table 2. Regressi on was not associated with the oxidative stress biomarkers measured. Ming, PML 124, at 382. Although Dr. Roberts testified that meas urements of F2 isoprostanes were the most reliable way of assessing oxidative stress or oxidative injury in the body (Tr. at 2164-65), he also testified that measuring urinary levels of F2 isoprostanes by immunoassay is not reliable. Tr. at 2181-83. He explained that efforts to create a reliable and accurate immunoassay for meas uring prostaglandins have uniformly failed, because biological fluids like urine and plasma contain too many substances that can interfere with antibody binding to these sm all lipid molecules. Tr. at 2182-83. b. Chauhan Study. The Chauhan study, PML 481, compared leve ls of malonyldialdehyde [\"MDA\"]553 in blood drawn from children with autism to that of their neurotypical siblings. The study involved 30 children with autism divided into two groups. These children were eachpaired with a typically developing sibling. The two groups were subjected to differenttesting protocols. Of the 19 children in one group, 12, by parental report, had lost previously acquired skills. 554 Chauhan, PML 481, at 2540-41. Those without language regression were more similar in biomarker results to their typically developing siblings than the children with language regression were to thei r siblings. Chauhan, PML 481, at 2544- 45. Although this suggests a possible biochem ical distinction between autistic children with regression and autistic child ren without loss of skills, the very small numbers make drawing any conclusions from this study problematic, even if t he measurement methods were reliable. As Dr. Roberts testified, the measur ement methods employed were \"totally common phenomenon in ASD. Tr. at 875. Thus, it may be even more difficult to determine whether biomarkers of oxidative stress reflect epilepsy (subclinical or overt) or autism or both. 553 Malonyldialdehyde is a product of the oxidati on of fatty acids. Chauhan, PML 481, at 2541. 554 Doctor Lord noted that parental reports of regression are not always accurate. See Tr. at 3572- 73. As the authors of this study commented, although approximately one-third of children with autism undergo regression, 63% of children in this cohort had reportedly experienced regression. Chauhan, PML 481, at 2541. 214unreliable.\" The type of assay555 used to determine oxidative damage was not specific for MDA,556 which is, in itself, a substance that is not specific for oxidative stress. Tr. at 2178-80. c. James Studies. The James 2004 study, PML 5, compared various plasma metabolites in children with autism to those in aged-matched control ch ildren. The study found biomarkers for impaired methylation capacity557 and oxidative stress in the children with autism. James 2004, PML 5, at 1612-13. The ratio of SAM to SAH was approximately 50% lower in the autistic children (reflecting impai red methylation), and the GSH/GSSG558 ratio was 70% lower in the autistic children (reflecting oxidative stress). Id. In a small subgroup of children with autism (eight children), va rious oral or injectable supplements were tested to improve the metabolic profile. The supplements succeeded in normalizing the methionine cycle metabolites and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Id. at 1613-14. Whether the normalized metabolic profile led to any clin ical improvement was not examined in a scientific and quantifiable manner.559 Id. at 1615. Nineteen of the 20 children in this st udy had experienced regression. James 2004, PML 5, at 1612, 1615. Although the aut hors suggested that the oxidative stress and impaired methylation found in the childr en with regression may have contributed to their regression ( id. at 1615), it may be more accurate to say that it may have 555 The assay was identified as a \"TBARS\" assay. Doctor Roberts testified that this assay cannot reliably measure MDA. Tr. at 2180. He explained that drawing blood causes platelets to activate. Activated platelets contain thromboxane synthase, an enzyme they use to make thromboxane. Tr. at 2179. For every molecule of thromboxane made, platelets also make a molecule of MDA. Thus, usingdetection of MDA in plasma to measure oxidative st ress is not reliable, because the act of drawing blood generates MDA. Tr. at 2180. 556 A lack of specificity means that, in addition to measuring MDA, it also measures other substances. Tr. at 2178. 557 In Rett's disorder, the causative gene mutation is the MECP2 gene. See Rodenhiser and Mann, PML 459, at Table 1. This gene is involved in DNA methylation. Id. at 341. Brain autopsies of patients with ASD have also shown a deficiency in MECP2 expression. Id. at 346. Any impairments in methylation found in the children with ASD may thus stem from a genetic defect, rather than asusceptibility to environmental toxins. 558 See D. Giustarini, et al., Interference of Plasmatic Reduced Glutathione and Hemolysis on Glutathione Disulfide RES. 38(10) 1101-06 (2004) [\"Giustarini\"], filed as RML 206 (discussing problems in using GSH/G SSG measurements based on spontaneous oxidation of GSH). 559 In spite of this disclaimer by the authors, Dr. Deth nevertheless asserted that dietary supplements improved both metabolic profiles and neurologic status. Tr. at 611-12. 215contributed to their autism.560 As only one child with early onset autism was tested, there was no basis to imply that children with regression were metabolically different from those with early onset autism.561 The impetus for the James 2004 study, PML 5, was the similar metabolic profile of a dizygotic twin pair, one with aut ism and the other with Down syndrome.562 The authors noted that children with Down syndrome have lower concentrations of methylation metabolites and lower glutathi one concentrations than control children. Id. at 1611. This does not appear to be supportive of Dr. Deth's hypothesis; the fact that children with Down syndrome, a purely genetic condition, have a metabolic profile more like children with autism than that of typi cally developing children suggests that genetic anomalies in both, rather t han environmental exposures, may account for their unusual metabolic profiles. The James 2006 study, PML 49, also measured various metabolites in plasma, with similar, although not identical findings.563 These included an impairment in methylation capacity (decreased SAM/SAH ra tio) and in antioxidant capacity (decreased glutathione/GSSG ratio). James 2006, PM L 49, at 954. The authors attributed increased plasma GSSG levels to oxidative stress. Id. In both of the James studies, the author s noted the preliminary nature of their findings (PML 5 at 1615; PML 49 at 954). In his article on autism and oxidative stress, Dr. Deth also relied on these two James studies, but in this publication, he noted thatthe James study findings were preliminary. See Deth, PML 563, at 195; Tr. at 638-39. 560 In the James 2006 study, the authors commented on the 2004 study, stating: \"The metabolic profile of children diagnosed with autistic disorder with regressive onset was found to be severelyabnormal.\" PML 49 at 948. Without expressly so stating, the authors imply that children with regressiveautism have a different metabolic profile than children with early onset autism. The authors did not explain that 19 of the 20 children tested in the 2004 study had experienced regression. With only one early onsetsample, no valid statistical comparisons could be made between autism in general and regressive autismwith regard to metabolic profiles. 561 To illustrate the logical fallacy here, if the driving records of red Corvette owners are compared to those of drivers in general, any conclusion about an excess number of speeding tickets received by redCorvette drivers cannot be attributed to the color of the car, rather than to the model, without additionaldata about drivers of Corvettes of other colors. 562 Down syndrome is a purely genetic disorder, associated with three copies of chromosome 21. DORLAND 'S at 1815; James 2004, PML 5, at 1611. 563 Doctor Jones noted that, with regard to the James 2006 study, PML 49, Table II, the levels of metabolites that are the highest are those most likely to be accurately measured. The levels ofcysteinylglycine were very similar in both autistic children and the controls. Tr. at 2746-47. It was the second highest metabolite measured. This finding conflicts with Dr. Deth's assertions that mercuryreduces the level of cysteine and that autistic children are more likely to be affected by this reduction. See Section VII.D.3. 216d. Evaluation of the Studies and Opinions. Doctor Deth relied on altered plasma leve ls of biomarkers for oxidative stress and impaired methylation as indirect evi dence of oxidative stress or damage in the brain. He conceded that plasma levels ma y say little about glutathione levels or even oxidative stress in the brain. However, he commented, \"the fact that the plasma is indicating very significant signs of oxidative st ress at the level of the thiols is creating a very likely hope that the brain will also show that.\" Tr. at 3911 (emphasis added). He added that because plasma levels reflect the me tabolic state of the liver, the source of sulfur resources for the brain, the brain is likely to be affected.564 Tr. at 3911-12. However, the expert on oxidative stress, Dr. Roberts, testified that a finding of oxidative stress in plasma or urine does not i ndicate that there is oxidative stress in the brain because the damage done by free radicals occurs where they are generated. Free radicals do not travel from the periphery to the brain; they react with what is nearby because they are so highly reactive. Tr. at 2173, 2176, 2183, 2185-86. Oxidative stress in the periphery can have many causes. Tr. at 2185. Doctor Jones provided the most significant criticism of Dr. Deth's conclusion that evidence of oxidative stress in children with autism is evidence that oxidative stress is causal of autism. He testified that indi viduals with almost any disease will have lower glutathione levels than those found in healthy controls. This includes conditions as diverse as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, and lungdisease. Reduced glutathione levels appear to be a general response to a diseaseprocess rather than a cause of it. Tr. at 2790. The ubiquity of increased oxidative stress makes it almost valueless as evidenc e of an oxidation-caused injury in ASD. In essence, the James 2004 study compared heal thy children to those with a disorder, with predictable results. Additionally, at least one study indicate s that the GSH/GSSG ratio can be an unreliable marker for the existence of ox idative stress, and that reference values diverge significantly. The Giustarini study measured GSH and GSSG levels in healthy volunteers, finding that plasma GSH can spontaneously oxidize, generating GSSG, and is highly unstable after blood draws. RML 206 at 1102-03. This spontaneous oxidation can result in a 20-30% increase in GSSG. Id. at 1105. Red blood cell hemolysis, caused when drawing blood, and present in epilepsy, can also cause an increase in GSSG. Id. at 1105. 564 I note that Dr. Aposhian expressed skepticis m regarding the utility of measuring glutathione concentrations in the plasma because most glutathione is present in cells, not extracellularly. His criticism of Dr. James for not measuring liver glutathione levels suggests that plasma levels do not, in fact, reflect liver levels. Tr. at 285. Doctor Jones concurred that plasma values do not indicate what is happening in the brain with regard to oxidative stress or injury. Tr. at 2745-46. 2173. Genetic Vulnerabilities to Mercury or Oxidative Stress. Doctor Deth began his discussion of polym orphisms related to oxidative stress with a broad and unsubstantiated stat ement. He testified that: Now, the occurrence of autism is estimated to be one in 150 individuals, by the CDC. And so this tells us t hat exposure to thimerosal or other uniformly exposing agents in our society only affects a subpopulation ofthis society. Tr. at 574. How the prevalence of autism (a correct statement) is related to thimerosal or other environmental agents being causal of ASD was left unspecified. Doctor Deth followed up this statement with a comm ent that \"the subpopulation with autism has certain genetic features.\" Tr. at 574. In general terms, this second statement is correct; there was overwhelming evidence that autism is a highly genetic disorder, even if all of the genes that interact to cause autism have not yet been identified. See Section I V.C.2. Doctor Deth's assertion that these genetic features are connected to a susceptibility to either mercury or oxidative stress was not established by the evidence. Doctor Deth reiterated that genetic susc eptibility was an essential element of his theory of causation. He asserted that children with autism have polymorphisms that adversely affect their ability to: (1) detoxif y or eliminate ethylmercury, (2) maintain normal oxidative and methylation status, and (3) maintain synchronization in neuronal signaling. Report of Dr. Deth, PML 713, at 2. a. Hypersusceptibility to Mercury. For evidence regarding a genetic susceptibilit y to thimerosal, Dr. Deth relied on the same evidence that Dr. Aposhian present ed, asserting that some individuals cannot handle the same level of mercury as others. Tr. at 3917-18. Doctor Deth was quite vague about how many individuals are genetically predisposed to react to TCVs, orwhether this predisposition applied to everyone with ASD (see Tr. at 618), although his comments about \"uniformly exposing agents\" ( see Tr. at 574) suggest that it does. Doctor Deth asserted that an impairm ent in glutathione- based detoxification could be classed as an efflux disorder, but this testimony was based on a shortage ofglutathione. Tr. at 628-29. In view of the overwhelming evidence of the abundance of glutathione in the body, and the low levels of mercury to which children are exposed through vaccines and otherwise, this is unlikely as a biochemical cause for mercuryefflux disorders or hypersusceptibility. The only evidence of a genetic susceptib ility to mercury, other than those proffered by Dr. Aposhian, was the Hornig study, PML 15. This study purportedly found that autoimmune disease-sensitive mice ex posed to thimerosal showed growth delay and other changes, while mice strains with resistance to autoimmunity were not 218affected. The affected mice also exhibit ed alterations at the neuronal cell level, with altered glutamate receptors and tr ansporters. PML 15 at abstract. However, the results from this study could not be duplicated.565 The Berman study, RML 42,566 replicated the Hornig study's protoc ol with very different results. Thimerosal, with and without accompanying va ccines, was injected into the same type of autoimmune disease-sensitive mice used in the Hornig study, modeling the childhood vaccination schedules. Additionally, one cohort of mice received a dose of thimerosal10 times higher than that found in vaccines. 567 RML 42 at abstract. Performance on behavioral tests and on indices of early dev elopment were unaffected by thimerosal administration with the ex ception of locomotor tests in female mice.568 RML 42 at 300. In addition to mirroring the Hornig study, the Berman study included measurements of tissue mercury levels in blood, brain, and kidney, and measured the numbers of hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells.569 It also added tests for social interaction and anxiety. Berman, RML 42, at 295. Co-administration of vaccine and thimerosal did not affect mercury levels in blood, brain, or kidney. Berman, RML 42, at 298. There was no evidence of disruption of the cellular structure of the hippocampus in the mice exposed to thimerosal and vaccines. There was no difference in the numberof neurons nor any evidence of neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus. Berman, RML 42, at 299. The study could not verify any of the Hornig study's findings. See Berman, RML 42, at 304-07. The authors concluded: No evidence was found that exposure to vaccine-associated levels of thimerosal, whether or not in co mbination with vaccine, resulted in abnormal somatic growth or altered the normal development or structure of the hippocampus. No deficits were observed in tests of complexbehaviors that have been considered to be particularly relevant to thestudy of neurodevelopment and its disor ders, including social interaction, 565 Doctor Aposhian agreed that the Hornig study 's findings were not duplicated by the subsequent Berman study. Tr. at 449-50. 566 R. Berman, et al., Low-Level Neonatal Thimerosal Exposur e: Further (2008) [\"Berman\"], filed as RML 42. 567 For both the same dose of thimerosal used by Dr. Hornig and for a dose 10 times higher, no pathological effects were observed. Tr. at 2214-15; Berman, RML 42, at 307. 568 More complex behavioral testing did not show any effect. Berman, RML 42, at 305-06. 569 The hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells have been identified by other studies as abnormal in individuals with Rett's disorder. Hornig, PML 15, at 11 (citing to Amir, RML 10, and a study byBauman and Kemper that was not filed by either party). 219sensory gating, or anxiety. Only limited locomotor effects were observed, and these were primarily in female SJL mice in the open field at 4 weeksof age. Considered together, the overa ll pattern of results of the present study does not indicate marked or per vasive neurotoxicological deficits in neonatal SJL/J mice following injections of vaccine-associated levels ofthimerosal. Particularly relevant to human health concerns, the currentdata do not provide support for the inference that neonatal thimerosal exposure is involved in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders that alter social behaviors such as autism. Berman, RML 42, at 307 (citations omitted). Doctor Johnson testified the mouse strain used by Hornig, the SJLJ mouse, did not, as Dr. Deth inferred in his expert r eport (PML 713 at 4), have any redox enzyme deficiencies. Tr. at 2210-11. He added that there was \"absolutely no data supporting the fact that there is a REDOX enzyme diffe rential. Now, I can understand the reason it's in there is because it supports his hypot hesis in the sensitivity, but that's not an accurate representation of the mice.\" Tr. at 2211. Doctor Deth testified on rebuttal that his laboratory was, at the time of the heari ng, examining glutathione levels in the same two strains of mice Dr. Hornig studied. In the \"thimerosal vulnerable mice\" (apparently referring to the SJLJ mice in the Hornig st udy), Dr. Deth testified that the levels of glutathione were about 40% lower. His l aboratory also measured synthase in the \"thimerosal vulnerable\" mice. Tr. at 3947. These findings were made in the \"last month or six weeks.\" Tr. at 3947. Theseunpublished findings were limited to the biochem istry, not to the behavioral differences observed in the Hornig study, PML 15. Tr . at 3948. Doctor Deth also noted that thimerosal treatment at 10 weeks did not affect the values observed. Tr. at 3948. Doctor Johnson provided another reason fo r crediting the Berman findings over those of the Hornig study. The Hornig paper included slides from the mouse brains to illustrate their findings, as did the Berman st udy. Based on the relative quality of the slides submitted, Dr. Johnson had no confidence in Dr. Hornig's reported results. Tr. at 2211-12. He provided copies of slides from both papers to illustrate the difficulties he had with Dr. Hornig's work. 570 Tr. at 2212. Doctor Johnson described Dr. Hornig's images as \"absolutely awful.\" Tr. at 2213. Based on his experience, Dr. Johnson opined that the tissue samples in the slides were improperly prepared. Tr. at 2213-14. In contrast, Berman's tissue slides571 of brain sections comparable to Hornig's were, in Dr. Johnson's words, \"absolutely beautiful,\" with the cellular architecture clearly 570 See Res. Tr. Ex. 7, slide 5. The picture in the upper right represents the brain section when treated by the \"vehicle,\" referring to the control solution without the vaccine. The picture in the bottomright is the brain section that received the thimerosal. Tr. at 2212. 571 They were reproduced on the left side of Res. Tr. Ex. 7, slide 5. Tr. at 2214. 220reproduced. Tr. at 2214. The defects Dr. Johnson noted on the Hornig slides were obvious, even to an untrained observer. Both studies used antibodi es to stain specific proteins in brain tissue.572 The tissue architecture in Berman's study is more easily discerned. Tr. at 2215-16. The comparable areas on the Horn ig slides show tissue full of holes,573 which may reflect intense nonspecific antibody staining. Tr. at 2217. Doctor Johnson testified that if slides demonstrating this pattern were presented to him, he would tell the researcher to go back and do the experim ent again because the tissue degeneration makes the potential for artifactual data extrem ely high. Tr. at 2217. For these reasons, Dr. Johnson placed more weight on the Berman data than that of Hornig. Tr. at 2218. Doctor Deth attempted to respond to the criticisms offered of the Hornig study, but indicated he was not an expert in histoc hemistry. Tr. at 3945-46. However, he had immunohistochem ical staining for EAAT3, the cysteine transporter, and saw evidence that the EAAT3 transporter was significantly up-regulated in the thimerosal treatment group. This suggested that the cell was making efforts to get more cysteine in response to the thimeros al exposure. Tr. at 3946. He caveated his testimony on this point by stating that he did not have the expertise to make a quality judgment of the histochemical staining tec hniques, and that the interpretation of such staining was subjective. He thought the di fferences Dr. Hornig described were clear. Tr. at 3946-47. Doctor Deth also commented on t he Laurente study, PML 668, involving hamsters administered \"vaccine level\" doses of thimerosal. Tr. at 3953. He noted that t the Laurente paper favored Hornig's findings . Tr. at 3987. However, he agreed that Berman was unable to find an effect in spite of using a considerably higher dose ofthimerosal. 574 Tr. at 3987. In the conflict between the Hornig and Be rman studies, I credit the testimony of Dr. Johnson over that of Dr. Deth. Unlike Dr. Deth, Dr. Johnson did have expertise in histochemical staining. Furthermore, he prov ided evidence for his assertions, unlike Dr. Deth. I am unwilling to rely on Dr. Deth's descriptions of his own work on either the measurements of oxidative biomarkers in the \"thimerosal vulnerable\" mice or with 572 Slides from each study were reproduced on Res. Tr. Ex. 7, slide 4. The two slides on the left were from the Berman study with lines drawn from them to comparable areas in the Hornig slides. Theboxes on the Berman slides were enlarged in the two slides appearing on the bottom right side of Res. Tr. Ex. 7, slide 4, showing the neurons in the clear area. Tr. at 2216-17. 573 This is particularly evident on the Hornig s lides labeled \"c\" and \"d\" appearing on Res. Tr. Ex. 7, slide 4. Tr. at 2217. 574 The Laurente study was discussed in more detail in Section VI.D.2.e., with Dr. Brent explaining that the dosing schedule made the hamsters mercury-toxic. See Res. Ex. EE at 14. 221regard to the EAAT3 cysteine transporter in these mice. His ipse dixit is simply not enough to counter Dr. Johnson's greater exper tise and the contrary findings of no observed effects from the Berman researchers. b. Polymorphisms Relating to Oxidation and Methylation. As evidence that children with autism have polymorphisms that affect their ability to respond to oxidative stress, Dr. Deth relied on the James 2006 study, PML 49. Doctor James focused on polymorphisms, wh ich are normal variants of genes, involved in methylation and transsulfuration.575 Tr. at 574. Doctor James measured metabolites in plasma, and attempted to correlate thos e with various polymorphisms of six different genes involved with metabolic processes. In comparing autistic children to control children, the James 2006 study found that cert ain combinations of polymorphisms that affect methionine metabolism were more likel y to be found in autistic children. James 2006, PML 49, at 953-54; Tr. at 576-77. Based on this study, Dr. Deth asserted that children with autism are genetically more prone to develop oxidative stress and are more likely to be adversely affected by exposure to thimerosal. Tr. at 574, 576-77. James 2006, PML 49, at 953-54. However, the James 2006 study attributed the al tered levels to a genetic predisposition, not to mercury interference. James 2006, PM L 49, at 954. There was no indication that the study focused on autistic children with regression, or that the polymorphisms associated with a higher risk of metabolic anomalies had any connection to regression. Doctor Deth agreed that these polymorphi sms also occur frequently in the general population,576 while suggesting that heavy metal toxicity might be an environmental condition turning the alleles into ri sk factors for ASD. Tr. at 577. The James 2006 study did not report w hether the case children (those with autism diagnoses) had experienced regression nor whether the severity of autism symptoms was associated with severi ty of metabolic imbalance. See PML 49 at 947, 952. The authors also noted that abnorma lities in the methylation cycle and 575 The genes investigated in the James 2006 study involved the two polymorphisms of the gene that controls methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase [\"MTHFR\"], which makes methylfolate for use bymethionine synthase. Tr. at 574. The study also examined the reduced folate carrier [\"RFC\"] gene, whichmanufactures the proteins that transport folate into cells; the transcobalamin II gene, which produces theenzyme that transports cobalamin into cells, affecting the activity of methionine synthase; the catechol-o methyltransferase [\"COMT'] gene, which determines of dopamine action; and glutathione S transferase [\"GST\"] gene, and in particular, the M-1 form of that gene. See James 2006, PML 49, at 953- 54. Certain polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene have been shown to control altered DNA methylation in response to diet, alcohol consumpti on, and hormone replacement therapy. See Rodenhiser and Mann, PML 459, at 343. 576The polymorphisms in the James 2006 study are normal variations, not mutations, and are shared by varying percentages of the population. So me may be present in as many as 50% of the population. Tr. at 619-20. 222transsulfuration pathway have been found in heart disease, cancer, birth defects, and other neurologic disorders. Id. at 953. Based on the differences in frequency of several alleles between control children and those with autism, the authors strongly suggested that the metabolic abnormalities they observ ed in many of the autistic children were genetically influenced. Id. at 954. The specific polymorphisms present in hi gher numbers of autistic children in the James 2006 study contradicted several aspects of Dr. Deth's hypothesis. Table III inthe James 2006 study, PML 49 (reproduced on Dr. Deth's slide 39, Pet. Tr. Ex. 3), listsa number of different polymorphisms for si x genes. Those in which the children with ASD differed significantly from the control ch ildren were listed in bold typeface. Doctor Jones noted that, in several of the genes in which a significant difference was found, thegenetic variant in the autistic children would have a protective effect against oxidative stress. Tr. at 2754-55; Res. Tr. Ex. 9, slide 27. Doctor Deth agreed that some of t he gene variants would have a protective effect, but because of the confidence intervals, he did not think the protective effect was statistically significant. 577 Tr. at 3929-31. An examination of Table IV of the James 2006 study, PML 49, reproduced on Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 40, demonstrates that at least two combinations of polymorphisms that Dr. Deth characterized as demonstrating a risk for oxidative injury suffered from the same problem with confidence intervals, making his assertions unlikely. Another flaw Dr. Jones found in Dr. De th's hypothesis came from the data on polymorphisms in the methionine synthase r eductase gene. Tr. at 2754. The data in the James 2006 study, PML 49, reflect that, in the autistic subjects studied, all of the variations in the gene that codes for meth ionine synthase reductase are associated with a protective effect. Tr. at 2755. The presence in some children with ASD of combinations of polymorphisms associated with higher levels of oxidativ e stress does little to advance Dr. Deth's hypothesis, because nothing associates thes e polymorphisms with a sensitivity to mercury or a propensity to oxidative stress. In view of the strong genetic contribution to ASD, the polymorphisms may simply reflec t genetic differences between children with ASD and the control children. The polym orphisms may reflect part of the causal process in ASD. There is no evidence that suggests the polymorphisms are associated with any susceptibility to environmental toxins in general, or mercury in particular. c. Genetics and Neuronal Signaling. 577 Doctor Deth also testified, based on his own research, that the polymorphisms with a borderline protective effect were not involved in neuronal cells. Tr. at 3930. He did not identify any published studysupporting this assertion, and in view of his broad def inition of \"neuronal cells\" and the focus of his work taking place in neuroblastoma cells with a methionine synthase deficiency, I give this assertion little weight. 223There was no evidence adduced that thos e with autism have any polymorphisms associated with defects in neuronal signaling. Reasoning by analogy, Dr. Deth pointed to a polymorphism associated with neuronal signaling found in increased numbers of those with ADHD, and indicated that a similar signaling defect might be associated with autism. However, his own article indica ted that this particular polymorphism had not been detected in increased numbers in children with autism. Deth, PML 563, at 194. G. Conclusions Regarding Dr. Deth's Assertions. Initially, to someone unacquainted with mercury's toxicology, ASD, or biochemistry, Dr. Deth's opinions on mercur y, oxidative stress, and sulfur metabolism might appear to be solidly based and plausible. After all, mercury can be toxic to cellsand is known to produce neurological injuries. Mercury does bind to glutathione, thebody's primary antioxidant molecule, and thus might be expected to affect adversely the body's oxidative status. Mercury is know n to bind to cysteine transporters, and thus might be expected to affect cysteine levels in cells, and thus adversely affect cells that cannot manufacture their own cysteine, such as neurons. There is evidence to indicatethat mercury can cause proliferation of micr oglia and reductions in astrocyte numbers in at least some areas of the brain, wh ich Dr. Deth equated to the neuroinflammation found in the brains of individuals with ASD. There is some evidence that children with ASD display biomarkers of oxidative st ress in peripheral blood, and may even have some polymorphisms associated with hi gher levels of oxidative stress. However, when critically examined, Dr. Deth's causal assertions fall apart. Mercury, at sufficient doses, is toxic to ce lls, but humans are born with mercury in their brains, blood, and hair as a result of mate rnal exposures. Humans continue to be exposed to mercury throughout their lives, and methods for detoxifying and eliminating mercury have evolved to account for this ex posure. In populations with high mercury exposure, there is no increased incidence of ASD, and thus the low levels once found in vaccines are unlikely to be a cause or a s ubstantial contributor to the condition. Mercury, at sufficient doses, can produce neurological injuries, but not at the levels of mercury found in vaccines. The neurological injuries it produces are wellestablished and do not resemble ASD. A comparison of autopsy findings in mercury'svictims and autopsy findings from individuals with ASD do not show the same patterns of damage or injury. Doctor Deth attempted to demonstrate that vaccine levels of mercury could adversely affect sulfur metabolism and pr oduce oxidative injury in the human brain through a series of experiments on cells in culture. He represented the cells as \"neuronal,\" although they were not neurons and had defects affecting the processes he attempted to measure. His laboratory exper iments, funded largely by contributions from groups associated with the belief that vacci nes cause ASD (ARI and SafeMinds), found adverse effects from doses of mercur y between 100-10,000 times lower than those used by other researchers. Assuming, arguendo , that these experiments were properly 224performed and produced correct results (both points about which I am unconvinced), the experiments contribute little to not hing to the causation hypothesis. In vitro experiments on cells in culture may suggest lik ely avenues for further research, but the complexity of sulfur metabolism pres ented in Dr. Deth's testimony and report demonstrates the robust systems in place in human beings to handle oxidative stress and produce the methylated products needed for cellular functioning, including DNAexpression. I note that Dr. Deth heavily relied on mercury's effects on glutathione, but the evidence overwhelmingly illustrated that glutathione levels in the body would be unaffected by vaccine level doses. Doctor Deth also relied heavily on evidence indicating that children with ASD display peripheral markers of oxidative stre ss, and that brains of those with ASD have evidence of neuroinflammation, which he equat ed to oxidative damage. He failed to mention that oxidative stress in the per iphery is associated with many different diseases, but that peripheral levels do not represent brain redox status. He likewise failed to point out that neuroinflammation is found in many brain disorders and injuries, including those produced by trauma. Thus , a finding of oxidative stress or even oxidative injury says little about mercury as a probable cause of the stress or injurybecause there are so many other possibl e causes, including neuroinflammation as a response to the other pathophysiological findi ngs in the brains of those with ASD. Since ASD is a highly genetic disorder, it is unsurprising that preliminary studies have found some polymorphisms exist in ch ildren with ASD in higher numbers than in neurotypical individuals. It is equally unsur prising that some of these polymorphisms are associated with problems in oxidation or sulfur metabolism. Children with Down syndrome, an entirely genetic diso rder involving mental retar dation, also have oxidative stress levels higher than neurotypical childr en. Children with Rett's disorder, another entirely genetic condition, have impairments in DNA methylation, a sulfur metabolism problem. The preliminary findings in children with ASD say nothing about a genetic susceptibility to mercury or even that the ox idative stress levels found actually affect mercury detoxification. Doctor Deth's own experiments were based on faulty premises regarding methylation of the D4 receptor and defects in methionine synthase activity in human neurons. His experiments detecting effect s of nanomolar levels of mercury on glutathione, cysteine, methylcobalamin, and methionine synthase had so many flaws that they cannot be considered reliable as ev idence. Respondent's experts in oxidative stress, sulfur metabolism, neurodegenerative disorders, and mercury pointed out the serious deficiencies in Dr. Deth's hypot hesis, experiments, and conclusions. Their criticisms, coupled with the flaws in Dr. De th's logic, his own acknowledgment that eliminating TCVs has not produced any decli ne in ASD rates (Tr. at 617-18), and the conflicts between his testimony and what is well established about mercury's toxicology, all convince me that Dr. Deth's hypothesis is not reliable, and cause me to accord histestimony and report little weight. 225Section VIII. The Neuroinflammation Hypothesis. A. Overview. Doctors Deth and Kinsbourne presented hy potheses that involved persistent inorganic mercury in the brain causing neuroinflammation,578 leading to autism. The majority of Dr. Deth's testimony focused on the effects of mercury on sulfur metabolism, leading to a state of oxidative stress in the brain, manifesting with the neuroinflammatory findings reported by the Vargas study, PML 69. His neuroinflammation hypothesis was similar, but not identical, to that of Dr. Kinsbourne, and he was less clear about how the neuroinflammation resulted in ASD. DoctorKinsbourne's hypothesis attempted to fill t hat gap. Doctor Kinsbourne asserted that mercury-induced neuroinflammation caused excitotoxicity, 579 which manifested as overarousal of individuals with ASD, causing autistic behaviors. Doctor Kinsbourne made it clear that his opinion did not depend on that of Dr. Deth, who \"was studying at the molecular level a particular component of the broader process that I was invoking.\" Tr. at 904. However, Dr. Kinsbourne did not tie his neuroinflammation process specifically to Dr. De th's oxidative stress model. Tr. at 905. For purposes of his hypothesis, it did not matter how the neuroinflammation wasproduced. See Tr. at 911-12. However, Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis was based on Dr. Aposhian's opinions about the amount of mercury required to c ause the excitotoxic process he proposed. Tr. at 864. As indicated in Section V I, I did not find Dr. Aposhian's calculations regarding the amount of mercury in the brai n generated from vaccines to be correct. I did not credit Dr. Aposhian's testimony t hat TCVs could produce enough mercury to cause the widespread glial activation necessary to Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis. Nevertheless, because of the role of Dr. Kinsbourne's testimony in the general causation test case, I evaluate his general causation hypothesis 580 as if these 578 One paper defined neuroinflammation as \"chroni c, CNS-specific, , NEUROINFLAMMATION 1: 1-12, 2 (2006) [\"Streit\"], filed as PML 70. According to Dr. Kinsbourne, \"[n]euroinflammation is the brain's innate immune sy stem's response to invading organisms and foreign proteins and toxins.\" PML 717 at 13. It \"is often a ssociated with the activation, proliferation and ultimate disintegration of astrocytes, as well as increase in neural excitability.\" PML 717 at 13. According to Dr.Deth, the term \"neuroinflammation\" implies the presence of oxidative stress involving microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, produced by changes in sulfur metabolism. Tr. at 513-14; Pet. Tr. Ex. 3, slide 4. Itappeared that each expert defined neuroinflamma tion according to his own hypothesis. 579 Excitotoxicity is explained more fully, infra. 580 Doctor Kinsbourne's testimony was limited to the issue of general causation; he did not offer opinions on the three individual Theory 2 cases. Tr . at 777-78. The specific causation opinions were provided by Dr. Mumper, whose opinion with regard to Colin is addressed in Section X.G.2., below. 226evidentiary prerequisites had been met. I conclude that there are other fatal flaws in his hypothesis. The method of injury he proposed would lead to neuronal death, andeventually patient death, not ASD. The brain cell interactions he proposed are not consistent with the complex interactions that actually occur in human brains. Mercury's effects on the brain and the symptoms it produces do not resemble those of ASD. Doctor Kinsbourne's overarousal model of ASD is not new, but it has never been widely accepted because there is no evidence linki ng the behaviors Dr. Kinsbourne attributed to overarousal to physiological m easurements of hyperexcitability. B. Doctor Kinsbourne's Hypothesis. 1. The Hypothesis. Doctor Kinsbourne asserted that neuroinf lammation is the process by which ASDs are caused. Tr. at 814. In attr ibuting to neuroinflammation, 581 Dr. Kinsbourne conceded that neuroinflammation c an have many causes and the specific cause cannot be determined merely by looking at the inflammation. Tr. at 810.Causative agents fall into three categories: viruses; toxins, such as heavy metals 582 or some drugs; and neurodegeneration.583 All three of these causative agents are \"on the differential\" in trying to diagnose the c ause of neuroinflammation. Tr. at 810-12. Because TCVs contain ethylmercury, a heavy metal, they belong on the list of potential causes of autism. They may be identified as causal through the process of differential diagnosis584 when other causes have been ruled ou t. Tr. at 778-79; PML 717 at 3. Diagnosis of ASD as a mercury-induced injury would be \"a conjoined effort by aneurologist and a toxicologist,\" and by a tr eating physician as well. Tr. at 843. 581 Doctor Kinsbourne was clear that he was not asserting that neuroinflammation is autism; rather, it is the process by which autism is caused. Tr. at 814. 582 Mercury is considered a heavy metal. Doctor Kinsbourne would consider any source or form of mercury, including TCVs, in making a differentia l diagnosis of autism caused by mercury-induced neuroinflammation. Tr. at 812. 583 Unless Dr. Kinsbourne intended the term \"neurodegeneration\" to include trauma and congenital injuries, Dr. Kinsbourne's list of causes for neuroinflammation was incomplete. There was substantialevidence that neuroinflammation may be a response to injury. See Section IV.G.4. From other testimony, it appeared that in using the term \"neurodegeneration,\" Dr. Kinsbourne was referring to neurodegenerativediseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, which cause inflammation secondary to neuronal death. Tr. at 811; see also Tr. at 947-48 (chronic neuroinflammation could lead to neurodegeneration). 584 Doctor Kinsbourne described the process of differential diagnosis in the following manner. \"When one is confronted by an individual with a particular problem, be it physical, or mental, or both, it is almost always the case that there's more than one possible cause of the appearances that you see. One then lists to the best of one's ability the various dis ease processes that could lead to that outcome and to the best of available investigative capability tries to find out which one of them it is ruling out the others.\" Tr. at 849. 227In his expert report, Dr. Kinsbourne asserted that: [A] current view holds that ASD can be due to active inflammation involving specific territories of the br ain over many years. One potential cause of such chronic inflammation would be a series of low-doseexposures to organic mercury, doses t oo small to cause substantial acute or focal neuronal damage and death, but doses sufficient to lead to theaccumulation of [inorganic mercury] in astrocytes and microglia. PML 717 at 13. The persistent mercury bur den causes the inflammation to \"become chronic and itself damaging to bystanding neighboring tissues.\" Id. \"[M]ercury in the brain can cause autistic behavior problems, \" and any source of mercury should be considered as a potential cause of autism in a particular child. Tr. at 779, 842-43. He opined that, to a reasonable degree of medi cal certainty, mercury could induce neuroinflammation by affecting brain glutamate levels, 585 and thus result in autistic symptoms.586 Tr. at 779-80, 814-15, 912. The which causes overarousal, which causes the autisti c behaviors. Tr. at 875-76. With persistent mercury in the brain, the mechanism of injury would be ongoing or continuous. Tr. at 839. However, he was \"not at all confi dent whether the amount of mercury in the vaccines is at the level to elicit this infl ammation because that is something that, as I've explained, for which I need assistance from a toxicologist,\" referring to Dr. Aposhian's opinions on brain levels of mercury expect ed from TCV administration. Tr. at 912. 585 Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. Too much glutamate is dangerous because it can damage neurons by causing them to fi re too much and cause seizures, a process called excitotoxicity. Tr. at 797. Glutamate and GABA normally coexist in a ratio that decides the level ofgeneral excitation in the brain. Tr. at 803-04. 586 One of the questions that prompted this response referred to the mechanism of injury \"whereby neuroinflammation might express itself as the symptoms of regressive autism.\" Tr. at 814 (emphasis added). Doctor Kinsbourne's answers did not qualify t he injury mechanism as causing only regressive autism. Indeed, in other testimony, he candidly stated that his mechanism of injury was not limited toregressive autism. Tr. at 901-03. Initially, he stated: \"I'm putting it forward for regressive autism. Whetherit extends to any other kind of autism, I haven't considered it in that context.\" Tr. at 903. He thencontradicted himself: I don't believe for a moment that it only happens in regressive autism. I also believe that it has more than one cause. For example, if one gives a mother terbutaline duringpregnancy and then finds neuroinflammation in the autistic child, that would be another cause of neuroinflammation. I wouldn't be surp rised if there were other viruses than the measles virus and if there were other toxicants than mercury that could do the same thing. I began by saying that there are multiple potential causes. Tr. at 903. When asked again if his hypothesis of neuroinflammation was restricted to regressive autism, he responded: \"No. Not at all.\" Tr. at 904. 228Doctor Kinsbourne acknowledged that the overarousal hypothesis was essentially the same hypothesis he presented in the Theory 1 cases.587 He testified that the mechanism by which the autistic behavio rs were provoked was not specific to mercury or measles virus; it can be caused by anything that triggers neuroinflammation.588 Tr. at 911-12; 4152-53. Do ctor Kinsbourne acknowledged that excess glutamate is not known to be a caus e of regressive autism, or, indeed of any form of autism. Tr. at 908. 2. The Cellular Processes in Neuroinflammation. Doctor Kinsbourne testified that, when conf ronted by an invader or toxin such as mercury, the brain's innate immune system responds by activating microglia. Tr. at 798-99. Activated microglia attack the invadi ng substance by releasing ROS, cytokines, free radicals, and \"other potent ial neurotoxins.\" PML 717 at 13. They may also respond by engulfing the invader. See Tr. at 795 (microglia act as phagocytes). If the invader is successfully eliminated, then the reactive chemical attack stops. If the invader remains, then there may be \"a chronic continuous outpouring of these cytokines and other agents that can now be damaging to astrocytes and damaging to neurons.\" Tr. at 800. In a persistent immune challenge, the number of microglia increase because there is more work for them to do. Tr. at 804. More microgliaincrease the potential for friendly fire to damage astrocytes, which, over time, die. Tr. at 804. Astrocytes regulate the levels of glutamate in brain synapses 589 through transporters and receptors on the astrocytes that absorb excess glutamate. PML 717 at 18; Tr. at 797-98. Microglia also medi ate the uptake and removal of excitotoxic neurotransporters, including glut amate, from the area of t he synapses. Pardo, PML 72, at 489. The chemical agents, such as proi nflammatory cytokines, released by \"friendly 587 During the Theory 1 cases, Dr. Kinsbourne testified that the mechanism of injury-the glutamate-excitation hypothesis-was t he weakest part of his hypothesis. See Tr. at 912-13. During the Theory 2 cases, he acknowledged this earlier testimony, but explained that this part of his hypothesis had\"gotten stronger.\" He had not examined the issue of TCVs during the Theory 1 cases, and thus had notformed an opinion about TCV causation at that time. Tr. at 913-15. He began to consider the question of mercury only very recently, when he realized that mercury could cause the same neuroinflammation as viruses. Tr. at 915-17. 588 Doctor Kinsbourne admitted that portions of his testimony in the Cedillo Theory 1 case (which involved his theory of virus-caused neuroinflammation) were virtually identical to his report in the Theory 2 cases. Tr. at 916. A comparison of page 16 of his report in Snyder with page 13 of his general causation report (PML 717) in the Theory 2 cases reflects t hat the only changes involved substituting \"thimerosal- containing vaccines\" for \"measles virus.\" Tr. at 917-18. 589 Neurons do not directly connect with each other. The gaps between neurons are called synapses, which are bridged chemically. Tr. at 796. 229fire\" can block transporters on the astrocyt es, impairing their ability to mop up excess glutamate. Astrocyte interaction with acti vated microglia can also by the astrocytes. Tr. at 801; PML 717 at 18. Because the astrocytes mediate the microg lial attack by being \"first in the firing line,\" the reactive chemicals released by t he microglia might not cause direct neuronal damage. Tr. at 801. However, neurons may be damaged indirectly. If damagedastrocytes are not scavenging glutamate, it accumulates, \"shifting the excitation- inhibition balance in the direction of overex citation,\" and causing glutamatergic cells to fire more frequently. PML 717 at 18. This c auses a general excitation of many parts of the brain and the level of excitation may be so great as to kill neurons. Tr. at 802; see also PML 717 at 21 (explaining harmful effect s of excess glutamate on neurons). When the astrocytes malfunction or die, glutamat e excesses occur, and, over time, there will be an increase in microglia, a decrease in as trocytes, an increase in gliosis, and, in severe cases, a loss of neurons. Tr. at 805. Doctor Kinsbourne relied on the Asc hner 2000 and Aschner 2007 articles 590 as evidence for this mechanism of injury. The Aschner 2007 study, PML 570, focused onthe role of astrocytes in mediating methylme rcury neurotoxicity. Citing to earlier studies, the authors noted that methylmercury prefer entially accumulates in astrocytes and inhibits astrocytic glutamate concentrations neurons PML 570 286; see also PML 717 at 16. Doctor Kinsbourne noted this was the same ex citotoxic process he had described. Tr. at 817. From these articles by Aschner and others, Dr. Kinsbourne concluded that mercury would create astrocytic death and microglial activation. Tr. at 872; see also PML 717 at 16 (\"[Inorganic mercury] is also a medically reasonable cause of neuroinflammation and its sequelae in some children.\"). Doctor Kinsbourne stressed that the neuroinflammatory process he described would cause abnormal functioning of neurons , not generalized neuronal death. Tr. at 823-24. Astrocytic death was likewise not a necessary condition; his hypothesis merely required that astrocytes be suffi ciently impaired to permit glutamate to rise out of control and produce overexcitation in neurons. Tr. at 933. Even if the astrocytes themselves were not harmed by mercury, the presence of mercury in the astrocytes could attract an immune attack by the microglia, killing or damaging the astrocytes. Tr. at 934. 3. Mercury and Neuroinflammation. 590 Aschner 2000, PML 568; Aschner 2007, PML 570. The Aschner 2007 article, PML 570, was primarily a literature survey, followed by a depi ction of a proposed role for oxidative stress in methylmercury toxicity. PML 570 at 288-90. I note that the article focused solely on methylmercury toxicity, and did not indicate whether the methyl mercury had demethylated to inorganic mercury before generating its purported effects on various cellular processes. Neither Aschner study identified thequantity of mercury necessary to cause the effects described. 230Although he deferred to a toxicologist concerning the quantity of mercury necessary to induce neuroinflammatory effects (Tr. at 860, 867), Dr. Kinsbournediscussed mercury's role in neuroinflammation at some length. He agreed that some of the inorganic mercury in every brain came from sources other than TCVs. Tr. at 813- 14, 860. He opined \"that mercury, in su fficient amounts, will set up the process of neuroinflammation with its consequences...regardle ss of the vehicle in which it comes, whether it's mercury vapor, or whether it's a vaccination, or whether it's fish, anything.\" Tr. at 860. He left it to others to a scertain that TCVs contained enough mercury to cause autism by the neuroinflammatory mec hanism he described. Tr. at 856, 862-63. He did, however, address timing. With respect to mercury from TCVs, he stated that ethylmercury was \"likely to enter the br ain while it is still detectable in the blood, so it will perhaps be a few weeks.\" 591 Tr. at 856. Vaccination with a TCV would result in a chronic low dose exposure because the ethy lmercury degrades to inorganic mercury, which remains chronically present. Tr. at 858. The process of conversion to mercuric mercury would take from weeks to months. Tr. at 859. The deethylized ordemethylized metallic mercury would remain in the brain to elicit the inflammatory actions Dr. Kinsbourne discussed, causing autistic symptoms. See Tr. at 858-59. He would expect the immune system to react to toxins by producing inflammation within days or a few weeks. Tr. at 896. Some response might occur almost immediately after the toxin enter ed the brain, but the response might only become clinically apparent later. Tr. at 897. He could not definitively set the lower and upper bounds of the appropriate reaction time. Tr. at 897-98. Under his theory, the neuroinflammation w ould continue as long as the inorganic mercury remained present. Logically, the infl ammation would subside if the amount of mercury decreased, and increase if the amount of mercury increased, but Dr. Kinsbourne did not have any empirical evidence for either scenario. Tr. at 899-900; 4154-56. On rebuttal, he changed his position, indicating that the glutamate excess would not continue to increase as the i norganic mercury increased. He hypothesized that some of the regulatory mechanisms pres ent in the body controlled the excess to a degree, preventing the glutamate excess fr om killing neurons. Tr. at 4153-56. For evidence that the mercury in TCVs was sufficient, he relied upon Dr. Aposhian's report and some literature that s uggested that toxicologists could determine that sufficient mercury would reach the brai n. Tr. at 864-65. His report concluded: [I]t is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability that a 591 I note that this statement conflicted with the evidence in the Burbacher infant monkey study, which found blood levels of mercury in the ethylmer cury-dosed monkeys cleared very rapidly, on the order of about 8 days. Burbacher, PML 26, at 1019. In the Pichichero 2002 study, blood mercury levels in thetwo-month-old infants were measured 3-21 days after vaccination, and in about 1/3 of the samples,mercury levels were below the limit of detection. See PML 223 at 1738-39. 231series of TCVs can result in or c ontribute to an accumulation of [inorganic mercury] in the brain. The me rcury in the brain may trigger an inflammatory response in some children...that results in ahyperglutamatergic state. PML 717 at 24. When questioned about this statement, Dr. Kinsbourne emphasized that a toxicologist would have to determine whether the amount of mercury in TCVs was sufficient, responding: \"In other words, in my differential diagnosis I would consult a toxicologist.\" 592 Tr. at 866-67. Although everyone is exposed to some amount of mercury, and most children who were vaccinated in the 1990s received TCVs, only a small minority develop anASD. To explain why only some childr en exposed to mercury develop an ASD, Dr. Kinsbourne postulated a genetic susceptibility in these individuals. He asserted that the genetic vulnerability in autism is such that a particular event, which is harmless to mostpeople, is harmful to a subset. Tr. at 852-53. He testified that he could not provide the specific neurobiological basis for why so me people become autistic, although most do not, after TCV exposure. He had not worked out what their vulnerability was, and could not state that it resulted from a lowered threshold for mercury's effects. All he could say is that the great majority of children who received TCVs emerged unscathed. Tr. at 853-55. He indicated that individuals with autism have glutamate receptor and transporter abnormalities, implying that these abnormalities may enhance mercury's neuroinflammatory effects. PML 717 at 18. However, he could not identify what would determine why one person would have excess gl utamate as the result of inorganic mercury and another would not. Tr. at 4153-56. He knew of no quantitation of the amount of excess glutamate needed to produce the excitatory effects he postulated. Tr. at 4158-59. Doctor Kinsbourne summarized the mechanism of injury as:[M]icromolar (trace) amounts of me rcury derived from the breakdown of several different mercury compounds can damage astrocytes, releasingglutamate flow from control, damage the glutamate transporters on neurons, with similar consequences, compromise the function ofmitochondria in the energy metabolism of cells, and lead not only to 'anunimpeded cytotoxic cycle' [citing to Aschner 2007, PML also an overactivated brain state. PML 717 at 17. 592 At the time he wrote this opinion regardi ng TCVs and neuroinflammation, Dr. Kinsbourne had not directly consulted a toxicologist. However, he wa s aware of Dr. Aschner's work reporting that mercury in the brain could cause microglial activation and inhibi tion of glutamate reuptake. Tr. at 870. I note that the transcript referred to \"glutamate reactate.\" Tr. at 870. From context, including the articles Dr.Kinsbourne was citing, the transcript should have read \"glutamate reuptake.\" 2324. Overarousal as a Result of Excitatory-Inhibitory Imbalance. This subsection sets forth the testimony and sections of Dr. Kinsbourne's report in which he explains his overarousal hypothesis . There are internal, as well as external, contradictions in Dr. Kinsbourne's testim ony and report, which are addressed below. a. Doctor Kinsbourne's Model. In what Dr. Kinsbourne characterized as the \"overarousal model\" of autism, excess glutamate increases the excitation-i nhibition ratio, resulting in behavioral overarousal. Tr. at 824. He claimed that \"[a]utistic behavior is precisely what one would expect if the brain's excitati on/inhibition ratio were skewed in favor of excitation (as occurs in hyperglutamatergic states).\" PML 717 at 20. He noted that \"the higher functioning majority [of the ASD population]593 was overaroused\" but that \"a substantial minority of patients seems lethargi c and underaroused,\" and that those with underarousal were those most intellectually handicapped.594 PML 717 at 20. He cited to an article by Baron, PML 550,595 and to his own questionnaire study, Liss, PML 373,596 as support for these statements. He conceded that the overarousal model could not apply to all cases of autism, but might apply to most. PML 717 at 20. 593 In view of the otherwise unchallenged evi dence of the high association between ASD and mental retardation ( see, e.g. , DSM-IV-TR at 69), Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion that higher functioning autistic individuals constitute a majority of those with ASD is incorrect. He offered no support for this assertion. 594 This statement, coupled with his testimony that those with regressive autism tended to be those more severely affected (Tr. at 780-81), sets up a conflict. If those with regressive autism are moreseverely affected and those who are more severely affected are those who are underaroused, theoverarousal hypothesis cannot account for their behavior. 595 This article was not filed. One page from a book edited by M. Grace Baron and others was filed as PML 550. The page cited a study by Goodwin examining cardiovascular responses in fiveindividuals with autism. Another page from what wa s identified as the Goodwin study on the Petitioners' Master Reference List was filed as PML 496. This page is the mean heart rate level for \"J.L,\" who was nototherwise identified. Based on the Baron article, Dr. Kinsbourne contended that autistic subjects have higher basal heart rates, a result of a higher rate of functioning of the sympathetic nervous system and reflecting a state of overarousal. Tr. at 825-26. Whether someone looks aroused is not the same th ing as arousal from a physiological standpoint. According to Dr. Rutter, the Goodwin paper first reviewed the problems other researchers hadencountered in assessing whether someone appeared to be aroused and tying that appearance tophysiologic evidence of arousal. The authors then co mpared responses in five individuals with autism and five controls, attempting to find physiologic evidence fo r arousal. The study was small, and, like the earlier research, its results were inconclusive. Tr. at 3316-17. 596 Doctor Kinsbourne is listed as the senior researcher on this study. He described his role as developing the questionnaire used to query parents about \"o verfocusing.\" Tr. at 910-11. Doctor Rutter described the Liss paper, PML 373, as a questionnaire study of parents describing their children'sresponses to sensations. Tr. at 3317-18. The weakness of the study was its use of observations of thechildren's responses, rather than objective measurement s of responses to sensory stimuli. Tr. at 3318. 233According to Dr. Kinsbourne, this creates \"a situation which is consistent with one of the existing models of what brain c hange it is that underlies autistic behavior and which I called in my report 'the overarousal model.'\" Tr. at 824. This proposed model connected neuroinflammation to manifestations of autistic behavior. Tr. at 824-25. He contended, citing his own 1980 article, PML 460,597 that autistic symptomatology could be accounted for as either an attempt to esc ape from the effects of overarousal or the effects of overarousal. PML 717 at 20. b. Tying Overarousal to Autistic Behavior. According to Dr. Kinsbourne, the cons equences of this state of overarousal manifest as three types of autistic behavior. Tr. at 826. First, as arousal increases, focus of attention constricts. As an exam ple, Dr. Kinsbourne pointed to the restricted focus of autistic individuals. Rather t han looking at a person's face, an autistic individual might focus only on an ear. Tr. at 827. He suggested that this is what makes autistic individuals disproportionately better at simple tasks rather than complex ones. Tr. at 829; see also PML 717 at 20 (pointing to echolalia as a consequence of overarousal). The second category of manifestation is seeking environments that are low in stimulation. Tr. at 829. I ndividuals with ASD do not tolerate change well. Tr. at 830. They acquire very detailed information in very narrow categories. Tr. at 830-31; see also PML 717 at 22 (attributing to overarousal failures in tests of \"theory of mind,\" 598 as well as the tendency of those with ASD to be solitary and engrossed in unusual topics). The third category involves responses to overstimulation. When placed in new situations, children with autism go out of control as a result of overstimulation. Short of these \"meltdowns,\" children c onfronted with too much stim ulation engage in stereotypic behaviors such as hand flapping, whirling, and repetitive finger motions, all of which serve an internal purpose of dearousing. Tr . at 832. Doctor Kinsbourne interpreted certain behaviors, such as lining things up, as a self-soothing mechanism to hold downthe level of stimulation. Tr. at 831. He called them adaptive preferences for dealing with threatening environm ents. Tr. at 832; see also PML 717 at (attributing stereotypic behaviors as attempts to lower neural excitation levels and \"stimming\" as an 597 M. Kinsbourne, Do Repetitive Movement Patterns in Children and Animals Serve a Dearousing Function? J. DEVEL. & BEHAV . PEDIATRICS 1(1): 39-42 (1980), filed as PML 460. In his expert report, Dr. Kinsbourne either mistakenly indicated that this article was published in 1987 or was referring to another article. See PML 717 at 20. His citation to page 117 of PML 460 suggests that he may have had another article in mind, as PML 460 ends on page 42. 598 The ability to understand others through assessing social situations has been called the \"theory of mind.\" Tr. at 3270-71. Doctor Rutter explained that neurotypical individuals are good at recognizing what others are thinking from social context and behavio ral clues. Autistic individuals are not. Tr. at 3271- 72. 234action performed for its calming effects, and gaze avoidance and the need for sameness as \"defensive\" efforts to minimize overarousing inputs). He also attributed epilepsy and subclinical EEG disturbances, which are common in those with ASD, to overexcitation. PML 717 at 18, 21; Tr. at 875-76. Doctor Kinsbourne asserted that EEG studies and neuroimaging show that some brain systems, such as the amygdala, are overar oused in those with ASD, but did not identify any specific studies for this point. Tr. at 826. 5 Studies Cited in Support. a. Overview. Although Dr. Kinsbourne cited a number of studies as supporting his model of autism as a consequence of an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, many either do notsupport the points for which he cited them or the points he made were taken out of context. Doctor Rust generally characteriz ed Dr. Kinsbourne as overstating the support found in these studies. Tr. at 2487. What emerges when these studies are critically examined is validation for Dr. Rust's charac terization. The data Dr. Kinsbourne cited are not representative of t he studies' findings, and much of the data contained in the studies do not support Dr. Kinsbourne's hypot hesis. As Dr. Rust further observed: \"Prominent countervailing data and theories are not considered.\" Tr. at 2465. An occasional misstatement of a study might be expected in any expert's analysis of such complex issues. However, the pattern that emerges in Dr.Kinsbourne's citations is not that of an o ccasional misstatement. A scientist might well pick data from many different sources to serve as circumstantial evidence for a particular hypothesis, but a reliable expert w ould not ignore contrary data, misstate the findings of others, make sweeping statem ents without support, and cite papers that do not provide the support asserted. In the subsections below, I set forth Dr. Kinsbourne's assertions regarding the support for his hypothesis found in specific st udies or groups of studies, immediately followed by any issues concerning his asse rtions. I defer most critical comments concerning his overall hypothesis to subsection C., below. b. The Studies. (1) Neuropathology Studies. 599 599 Because most of the neuropathology studies were in general agreement with one another, these studies are addressed as a group. Doctor Kinsbourne's assertions regarding the Vargas and Lopez-Hurtado papers are addressed separately below. 235Doctor Kinsbourne addressed several of the findings from the neuropathology studies, and asserted that their pathophysiology findings can be associated with autistic symptoms. PML 717 at 15. Doctor Rodier disagreed, testifying that most findings from these studies could not be linked to a particu lar autistic symptom or behavior. Tr. at 3038-39. Doctor Kinsbourne also commented that the timing of TCV administration coincided with a vulnerable period of brai n development. Inorganic mercury present during this period would induce \"disruptions of glial cell function [leading] toabnormalities in brain development and maturation.\" PML 717 at 15. He neglected tomention that the neuropathology studies strongly indicated that the brain development and maturation processes in ASD were largely of prenatal origin. See Section IV.G.6. Doctor Kinsbourne identified gliosis, found in the brains of autistic individuals in the Bailey study filed as PML 90,600 as supportive of his hypothesis, calling gliosis \"a sequel [sic] of the death of astrocytes in in flammation.\" PML 717 at 13. Doctor Rust disagreed with his characterization, noting t hat gliosis is a nonspecific finding that occurs in many brain diseases where there is no evidence for toxins or infection. Tr. at 2487; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 67. Doctor Johns on pointed out that gliosis is not astrocyte death. Tr. at 2243-44. Doctor Kinsbourne noted that pyramidal cells are particularly vulnerable to excitotoxic damage due to glutamate.601 PML 717 at 18. In the next sentence of his report, he appeared to conflate pyramidal cells with Purkinje cells, noting that the loss of Purkinje cells in those with autism had been demonstrated, and might \"in some cases represent the cytotoxic e ffect.\" PML 717 at 18; see also Tr. at 881 (acknowledging that Bauman and Kemper found fewer Purkinje ce lls than expected in the cerebellum). Doctor Kinsbourne testified that inorganic mercury was the likely source of the Purkinje cell loss, stating: \"I would expect inorganic mercury to set up the excitotoxicity potential that I've described, and, if there is excitotoxicity, the Purkinje cells are a very likely target because they're more vulnerable to excitotoxicity than most other cell types in the brain.\" Tr. at 878; see also Tr. at 881. He did not identify any source for the statement that ethylmercury or inorganic me rcury caused the loss of Purkinje cells, and 600 Doctor Kinsbourne cited this study as \"Bailey et al. (1998b PMRL #0090).\" It appears that Dr. Kinsbourne may have meant the Bailey study at PML 220, rather than the Bailey study at PML 90. TheBaily 1995 study, PML 90, is a twin study; the Baily 1998 study, PML 220, is one of the autopsy studies. 601 The cited article, M. Hamann and J. Rossi, et al., The electrical response of cerebellar Purkinje neurons to simulated ischaemia , BRAIN 128: 2408-20 (2005), filed as PML 494, deals with the electrical response of rat and mice Purkinje cells to ischemia, a lack of blood. Doctor Kinsbourne's report referredto pyramidal cells, which are only mentioned in the arti cle in passing. Even if the reference to pyramidal cells is a typographic error, the study is not supportive. It did not examine the vulnerability of Purkinje cellsto excitotoxic damage; it examined the electrical res Purkinje cells to ischemia. Purkinje cells release glutamate when blood flow is cut off. 236I was unable to find one. Given the strong evidence that the loss of Purkinje cells occurred long before birth, Dr. Kinsbourne's attribution of their loss to inorganic mercury, presumably from TCVs, has a timing problem as well. See Section IV.G.3.b. When confronted with evidence that one of the studies upon which he relied stated that Purkinje cells were not damaged by methylmercury exposure602 PML 568, at 201-02), Dr. Kins bourne's response was more than a little illogical. He testified that he was not attri buting the loss of Purkinje cells directly to mercury poisoning, but rather to the excitotoxi c effects of mercury. Tr. at 881-83, 879. That is, he was saying that high doses of me thylmercury (which converts to inorganic mercury) will spare Purkinje cells, but low-dose exposure will kill them through excitotoxicity caused by inorganic mercury. The evidence established that doses of mercury sufficient to cause harm spared Purkinje cells, while damaging other cell types. Doctor Kinsbourne agreed that methylmerc ury, but not ethylmercury, produced the loss of granular cells, another type of neur on. He also agreed that, at large enough doses, mercury will kill neurons. Tr. at 878-81. He acknowledged that \"in methylmercury poisoning, which we don't have in autism, the granule cells are morevulnerable than the Purkinje cells to being killed.\" Tr. at 883. Rather than providing the \"dramatic support\" for his hypothesis that Dr. Kinsbourne asserted they did (PML 717 at 13), the pathophysiology studies undermined it, both in terms of the likely prenatal orig ins of the brain anomalies observed in those studies, and in the findings regarding specific cell types. Doctor Casanova's studies 603 602 The fact that methylmercury damages granule cells, but spares Purkinje cells, and that ethylmercury causes far less damage to granule cells and likewise spares Purkinje cells does not appear to be in controversy, except perhaps for Dr. Kinsbourne. See Clarkson 2002, PML 182, at 13 (attributing ataxia from methylmercury to the loss of the granule cells, and noting that neighboring Purkinje cells arelargely spared); Magos 1985, PML 175, at abstract and 263 (granule cell damage observed in rat brainsafter high levels of methylmercury exposure, but much less damage observed after higher levels ofethylmercury exposure; no damage to Purkinje cells noted); Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 631 (inhuman methylmercury poisoning, damage was restricted to focal areas of the brain, the granule cell layer of the cerebellum; adjacent Purkinje cells spared). 603 During rebuttal, Dr. Kinsbourne testified that one of Dr. Casanova's articles (filed as both PML 274 and RML 62) supported his hypothesis. Tr. at 4121-22; 4161-63. He referred to the followingstatement: Among several conceptual classifications, aut ism has been considered a disorder of the arousal-modulating systems of the brain. A ccording to this theory, autistic individuals experience a chronic state of overarousal and exhibit abnormal behaviors to diminish this arousal. The arousal theory is of some intere st because it is consistent with a reduction of inhibitory interneuronal activity. RML 62 at 431 (citation omitted). This citation serv es as yet another example of Dr. Kinsbourne \"cherry- picking\" data. The article itself asserts that the minicolumnar abnormalities occurred during gestation,hardly supportive of Dr. Kinsbourne's postnatal merc ury hypothesis. After the overarousal statement 237did not find a loss of pyramidal cells, the resu lt predicted by Dr. Kinsbourne's assertions that they were particularly vulnerable to mercury's effects. Granule cells are damaged by methylmercury, but much less damage to granule cells is caused by ethylmercury. This suggests that the damage to these neuronal cells occurs before demethylation and is thus attributable by species to methylme rcury. However, Dr. Kinsbourne asserted that inorganic mercury was the cause of neuroinflammation. The loss of granule cells occurs in autism only when the associated Purkinje cells are also lost. See Vargas, PML 69, at 78-79 (noting granule cell loss in t he area of missing Purkinje cells). Doctor Kinsbourne could not explain why high-dose exposure would spare cells, but low-dose mercury exposure would damage them or impair their function. (2) Lopez-Hurtado Study, PML 446. Doctor Kinsbourne relied on the Lopez-Hur tado study's findings of decreased density of neurons and increased density of g lial cells as evidence of neuronal death with gliosis. PML 717 at 13. However, hi s model did not predict neuronal death. Tr. at 881. As Dr. Johnson noted, the findings of neuronal loss in this study were notconsistent with Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis of a steady state of astrocyte death and dysfunction without a progressive disease pr ocess leading to neuronal death. Tr. at 2262. (3) The Vargas Study, PML 69. Like Dr. Deth, Dr. Kinsbourne also relied heavily on the Vargas study, PML 69, which found evidence of chronic inflammation and \"an active ongoingneuroinflammatory process in the brain.\" PM L 717 at 14. He testified that the Vargas study found some problems with neurons, but did not find much gliosis. Tr. at 835. quoted above, Dr. Casanova continued: It is known that the cortex contains inhibitory double bouquet cells that define minicolumnar organization for the brain, or what one researcher calls a \"strong verticallydirected stream of inhibition.\" The late ral inhibition caused by the GABAergic neurons helps to ensure individual minicolumn discreteness and during development, to impel adjacent minicolumns into establishing connec tions with functionally dissimilar sets of thalamic neurons. RML 62 at 431 (citations omitted). Read in cont ext, Dr. Casanova's statements have nothing to do with the brain-wide excitatory imbalance caused by me rcury that Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis proposes. Doctor Casanova proposed that, if in minicolumn development, certain connective patterns are notformed, an individual's ability to \"discriminate betw een competing types of sensory information\" may be impaired. Id. This is not support for a postnatal state of overexcitation with neurons firing too frequently. Rather than a global brain excitation-inhibition imbal ance, Dr. Casanova mentions the possibility of one occurring within the minicolumnar structure. 238The microglial activation from the Vargas study and gliosis604 from the Lopez-Hurtado study supported his view that the brains of individuals with ASD display chronic activity and reactivity. Tr. at 836-37, 876. Acco rding to Dr. Kinsbourne, Vargas study reported \"sweating\"605 of the microglia, some edema, and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines. Tr. 876; see also PML 717 at (neuroinflammation \"is characterized by edema, activation of mi croglia...and local invasion of immune cells from the circulation\"). Based on his hy pothesis of astrocytic death and microglial activation, Dr. Kinsbourne would expec t these neuropathological findings. According to Dr. Kemper, Dr. Kinsbourne was incorrect when he said that edema was a characteristic of neuroinflammation. Tr. at 2849. Doctor Kemper testified that his own research had found no evidence of edema in neuroinflammation and that the Vargas researchers had not recorded its presence.606 Tr. at 2849. Doctor Rust testified that Dr. Kins bourne misstated the findings and conclusions of Drs. Vargas and Pardo. Tr. at 2490-92. The Pardo paper indicated that neuroinflammation may represent a nonspecific repair process.607 Tr. at 2493; Pardo, PML 72, at 492. Doctor Rust noted that Dr. Pardo's letter (Res. Ex. BB at 3) made it clear that the Vargas study did not find a to xic basis for the observed inflammation. Tr. at 2493. Doctor Rust also explained that the Vargas study's findings with regard to 604 Doctor Kinsbourne equated gliosis with astrocyte death. See Tr. at 876. The Vargas study reported astrocytic activation, not astrocytic death. PML 69 at 71. 605 Doctor Kinsbourne did not define this term and I could not find the term in the Vargas study. 606 I did not find the term \"edema\" in the Vargas study, nor any references to swelling or increased fluid levels. During rebuttal, Dr. Kinsbourne was asked if the Petropoulos study ( see H. Petropoulos, et al., Grey matter abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder revealed by T2 relaxation , NEUROLOGY 67: 632- 36 (2006) [\"Petropoulos\"], PML 320) supported his statement that neuroinflammatory processes\"are typically accompanied by edema.\" He indicated that it could. Tr. at 4127-29. The authors did indicate that edema could account for some of the MRI findings in their study. They did not, however, indicate that edema was present, and noted that as the brain matures, fluid in brain matter is replaced by myelin and increased axon growth; the higher water c ontent they found might indicate slower brain development consistent with developmental del ay, rather than edema. PML 320 at 635. 607 Unlike the Vargas study, the Pardo article actually mentioned oxidative stress. The authors commented: [T]he precise role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis and natural history of autism is still uncertain. Studies in animal models and other neurological disorders suggest thatmicroglial activation and neuroinflammation may play a role in processes of injury as thereis increased oxidative stress and tissue injury, however, there is also recent evidence that neuroinflammation may be associated with repair processes and regeneration . Pardo, PML 72, at 492 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). 239cytokines were very complicated because cytokines serve functions other than their role in inflammatory diseases, including role s in normal brain development. Because cytokines are present in many diseases, their presence does not necessarily indicate the presence of a condition causing inflammati on. Tr. at 2492. Doctor Rust also noted that cytokines and chemokines are present in brain tissue and CSF in a number of conditions known to be genetically determined, such as Rett's disorder and tuberoussclerosis. Tr. at 2493; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 73. Doctor Kemper also took issue with t he conclusions Dr. Kinsbourne drew from the Vargas and Pardo papers. Echoing Dr. Rust's remarks about neuroinflammation, Dr. Kemper testified that developmental abnormalities persisting since gestation could produce microglial activation, and that those developmental abnormalities would be consistent with the presence of neuroinflamma tion. Tr. at 2850-51. He noted that one of the major points of the Vargas paper was that microglial activation could act as a neuroprotective process. 608 Tr. at 2851. The Vargas study found evidence of neur oinflammation in the brains of ASD patients, which provides support for Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis. However,neuroinflammation is such a nonspecific finding that its presence does little to advance the specific mechanism of injury Dr. Kinsbourne proposed. Further, the study found neuroinflammation in those with and without devel opmental regression, undercutting the link petitioners drew between neuroinflammati on and regressive autism. The authors did not conclude that neuroinflammation causes autism. Tr. at 2854. They noted that it might represent a response to injury, rat her than its cause. The Courchesne 2005 paper, relied upon by petitioners, similarly inte rpreted the Vargas study's findings. PML 104 at 589-90. (4) The James 2006 Study, PML 49. Also like Dr. Deth, Dr. Kinsbourne relied on the James 2006 study, PML 49, to demonstrate that autistic children may be \"parti cularly vulnerable\" to \"oxidative stress.\" PML 717 at 14. The same criticisms of this study noted in Section VII.F.3.b. apply to Dr. Kinsbourne's assertions. (5) The Block Study.609 Doctor Kinsbourne noted that \"[m]icr oglial activation and inflammation are implicated in a diverse range of neurologi cal diseases, particularly neurodegenerative 608 I note that respondent's counsel asked many leading questions of Dr. Kemper during this portion of his testimony. 609 M. Block and J. Hong, Microglia and inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration: Multiple triggers with a common mechanism , PROG. NEUROBIOL . (electronic publication with no further citation (2005) [\"Block\"], filed as PML 559. 240diseases.\" PML 717 at 14 (citing Block, PML 559). This 2005 literature survey does, indeed, stand for this proposition. However, the article also notes that \"the gradual accumulation of neuronal death and the increase in disease severity across time is aunifying theme across the diverse classifi cations of neurodegenerative disease.\" Block, PML 559, at 2. As death of neurons is not part of Dr. Kinsbourne's model because neuronal death is not generally seen in ASD , the paper's findings with regard to neuronal death undercut Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis that ASD is the result of a steady state of neuroinflammation. The authors note that activated microglia should not be classed \"as exclusively beneficial or inherently deleter ious, [and] it is likely that microglia can serve both functions.\" Id. at 3. The article discussed the role of activated microglia in a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's, HIV dementia , multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's. Id. at 4-6. The article generally discussed neur onal death caused by microglial activation, and microglial activation in response to neuronal injury and death. (6) The Aschner 2007 and Mutkus Studies. For evidence of mercury-induced neurotox icity, Dr. Kinsbourne cited to the Aschner 2007 study, PML 570. According to Dr. Kinsbourne, this study summarizedevidence demonstrating that mercury compounds \"preferentially accumulate in the astrocytes, and inhibit their uptake of glutam ate.\" PML 717 at 16; Tr. at 823. He also cited to the Mutkus study, PML 571, 610 for this point. The Aschner 2002 article also indicated that chronic mercury exposur e induces astrocyte swelling and that methylmercury mediates neurotoxicity via it s effects on glutamate, causing excessive concentrations of excitatory amino acids. PML 568 at 200. Doctor Kinsbourne noted that these were the same points made in t he Aschner 2007 article. Tr. at 821-23. He cited to several other studies indicati ng that neuronal dysfunction due to mercury exposure is primarily due to disturbances in as trocytes, as well as an inhibitory effect on neuronal glutamate transporters. See PML 717 at 16. The Aschner articles do provide some evidence for Dr. Kinsbourne's assertions that mercury affects glutamate uptake by astrocytes and that mercury preferentially accumulates in astrocytes, but only with regar d to methylmercury. A review of the Aschner 2007 study indicates that the effects are attributed to methylmercury; inorganic mercury is not mentioned with r egard to the mechanisms discussed.611 In his causal 610 Doctor Aschner was listed as the senior researcher on this study. This study involved micromolar doses of mercury chloride on cultured hamster cells. Although it found effects on astrocyticglutamate transporter cells, the quantity and species of mercury, the fact that it was an in vitro study, and the type of cells studied all militate against substantial reliance on this study. 611 Inorganic mercury is mentioned in this article only with regard to the creation of methylmercury by methylation of inorganic mercury in waterways, re sulting in its accumulation in seafood. PML 570 at 285. 241mechanism, Dr. Kinsbourne postulated an effect by inorganic mercury. For the articles to support Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis require s, as Dr. Brent noted, an inference that ethylmercury or inorganic mercury will produce t he same effects as methylmercury. Tr. at 4334. Doctor Johnson agreed with Dr. Brent. Tr. at 4324-25. He added that the Aschner studies demonstrated that, once mi cromolar doses of mercury triggered astrocytic dysfunction, a vicious cytotoxic cycle ensued.612 Tr. at 4326. However, the micromolar doses required to produce astrocyt ic dysfunction in Dr. Aschner's work were much higher than would be seen in the brain after TCVs. Tr. at 4325. (7) Rubenstein and Merzenich Article,613 PML 530. Doctor Kinsbourne cited a review articl e by Rubenstein and Merzenich, PML 530, for a number of points regarding overexcitati on in autism. These authors hypothesized \"that at least some forms of autism ar e caused by a disproportionate high level of excitation (or disproportionately weak inhibition) in neural circuits that mediate language and social behaviors.\" PML 530 at 256. They suggested that the \"imbalance of excitation and inhibition could be due to incr eased glutamatergic (e xcitatory) signaling, or to a reduction in inhibition due to a reduction in GABAergic signaling.\" Id. The authors advanced several possible causal mechanisms of overexcitation, including the presence of too m any glutamate receptors, rec eptors that are too sensitive to glutamate's effects, too many neurons producing glutamate, or the inordinate amplification of neuronal signaling. The arti cle also discussed the possibility that some forms of autism might be attributed to decreased inhibition, caused by deficient production of GABA, poor GABA signaling, too few neurons producing GABA, or deficiencies in GABA receptors. See Rubenstein and Merzenich, PML 530, at 260. Notably, the authors do not mention an imbalance caused by astrocytic damage from mercury exposure; they ment ion the TCV-ASD hypothesis, but do not discuss its merits. This review article advances hypotheses t hat, in some respects, resemble those of Dr. Kinsbourne regarding overexcitation, indicating that others may consider a possible role for excitation-inhibition imbal ances in ASD. However, the authors note that overexcitation may be caused by either increased glutamate or by too little GABA, but their hypotheses are not based on meas urements of either. PML 530 at 256. 612 Doctor Kinsbourne was cross-examined on Dr. Aschner's statement, as it apparently conflicted with his model of astrocytic injury without astrocytic death. Tr. at 4168-69. He indicated that, in vivo , regulatory mechanisms could preclude the cycle fr om going out of control. Tr. at 4169-70. 613 J. Rubenstein and M. Merzenich, Model of autism: increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in key neural systems , , filed as PML 530. 242Doctor Kinsbourne's hypothesis addresses only one of these alternatives. As Dr. Rust noted, Rett's disorder, which resembles ASD, appears to include a geneticallydetermined defect in GABA production or signaling. Tr. at 2502. (8) The Purcell Study, PML 567. The Purcell study, PML 567, examined cerebellar tissue to measure gene expression. The researchers targeted the area where Purkinje cell loss had been observed and compared the findings in the brai ns of individuals with autism to those of controls, matching for gender, age, and postmortem interval. Purcell, PML 567, at1618-19. Doctor Kinsbourne cited the Purcell study to indicate that individuals with autism have glutamate receptor and transporte r abnormalities, implying that these abnormalities may enhance mercury's neuroinflamma tory effects. PML 717 at 18. He indicated the article was relevant because of the higher levels of GFAP, which is released by astrocytes under stress, found in the brains of autistic subjects. Tr. at 4116-17; Purcell, PML 567, at 1626. Accord ing to Dr. Kinsbourne, astrocytes may proliferate in response to stress, and that proliferation may contribute to the mechanism by which an individual develops autism. 614 Tr. at 4117. He also asserted that the Purcell study supported his hypothesis that disrupted glutamate transmission could account for some of the cognitive defic its seen in autism. Tr. at 4117-18. Doctor Johnson described the significance of the Purcell study differently. He explained that the researcher s identified some candidate genes that were different in autistic brains than in control brains. Tr . at 4322. Some of the genes investigated involved the EAAT1 and EAAT2 transporters that br ing glutamate into astrocytes. Tr. at 4322. They found significantly more of both ty pes of transporters in the autistic patients. Tr. at 4321, 4323-24. To Dr. Johnson, this suggested that autistic brains had a greater capability to handle glutamate than the brains of the controls. Tr. at 4324; Purcell, PML 567, at Figures 2 and 3. In view of Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis t hat mercury interferes with astrocytic ability to mop up excess glutamate, evidenc e that autistic individuals have a greater number of glutamate transporters is not supportive. (9) The Primate Studies. In addition to his reliance on Dr. Aposhi an's opinions that TCVs would produce sufficient mercury in the brain to cause or substantially contribute to neuroinflammation, 614 I note that astrocytic proliferation woul d involve an increased number of astrocytes, and, presumably, a thereby increased ability to take up any glutamate excess. Astrocyte proliferation would beinconsistent with Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis of im paired glutamate uptake due to astrocytic damage or death. 243Dr. Kinsbourne also relied on Dr. Burbacher's infant monkey study, PML 26, and the Charleston adult monkey studies, PML 32, 33, and 116. Tr. at 864-65. Doctor Kinsbourne testified that if t he monkey studies (which he referred to in general) did not in fact mirror the amount of mercury given to children, he \"would lose confidence\" in their conclusions. Tr. at 890. His testim ony regarding these studies strongly suggested that he had not read them closely. Doctor Kinsbourne incorrectly asserted t hat the infant monkey brains had signs of microglial activation and inflammation. Tr. at 888. The Burbacher study did not involve examination of the monkey brains for either microglial activation or inflammation. See PML 26 at 1016 (describing study methods).615 On redirect examination, he testified that the Burbacher re search team was currently looking at the brains of the monkeys for evidence of neuroinflammation, but did not explain where he derived this information.616 Tr. at 939-40. Doctor Kinsbourne also testified that the Charleston adult monkeys \"were delivered mercury in amounts comparable to t hat which children used to get.\" Tr. at 868; see also Tr. at 868-69, 884-85. This was a gross misstatement of the amount of mercury administered to the adult monkeys, who received 50 g of methylmercury per kilogram of body weight every day for periods ranging from six to eighteen months. Charleston 1995, PML 32, at 326. Assumi ng that an adult monkey weighed only two kilograms,617 the adult monkeys received about as much methylmercury in two days as human infants receive from TCVs over their first two years of life. Based on a series of leading questions on redirect examination, Dr. Kinsbourne corrected this reference, indicating that he was referring to the Burbacher infant monkey study, not the Charleston adult monkey studies . Tr. at 936-41. However, the infant monkeys in the Burbacher study did not receive vaccine level doses either; they received about 2.5 times more ethylmercury per kilogram of body weight than human infants received from TCVs.618 The infant monkeys received it on a much more compressed timetable, over a period of 21 days, rather than the six month period of 615 The adult monkey studies had signs of microg lial activation, but the adult monkeys received much higher doses of mercury. 616 My review of the transcripts and the medical and sci entific journal articles filed failed to disclose any evidence regarding a continuation of the Burbacher study. There were, however, several references to this continued research by petitioners' counsel. See, e.g. , Tr. at 38-39,1961-62; Dwyer Tr. at 299, 332 . Attorneys' assertions are not evidence. 617 Vahter 1994 indicated that the adult monkey s weighed between 2.4 and 6.1 kilograms, making this an underestimation. PML 60 at Table 1. 618 Doctor Brent calculated this at more than three times the amount. Res. Ex. EE, at 5. For the reasons indicated in note 374, I found Dr. Brent's calculations to result in a slight overestimation of the difference. 244human infants. Burbac her, PML 26, at 1016. According to Dr. Kinsbourne, the Charle ston adult monkey studies looked for astrocyte death in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. Tr. at 891. He indicated that if he were incorrect about the areas in wh ich astrocyte death and microglial activation were observed his opinion would not change, because microglial activation wasreported and the glutamate system is all over the cerebrum. Tr. at 891-94. On redirect examination, he reviewed the article and testif ied that the part of the brain examined in the Charleston 1996 paper, PML 116, was actually the thalamus. Tr. at 936. As Dr. Brent noted, there was little evidence of astrocyte loss found in the adult monkey studies; statistically significant losses were found only in the thalamus and only in the six-month and clearance groups. Tr. at 1941; Charleston 1996, PML 116, at Fig. 1. Doctor Kinsbourne agreed that there were no behavioral disturbances observed in the adult monkeys. Tr. at 894. He did not recall whether the neuropathological findings in the Charleston adult monkey st udies were similar to the neuropathological findings in the autistic patients. Tr. at 894. He commented that with \"low doses of mercury\" in the monkeys, and the brief time they stayed alive, the findings of mercury damage might be different from those on autopsy of autistic individuals many years after their condition manifested. 619 Tr. at 895. (10) The Vezzani and Granata Study,620 PML 569. Doctor Kinsbourne cited the Vezzani and Granata study, PML 569, as support for his mechanism of injury: excess glutamate leading to overexcitation, causing neurons to become more excitable, and eventually to die or to experience seizure activity. PML 717 at 18, 21. Doctor Rust discussed the study in more detail, noting that it did not support these points. The study had nothing to do with autism or mercury. It involved stimulating particularly sensitive cells in t he hippocampus over a long period of time with a regular pulsed current, eventually producing an epileptic focus.621 Tr. at 2484-85. He noted that the brain's inter nal regulatory mechanisms are so robust that the external stimulus had to be applied repeatedly befor e the cells broke down and seizures resulted. Doctor Rust noted that the ex periment produced a regional tissue injury, not overexcited neurons. Tr. at 2485-86. Alt hough the same brain region can be injured with excitatory amino acids (which include gl utamate), it is an area that has particular 619 From context, this last statement likely applied to the Burbacher infant monkey study, PML 26 (apparently mistranscribed as \"Burmeister\"). Tr. at 894-95. 620 A. Vezzani and T. Granata, Brain Inflammation in Epilepsy: Experimental and Evidence , 46(11): and 569. 621 One of Dr. Rust's areas of specialization is epilepsy. See Tr. at 2351. 245biochemical and genetic features. Tr. at 2486. He also noted that Dr. Kinsbourne ignored the authors' conclusion that the changes they provoked were related to genetic transcriptional activation. Tr. at 2485. (11) The Bezzi Study,622 PML 367. Doctor Kinsbourne cited the Bezzi study as support for his statement that astrocyte interaction with activated microg lia can also amplify glutamate release by astrocytes. PML 717 at 18. The study does conclude can amplify astrocyte glutamate release. Bezzi , PML 367, at 705-06. However, the study finding is much more limited than Dr. Kinsbourne suggested in his citation. The portionof the study examining the interaction among microglia and astrocytes initially involved three cell cultures: (1) an astrocyte cultur e almost devoid of microglial cells; (2) an astrocyte culture with microglial cells added in a ratio that resembled that found in mammalian brains; and (3) a pure microglial cult ure. Glutamate release was highest in the astrocyte plus microglia culture, but only when the microglia had been recently exposed to lipopolysaccharide. 623 Resting (nonactivated) microglia did not enhance glutamate release. PML 367 at 705. In gener al, this portion of the study supported Dr. Kinsbourne's assertion. The second portion of the study invo lved measuring neurotoxicity. Low concentrations of a protein found on viral su rfaces of the human immunodeficiency virus [\"HIV\"] produced rapid glutamate release from both human and rat astrocyte cultures containing activated microglia. Howe ver, prolonged exposure caused the death of neurons, unless the cell cultures contained subs tances that interfered with the action of the particular glutamate receptor being st udied. Bezzi, PML 367, at 706-07. The receptor studied in this experiment involved a specific type of glutamate release, one that is normally tightly regulated. Bezzi, PML 367, at 707. The process used in this experiment caused extremely rapid release of glutamate, \"whereas in most other known processes such as inflammation, its action is much slower.\" Id. at 708. Doctor Rust noted that the most f undamental problem with Dr. Kinsbourne's interpretation of the Bezzi study is that the study conditions required the presence of healthy astrocytes to keep the neurons viable. Tr. at 2495; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 75. Injury was not produced by chronic inflammation; it was produced by adding freshlyactivated microglial cells to the culture. Tr. at 2495-96. Finally, the result was not a glial injury with neuronal hyperexcitation; it wa s neuronal death. Tr. at 2496. The reason neurons died had to do with the interaction of glutamate and glutamine. Tr. at 2497. Doctor Kinsbourne focused on the presence of too much glutamate without discussing 622 P. Bezzi, et al., CXCR4-activated astrocyte 367. 623 Lipopolysaccharide (often abbreviated \"LPS\") is a substance found in bacterial cell walls. DORLAND 'S at 1057. 246the rest of the regulatory syst em in place between astrocytes and neurons. Tr. at 2497. (12) The Courchesne 2005 Paper, PML 104. In his report, Dr. Kinsbourne cited t he Courchesne 2005 paper to support the existence of a vulnerable postnatal period of brain development in the first two years of life. PML 717 at 15. The Courchesne 2005 paper, PML 104, is an extremely detailed literature survey of the neurobiological st udies of ASD and early brain development. Although it indicated that the first two year s of life involve a wide variety of brain maturation processes when interference by environmental events might occur (PML 104 at 581-82), the authors did not posit postnatal events as the most likely cause of the developmental abnormalities occurring during this period, such as the dramatic growth in brain size and head circumference. They commented: In addition to scenarios in which an inflammation-inducing insult or proliferative error causes mult iple further disruptions, neuronal overproliferation and glial activation could share a common genetic root. One example of a potential genetic bas e for many of the observed micro and macrostructural changes is the p27 gene. Its loss causesdysregulation of cell proliferation cycl es, resulting in a 250% increase in glial cell numbers in the cerebellum and a 30% increase in hippocampalneurons. PML 104 at 592 (citations omitted). The Courchesne 2005 article did not necessarily advocate a genetic cause for these events. During rebuttal testimony, Dr. Kinsbourne was referred to a section of the Courchesne 2005 paper (PML 104 at 590) dealing with the role of glial cells in both neuroinflammatory reactions and in brain or ganization, that purportedly supported his hypothesis. In a series of leading questions, Dr. Kinsbourne was invited to comment onhow glial cell disruption might cause t he neuropathological changes Dr. Kemper and others discussed. Tr. at 4124-25. He was specifically referred to a paragraph stating: Excess glial production and/or activati on have the potential to produce any or all of the previously discussed micr ostructural findings, including frontal minicolumn abnormalities and increased neuron counts. PML 104 at 590; Tr. at 4125. What was not included in the quotati on was the preceding paragraph of the article. This paragraph indicated that the \"glial and molecular abnormalities described by Vargas\" could be \"fundamentally neuroinflamma tory reactions that begin prenatal or early postnatal or reflect aberrations in genetic mechanisms that regulate the normal role of glia during neural development and organization.\" PML 104 at 590. 247Read in context, the two paragraphs indicate that impairments to the role of glial cells in neuronal migration and other br ain architectural developments (a role acknowledged by respondent's experts) were not being attributed to postnatal causes. See also PML 104 at 588 (referring to migration abnormalities in minicolumn development as an explanation for the pathologica l findings in minicolumns in the brains of ASD patients); RML 67 at 426 (Dr. Ca sanova discussing prenatal timing of neuronal migration in minicolumns); Tr. at 4163-64. c. Conclusions Concerning Citations in Support. A careful examination of his cited refe rences reflected Dr. Kinsbourne's penchant for extracting data and out-of-context referenc es to support his position, while ignoring contrary data or remarks in the same study or article. Although some studies contained support for specific aspects of his hypothesis, the studies Dr. Kinsbourne cited were notsupportive of glutamate excess as a cause of ASD. 6. Drug Trials. a. Riluzole Trial. As support, Dr. Kinsbourne asserted than an ongoing clinical trial was testing the disrupted glutamate transmission hypothesis by using drugs that block glutamate receptors to alleviate some symptoms of autism. Tr. at 4117-18. He referred specifically to a clinical trial of riluzole to treat children with autism. Pet. Tr. Ex. 13. 624 Tr. at 4118. The study announcement described riluzole as a drug that \"reduces the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in volved in the brain circuitry affected in OCD,\"625 which has also been used to treat ALS, and was being investigated for use in acute depression. Pet. Tr. Ex. 13 at 1-3. Doctor Kinsbourne testified that riluzo le \"has been shown to be effective in childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder.\" Tr. at 4119, 4148-49. Actually, the recruitment announcement indicat ed that it was being tested on adults with OCD, with this announcement extending the study to ch ildren. Pet. Tr. Ex. 13 at 3. He characterized the expanded study as testing the glutamate blocker \"in children with autism-spectrum disorders.\" Tr. at 4119. Doctor Kinbourne's statements were misleading. Riluzole had not been shown to be effective in treating childhood OCD; thatwas the purpose of the study. See Pet. Tr. Ex. 13 at 1. The study was not testing the drug as a treatment for ASD. Rather, the re cruitment efforts were focused on children and adolescents with OCD, includi ng those with and without ASD. Id. 624 Petitioners' Tr. Ex. 13 is the study recruitment announcement. This trial exhibit was also filed as PML 757. 625 \"OCD\" refers to obsessive compulsive disorder. at 1299. 248Conflating glutamate and neuroinflammation, Dr. Kinsbourne testified that if the neuroinflammation found by the Vargas researcher s was helpful or protective, this study would never have been funded. Tr. at 4119-20. This statement presupposes that the neuroinflammation observed is caused by gl utamate. That is Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis, but there is no evidence that glutamate is causal. What the study announcement indicates is that glutamate ma y be involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD . It says nothing about glutamate's involvem ent in ASD. Pet. Tr. Ex. 13 at 2-3. b. Minocycline.Doctor Kinsbourne also asserted that the Vargas researchers 626 suspected that the neuroinflammatory process they obs erved was causal because \"they are now administering an agent that counteracts microg lial activation in an attempt to reduce or even cure the autistic manifestations.\" Tr. at 908-09. This testimony concerned another drug trial, one involving minocycline.627 Pet. Tr. Ex. 9; see also PML 369 (an earlier version of the same study announcement). c. Criticisms of Using Drug Trials as Causation Evidence. Doctor Rutter referred to the minocyline grant proposal as a \"long shot,\" but added that it was a proper thing for NIH to do. NIH has funded a large number of studies, including ones based on a claim fr om UCLA that fenfluoramine made a massive difference in autism. The drug was later withdrawn from the market because of toxic effects. The NIH also funded the secr etin studies, which consistently showed it was not effective. Tr. at 3341-42. NI H has taken suggestions both plausible and implausible and funded studies r egarding them. Tr. at 3343. Doctor Johnson, a neurotoxicologist whose research focus is on 626 Doctor Kinsbourne's report and testimony asserted that the minocycline drug trial grant was made to Dr. Pardo's group. PML 717 at 15; Tr. at 908-09. There is no evidence in the publicly availabledocuments pertaining to this study that Dr. Pardo's group is conducting the minocycline trial. At best, the evidence indicates that Johns Hopkins University (wher e Drs. Pardo and Vargas are located), is recruiting participants, along with the National Children's Medical Center in Washington, DC, and NIH. Pet. Tr. Ex. 9at 1, 4. A reason for concluding to the contrary may be found in the Pardo paper, PML 72, at 492 (authorswarning practitioners against treatments based on the assumption that neuroinflammation was causal of ASD). Another reason for questioning whether the Vargas researchers were involved in this drug trialconcerns a misstatement of the Vargas study's findings in the drug trial recruitment announcement. Itindicated that the Vargas study found that regressive autism was associated with chronic braininflammation. This statement omitted the fact tha t, although the CSF portion of the Vargas study focused on children with regression, the brain tissue portion of the study included tissue samples from eightindividuals without regression, three with regression, and four whose status was unknown. Vargas, PML 69, at Tables 1 and 2. It seems unlikely that the Vargas researchers would themselves misstate their findings. 627 Minocycline is \"a powerful inhibitor of microglia l activation.\" Pet. Tr. Ex. 9 at 2. It has been used to treat Huntington's disease. Id. 249neurodegenerative diseases, testifi ed that the type of treatment for a neuroinflammatory disease does not necessarily implicate a c ause. Tr. at 4316. Drug therapies treat symptoms. For example, in Alzheimer's di sease, some symptoms are caused by the loss of a specific neurotransmitter, acetylc holine. Tr. at 4316-17. Most drugs approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's increase brai n levels of acetylcholine, which results in an improvement of cognition. However, t he treatment does not affect the underlying disease process. Whatever is killing brai n cells continues to do so, unabated by the drug therapy. Tr. at 4317. With regard to ASD, if neuroinflammati on is part of the progression of the disease, treating it may alleviate some of the symptoms, but t hat does not imply that neuroinflammation is causing the disease. Tr . at 4317. I note that the minocycline trial is focused on counteracting neuroinflamma tion, which Dr. Kinsbourne conceded has many causes. C. Responses to Dr. Kinsbourne's Hypothesis. 1. Overview.The criticisms by respondent's experts of Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis were many and varied. Doctors Rust, Kemper , and Johnson described defects in Dr. Kinsbourne's descriptions of the cellular in teractions and the effects of glutamate excess over time. Doctor Rust chall enged Dr. Kinsbourne's attribution of autistic behaviors to overarousal. Doctor Kemper emphasized that postnatal mercury exposure could not account for the neurodevel opmental abnormalities he and others had documented and that the hypothes is ran counter to what was known about mercury's affinity for particular brain structures. He and Dr. Rodier also noted that mercury's observed effects on behavior did not resemble the behaviors seen in autism. Doctors Rust and Lord, who see, treat, and diagnos e children with ASD, both opined that Dr. Kinsbourne's attribution of autistic behaviors to the effects of overarousal reveals his relative inexperience with children with ASD. Doctor Leventhal acknowledged that glutamate receptors may play a role in ASD, but rejected the excitotoxicity and overarousal hypothesis. Respondent's experts did not contest that neuroinflammation is present in the brains of those with ASD. However, as Dr . Rust noted, inflammation is a nonspecific process, 628 in that its causes range from an infe ction to cancer. Tr. at 3425. Doctor Rutter did not find the specific proposit ion that inorganic mercury might cause neuroinflammation to be very startling because so many things causeneuroinflammation. Tr. at 3425. 628 Although the transcript reads \"Information is a very nonspecific sort of process,\" it is clear from the context that Dr. Rutter actually said that \"Inflammation is a very nonspecific sort of process.\" Tr. at3425. 250Neuroinflammation is involved in almost every neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Hunti ngton's, and ALS. diseases, the neuroinflamma tion, including gliosis and microglial activation, is a progressive part of the diseas e as a result of the pathologic process. As Dr. Johnson testified: \"I don't think that any body at least in the field would argue that they're a causative factor at this poin t, it is more an outcome.\" Tr. at 4316. 2. Cellular Processes. Doctor Rust has published papers on the dev elopmental aspects of astrocytes, their functions, biochemical operation, and rela tionship to other brain cells, particularly neurons. Tr. at 2482. He also has consider able expertise in the area of inflammatory diseases of children. Tr. at 2482-83. Ba sed on his expertise, Dr. Rust concluded that Dr. Kinsbourne's characterizations of astro cytic and microglial changes in the brain are not consistent with these processes or with what is known about inflammation. Tr. at 2482. As Dr. Rust explained: \"[W]e know a great deal about the regulation and the interaction of the systems that are in volved and referred to, and [Dr. Kinsbourne displayed] absolutely no apparent underst anding of the ways in which the system actually functions.\" Tr. at 2465-66. Doctor Kinsbourne did not consider the \"absolutely necessary interaction between astrocytes and neurons and the very complicatedbusiness of counter-regulation for excitatory compounds in the synapse, and [displayed]no real understanding of the archit ecture that's in it as far as I can tell.\" Tr. at 2466. As Dr. Rust explained, excess glutamate pr oduces injury in the most active cells. Tr. at 2502. If Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis is correct, the deficits in autistic patients would worsen over time, causing epilepsy or cell death. In epilepsy caused byhyperexcitability, there is progressive tissue injury, producing changes in motor and intellectual function, and worsening epilepsy. Tr . at 2502-03. This is not what is seen in autism. Tr. at 2503. Although there are so me progressive issues with regard to EEG changes and epilepsy in autism, those wit h autism do not show the progressive, nonspecific regional injury that is seen in epilepsy caused by hyperexcitability. Tr. at 2503. Based on his experience in examining how astrocytes and neurons interact, Dr. Rust testified that Dr. Kinsbourne's view s on neuronal excitation in the presence of astrocytic damage were simply incorrect. Astrocytes support neurons in a number ofways, including providing them with energy fr om their stores of glycogen. Tr. at 2506- 07. If astrocytes are damaged or destroy ed, neurons cannot function because they need support from astrocytes to do so. Tr. at 2507. Neurons need the additional energy support provided by astrocytes in order to become hyperexcitable; without these energy stores, neuronal function di minishes and then stops. Tr. at 2507. Neurons cannot go on being hyperexcitable for l ong periods of time if inflammation has caused damaged or dead astrocytes. Tr. at 2507. There is a complex system of r egulation in place between neurons and 251astrocytes. Cells receiving glutamate can dial their receptors up or down. If there is too much glutamate, neurons or astrocytes can lose their receptors and not remake them. Tr. at 2499-500. This regulatory system can be injured, but when it is, the neurons die. Tr. at 2500-01. Doctor Johnson, who has studied and published in the area of astrocytic function, also took issue with Dr. Kinsbourne's vi ews of what happens when astrocytes are unable to mop up excess glutamate. Tr. at 4320-21. His work involves many of the brain mechanisms Dr. Kinsbourne discussed. Tr. at 2240. Doctor Johnson agreed that when astrocytes fail to take up excess glutam ate, the short term effect is an increase in glutamate, which will accumulate in the synaps es and bind to glutamate receptors in the neurons. The neurons that are on the post synaptic side of the receptor will become hyperactive. However, in the long term, increased glutamate will cause the neurons to die. There are well-established models that demonstrate glut amate and glutamate agonists kill neurons. Tr. at 2246. excess is neurodegenerative. Tr. at 4324. Although glutamate is likely part of the pathogenic process in autism and brain diseases, a chronic glutamate excess causes astrocytic dysfunction, which leads to neuronal death. Tr. at 4327-29. Doctor Leventhal, who has written about abnormal glutamate function and ASD, discussed the role that a glutamate rec eptor, Mglur-4, may play in neurodevelopment and neurotransmission in ASD. Like Dr. Rust, he testified about the complex interaction between glutamate and astrocyt es that Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis did not address: astrocytes do play a role in regulating glutamate, but glut amate also regulates astrocytes. Dwyer Tr. at 280-83. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress pl ay a role in a number of central nervous system diseases. These include Alz heimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's, and HIV dementia. See Tr at 4315-16; see also Streit, PML 70, at 5-6. The witness with a research focus on such diseases, Dr. Johnson ( see Tr. at 2199), testified that autism did not bear any resemblance to t hose diseases, which involve \"neuro death.\" Tr. at 2202. He testified that if astro cytes are chronically dysfunctional, the neurons around them will die. Tr. at 2246-47. On ce physical symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease manifest, the disease progresses, and neuronal cell death occurs in the region where the cells are stressed. The neur oinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases is a pathogenic process that progresses to cell death, and, eventually, to patient death. Tr. at 2250. Neurodegenerative diseases do not plateau. Therefore, Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis of chronic, steady cell destructi on is, in Dr. Johnson's opinion, nonsensical. Tr. at 2247, 2255-56. Doctor Kemper's criticism focused on the response of astrocytes to damaged brain structures, rather than the astro cyte-neuron interaction Drs. Rust and Johnson discussed. There is no evidence that microg lia are destroying astrocytes in the brains of autistic individuals, because there is no good, credible evidence of astrocytic death or loss in ASD. Tr. at 2859-60. 252The role of activated microglia in the innate immune response of the brain is very consistent with a response to the widespread defects in prenatal brain development that Dr. Kemper documented in his studies. Inst ead of astrocytes being impaired or inactive in autistic individuals, the literature suggests that astrocytes are quite active. Tr. at 2860. Neuroinflammation cannot explain the structural changes observed in the brains of those with autism, but those structur al changes can explain the neuroinflammation observed. Tr. at 2860-61. 3. Mercury's Effects on the Brain.Doctors Brent and Rutter both noted that the mercury-induced neuroinflammation hypothesis could not be specific for thim erosal because there are so many other sources for mercury. Tr. at 1956-57, 1960, 1964, 3426. Mercury has an affinity for specific areas of the brain, a fact consistently noted in the mercury autopsy studies. Doctor Kemper discussed two additional studies, Shiraki, 629 RML 449, and Reuhl and Chang,630 mercury's affinity for the visual cortex, the motor cortex, and the sensory cortex in adults, with more diffuse patterns of involvement in neonatal ex posure. Tr. at 2840-41, 2843; Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slides 23-25. Mercury's affinity fo r the vermis, an area in which autism-related structural changes are not found, was illustrat ed on Slide 24, Res. Tr. Ex. 10. Mercury's affinity is for the deeper parts of the cer ebellum; in autistic individuals, the loss of Purkinje and granule cells involves areas close to the surface of the cerebellum. Tr. at2841-42. In mercury toxicity, the Purkinje cells are spared, a striking difference between mercury exposure and autism. Tr. at 2842-43. The neuropathological findings in mercury toxicity and autism are not consistent. Tr. at 2844. Doctor Kinsbourne's proposed mechanisms of injury from TCVs (or mercury in general) do not account for any of the dev elopment anomalies Dr. Kemper and others have found in autistic brains. Tr. at 2834. Doctor Kemper provided a list of clinical features and neuropathological findings in autism compared to those of mercury toxicity. See Res. Tr. Ex. 10, slide 26; Tr. at 2844-45. The clinical features and neuropathology of the two conditions do not overlap; in many cases, the findings in autistic brains are the opposite of those caused by mercury. Tr. at 2844-45. Doctor Rust commented that if inorganic mercury causes overexcitation, and the amount of mercury increases over time, patients with autism would get progressively worse over time. Because human beings are continually exposed to various sources of 629 H. Shiraki, Neuropathological aspects of organic merc ury intoxication, including Minamata disease , in HANDBOOK OF CLINICAL NEUROLOGY 83 (P. Vinkin et al. eds., 1979) [\"Shiraki\"], filed as RML 449. 630 K. Reuhl and L. Chang, Effects of Methylmercury on the Development of the Nervous System: A Review , NEUROTOXICOLOGY 1: 21-55 (1979) 395. 253mercury, brain inorganic mercury levels incr ease over time, even in the absence of TCV exposure. Doctor Kinsbourne's report indi cated both that autis tic symptoms plateau, but may also become more severe if epilepsy ensues. PML 717 at 6. Although hedistinguished ASD from metabolic brain degeneration ( id.), the implication of a steadily increasing toxic element causing a reaction is that there would be a steady deterioration in function. Tr. at 2511-12. That is not what is seen in autism; individuals with autism improve over time. Tr. at 2512. This is inconsistent with Dr. Kinbourne's hypothesis. Tr. at 2513. 4. Autistic Behavior and Overarousal.Doctor Kinsbourne stated that \"[a]utistic symptomatology can be classified into that which exemplifies the effects of hyper arousal and that which represents an attempt to escape from such effects or fend them off.\" PML 717 at 20. Doctor Rust called this statement \"speculation,\" comm enting that interpreting behavior of autistic individuals is best done by those who see a large number of them. Tr. at 2508. He indicated that there is \"not one shred of evidence\" that stereotypic behaviors lower neuroexcitation levels, in spite of Dr. Kinsbourne's claims in his report (PML 717 at 22). Tr. at 2509. Doctor Rust also disagreed with Dr. Ki nsbourne's opinion that autistic behaviors are manifestations of a hyper excitable nervous system, indica ting that it ran counter to the data and his own clinical experiences in working with autistic children. Tr. at 2433. A relatively inexperienced observer mi ght mistake some autistic behaviors as hyperactivity or anxiety. Tr. at 2433. T hese actually reflect the systems dysfunctions present in ASD. Tr. at 2433; Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 41. Doctor Lord testified that Dr. Kins bourne's overarousal model has been around for 40 to 50 years and has been used to describe many disorders. Tr. at 3585. Manychildren respond to overstimulation; childr en with ASD may do so in more conspicuous ways and may have a lower threshold for stimulation. However, the behaviorsdemonstrated by an autistic child who is re sponding to overstimulation are the same behaviors that occur when the child is underaroused. Tr. at 3585-86. The behaviors that Doctor Kinsbourne characterized as evidence of overarousal occur in many different contexts. Tr. at 3586. Doctor Rutter concurred with Drs. Rust and Lord. He commented that individuals with autism appear to experi ence both overexcitation and apathy on occasion. To be of evidentiary value fo r Dr. Kinsbourne's causation hypothesis, these apparent emotional states must be link ed with what is happening physiologically, and that evidence is lacking. Doctor Rutter te stified that no studies measure heartbeat and EEG changes, and no studies demonstrate t hat these changes occur in social situations. Tr. at 3319-20. If they are not linked to social situations, it is difficult to link the apparent over- or underarousal to the social reciprocity problems in autism. Tr. at 3320. 254Doctors Rust and Rutter both noted that Dr. Kinsbourne failed to explain how overarousal leads only to regre ssive autism. Tr. at 2592, 3320-21. D. Conclusions. In his Theory 2 general causation hypothesis, Dr. Kinsbourne added a new coat of paint to an old building, but failed to s hore up the building's basic structural failings. As Dr. Rust characterized it, Dr. Kinsbour ne's hypothesis has \"lethal problems in terms of scientific support.\" Tr. at 2495. Rather than producing ASD, the excitotoxic state Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis envisioned would pr oduce neuronal death, followed by patient death. That is not descriptive of the natural history of ASD. His whole hypothesis relied on \"a toxico logist\" (presumably Dr. Aposhian) to establish that exposure to TCVs could produce enough mercury in the brain, either alone or in conjunction with other envir onmental mercury exposure, to cause neuroinflammation. For reasons detailed at length in Section VI, Dr. Aposhian's opinion that TCVs would produce enough mercury to cause the effects postulated was notreliable. Even if, arguendo , sufficient brain mercury is produced by TCVs, Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis cannot explain why mo st children with ASD improve over time, while the mercury levels in their brains ar e likely increasing over the same time frame from diet and other sources. His assertion that brain protective measures kick in at some point to ameliorate the effects of additional mercury was sheer speculation. Doctor Kinsbourne opined that neuroinf lammation produces ASD through a glutamate excess. None of the studies he ci ted measured glutamate levels in the brains of those with ASD. The evidence of neuroi nflammation does not establish a cause for neuroinflammation, and there was ample evidenc e that it is a nonspecific finding with many possible causes, including a response to injury. Witnesses with far better qualifications in research into neurodegenerative diseases and oxidative stress established t hat the cellular processes Dr. Kinsbourne described do not work the way he asserted. Doctor Kinsbourne's testimony about what happened to astrocytes in his model was inconsistent. He relied on the Lopez-Hurtadostudy's findings of gliosis, which he erroneous ly equated to astrocytic death. He relied on damage to astrocytes as an essential component of his theory of a glutamate imbalance, and indicated that astrocytic deat h was not required. Then, he postulated an increase in astrocyte numbers as responsible for causing ASD. He was not onlyinconsistent, he was wrong. Although, on a theoretical level, other physicians and scientists have considered Dr. Kinsbourne's overarousal model as an ex planation for autism's behavior, a mercury- produced glutamate excess is not a probable explanation for overarousal. As Dr. Kinsbourne conceded, glutamate has never been identified as a cause of ASD. What 255mercury does in the brain is well-known. In sufficient doses, it is a potent neurotoxin, but not one that has ever been shown to c ause autism or autistic symptoms. To properly place a factor on a list of differentia l causes for a disease or disorder requires some evidence that it is capable of causi ng that disease or disorder. To prevail, petitioners must establish by preponderant ev idence that TCV exposure belongs \"on the differential\" as a cause for ASD. Even by this standard, which is much lower than that of \"scientific certainty,\" petiti oners' case falls well short. Section IX. Conclusion . A. Conclusions in General. A diagnosis of ASD can be heartbreaking. Although most children improve, few ever lose the diagnosis. Most children wit h ASD will never live independently as adults. The true cost of ASD is borne by those who live daily with the condition and contend with its financial and emotional tolls. In t he caring and compassionate words of Dr. Rust during the general causation hearing, those of us on the outside looking in \"do not understand.\" Res. Tr. Ex. 8, slide 45; see also Tr. at 2434. When petitions for compensation alleging that ASD was the result of childhood vaccinations were filed in mounting numbers, the OAP was created to help resolve the factual and legal questions the petitions pr esented. The Vaccine Program exists to compensate victims of vaccine injuries easily, quickly, and with generosity, but entitlement to compensation requires more than a sincere and honest belief that a vaccine is responsible for causing ASD. In these cases, as in all other off-Table cases,petitioners must establish by preponderant evidence that a vaccine can cause ASD, and that it did so in their children's cases. The evidence produced in the Theory 2 cases alone was voluminous and highly technical, and the hypotheses presented were verycomplex. This illustrates not only the diffi culty of making factual conclusions regarding that evidence, but also the utility of an omnibus hearing to produce and evaluate it. However, nearly a decade after the OAP was created, all of the evidence produced to date is inadequate to demonstrate any causal connection between vaccines and ASD. The TCV causation hypothesis emerged fr om a combination of mercury's long- established role as a neurotoxin, ASD's st atus as a neurological disorder, and the ubiquity of exposure to TCVs prior to the perceived emergence of ASD's symptoms. The Faroe Islands studies suggested that maternal methylmercury exposure during gestation was a statistically significant predictor of poorer performance on some neurological tests. Although the Seychelle s Island studies did not make the same findings, the Faroe Islands studies were some evidence that smaller doses ofmethylmercury than previously thought could cause neurological harm. The Internet 256likely played a role as well, according to at least one commentator.631 The focus on TCV causation of regressive ASD emerged in the Theory 2 cases as a consequence of what Dr. Kinsbour ne called the \"striking\" and \"shocking\" presentation in some cases of regression, in which apparently normal toddlers lost skills and sociability. Without an understanding of how behavior at age two could be caused by some brain systems coming on line while others were disconnected, it made sense for parents and others to look for a more re cent triggering event. Most children with ASD had received vaccines containing \"a known neurotoxin\" and, equating thereference dose for methylmercury to ethylmercury, parents voiced concerns about theamount of mercury children received in vaccines. Even the prestigious IOM called themercury hypothesis \"biologically plausible \" in 2001, although what the IOM meant by that term was not what the parents perceived. However, over the following three years, more scientific studies were published. The toxicokinetics of ethylmercury were studied in primates and human infants, and every reputable study confirmed that methyl mercury studies were not a good predictor of ethylmercury's effects. Well-conduct ed epidemiological studies found no connection between TCVs and ASD. In 2004, the IOM reexamined the TCV-ASD hypothesis and concluded, in the strongest terms available to it, that the evidence favored rejection of any causal connection. Since 2004, ev ery epidemiological study except one has continued to find no connection between TCVs and ASD. The one study that found aconnection was funded by the Petitioners' Steering Committee representing the OAP petitioners in this omnibus proceeding. The Theory 2 cases may have continued to press the TCV-ASD hypothesis because some of the factual predicates for the hypothesis are well established. The strong beliefs of many parents (and a sma ll group of physicians and scientists) that vaccines are causal undoubtedly played a role as well. Vaccines received by most U.S.children in the 1990s through the 2001-2003 ti me frame contained more than trace amounts of thimerosal. When injected, thimer osal is metabolized into ethylmercury. A small portion of this ethylmercury reaches the brain, where an even smaller amount is converted to inorganic (mercuric) mercury. On ce converted to inorganic mercury in the brain, it is virtually immobile. At certai n brain levels in primates, organic mercury has been shown to cause fairly widespread activation of microglial cells and some reductionin astrocytic cells. Activated microglia have been found in autopsies of the brains of patients with ASD in greater num bers than in the brains of neurotypical individuals. In spite of these widely-accepted fact ual predicates, the TCV-ASD causation hypothesis has been rejected by the general scientific community for many cogent 631 See Baker, PML 599, at 251 (commenting that the \"insinuation prevalent on the Internet that thimerosal was a dubious product smuggled into vaccines by avaricious drug companies\" was one of the streams that converged to spread the TCV-autism hypothesis). 257reasons. However, it continues to be pressed by a small group of physicians and scientists associated with groups such as SafeMinds, DAN, and ARI. Most ofpetitioners' experts were drawn from this group. Doctor Deth's research has been funded by them; Dr. Mumper is the medica l director of ARI, and Dr. Aposhian has participated in ARI's \"think tanks.\" Many of the published studies relied upon by the testifying experts, including nearly all of t hose relied upon by Dr. Aposhian in his \"six pillars,\" were written by individuals asso ciated with ARI and other similar groups. As discussed in Sections VI-VIII above, the conclusions of this group are not grounded onreputable and reliable scientific foundations. The view that ASD is caused by merc ury may have persisted because it provides some hope that ASD can be treated, and even cu red. The general scientific consensus is that ASD is the result of prenatal developmental problems shaped largely by genetic and epigenetic contributions. This consensus provides little hope for parents of children with ASD. Mainstream science does not, at present, offer many effective therapies,much less offer hope of a cure. Mainstream science tells us that some manifestations of autistic behavior can be treated with drugs, behavioral therapy, and speech and language therapy, but that few children will lo se the diagnosis or live independently in adulthood. Understandably, many parents have looked to practitioners who offer hope of improvement, and even a cure. After extensively reviewing the testim ony, expert reports, and other evidence, I have concluded that petitioners have fail ed in the general causation case to demonstrate that TCVs cause or substant ially contribute to ASD. Their experts proffered hypotheses that were illogical, c ontrary to the weight of the evidence, and, ultimately, unpersuasive. B. Qualifications of the Experts. The quality of the expert opinions proffered in this case was heavily influenced by the expertise of the scientists and physici ans offering them. Respondent produced an impressive group of physicians and scientists w ho were truly experts in the fields about which they testified. They had garnered awards from both peers and autism advocacy groups. Many had published hundreds of peer reviewed articles and book chapters pertaining to the subjects about which t hey testified. Doctor Rutter has been researching ASD for more than four decades, and Drs. Lord, Kemper, Rodier, Leventhal, and Rust have been involved in such research for nearly as long. DoctorsJohnson, Mailman, Jones, and Roberts each had extraordinarily impressive qualifications in the highly technical subjec t matter about which they testified. Doctor Brent brought both a treating physician's pers pective and a toxicologist's background to the discussion of mercury's effects on human beings, and clearly and carefullyexplained the significance of the science about wh ich he testified. Only in epidemiology did the qualifications of petitioners' ex pert even approach those of respondent's, and even there, Drs. Fombonne and Rutter brought the additional expertise from their own research and publications in the epidemiol ogy of ASDs. Doctor Goodman offered 258much-needed insight into the IOM reports on TCVs and expertise on the issues of \"subgroups\" and biological plausibility. In contrast, petitioners produced a ve ry well-qualified epidemiologist, Dr. Greenland, whose opinion was so limited as to be essentially useless as part of acausation hypothesis. Because the factual predicates for his opinion on \"clearlyregressive autism\" were not established, Dr. Greenland's primary contribution was pointing out the generally acknowledged weak nesses in the epidemiological studies of ASD and TCVs. Doctor Aposhian was qualified to opine on mercury, but lacked thequalifications in medical toxicology that Dr . Brent possessed. Doctor Deth's experience in mercury, sulfur metabolism, oxidat ive stress, and ASD was minimal and recently acquired, and paled in comparison to t hat of respondent's experts in academic background, teaching experience, resear ch focus, publications, and awards and recognitions. Doctor Kinsbourne has not had a clinical practice in nearly two decades,and, in comparison to respondent's experts, re latively little experience before that in diagnosing and treating children with ASD. I emphasize that the qualifications of the experts were not, standing alone, determinative in my conclusion that petiti oners have failed to make a prima facie case for mercury's causal role in ASD. No t only were respondent's experts far better qualified to opine, the evidentiary quality of their opinions exceeded that of petitioners' witnesses. With very few exceptions, when one of respondent's witnesses cited amedical or scientific study for a point, t he study fully supported that point. Their opinions were well supported by other evi dence, and, when contrary studies existed, they were careful to explain why they found them unpersuasive or unreliable. In contrast, on many occasions when I read a study that one of petitioners' experts cited, I found that it did not provide s ubstantial support for the point fo r which it was cited, or did so only in part, with the study as a w hole being unsupportive of the proposition advanced by the expert. The studies that we re supportive often had problems of their own in that they could not be duplicated by ot her researchers. Many of Dr. Aposhian's conclusions were drawn from studies that could not be duplicated. Most of Dr. Deth's opinions were based on his own unpublished work, certain aspects of which were,according to experts in the field, poorly performed and unlikely to be correct. Although peer review and publication are not necessary conditions for consideration in VaccineAct cases, the problems with Dr. Deth's own work cast substantial doubt on the conclusions he drew from it. As respondent 's experts correctly noted, Dr. Kinsbourne sometimes cited studies for unsupported propos itions, misstated the degree of support found, and \"cherry-picked\" data from studies, while ignoring contrary data in the same study. C. A Failure of Proof. As Dr. Rust stated, a hypothesis that is so broad that anything from measles virus to an environmental toxin could cause ASD is unlikely to be correct. Tr. at 2514.Where the evidence was in conflict, the great weight of the evidence favored 259respondent. Thus, I have resolved most of the factual disputes against petitioners. With regard to ASD itself, I concluded that there is no reliable evidence that regressive autism is a disorder distinct from that of classic or early onset ASD. The evidence for any postnatal causal factors, including envir onmental toxins, is very weak. The weight of the evidence is that ASD originates prenatally, with genetics playing a very strong role in its origin and manifestations. 1. TCVs Do Not Substantially Contribute to Brain Mercury Levels. Humans are born with some mercury pres ent in their brain as the result of maternal exposure to various sources of mercury. Inorganic mercury continues to accumulate in the brain over a lifetime from sources ranging from food products and dental amalgams to air and water. Merc ury is considered a neurotoxin, and its neurotoxic effects are more pronounced when t he exposure occurs in utero. Harmful effects are a function of dose and other fact ors, including the method of administration, the species of mercury involved, and the time period over which exposure occurs. However, there is no reliable evidence that TCVs produced anything more than minuscule levels of inorganic mercury in the brain of infant monkeys exposed to approximately 2.5 times as much mercury as human infants received in TCVs. In contrast, autopsy studies of U.S. inf ants who died within a few days of birth demonstrated mercury levels much higher than those of the infant monkeys, likely a result of prenatal exposure. A number of studies established that at birth, human infants have blood mercury levels strikingl y similar to those of their mothers. Doctor Aposhian's contrary testimony and calculations were based on faulty premises. Although the widespread use of TC Vs contributed some amount to the level of inorganic mercury in the brain, the amount contributed was very small in comparison to amounts that accrue from env ironmental exposures over time. The levels of mercury that have produced toxic symptoms, includi ng the subtle neurodevelopmental testing abnormalities observed in children from areas with high levels of dietary exposure, have all been much higher than those produced by TCVs. 2. Evidence that TCVs Produce Neuroinflammation is Lacking.Although exposure to far higher doses of methylmercury has been observed to produce neuroinflammatory responses in the br ains of adult primates, there is no direct evidence that the ethylmercury from TC Vs produces the same effects. The circumstantial evidence that vaccine level doses can do so, even in conjunction with other mercury exposure, is likewise lacking. Microglial activation is not specific to mercury, other heavy metals, or ASD; it o ccurs in many brain disorders, and may represent a response to injury, rather than it s cause. An author of the Vargas study, one of the papers on which petiti oners primarily relied, wrot e that the neuroinflammatory responses observed in the brains of aut ism patients were not consistent with a response to a toxic exposure. 2603. Mercury's Known Biological Effects in the Brain Do Not Resemble Those of ASD. What mercury exposure does to the brai n is well established, and neither the structures nor the cell types principally inju red by mercury exposure are those that are malpositioned, damaged, missing, or destr oyed in ASD. Petitioners' hypothesis requires that high level doses of mercury spare Purkinje cells, while low level dosesdamage them. The pathophysiological changes in the brain in ASD largely occurprenatally; prenatal exposure to high enough dos es of mercury to cause observable neurological symptoms produces cerebral pal sy and developmental delays, but has not been observed to produce anything resembling ASD's core symptoms. Mercury causesdamage to discrete anatomical regions of the brain associated with motor coordination; motor skills are largely unaffected in ASD. 4. The Symptoms of ASD Do Not Resemble Symptoms Produced by Mercury Exposure. Doctor Rodier, the one witness with cons iderable expertise in both mercury exposure and ASD, testified that there ar e no similarities between ASD and either ethylmercury poisoning or mercury poisoning in general. Tr. at 3033. If ASD results from a hypersusceptibility to mercury in a small group of children, one would expect the symptoms of this group to resemble closely those of mercury poisoning victims, with a lower dose producing similar effects in those genetically hypersusceptible. It does not. Sensory and motor disturbances are the first effects observed in mercury poisoning;language, communication, and social skills losses are among the first symptoms observed in ASD. 5. There is No Evidence of Hypersusc eptibility to Mercury in Individuals with ASD. Although both Drs. Aposhian and Deth te stified about a hypersusceptibility to mercury, or mercury efflux disorder, there is no reliable evidence that one exists. The studies on which Dr. Aposhian relied could not be duplicated by other researchers. At best, preliminary evidence that children with ASD have higher biomarkers of oxidative stress suggests that they may be more affe cted by administration of substances that produce oxidative stress, but there is no evidence that they respond differently to vaccine level doses of thimerosal. To point to the existence of ASD as validation of that aberrant response is simply circular reasoning. 6. Postnatal Causes for ASD Are Unlikely.The pathophysiological findings from the autopsy studies strongly point to a prenatal origin for nearly all the abnormal findings observed. The co-occurrence of dysmorphology in substantial numbers of those with ASD, and t he dating of the origin of the dysmorphology to points in early gestati on, buttresses the autopsy studies. ASD is 261strongly genetic, and although there is not a 100% concordance rate for ASD diagnoses in monozygotic twins, epigenetics may acc ount for the discordance. Doctor Rutter explained that the development of human beings is designed to work in a particular way, but genes do not tell each cell what to do. Genetics specifies a pattern, but the pattern may be altered by many factors. Tr. at 3269. Injuries early in the prenatal period pr oduce, as Dr. Rodier remarked, a cascade of further injuries in the nervous system. Tr. at 3057. As the authors of the Connors study, relied upon by Dr. Aposhian (PML 711 at 15), noted: \"The neurobiologicmechanisms underlying autism are in pl ace before birth.\" PML 73 at 876. 7. There is Insufficient Evidence that Regression or \"Clear Regression\" in ASD has a Separate Biological Basis. Doctor Kinsbourne was unpersuasive in his a ttempts to establish that regression in ASD has a separate biological basis or ev en that it should be considered a separate type of ASD. His opinions were contradict ed by several witnesses, each of whom had far more experience in diagnosis of ASD and research into how ASD presents. They described some loss of skills occurring in many, if not most, children with ASD, andrarely constituting the first sign or symptom of the disorder. Loss of skills is something apparent to parents; failure to meet milestones may or may not be. ASD may present in any number of subtle ways not readily appar ent to untrained observers. Regression occurs in several genetically-caused disorders, clearly indicating that it need not be the result of a triggering postnatal event. 8. Neither Excitotoxicity nor Oxidativ e Injury is Likely as a Cause of ASD. Glutamate may well play a role in AS D's symptomology, but a general level of excitotoxicity caused by mercury damage is unlikely as a cause for ASD. DoctorKinsbourne hypothesized that mercury c auses neuroinflammation, which causes damage to astrocytes, leading to overexci ted neurons firing too frequently. This scenario, in the opinion of several of re spondent's experts who have researched brain disorders, would lead to neurodegeneration and neuronal death. There is little evidence of neuronal death in ASD; neurons are frequently smaller and more numerous in ASDpatients. Neuronal death progresses to pat ient death in other neurological disorders, most of which occur later in life. There is no evidence of progressive neurological injury in ASD. 9. Epidemiology Has Failed to Detect Any Connection Between TCV Exposure and ASD. The epidemiological evidence presented was strong, but not dispositive, on the issue of general causation. These studies indicated that a causal connection between TCVs and ASD is unlikely, but not impossibl e. Because I have concluded that there is no evidence to show that \"clearly regressi ve\" autism exists as a separate phenotype of 262the disorder, and have likewise concluded that there is virtually no evidence suggesting that regression in general constitutes a s eparate phenotype with a distinct etiology, I consider the epidemiology relevant to my ultimate conclusion on general causation. Strong epidemiological evidence indicates that TCVs are unlikely to play a causal role. Although most U.S. vaccines manufactured after 2001 contained no more than trace amounts of thimerosal, its removal had no effe ct on the prevalence of ASD rates, even considering that stockpiles of TCVs may have been used for a year or two aftermanufacturing ceased. D. Conclusion. The Theory 2 hypotheses have fared no better than the Theory 1 hypotheses. The evidence in favor of TCV causation of ASD is weak and singularly unpersuasive. Two processes that are not pathognomonic of any disorder, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, were assigned a causal role in the development of ASD, but the presence of either or both in ASD patients says little to nothing about ASD's potential causes. If ASD can be caused by neuroinf lammation and/or oxidative stress, then anything that can cause either of those conditions belongs, according to Dr.Kinsbourne's reasoning, \"on the differential\" for ASD causation. Petitioners have failed to demonstrate why TCVs-among all the po ssible causes of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress-are a probable cause of, or a substantial contributor to, ASD. In the following section, I consider the evidence presented that pertains specifically to Colin Dwyer, and apply the general causation evidence to evaluate the merits of the claim for compensation filed on his behalf. Section X. Colin's Speci fic Causation Claim. A. Introduction. The relevant procedural history pertaining to Colin's claim was set forth in Section I above and will not be repeated here. Colin's claim was timely filed and he received all the relevant vaccinations in t he United States. His ASD has persisted for more than six months. Thus, all of the stat utory prerequisites to entitlement have been established by preponderant evidence, except that of causation. 632 To prevail, petitioners must prove by preponderant evidenc e that Colin's ASD was caused by his receipt of TCVs. The record as a whole fails to demonstrate any causal relationship. B. Evaluating the Medical Evidence. Conflicts between contemporaneous medical records and subsequent statements, testimony, and m edical histories are common in Vaccine Act cases, and 632 Although the parties did not stipulate that the statutory prerequisites for entitlement to compensation were met in this case, respondent did not contest any statutory requirement, except that ofcausation. 263this case is no exception. Two general legal principles guide the resolution of conflicts between contemporaneous records and later-adduced evidence. The first is that theabsence of a reference to specific symptoms in a medical record does not conclusively establish the absence of symptom s during that time frame. See, e.g. , Murphy v. Sec'y, HHS , 23 Cl. Ct. 726, (1991), aff'd, 968 F.2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he absence of a reference to a condition or circumstanc e is much less significant than a reference which negates the existence of the condition or circumstance.\" (citation omitted)). The second principle addresses the degree of reliance commonly accorded to contemporaneous records. Special masters frequently accord more weight tocontemporaneously recorded medical symptoms than those recounted in later medical histories, affidavits, or trial testimony. \"It has generally been held that oral testimony which is in conflict with contemporaneous doc uments is entitled to little evidentiary weight.\" Murphy , 23 Cl. Ct. at 733 (1991) see also Cucuras , 993 F.2d at 1528 (medical records are generally trustw orthy evidence). Memories are generally better the closer in time to the occurrence reported and when the motivation foraccurate explication of symptoms is more immediate. Reusser v. Sec'y, HHS , 28 Fed. Cl. 516, 523 (1993). Inconsistencies betw een testimony and contemporaneous records may be overcome by \"clear, cogent, and consistent testimony\" explaining thediscrepancies. No. WL 608693, at *3 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Dec. 21, 1990). The following m edical history and the conclusions drawn therefrom are presented with these legal principles in mind. I emphasize that I do not question the veracity of Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer. They are caring and devoted parents and I am confident that their testimony was based on their best recollections of an extremely difficult and stressful period in their lives. Not surprisingly, given the passage of time, some of the testimony conflated events, such as which vaccinations were received at a parti cular time, and what symptoms or behaviors Colin displayed at particular times. Thus , I rely primarily on the most contemporaneous medical records, including the Dwyers' a ccounts of relevant symptoms contained in those records, for my factual determination of when and how Colin's ASD manifested. C. Vaccinations. Colin's medical records reflect an order for a hepatitis B vaccine to be administered 24 hours after his birth on No vember 10, 1998, but the records do not reflect that it was administered. 633 See Pet. Ex. 19, p. 17. His first hepatitis B 633 When a vaccination is administered, health care providers record the vaccine's manufacturer and lot number, and the anatomical site of administration. It appears from other records ( see, e.g. , Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 88-89) that New York required vaccinations to be recorded on a particular form. No formpertaining to this particular hepatitis B vaccination was filed. Other than the first two columns (the date theorder was given and the nature of the order), the page of the medical record containing the order is blank, including the spaces for recording the date and time t he vaccination was given and the injection site. Pet. Ex. 19, p. 17. Although Mrs. Dwyer testified that s he believed this vaccination was actually administered (Dwyer Tr. at 66-67), she did not testify that she observed its administration. Based on the medicalrecords, I find that it was not administered. It appears that Colin's pediatrician did not think Colin had 264vaccination was actually administered on November 23, 1998, when Colin was 13 days old. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 80. He received a second hepatitis B vaccination on December 30, 1998, at seven weeks of age. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 17, 79, 89. Colin received his next set of vaccinations at nearly three months of age, on February 2, 1999, when he received DPT,634 poliomyelitis [\"IPV\"], and Hib. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 77, 88. These were followed by DPT, IPV, and Hib vaccinations on March26, 1999, when he was four and one-half months old. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 75. On May 27, 1999, when Colin was six and one-half mont hs of age, he received his third DPT, Hib, and hepatitis B vaccinations. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 74. Colin received his only measles, mumps, and rubella [\"MMR\"] vaccination on November 22, 1999, when he was 12 months ol d. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 70. He received Hib and varicella (chickenpox) vaccinations on March 1, 2000, when he wasalmost 16 months old. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 67, 87. In his last set of vaccinations on July 10, 2000, at 20 months of age, Colin received DTaP and IPV vaccinations. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 63, 86; see also Pet. Ex. 1, p. 5 (a record with an illegible date but reflecting that Colin was eight years old, noting that \"Dad declines further vaccinations\"); Pet. Ex. 1, p. 44 (a medical record ent ry on January 13, 2004, indicating that the Dwyers were \"refusing vaccines\" for Colin). Petitioners did not submit any direct evi dence of the actual amounts of thimerosal contained in the individual vaccinations adm inistered to Colin. Their expert, Dr. Mumper, testified about the total amount of th imerosal Colin received, but she did not explain how she derived that amount. Dwyer Tr. at 112-13; See Pet. Ex. 13, p. 3. The IOM 2001 Report, RML 254, estimates the et hylmercury levels in the vaccines 635 that Colin received as follows: the four doses of DPT/DTaP could have contained a total of100 g; the four doses of Hib could have contained a total of 100 g; and the three doses of hepatitis B could have contained a total of 37.5 g. This would be a possible cumulative total of 237.5 g of ethylmercury 636 between his initial hepatitis B vaccination received this vaccination, because he administered a hepatitis B vaccination at 13 days of age (Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 80), too soon for a second hepatitis B vaccination under the recommended childhoodvaccination schedule for hepatitis B vaccinations. See CDC Childhood Immunization Schedules (follow \"1998\" hyperlink). 634 Colin's vaccination record lists the first thr ee vaccinations as \"DTP\" (diphtheria, tetanus, and whole cell pertussis) and the fourth as \"DTaP\" (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) whereas theindividual records from his check-ups indicate they were all DTaP vaccines. Compare Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 88 with Pet. Ex. 1 pp. 74, 75, 77, 86. Either formulation, if it came from a multi-use vial, likely contained thimerosal. IOM 2001, RML 254, at 27-28. 635 The IPV, MMR, and varicella vaccines do not contain thimerosal. IOM 2001, RML 254, at 27. 636 This cumulative total is the same as that contained in Dr. Mumper's report; she counted three hepatitis B vaccinations instead of four in her report. Pet. Ex. 13, p. 3; Dwyer Tr. at 112-13. 265at two weeks of age and the final TCV at 20 months of age.637 IOM 2001, RML 254, at 28. If Colin had actually received four hepat itis B vaccinations, the total would have been 250 g. D. Colin's First Year. 1. Prenatal and Neonatal Records.Both Drs. Mumper and Leventhal agreed that Colin's prenatal course was essentially normal. Pet. Ex. 13 at 2; Res. Ex. CC at 1. At birth on November 10, 1998, Colin weighed almost eight pounds, and had Apgar scores 638 of nine at both one and five minutes. Pet. Ex. 19, p. 6. 2. Early Medical Care and Treatment: Birth to One Year.The records of Colin's medical care in his first 12 months document a relatively healthy baby. Colin had periodic check-ups at South Shore Pediatrics, with well child visits at 13 days (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 80), sev en weeks (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 79), two and one-half months (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 77), four and one-half m onths (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 75), six and one-half months (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 74), and at 12 months (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 70). Colin experienced some mild illnesses: colds, fevers, bronc hitis, rash, and bloodshot eyes, all common complaints in infants. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 73, 75, 76, 78. There was no suggestion that these illnesses were either unusually severe or excessive in number. Colin's physical development during this period was normal. His weight ranged from the 50 th percentile at birth up to the 90th at two months of age. He was in the 50th percentile again at six months of age, but declined to the 25th percentile by about one year, when he was noted to eat \"hit or miss.\" Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 67, 70, 74, 75, 77, 79, 80- 81. Colin's mother testified that he sat up on his own at three months,639 pulled himself up at six months, and started to walk at nine months. Dwyer Tr. at 30. His early social development appeared normal: at 13 days he smiled, responded to sound, and 637 Using Dr. Aposhian's estimates of thimerosal content in Pet. Ex. 21 at 4, the totals are the same. 638 The Apgar score is a numerical assessment of a newborn's condition, usually taken at one minute and five minutes after birth. The score is derived from the infant's heart rate, respiration, muscletone, reflex irritability, and color, with from zero to two points awarded in each of the five categories. See D ORLAND 'S at 1670. 639 This testimony is substantiated by medical records. Pet. Ex. 12, p. 3. That page is undated, but from the records accompanying that page, it was likely filled out in January, 2004. Pet. Ex. 12, p. 1. However, Mrs. Dwyer told a speech therapist on May 31, 2001, that Colin sat up at \"approximately 6months of age.\" Pet. Ex. 10, p. 1. The pediatric neurologist who evaluated Colin for autism recorded thatColin sat unassisted at six months. Pet. Ex. 2, p. 7. Although his pediatrician's handwriting is not veryclear, the record of his six month check-up appears to say that he was \"Tripod Sitting\" at that point. Pet.Ex. 1, p. 74. I note that sitting unassisted typically occurs at six months of age. N ELSON TEXTBOOK OF PEDIATRICS [\"NELSON 'S PEDIATRICS \"], Table 8-1 (18th ed. 2007). 266regarded faces. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 80. He was smiling and cooing at two and one-half months (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 77), and babbling and laughi ng at four months (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 75). E. Period Surrounding Initial ASD Symptoms and Diagnosis. 1. Colin's Development from 12 to 16 Months of Age.In Colin's second year, he displayed some language skills, with the records reflecting that he had three to five words at his one-year well child check-up onNovember 22, 1999. His pediatrician observed him babbling with an occasional word(Pet. Ex. 1, p. 70) at this visit. At his 15-month check-up (when he was nearly 16 months old), he was \"talking some.\" 640 Pet. Ex. 1, p. 67. The experts differed regarding whether these visits reflected normal language development, with Dr. Mumper testifying that the notations at one year and 15 months indicated normal development. Dwyer Tr. at 105-07. However, Dr. Leventhal testified that the \"talking some\" comment at Colin 's 15-month well child check-up was not a notation a pediatrician would use to describe normal development. Instead, it indicated a problem with Colin's speec h. Dwyer Tr. at 262-63. In addition to his well child check-ups during the first half of his second year of life, Colin had doctor's visits for a febrile ill ness in December, 1999 (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 69), and a cough, congestion, and runny nose in May, 2000 (Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 64-66). In between these two illnesses, he received Hib and varicella vaccinations on March 1,2000, at approximately 16 mont hs of age, when the \"talking some\" notation was made. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 17, 67. 2. Colin's Development from 17 Months to ASD Diagnosis. a. Overview of Issues. Petitioners contend that Colin suffered a developmental regression beginning at around 20 months of age. Pet. Post-Heari ng Br. at 68. Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer both testified that they began to notice probl ems in Colin's development and behavior at around this time frame. Dwyer Tr. at 38, 79. A thorough review of the testimony and the contemporaneous medical records subs tantiates that Colin's developmental problems were noted between July and De cember, 2000, but there are conflicts 640 Mrs. Dwyer's affidavit stated that Colin had five to six words by 12 months. Pet. Ex. 17 at \u00b6 3. She testified that, between 12 and 20 months of age, Colin had about eight words in his vocabulary. Dwyer Tr. at 35 (listing mama, dada, ba-ba ( i.e., bottle), bye-bye, baby, bear, up, cookie). These numbers are larger than those appearing in the more contemporaneous medical records and reports discussedbelow. Even at the higher range of eight words by 20 months of age, Colin's vocabulary was belowaverage. Most children use 10-15 words spontaneously by 18 months of age, and use between 50-100 attwo years of age. N ELSON 'S PEDIATRICS at 49; see also Tr. at 1483-84 (testimony of Dr. Mumper regarding language abilities of 15- and 21-month old children). I note that Mrs. Dwyer reported that Dr. Baker askedif Colin had 50 words at his well child visit when he was 28 months old. Pet. Ex. 10, p. 1. 267concerning the nature, timing, and severity of Colin's behavioral symptoms between the March 1, 2000 visit and the March 22, 2001 visit when he was referred for furtherevaluation. Because there were only tw o medical visits in this time frame, 641 my determination of whether Colin experienced any loss of skills is based primarily on parental recall and reports to other health ca re providers months or years after the events in question. Unfortunately, these reports conflict with one another and with the Dwyers' testimony. b. July, 2000-February, 2001. (1) Petitioners' Testimony. Mrs. Dwyer testified that she noticed changes in Colin's development when he was around 20 months of age (which would have been around July, 2000), but alsotestified that these changes occurred \"around the fall\" of 2000, which would place the changes at closer to two years of age. Dwyer Tr. at 38. Mr. Dwyer testified that in \"the fall [of 2000] or early in 2001,\" Colin began to exhibit obsessive-compulsive behaviors, hand flapping, and loss of engagement with others. Dwyer Tr. at 83-84. Mrs. Dwyer further testified that she suspected a lin k between Colin's autism and vaccines \"[a]fter Colin had his last round of vaccinations, which was in July of 2000\" and that \"he started his gradual regression shortly ther eafter.\" Dwyer Tr. at 65. Both Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer testified that during the fall of 2000 and the winter of 2001, they observed changes in Colin's behavior and communication skills. Dwyer Tr.at 38-41, 79. Mrs. Dwyer testified tha t, during this time frame, Colin became uncooperative, agitated, and no longer enjoyed some activities that he previously enjoyed. Dwyer Tr. at 38-40. As an exam ple, she described Colin's \"complete[ ] reject[ion]\" of bath time during this period, which he had \"always loved.\" 642 Dwyer Tr. at 38-39. Mr. Dwyer echoed the observation that it was more difficult to engage Colin in activities they had done in the past, and he described uncooperative behavior during thefall of 2000. Dwyer Tr. at 79. Mrs. Dwyer described that, at Christmas, 2000, Colin, then two years of age, sat in a bin that hi s father had padded with pillows and blankets, never acknowledging the family members t here for the occasion and taking no interest in unwrapping gifts. Dwyer Tr. at 39. 641 Colin had a well child visit at 20 months, on July 10, 2000. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63. Colin had only one other pediatric visit between July, 2000, and Ma rch, 2001, when he was seen for a cough on October 16, 2000. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 62. This record does not reflect any concerns, other than those connected withhis illness. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 62. 642 At Colin's May 31, 2001 speech evaluation, Mrs. Dwyer reported that Colin \"loves bath time and loves to play with water.\" Pet. Ex. 10, p. 2. Another evaluator reported on December 14, 2001, that\"Colin loves the water and enjoys taking a bath.\" Pet. Ex. 3, p. 7. Either Mrs. Dwyer confused when Colinbegan resisting bath time or the resistance was short-lived. 268Mrs. Dwyer testified that Colin \"did not use his language the way he had been using it previously.\" Dwyer Tr. at 38. By spring 2001, Colin did not use words to communicate, did not like to be touched or hel d, and did not like to wear clothes. Dwyer Tr. at 39-40. She also testified that he stopped eating, lost weight,643 and developed diarrhea. Dwyer Tr. at 40. When asked to identify the physical symptoms that occurred around the fall of 2000, she te stified that the most pr ofound physical symptom she observed was \"his complete rejection of f ood.\" Dwyer Tr. at 68. She commented that he had been eating pureed foods, and then \"he just absolutely rejected every food that we put in front of him.\" Dwyer Tr. at 68. She testified that he had normal bowels, but then developed chronic diarrhea that would leak out of his diaper. Dwyer Tr. at 68-69. By way of dating these symptoms, she indi cated that they were reported to Colin's pediatrician at the March, 2001 visit. Dwyer Tr. at 69. The record of that visit does not reflect this report. Complaints of chroni c diarrhea and eating problems are likewise not reflected in any of the medical records over the next 12 months.644 (2) The Contemporaneous Records. Colin was 20 months old when he received DTaP and IPV vaccinations at a well child visit on July 10, 2000.645 Pet. Ex. 1, p. 17. The medical records from this check- up are consistent with some concerns about his speech development, but the concerns appear to have been those of his pediatrician, not his parents. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63. The 643 Mrs. Dwyer's testimony regarding Colin's weight loss did not specify when it occurred, but the medical records contradict any suggestion of weight loss around the time of onset or diagnosis. In July, 2000, Colin weighed 24 pounds, 6 ounces, which was slightly above the 25th percentile, the same percentile where he was at one year of age. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 63, 81. In March, 2001, Colin weighed 27pounds, which was also at or slightly above the 25 th percentile. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 61, 81. Indeed, the records indicate that Colin's weight declined from the 50th to the 25th percentile between six and 12 months of age, and remained at or around the 25th percentile through 28 months of age. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 81. However, prior to beginning the somewhat unorthodox treatments with Dr. Kenneth Bock, Colin's weight had reboundedto the 50 th percentile. See Pet. Ex. 4, p.1 (noting Colin's weight as 34 pounds on Apr. 19, 2002); Pet. Ex.1, p. 83 (growth chart indicating that we ight would place Colin in the 50th percentile). 644 The medical records say little regarding Colin's gastrointestinal functioning during the winter of 2000 and spring of 2001. The record of his March 22, 2001 pediatrician visit contains a section for \"Elim.,\" which in the absence of other relevant categories on the form is likely \"elimination.\" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 61. Thetwo words written in this category are largely illegi ble, but the first is likely \"BM,\" referring to bowel movements. The second may be \"nml,\" an abbreviation for \"normal,\" but because I am in doubt, the onlyconclusion I draw from this record is that no major complaints were recorded. With regard to later reportsof bowel problems, there is a record of a te lephone consultation in December, 2001, for vomiting and diarrhea, containing an instruction to follow up if the symptoms persisted, but no other medical recordsreflect bowel problems at or around the time of Colin's ASD onset or diagnosis. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 45. Inrecords from April, 2002 (dated by reference as part of Colin's intake records from Dr. Bock), Colin's parents assessed his diarrhea in the last 30 days as occasional and not severe. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 48. 645 Mrs. Dwyer reported to a health care provider in June, 2004, that Colin received a Hib vaccination at this visit as well. See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. His last Hib vaccination was received four months earlier, at the March, 2000 well child visit. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17, 67. 269physician's646 notes reflect that Colin \"[s]ays few wo rd[s] (3-5).\" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63. This is the same number of words he was speaking eight months earlier at his 12 month well child visit. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 70. Although t he handwriting is not clear, it appears that the pediatrician also wrote \"repeats word when ta lked to,\" followed by a space and then an illegible word. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63. This entry suggests echolalia.647 Other notes indicated that Colin was eating with a spoon and drin king whole milk. These entries were followed by two illegible words, then an entry i ndicating \"no concerns.\" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63. The pediatrician indicated \"watch speech,\" followed at the end of the record by a stated intent to follow up at two years to \"c heck speech.\" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63 (recording \" o speech\" in the \"plan\" section of the record). This record does not indicate how severe Colin's speech delay was at the time, but does reflect that Colin's speech wassomething his pediatrician intended to monitor. Colin's next visit to his pediatrician was for illness, on October 16, 2000, with a complaint of coughing for one week without fever and with a runny nose. Pet. Ex. 1, p.62. The record of that visit is limited to this complaint. c. March, 2001 Medical Visit and Referrals. Colin returned to his pediatrician's offi ce on March 22, 2001, when he was a little over 28 months of age. 648 Pet. Ex. 1, p. 61. He apparently saw Dr. Lisa Baker, as later referral reports are addressed to her. See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 58. Mrs. Dwyer testified that the visit was prompted by concerns about Co lin's developmental problems. Dwyer Tr. at 41. However, there are no concerns recor ded in the section for them at the top of the form. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 61. The first entry reflecting any issue is in the physical exam section of the form, where Dr. Baker reco rded \"speech/[l]ang delay!\" followed in assessi ng Colin's neurological status. Pet. Ex. 1. p. 61. In the plan section, Dr. Baker referred Colin for a speech evaluation, and noted that \"Father told v . important \" (underlining original), and not ed that Mr. Dwyer \"didn't seem interested [in early intervention].\" Pe t. Ex. 1, p. 61. She reiterated that she \"stressed [the] importance\" of early inte rvention to him. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 61. Two months later, on May 31, 2001, a s pecial education evaluator recorded Mrs. 646 The physician's signature is illegible and nothing el se in the record reflects which doctor saw Colin. 647 This suggestion is buttressed by Mrs. Dwyer's report of echolalia in her account of Colin's developmental problems to a special education evaluator in May, 2001. See Pet. Ex. 10, p. 2. 648 The medical record contains the notation \"2 yrs.\" This probably reflects that the visit was intended as the two-year well child check-up. It does not appear from the medical records that Colin had awell child visit at two years of age, although at the 20-month visit on July 10, 2000, the record indicatedthat a follow up was planned at two years of age to check his speech. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 63. 270Dwyer's account of the March 22, 2001 pediatrician visit: Dr. Baker asked her standard questions upon reaching his two years of age mark. Dr. Baker asked Maria if her son was producing 50 words, then asked ifColin had a vocabulary of 25 words, and mom answered no, which was thenfollowed by the question of whether or not Colin was putting two words together. When mom reported \"no\" to Dr. Baker's questions, he [sic] then referred Colin toTIPSE for a speech evaluation. Prior to this point, Colin's parents had no major concerns, however did notice that \"Colin was not progressing as fast as his older brother did at that age .\" Pet. Ex. 10, p. 1 (emphasis added). During th is evaluation, Mrs. Dwyer reported to two different evaluators that Colin said \"ma ma\" and \"dada\" for a few months and then stopped. Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 6, 9. In a section titled \"Family Concerns.\" Mrs. Dwyer was recorded as saying that she suspected that \"something might be wrong with Colin\" and after the referral for speech evaluation, she began to think that something more might be wrong. Mrs.Dwyer researched on the Internet because she suspected PDD, and identified that \"Colin had no language, no pointing, no response to his name, gets overwhelmed bypeople, and has poor eye contact. In addition, Colin has rote skill knowledge, echolaliaand some sensory issues.\" 649 The Dwyers indicated that they were aware of these \"delays\" but hoped he would grow out of them. Pet. Ex. 10, p. 2. The Dwyers reported that \"they became concerned when Colin turned two and was not yet responding to hisname or communicating with other s.\" Pet. Ex. 10, p. 11. d. Diagnosis of PDD. After the March, 2001 visit, the Dwyers sought out several services for Colin to determine what was wrong and how to treat it. (1) Initial Evaluation. On May 31, 2001, the Toddler-Infant Pr ogram for Special Education, Inc. [\"TIPSE\"] assessed Colin's development through testing and direct observations. Pet. Ex. 10, p. 4. Colin's social/emotional f unctioning was at an 18-to-24 month level (Pet. Ex. 10, p. 4), self-help at the 18-month level (Pet. Ex. 10, p. 5), and both cognitive functioning and fine motor skills at the 15-mont h level (Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 5-6). Colin's chronological age at this evaluation was two and one-half years. Pet. Ex. 10, p. 4. His gross motor skills were \"on or near age level,\" although his fine motor skills weresomewhat behind his chronological age. Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 6, 12. 649 From context, it appears that this research occurred after the pediatrician voiced her concerns. This timing is buttressed by Dr. Baker's records from the March, 2001 visit, and the emphasis she placed on Colin receiving early intervention services. See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 61. Doctor Baker's record does not reflect that the Dwyers communicated any concerns about Colin's development. 271Colin's receptive language abilities were \"well below his age level.\" Pet. Ex. 10, p. 6. He was \"unable to follow one-step co mmands\" and \"did not imitate gestures\" when they were presented. Pet. Ex. 10, p. 6. In addition to his poor receptive and expressive language skills, Colin displayed an inability to relate to his environment and reciprocatewith others. He was easily frustrated and screamed and grunted at times. Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 6, 9. The evaluators recommended more formal evaluations, speech and languagetherapy, occupational therapy, and placement in a small toddler group program. Pet. Ex. 10, pp. 6-7. (2) Doctor Fish's Neurological Evaluation. After Colin's TIPSE evaluation, Colin saw Dr. Irving Fish, a pediatric neurologist, on June 14, 2001. The history the Dwyers prov ided indicated that Colin answered to his name and babbled on time, but did not speak on time. At around two years of age,Colin's parents noted that he lacked speech, had poor eye contact, poor social skills, and lack of response to simple commands. In a somewhat contradictory entry, Dr. Fishnoted that Colin \"began to speak at 2 and now can count to 15, knows some letters,uses words such as cat, dog and repeats words others say,\" but Colin did not usespeech to communicate. Pet. Ex. 2, p. 7. Colin generally ignored others in the office, making only fleeting eye contact. He occasionally babbled and said words, butinconsistently responded to his name. Pet. Ex. 2, p. 8. Doctor Fish's impression was that Colin had Pervasive Developmental Disor der with significant autistic features and recommended applied behavioral analysis [\"ABA\"] therapy. 650 Pet. Ex. 1, p. 56; Pet. Ex. 2, p. 8. It did not appear that Dr. Fi sh conducted any standard diagnostic tests in making this assessment, as none were filed or mentioned in his two-page report. e. Reports to Others Regarding Colin's Language. Doctor Goldstein, the audiologi st who tested Colin's hearing651 on May 23, 2001, recorded that Colin had \"no words at two years. \" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 58. In December, 2001, Colin's parents reported to educational evaluat ors that he said \"mama\" and \"dada\" at 18 months of age. Pet. Ex. 3, p. 2 In April, 2002, at Colin's initial visi t with Dr. Kenneth Bock at the Rhinebeck Center, the Dwyers provided a history of Colin's health and development. Doctor Bock recorded that at 18 months of age, Co lin was using \"mama\" and \"dada\" and making vowel sounds. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 1. At around his second birthday, he stopped respondingto his name. He \"lost speech, including dada\" and lost eye contact. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 2. In June, 2004, the Dwyers told Doctor Br uce Russell that they noticed changes in 650 Applied Behavior Analysis is the \"applicati on of learning theory based on operant conditioning.\" Casanova 2007, RML 67, at 422. It \"is the only intervention recommended by the Surgeon General\" forASD. Id. 651 Colin's hearing was normal. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 60; Dwyer Tr. at 41-42. 272Colin after \"his 18 month immunizations.\" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29.652 There were no vaccinations recorded in Colin's medical records as administered at 18 months.653 3. Factual Determinations Regarding Onset and Regression.Colin's feeding difficulties apparently began before his first birthday, with \"hit or miss\" feeding noted at the one year check-up, and a decline from the 50 th percentile for weight at his six-month well child visit to the 25th percentile at the one year mark. By seven months of age, it is lik ely that Colin had received 187.5 g of ethylmercury from TCVs. By 16 months of age, he had likely received a cumulative total of 212.5 g of ethylmercury from TCVs. At 20 months of age, his cumulative total was likely 237.5 g of ethylmercury from TCVs. At this poi nt, however, Colin's ASD had already manifested with speech and language delays, as indicated below. By 15 months of age, his expressive language development is more difficult to assess. The experts differed in their interp retation of the pediatrician's \"talking some\" assessment of Colin's language skills on Marc h 1, 2000. In the absence of testimony by this pediatrician, I cannot conclude that the pediatrician was \"talking in code\" to convey that Colin's language development was no longer normal. Colin was talking at15 months of age, and in the absence of an entry clearly reflecting concern or other evidence that Colin should have been using more words, 654 I cannot conclude that his expressive language development was abnormal at this point. By 20 months of age, however, a different picture emerges. I conclude from the Dwyers' testimony and the medical record of Colin's July, 2000 visit that Colin's speechdelay was obvious at that point. 655 He was speaking three to five words, the same 652 A portion of this record also appears with the rest of Dr. Russell's records as Pet. Ex. 6, p. 102. The more complete copy of this page appears in Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. 653 Colin received vaccinations at his 15-month and hi s 20-month visits. It is likely that the Dwyers were referring to one of these instances when Colin received vaccinations, or, more probably, a conflation of the two events. They identified the vaccinations t hat Colin received at this \"18 month\" visit as \"DTap, Hib and polio.\" Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. Colin received his last Hib at the 15-month visit, and his last DTaP andpolio vaccinations at the 20-month visit. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 1, 17. 654 I note that N ELSON 'S PEDIATRICS , a standard pediatric textbook, indicates that four to six words at 15 months of age is typical development. See Table 8-1. 655 In December 2001, a McCarton Center evaluator recorded Mrs. Dwyer's account that around the time of his second birthday, and after his MMR va ccination, Colin \"stopped relating to his mother when she returned home from work and became a difficult child who often had tantrums.\" Pet. Ex. 3, p. 2. AsColin's only MMR vaccination was November 22, 1999, 12 days after his first birthday, the timing discrepancy precludes placing any reliance on this acc ount by Mrs. Dwyer. I note that she reported this association of Colin's ASD with his MMR vaccination in a subsequent history. See Pet. Ex. 4, p. 3. This may reflect a problem with dating events or an awar eness of the reported association of autism and MMR vaccinations that formed the primary basis for the Theory 1 OAP cases. Petitioners have not, however, alleged a causal association between Colin's MMR vaccination and his ASD in this proceeding, and to place Colin's emerging ASD behaviors in close te mporal connection with his MMR vaccination would 273number of words he had at one year of age. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 63, 70. Although there was some evidence that Colin had speech delays prior to July, 2000, in that Colin's parentsdescribed his speech at 18 months to several health care providers as one or twowords, plus vowel sounds, I cannot determine if he lost words after his first birthday and regained them by the twenty month check- up, or whether his language development simply reached a plateau at one year of age. Additional behavioral problems emerged over the next eight months. They either had not manifested or were not of sufficient severity to be mentioned at Colin's sick child visit in October, 2000, but I accept Mrs . Dwyer's striking account of Colin's social interaction difficulties at Christmas time, 2000. However, the variances in the Dwyers' accounts of Colin's behavior and when he lost skills make reliance on some of theiraccounts difficult. Having heard their testimony and observed their demeanor, I amconfident that they were testifying as accura tely as their memories permitted. I accept that behavioral difficulties emerged gradually over the period between July, 2000 and March, 2001. Conflicts between the testimony and records ma ke it difficult to accept that some of the specific problems about which the Dwyers testified emerged during this time frame or were of the severity they indica ted. I do not accept that Colin's feeding difficulties emerged only after July, 2000. Colin's weight was at the 25 th percentile around his first birthday and also at the 25th percentile at 28 months of age. He did not lose weight during this time frame, and thus, there could not have been a \"complete rejection of food.\" Likewise, the accounts of chronic dia rrhea are not supported by the evidence. The March 1, 2000 visit noted that Colin's elimination was normal; the July 10, 2000 visit was silent on the matter; the March, 2001 visit contains a largely illegible notation, but not one consistent with a r eport of chronic diarrhea. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 61, 63, 67. My conclusion that Colin did not have chronic diarrhea during this period is buttressed by several other pieces of circumstantial evi dence. In spite of being a picky eater, he did not lose weight. He had only one medical visit, for a cold, between 20 and 28 months ofage. Parents concerned enough about a cold to seek medical attention for it would certainly have been concerned enough about diarrhea leaking out of their child's diapers to contact a physician. They did not. Colin was supposed to have a follow up well childvisit at two years of age; instead, he wa s not seen again by a physician until 28 months of age. There were no reports of Colin having bowel problems separate from illness (see Pet. Ex. 1, p. 45) until the initia l visit to Dr. Bock, in April, 2002. 656 I find these accounts in sufficient to show that Colin had chronic diarrhea in the fall and winter of2000. render this petition untimely. 656 The Dwyers mentioned to Dr. Russell several y ears later that the bowel problems began after Colin's 18-month vaccinations. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. 274Colin did experience a regression in language after the 20-month check-up. Although his mother testified that he had five or six words at one year of age, his pediatrician recorded that Colin had three to five words by that point, and confirmed hearing at least one word, plus babbling, at hi s one year well child visit. Two reports, to the McCarton Center and to Dr. Bock, indica te that Colin said \"mama\" and \"dada\" at 18 months.657 These same reports indicate that he was no longer using those words by his second birthday in November, 2000. More precise dating of the language loss is impossible, as his 15-month check-up does not indicate how many words he wasspeaking, and his 20-month check-up indicated he had three to five words. The report to Dr. Fish indicated that Colin had ceased talking around his second birthday. I conclude that Dr. Leventhal was correct in asserting that Colin's language at 18- 20 months of age was abnormal. See Tr. at 263. At 18 months of age, he should have been using 10-15 words, but had fewer. Even were I to credit Mrs. Dwyer's testimonythat he had eight words at 20 months of age, this was not a normal vocabulary, and her testimony conflicts with the report to his pedi atrician of only three to five words at 20 months of age. Although I cannot precisely dat e the time Colin lost the use of words such as \"mama\" and \"dada,\" the Dwyers' testimony reflects that Colin's \"gradualregression\" (Dwyer Tr. at 65) began after the 20 month well child visit in July, 2000. Accepting this testimony in general, I must conclude that Colin was not developmentally normal at the time his regression began. Th is factual conclusion excludes Colin from the category of \"clearly regressive autis m\" about which Dr. Greenland testified, and from the \"striking\" and \"shocking\" categorizat ion about which Dr. Kinsbourne wrote and testified. F. Medical Care and Treatment of Colin After Diagnosis. 1. Overview.Colin's medical records after his diagnos is exceed 400 pages. In their efforts to aid their son, the Dwyers sought both c onventional and unconventional treatments. Colin received conventional behavioral and speec h therapy from several providers from the summer of 2001 through the time of the hearing in July, 2008, and receivedoccupational therapy at leas t through the beginning of 2006. See Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 23, 61. Colin was periodically evaluated, and he made progress in both expressive and receptive language and behavior, although he rema ins impaired in both as compared to his typically developing peers. His more unconventional treatments began in April, 2002, when he was first evaluated by Dr. Kenneth Bock and was placed on a gluten-free diet. A battery of tests 657 Although these reports are not precisely contempor aneous, they were the closest in time to the events described. The reports do not definitively state that these two words were all that Colin was usingat 18 months, although the context and circumstances do suggest that. 275was performed at this visit as well. From June, 2002 through February, 2004,658 he received a number of alternative therapi es associated with the DAN program of treatments for children with autism. T hese therapies included various dietary supplements, glutathione, secret in injections, and chelation. In 2004, apparently unsatisfied with Dr. Bock's approach,659 Colin's parents tried another unconventional therapy regimen wit h Dr. Bruce Russell. Doctor Russell subscribed to the view that autism is a neuroimmune system dysfunction [\"NIDS\"],660 and followed a NIDS treatment protocol based on this view. The most recent record from Dr. Russell was dated June 17, 2008, shor tly before the hearing in Colin's case. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 71. Because Dr. Mumper asserted that certai n test results constituted evidence in support of the causation hypotheses advanced, these tests and the therapies to treat the problems they revealed are recounted at somewhat greater length than those involving Colin's schooling and behavioral and speech therapy. Although Colin'sprogress in the conventional treatment programs does not bear directly on the causation issues, certain aspects of that treat ment are recounted when those evaluations coincided with the alternative treatments and evaluations. Evidence from controlled studies indicated that some of the treatments to which Colin was subjected had produced results comparable to placebos. Colin wasrepeatedly chelated, but only the first chelation resulted in the excretion of any mercury. Finally, some of the test results upon which Dr. Mumper relied were normal whencompared to age-appropriate values. Other te sts were performed by laboratories that had significant quality control and reliab ility problems, points which Dr. Mumper acknowledged, while nevertheless citing the te st results as evidence for the causation hypothesis. 2. Educational, Speech, and Behavioral Therapy.Colin was periodically evaluated between the initial TIPSE assessment described above and May 4, 2007, the date of the most re cent evaluation in his records. From shortly after his diagnosis with ASD in the early summer of 2001 through at least the 658 The year on the last encounter note is impossible to read. The month and day are October 21. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 27. Based on the previous encounter note (Pet. Ex. 4, p. 26), I conclude that the followingone was also in 2003. There were records of test specimens collected in December, 2003. See, e.g. , Pet. Ex. 4, p. 53. Thereafter, Dr. Bock called in a prescription for Diflucan for Colin in February, 2004, andrecommended, perhaps in a telephone consultation, further use of the Diflucan on March 5, 2004. Pet.Ex. 4, p. 28. 659 Doctor Russell recorded this dissatisfaction at Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. 660 NIDS is N euroI mmune D ysfunction S yndrome, reflecting the belief of some health care providers that ASD is a physical ailment caused by a linked dysfunction in the brain and immune system. See, e.g. , http://www.nids.net. These providers use antibiotics, diet, and antifungal medications. See id. at http://www.nids.net/nidsfaq.htm. Doctor Russell diagnosed Colin with NIDS. See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 103. 276spring of 2007, Colin had intensive speech and behavioral therapy, initially from TIPSE and Fischer Children's Services. Pet. Exs. 1, p. 53; 10, pp. 13-14; Dwyer Tr. at 43-44. An evaluation during the fall of 2001 indicat ed that little had changed in Colin's abilities from late spring 2001,661 and Mrs. Dwyer testified that Colin's behavior and speech difficulties continued during the fall of 2001. See Pet. Ex. 2, pp. 3-6; Dwyer Tr. at 44. By early December 2001, the Dwyers had decided to remove Colin from TIPSE and treat him with intensive ABA therapy. Pet. Ex. 2, p. 6. Colin was evaluated and tested at the McCarton Center for Developmental Pediatrics on December 14 and 27, 2001. Pet. Ex. 3, p. 2. Colin scored a 38 on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale [\"CARS\"], indicating he had an Autism Spectrum Disorder \"in the moderate to severe range.\" Pet. Ex. 3, p. 7. Colin's overall development was in the significantly delayed range for his age, due mainly to hiscommunication difficulties and rigid behaviors, and he was diagnosed as having\"Pervasive Developmental Disorder/Autis m Spectrum.\" Pet. Ex. 3, pp. 7-8. At the end of 2002, Colin's therapy consisted of at-home ABA therapy and speech, language, and occupational therapy, to taling more than 35 hours per week. He also attended school three days per week for two hours at a time. Pet. Ex. 3, p. 13. Although the Dwyers report ed that Colin \"has been making good progress,\" the evaluators noted concerns. Pet. Ex. 3, p. 13. The evaluation questioned whether \"his current program is effectively addressing his behaviors and tantrums . . . His lack ofprogress over the past year is very alarming and warrants a more aggressive andintensive program of intervention.\" Pet. Ex. 3, p. 18. Evaluations in late 2005 and early 2006 indicated that despite progress in language, \"Colin continues to present with si gnificant behavioral challenges.\" Pet. Ex. 7, p. 2; see also Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 16-27. The most recent report from the McCarton School, dated April 12, 2006, observed that \"C olin continue[d] to exhibit the same problem behaviors noted in January,\" while also noting that the family had observed that these behaviors were less frequent and less intense. Pet. Ex. 11, p. 2. The Dwyers moved Colin to the Elija Sc hool, which specializes in children with autism, for the 2006-2007 school year. Pet. Ex. 8, p. 1. A May 4, 2007 progress report from the school detailed his progress that year, listing discrete tasks, and reflecting whether Colin had mastered them. At ei ght and one half years of age, Colin had 100% mastery of body parts, but followed t he hand command to \"stand up\" with only 76% accuracy. He could use three-four word s entences, such as \"I am seven,\" but was still working on \"I need the bathroom.\" He was wo rking on saying \"hi\" to greet his teacher. Pet. Ex. 8, pp. 2-6. He had mastered a number of skills, such as establishing and maintaining eye contact when his name was called and naming a number of objects. 661 This record is undated, but given that it accompanies a letter that Mrs. Dwyer wrote on December 3, 2001, which describes this record as Colin's \"latest evaluation,\" it is likely the report wasmade in the fall of 2001. See Pet. Ex. 2, p. 6 (Mrs. Dwyer's letter). 277Pet. Ex. 8, p. 9. His tantrums ranged from none to 32 per day, with a mean of five. Pet. Ex. 8, p. 12. 3. Treatment by Dr. Kenneth Bock, April, 2002 through March, 2004. a. Overview. Colin began seeing Dr. Kenneth Bock at the Rhinebeck Health Center on April 19, 2002.662 Doctor Mumper described Dr. Bo ck as an \"integrative physician,\" with whom she had \"co-lectured,\" attended \"think tanks,\" and discussed \"medical problems in children with autism.\" Dwyer Tr. at 124. He apparently subscribed to the DAN approach to ASD treatment. The Dwyers sought out Dr. Bock for a \"biomedical\"663 approach to treating Colin. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 1. Doctor Bock treated Colin for slightly less than two years, from spring 2002 through early 2004. During this peri od, Colin had repeated medical testing, primarily conducted by laborat ories that offered specialized testing focused on children with ASDs.664 The wide range of treatments incl uded the gluten- casein-free diet,665 662 The Dwyers had contact with Colin's pediatrician twice after the March, 2001 visit, before beginning treatment under Dr. Bock. In November, 2001, his pediatrician ordered a complete blood countand lead level; the lead level was normal and the CBC was normal except for lymphocyte and monocytelevels. Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 46-47. The second contact involved a telephone conversation with one of Colin'sparents concerning a bout of diarrhea and vomiting on December 24 and 25, 2001. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 45. 663 The \"biomedical\" approach to treating ASD has been described as a view that ASD is \"a heterogeneous collection of discrete entities with differ ent etiologies sharing a common presentation\" and a view that \"some forms of autism are not simply treatable, but curable.\" Baker, PML 599, at 249. Thisarticle indicated that the biomedical approach to tr eating autism was promoted by the Autism Research Institute. Id. 664 Respondent introduced evidence that many of these laboratories had quality control problems sufficiently serious so as to render their test resu lts highly questionable, if not completely unreliable. Doctor Mumper also testified about her own concerns about one of the laboratories. The specific issues with the laboratories are discussed below. 665 Doctor Rust testified that the gluten-free diet is not helpful, except possibly in some cases of ataxia or migraine headaches. See Tr. at 2605-07. 278chelation, dietary and vitamin supplements,666 secretin,667 glutathione,668 methylcobalamin injections, as well as \"off-label\" treatment with a number of prescription drugs.669 None of these treatments is FDA approved for the treatment of autism. Although the records670 from Dr. Bock's office contain consistent notes that Colin was progressing, these notes do not reflec t any testing to confirm the reports.671 In some cases Colin reportedly reacted well to treatments, but each positive reaction was short-lived, and the basic circumstances of his illness-communication difficulty and behavioral problems-remained. Colin did ex perience relative improvement in both areas, but the record fails to demonstrate that the \"biomedical\" treatments were responsible. b. Initial Evaluation. At Colin's first visit on April 19, 2002, Dr. Bock recorded the Dwyers' account of Colin's regression as beginning around his second birthday, when they \"noticed [he] stopped reacting to his name,\" lost speech, eye contact, and social ability. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 2. Doctor Bock later noted that Colin's \"decline may have started after his MMR\" 666 Doctor Rust testified that he had not observed any efficacy to treatment by dietary supplements, with the caveat that parents do not alwa ys share what supplements their children are taking and when treatment with them begins and ends. Tr. at 2452. 667 Doctor Rust testified that secretin has been subjected to careful study, and found to have no effect as an ASD treatment. Tr. at 2452-53. His comments were echoed by Dr. Fombonne, who testifiedthat secretin has been shown to lack efficacy in autism treatment. In three separate randomized clinicaltrials, secretin did not differ from a placebo in efficacy. Tr. at 3703. NIH funded the secretin studies,which Dr. Rutter noted had consistently shown it was not effective. Tr. at 3341-42. 668 Doctor Brent testified that huge amounts of glutathione exist in the human body. The small amount of glutathione found in supplements would not make any difference in the body's ability to handle heavy metals. Tr. at 4347-48. 669 As of 2007, the only FDA-approved drug treatment for ASD behavioral symptoms was risperdal, to treat aggression, tantrums, and self-injury. See Casanova 2007, RML 67 , at 422. 670 All of Dr. Bock's records are handwritten and often extremely difficult or impossible to decipher. 671 What the records do establish is that Colin di d not thrive physically on this treatment program. At Colin's initial visit to Dr. Bock on April 19, 2002, his father reported Colin's weight at 34 pounds. Pet.Ex. 4, p. 1. This placed Colin, then about three and one-half years old, at around the 50 th percentile for weight. See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 83 (growth chart). In June, 2002, when the treatments began, and after two months on a gluten-free diet, he weighed 33 pounds. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 4 (this record also contains a notation that Colin was eating more foods and had an improved appetite). By September, 2002, Colin was down to31 pounds. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 9. In December, 2002, he weighed 33 pounds. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 15. Based on thegrowth chart at Pet. Ex. 1, p. 83, Colin, then four years of age, was around the 25 th percentile. His weight in April, 2003, when he was about four and one half years of age, was 35 pounds, still in the 25th percentile. He had gained only 1-2 pounds in a year. Pet. Exs. 1, p. 83; 4, p. 23. 279vaccination.672 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 3. The Dwyers reported Colin had a recent \"miraculous speech breakthrough\" that they attributed to his ABA therapy.673 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 2. Colin also had behavior problems, including tantrums, hyperactivi ty, and trouble sleeping. The Dwyers had no complaints regarding Colin's gastrointestinal health, although he had soft bowelmovements four to six times per day. Pet. Ex . 4, p. 2. A food diary of the four days prior to Colin's appointment shows that he wa s \"dairy free\" and ate a very limited diet. 674 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 39. During Dr. Bock's exam, Colin displa yed minimal eye contact, stimming, humming, irritability, moderate hyperactivity, and screaming. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 3. Doctor Bock's plan indicated the need for laboratory test ing to look for underlying etiologies for Colin's condition. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 4. c. Initial Testing.675 The initial tests ordered by Dr. Bock repor ted that Colin had low levels of carbon dioxide [\"CO2\"]676 and creatinine.677 Other test results were reported as high, but Dr. 672 As Colin received his MMR shortly after his fi rst birthday, this timing does not match what the Dwyers initially reported during the visit. In addition to this reference to an MMR vaccination and onset of Colin's symptoms, Dr. Bock also referred to a second MMR vaccination. See Pet. Ex. 4, p. 4. These references likely reflect Dr. Bock's belief that t he MMR vaccination causes ASD, an opinion also held by Dr. Kinsbourne. See Tr. at 903. The MMR-ASD hypothesis was presented and rejected in the Theory 1 test cases. The Dwyers did not rely on any connection between Colin's MMR vaccination and his ASD symptoms in this case. 673 The educational records filed do not reflect th is breakthrough, but they do not include accounts of individual sessions, simply periodic updates and assessments. 674 His diet consisted of bread, oatmeal, eggs, bananas, apples, cookies, chips, french fries, baked chicken, and carrots This food diary does not include a year. Given that the days recorded are April 15through April 18, it is likely this diary was prepared for his first visit with Dr. Bock on April 19, 2002. Pet.Ex. 4, p. 39. 675 Some of these tests appear to have been performed by an \"in house\" laboratory that used adult norms. See Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 126-30. When results are compared to a standard reference manual for laboratory testing, most of the results reported as high or low values are normal for a child of Colin's age. See M OSBY 'S MANUAL OF DIAGNOSTIC AND LABORATORY TESTS (3d ed. 2006) [\"M OSBY 'S LABS\"]. 676 I note that the listed norms of 23-29 reflect adult norms, as indicated by M OSBY 'S LABS at 157. Based on the appropriate norms for children (20-28), Colin's level was not low. 677 Creatinine is produced by muscle mass. Ordinarily, serum creatinine levels do not fluctuate, but renal disease or meals high in meat may cause elevations. Young children, such as Colin, typically have lower creatinine levels than older children or adults as the result of their lower muscle mass. See MOSBY 'S LABS at 207. I also note that Colin was still at the 25th percentile in weight. In any event, Colin's result of 0.4 mg/dL was not low, based on norms for children of 0.3-0.7 mg/dL. See MOSBY 'S LABS at 207. 280Mumper did not indicate that these result s were of significance for her causation opinion. d. Subsequent Testing. Over the next 20 months, Doctor Bock ordered many tests conducted at a number of different laboratories. I have grouped those results by the type of testing performed, omitting some that appear to hav e no bearing on the causation issues, and primarily focusing on those test results t hat Dr. Mumper thought had some relevance to the causation hypotheses. Because some of the laboratories Dr. Bock used were demonstrated to have reliability problems, in mo st cases, I also identify the laboratory. Testing performed at Dr. Bock's in- house laboratory demonstrated relatively consistent results for Colin throughout this period, but because the laboratory applied adult norms to all tests, its reports erroneously indicated that some of Colin's results were abnormal. (1) Amino Acid Testing.678 Great Smokies Laboratory679 tested Colin's amino acid levels from a urine sample collected on May 28, 2002. Pet. Ex. 4, pp.116-25. The results showed\"[m]ultiple deficiencies of e ssential and protein amino acids.\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 119. The report suggested an amino acid supplem ent schedule. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 122. (2) Oxidative Stress Testing. On July 11, 2002, Colin's blood was drawn for more tests performed by Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory. These in cluded a serum \"oxidative stress panel,\" plasma cysteine and an \"Essential and Metabolic Fatty AcidsAnalysis.\" The results were reported as abno rmal cysteine, and sulfate. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 96-98, 104-09. Testing in December, 2002, by Great Smokies also reported low glutathione, cyst eine, and sulfate levels. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 78-80. (3) Celiac Disease Testing. 678 More than 90 diseases are associated with abnormal amino acid function, and most amino acid defects are genetic in nature. M OSBY 'S LABS at 59-60. 679 Doctor Mumper testified in the general causation hearing that, in her \"best medical judgment,\" urinary mercury testing by Great Smokies laboratory was \"unreliable.\" See Tr. at 1529-32. This was in reference to a specific test result in another of the Theory 2 cases. She explained that Great Smokieslaboratory was one of the laboratories involved in her ongoing research project, which involved sendingsplit samples to different laboratories. Based on the results, she indicated that she was not comfortable inrelying on any testing from Great Smokies \"in a matter of this much importance.\" Tr. at 1532-33. The testreport itself indicated that the testing had not been \"cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration.\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 113. 281Other tests ordered on July 11, 2002, in cluded antibody testing for IgG, IgM, and IgA endomysial and gliadin antibodies,681 performed by Immunosciences Lab, Inc.682 Pet. Tr. Ex. 4, p. 99. The results indicated abnormal levels of antibodies for endomysial IgG, although the IgM and IgA antibodies werewithin range. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 99, 103. The g liadin antibody test was normal. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 101. (4) Testing for GFAP and Myelin Basic Protein. Colin had blood drawn on July 11, 2002, for neurofilament (GFAP) and myelin basic protein [\"MBP\"] IgG, IgM, and Ig A antibodies, with testing performed by Immunosciences Lab, Inc. Pet. Tr. Ex. 4, pp. 100, 102-03. High levels of IgM antibodies for neurofilament (GFAP) and MBP were detected, although the IgG and IgA for both neurofilament and MBP were withi n range. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 100, 102-03. (5) In-House Testing. Tests at the in-house laboratory on Nove mber 7, 2002, again reported that Colin had a low creatinine level. 683 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 83. Reported high levels on other tests were normal, when compared to age-appropriate norms . Another round of testing ensued in December, 2002. The results from the in -house laboratory again reported a low CO2 level, which was normal by age-appropriate norms. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 81; M OSBY 'S LABS at 157. In January, 2003, the in-house laborat ory again reported high and low creatinine and CO2.684 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 70. Testing on February 25, 2003 reported that Colin's 680 Screening for endomysial mucosal IgA antibodies is used to identify celiac disease. N ELSON 'S PEDIATRICS at 1591. Celiac disease is an autoimmune dis ease caused by exposure to gluten-containing foods, such as wheat and rye. See DORLAND 'S at 530. The normal IgA levels indicate that Colin did not have celiac disease and thus did not require a gluten-free diet. 681 Tests for gliadin antibodies are also performed to diagnose celiac disease. See DORLAND 'S at 100. The absence of these antibodies indicates that Colin did not have celiac disease and thus did not require the gluten-free diet Dr. Bock had recommended. 682 Problems with Immunosciences Lab, Inc.'s reliability were discussed at Dwyer Tr. at 157-77. The laboratory does not use child-specific norms. Dwyer Tr. at 165; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 13-19 (identifying specific problems at this laborat ory and subsequent governmental and court actions, concluding with the laboratory ceasing to perform clinic al testing). Specifically, \"results... since June 2002 from Immunosciences Lab Inc. may not be accurate or reliable.\" Res. Tr. Ex. 16 at 1; see also Dwyer Tr. at 169. I also note that respondent cited a number of cases from courts that have found Immunosciences'testing to be unreliable. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief [\"Res. Post-Hearing Br.\"] at 88. 683 Colin's result of 0.3 mg/dL was actually normal, based on norms for children of 0.3-0.7 mg/dL. See MOSBY 'S LABS at 207. 684 Colin's CO2 level was only slightly low; his creatinine level was normal. See MOSBY 'S LABS at 157, 207. 282creatinine was low.685 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 66. (6) Metal Testing.686 A red blood cell elements test performed in December, 2002, by Doctor's Data687 indicated the presence of arsenic, cadmium, and lead.688 No mercury was detected. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 75. The commentary accompany ing this test notes that Colin's copper levels measured high, and his selenium levels measured low, but the copper was within the reference range provided. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 75-77.689 I note that an earlier blood test for mercury and selenium by this same labor atory (in April, 2002) also failed to detect any mercury and reported Colin's selenium levels as normal. See Pet. Ex. 4, p. 131. This suggests that whatever affected Colin's selenium levels had nothing to do with his ASD diagnosis, and, instead, may have reflected the effects of the biomedical therapies performed by Dr. Bock. The low selenium level was detected in testing after Colin hadreceived chelation, secretin , and glutathione treatments. (7) Nutritional Testing. Nutritional testing in January, 2003, by Metametrix Clinical Laboratory did not flag any results as low (although it marked some as high). Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 67-69. The report was followed by a recommended list of nutritional supplements. Doctor Mumper 685 The use of age-appropriate norms would indicate that the creatinine level was normal. See MOSBY 'S LABS at 207. 686 Colin's mercury testing is addressed in a separate section, but some of the results are mentioned here as well. 687 In the general causation hearing, Dr. Mumper testified that, based on her experience, Doctor's Data laboratory had \"a very good set of toxicologists on board,\" and that she had \"relatively more faith inthis lab's expertise,\" (Tr. at 1550), apparently referring to her concerns about Great Smokies Laboratory. Respondent produced evidence that a 1999 request by Doctor's Data to analyze hair samples was deniedby the state of New York, based on the lack of good reference values. Res. Tr. Ex. 2; Tr. at 1564-65. Additionally, a 2006 report from the State of New York Department of Health, Res. Tr. Ex. 3, questioned a number of Doctor's Data laboratory practices. With caveats based on the fact that she had not read theentire exhibit and was unaware of corrective measures, Dr. Mumper indicated that Res. Tr. Ex. 3 was\"very concerning.\" Tr. at 1567-68. Doctor Brent was quite critical of test results from Doctor's Datalaboratory, including those for red blood cell metal levels, commenting that it is not the type of test thatwould be performed in routine medical practice, and does not have validated results that render itmeaningful. Tr. at 1853-54. 688 I note that Colin had a negative test for lead, testing below 1 g/dL in November, 2001 (Pet. Ex. 1, p. 46), which was at the low level of the reference range provided. A year later, Doctor's Datareported Colin's lead level at the upper end of the normal reference range. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 73. 689 A page is missing from this lab report that should fall between pages 76 and 77 of Pet. Ex. 4. The laboratory's discussion of the relevance of high copper levels is truncated due to the absence of this page, and discussion of other results from the test may be missing from the record. 283testified that some of these results reflect ed results consistent with the causation theory. Tr. at 139. e. Treatment. During the period June, 2002-February, 2004, Colin received a wide variety of alternative therapies, described below. T he treatments frequently overlapped, making attribution of any improvement to a particular treatment more difficult. In spite of Dr. Bock's enthusiastic assessments of Colin 's progress, assessments that were sometimes shared by his parents, Mr. and Mrs . Dwyer eventually determined that these treatments were not working. A few months after leaving Dr. Bock's practice, Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer reported to Dr. Russell that Dr . Bock's biomedical interventions had not been effective.690 See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. (1) Gluten- and Casein-Free Diet. Colin returned to Dr. Bock for a follow-up appointment on June 18, 2002. At this point, Colin had been on a gluten-free, case in-free diet since the April 19, 2002 appointment. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 4. His parent s reported that his stools had improved and his bowel movements had dropped to three times per day.691 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 4. Doctor Bock noted that Colin's appetite was also improved, his nasal congestion was better, and he \"continue[d] to make nice strides [wit h] his speech.\" His parents reported that he was a \"different child since Dec.\" and that he was making advances \"across allareas.\" 692 Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 4-5. Doctor Bock observed that Colin was moderately hyperactive, was \"wheeing\" and \"humming\" during the exam, and did not make eye contact with him. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 5. (2) Intravenous [\"IV\"] Glutathione. Mrs. Dwyer signed the consent to experiment al therapy for Colin's treatment with IV glutathione on July 24, 2002, and Colin rece ived his first of many treatments on that 690 Although Colin's parents reported that they did not think Dr. Bock's DAN-recommended treatments were effective, they later told Dr. Mu mper that some of them were associated with his progress. Dwyer Tr. at 189; see also Dwyer Tr. at 56-57. 691 In an apparent non sequitur, Dr. Bock included a note that Colin had lost weight and had a bloated abdomen after his second MMR. As Colin's vaccination records show only one MMR vaccination, which occurred some two years earlier, I cannot discern any reason for the notation, other than amisplaced attempt to link Colin's problems to an MMR vaccination. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 5; Pet. Ex. 1, p. 17. 692 Colin had an at-home visit evaluation less than a week prior to this appointment with Dr. Bock. The evaluator wrote that \"Colin has made excellent progress since I last evaluated him in December 2001\"and that Colin was talking during the visit. Pet. Ex. 3, p. 12. She advised no changes in his therapyprogram other than to add some activities with a typically developing peer. Pet. Ex. 3, p. 12. 284date.693 Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 37-38. At Colin's August 28, 2002, follow up visit, the Dwyers reported that Colin had a \"[ p]henomenal, unbelievable response to the IV [glutathione]\" that lasted for about three days. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 8. Even after three days, Colin was still \"markedly better,\" learning to play the harm onica and singing the ABC song. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 8. Unfortunately, by the time of the August 28, 2002 appointment, Colin was having tantrums again. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 8. Nevert heless, Dr. Bock noted at the appointment that Colin was \"not hyperactive presently\" and was \"[i]nteracting more [ with his] brother.\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 9. At the September 30, 2002 follow up visit,694 Dr. Bock prescribed further glutathione treatment. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 10. I cannot determine when the next dose was administered, but the records reflect that he missed a glutathione treatment on October 15, 2002, due to a fever. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 11. The Dwyers reported \"slow steady progress\" at his October 30, 2002 check- up, and Dr. Bock indicated an intent to continue IV glutathione and to start oral glut athione supplements. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 11-12. He indicated a similar intent at the Novem ber 25, 2002 follow up visit. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 14. At the December 20, 2002 visit, Mr. Dwyer reported that Colin was making slow, but steady, progress. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 15. Colin was reportedly \"[a] little 'spacey' [after his] last IV glut[athione]\" dose. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 15. There was no recommendation regarding continuing the IV glutathione at this visit; t he next mention of glut athione treatment is a notation: \"consider [undecipherable] IV glut in future,\" made on April 29, 2003. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 24. The records appear to indicate that Colin was prescribed \"TD\" (probably referring to \"transdermal\") glutathione in September , 2003 (Pet. Ex. 4, p. 26), and an entry on October 21, 2003 indicated that he was tolera ting transdermal glutathione (Pet. Ex. 4, p. 27), but there are no other references in the records indicating that Colin received glutathione treatment or that it had any effect. (3) Intravenous Secretin.695 Doctor Bock prescribed secretin at the August 28, 2002 visit, and Mrs. Dwyer signed the consent to experimental therapy on t hat date. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 9, 33-34. At the September 30, 2002 follow up visit after chelation and secretin therapy began, the 693 Because Dr. Bock's records do not reflect the actual administration of treatments, it is difficult to determine the number of treatments received by Colin. Doctor Russell summarized the instances ofsome treatments, but they do not entirely match up with Dr. Bock's records. See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. 694 This visit occurred after chelation and secretin therapy began. To the extent that an improvement was attributed to a particular treatment, I have included those comments in the sectionrelating to that treatment. 695 The state of Dr. Bock's records makes it difficult to determine how many secretin treatments Colin received. Doctor Russell reported that he received three. See Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. 285Dwyers reported that Colin's bowels were \"gr eat\" in response to the IV secretin. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 10. At the October 30, 2002 visi t, Colin's stools were \"excellent,\" but he had rough skin on his abdomen attributed to the IV secretin. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 11. At the November 25, 2002 visit, the Dwyer s \"noted definite improvement [after] IV secretin.\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 14. On Dece mber 20, 2002, Mr. Dwyer reported that after secretin, he was \"much more with it,\" mo re compliant, and playing better with his parents and brother. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 15. Doct or Bock also recorded that Colin's bowels were \"excellent\" since omitting certain foods from his diet. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 15. At Colin's January 21, 2003 visit, the Dwy ers reported to Dr. Bock that \"Colin definitely had a break through\" on Christmas Ev e with respect to his ability to interact with others. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 17. He had rece ived his third secretin treatment two weeks prior,696 and the notation suggests that the Dwyer s linked Colin's increased socialization to that IV secretion treatment. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 17. They also reported that he was more conscious of other kids, and he was mimicking other children's behavior. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 17. They observed that he was \"much happier,\" was having fewer tantrums, had\"incredible balance,\" and had excellent bowels. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 17. Doctor Bock recommended continuing se cretin at the January and February, 2003 visits (Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 18, 20), but t here were no other references to secretin treatment. (4) Chelation. 697 Doctor Bock prescribed chelation wit h DMSA at the August 28, 2002 visit, and Mrs. Dwyer signed the informed consent form on that date. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 9, 35-36. A baseline urine specimen was collected on September 20, 2002.698 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 93. He began the DMSA after this specimen was colle cted, and a post-provocation sample was collected on September 22, 2002. This sample tested at 17 g mercury/g creatinine. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 90. This was the only test of any type that reported any detectible level of mercury, in spite of many more rounds of chelation. 696 It appears from the records that this may have been his fifth secretin treatment, but because the dates of the infusions are not reflected in t he records produced, it is impossible to determine for certain. 697 It is also difficult to determine how many times Colin was chelated, but Dr. Russell reported that he had 12 rounds of DMSA, and also received alpha lipoic acid [\"ALA\"]. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. 698 Although the test results indicated that this was a post-DMSA-provocation test, Dr. Mumper testified that this entry was a mistake. Dwyer Tr . at 132. She testified that both Dr. Bock and Mrs. Dwyer told her that this urine specimen was collected prior to Colin's receipt of DMSA, in order to establish a baseline by which to measure post-provocation tests. Dwyer Tr. at 132. I credit Dr. Mumper's testimonyon this point, as no mercury was detected on this test, but mercury was detected on a second specimen collected, post-provocation, on September 22, 2002. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 90, 93. 286At the September 30, 2002 follow up visit after chelation and secretin therapy began, the Dwyers reported that Colin was continuing to improve in social interaction, cognition, and speech. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 9. However, his behavior was not improving; he continued to have tantrums and hyperactivity, and was starting to line up objects again. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 9-10. Colin was irritabl e during the appointment and did not make eye contact. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 10. Doctor Bock prescribed additional rounds of DMSA- provoked chelation. Id. In October, 2002, after Colin's third r ound of DMSA, Colin's parents reported a short-term increase in behavioral problems. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 11. The Dwyers noted that they were not happy with Colin's ABA program , but that his time spent in school seemed to help. Colin was demonstrating an increase in receptivity after the first twoDMSA courses. They indicated that \"it calm s him down, [increases] focus, helps [with] his behaviors, [and increases] his verbal [activit y].\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 11. As this was around the time he missed the IV glutathione due to a fever, Colin's parents were ableto attribute the \"significant difference\" to t he chelation therapy. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 11. Doctor Bock added an impression of \"heavy metal overload\" and reduced the DMSA dose. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 12. On November 3, 2002, Colin's second post-provocation urine test produced elevated levels of lead 699 but no detectible mercury. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 85. At a November 25, 2002 visit, the Dwyers told Dr. Bock that after his last chelation Colin had \"his bestday ever,\" and he tolerated the lower dose of DMSA much better. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 13. Further DMSA treatments were postponed pending laboratory result s. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 14. Apparently, chelation resumed sometime between the November 25 visit 700 and the next visit on December 20, 2002, becaus e Mr. Dwyer reported that Colin was \"tolerating [chelation] beautifu lly,\" but was also stimming mo re after treatment. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 15. Additional chelation was recomm ended. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 16. A post-chelation sample, taken on December 29, 2002, showed that all of Colin's results for the\"potentially toxic metals\" listed were withi n the reference range. No mercury was detected. Pet. Ex. 4. p. 73. On January 21, 2003, Dr. Bock recommended additional chelation, adding ALA. Although Dr. Bock did not further elaborate on what ALA was, he was likely referring to alpha lipoic acid. 701 Pet. Ex. 4, p. 18. A refill of Colin's previous DMSA prescription was ordered on January 30, 2003. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 19. 699 The Doctor's Data test report characterized the lead level as elevated, but the norms were based on a non-chelated population. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 85. 700 There is a record of a telephone call from Mrs. Dwyer on November 26, 2002, asking \"if ok to do DMSA,\" but it does not indicate when the DMSA was resumed. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 14. 701 It appears that ALA is another chelating agent. 287At Colin's February 25, 2003 visit, the Dwyer s told Dr. Bock that Colin was better after adding ALA to his DMSA chelation, and they noted that his receptivity and understanding had improved and his bad behavior had decreased. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 19. Doctor Bock indicated that l aboratory tests for this round of chelation were in order. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 20. Doctor's Data laboratory r eported that Colin's urine sample, collected on March 2, 2003, after DMSA provocation, showed normal levels of arsenic, lead, and tin, but no detectible levels of mercury. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 63. At the March 25, 2003 follow up visit to Dr. Bock, his mother reported t hat he was mildly agitated in response to chelation. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 21. Mrs. Dwyer told Dr. Bock t hat she felt the ALA therapy was helping Colin improve his verbal and social skills, \"esp[e cially] when [he] comes off the DMSA/ALA.\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 21. On March 25, 2003, Dr. Bock's plan indicated a discontinuation of the DMSA. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 22. There are no additi onal records pertaining to Colin's chelation therapy, although in October, 2003, shortly bef ore Colin's treatment with him ended, Dr. Bock recommended that the Dwyers consider DMSA/ALA therapy again. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 27. In November, 2002, Dr. Bock recomm ended that the Dwyers consider TTFD,702 administered transdermally. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 14. He repeated the recommendation in January, February, and March, 2003. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 18, 20, 22, 23-24. Colin apparently began TTFD in September, 2003. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 26. On October 21, 2003,Dr. Bock noted that Colin was tolerating the TTFD. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 27. There are no other records pertaining to this treatment. (5) Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) Injections. Colin began receiving a trial course of methylcobalamin injections, as recommended by Dr. Bock, at the November 25, 2002 visit ( see Pet. Ex. 4, p. 14), sometime in December, 2002. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 16. Mr. Dwyer signed the informed consent forms on December 20, 2002. Pet. Ex . 4, pp. 30, 32. By report, Colin did not react well to the methylcobalamin treatment. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 17. In response, Dr. Bock reduced the dose. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 18. Varying doses in February and March produced no further adverse reactions, but no improvem ent. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 20-21. At Colin's March 25, 2003 visit, Dr. Bock recorded that Co lin was tolerating the methylcobalamin without problems, but had not seen an effect yet. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 21. In April, 2003, Mrs. Dwyer reported that at a 12.5 milligram dose, Colin \"did well\" and had an improvement in language skills, but afterward had \"diarrhea all day.\" Pet. Ex. 4, p. 22. Dr. Bocklowered the dose in response. Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 23-24. In May, 2003, an increased dose was contemplated ( see Pet. Ex. 4. p. 25), but the next record is from September, 2003, 702 Although Dr. Bock's records do not indicate what TTFD is or why he prescribed it, PubMed, a website of biomedical literature maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, part of NIH, identified one article concerning the treatment of children with ASD with TTFD, thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide. The abstract indicated that TTFD appears to function as a chelator. 288and there is no mention of methylcobalamin at this visit (Pet. Ex. 4, p. 26), nor at any subsequent visit. 4. Treatment by Dr. Bruce Ru ssell, Spring, 2004 to Summer, 2008. Doctor Mumper did not appear to rely on any of Colin's test results or therapies used by Dr. Russell for her causation opi nion, and thus I have addressed Dr. Russell's treatment of Colin in much less deta il than that of Dr. Bock's treatment. a. Overview of Dr. Russell's Treatment.703 Colin was treated by Dr. Russell at the Northern New York Autism Clinic from June 4, 2004, through at least June 17, 2008, a month before the hearing in Colin's case. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 71, 103; see also Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29 (a more complete copy of the June 4, 2004 record). Doctor Russell apparently subscribed to the NIDS view of autism as an immunological disorder ( see Pet. Ex. 6, p. 103 (recording his impression as \"NIDS\")), and his treatment reflected that approach. The initial evaluation by Dr. Russell indicated that:[Colin had] been in ABA and a very intensive school program and has had significant improvement over the last year. Prior to that, he tried numerous biomedical interventions and homeopathic interventions. Noneof these previous interventions hav e been effective, except for Diflucan, which probably helped some. He has had 12 rounds of DMSA. He alsohad ALA. He had three secretin infusions. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. Doctor Russell also noted that Colin had an elevated ASO titer, 704 minimally elevated gliadin IgG antibodies,705 and positive candida antibody tests.706 He did not 703 A medical record that does not pertain to Colin Dwyer was filed as Pet. Ex. 6, p. 42. I have not considered this record. 704 This was apparently referring to an Antistreptolysin O titer, a test used to determine whether a previous streptococcus infection has caused a disease such as rheumatic fever or bacterial endocarditis. MOSBY 'S LABS at 103. Colin's level was reported to be 365 (Pet. Ex. 6, p. 56), which exceeds the age- normed level for children his age of 170-330. M OSBY 'S LABS at 103. 705 These antibodies are to proteins contained in wheat and wheat products and are suggestive of celiac disease. M OSBY 'S LABS at 263. These results were in contrast to earlier results. Compare Pet. Ex. 6, p. 61 with Pet. Ex. 4, p. 101. 706 Candida is \"a genus of yeastlike [f]ungi,\" severa l species of which may cause human infections. DORLAND 'S at 281-82. 289mention any other positive results of concern.707 His impressions were NIDS and PDD. He prescribed Diflucan, indicating that this was an off-label use. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 29. Doctor Russell wrote to Colin's pediatrician on June 4, 2004, recounting that Colin \"had a number of interventions through Dan (sic) which were not successful,\" and indicating that Colin would be taking Diflucan and having liver function testing. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 28. Doctor Russell's most recent progr ess note (from June, 2008) included the following two paragraphs, quoted in their entirety. The patient is a 9 year old male with a chief complaint of autism. His development has changed. He has developed increased language andnew social skills. New language skills new words list (sic). New socialskills include improved social skills. He has had an improvement inalertness, zoniness (sic), and bright ness. There has not been any ill effect of the new medicines. The following interventions have been tried, including ABA, early childhood intervention, the DAN prot ocol, chelation, and megavitamin therapy. The following valtrex, [708] famvir,[709] diflucan, nizoral,[710] include impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Sensory problems 707 Although the record of Colin's first office visit with Dr. Russell is in June, 2004, Dr. Russell apparently arranged for extensive laboratory tests in March, 2004. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 55-70. Colin alsoreceived what were labeled as a \"Herpes Sim.\" and \"Imm une Def. Panel.\" Pet. Ex. 6, p. 57. Based on the negative results, it did not appear that Colin had been exposed to herpes simplex 1 or 2. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 57. Tests were also performed for Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie virus, herpes virus 6, amongothers. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 60. He had high levels of antibodies to herpes virus 6, but not to any of the others. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 60. 708 Valtrex is the trade name for valacylovir hy drochloride, an antiviral medication ordinarily prescribed to treat herpes viral infections, including chickenpox. PHYSICIANS ' DESK REFERENCE (64th ed. 2010) [\"PDR\"] at 1702. 709 Famvir is the trade name for famciclovir, an antiviral used to treat herpes viral infections. DORLAND 'S at 673. 710 Nizoral is the trade name for ketoconazole, an antifungal medication, used to treat Colin's \"yeast.\" See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 97; see also DORLAND 'S at 976. Doctor Russell noted that this was not an FDA- approved use for the drug. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 97. 711 Celexa is the trade name for citalopram hydrobromide, an antidepressant in the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. A public health advisory regarding the use of antidepressants in children was issued in October, 2004. PDR at 1153 (noting that \"Celexa is not approved for use inpediatric patients\" due to an increased risk of \"suicidal thinking and behavior\"). 712 Zoloft is the trade name for sertraline hydrochloride, another SSRI class antidepressant. It is used to treat depression, OCD, and social phobia, among other conditions. D ORLAND 'S at 1686. 290include auditory sensory defensiveness. Current medications include Zoloft Oral Tablet 50 mg. School reports cognative (sic) improvement andincreased language. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 71. Doctor Russell's assessment was that Colin had an Immune Mechanism Disorder and Immunity Deficiency. 713 Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 71-72. b. Testing and Treatment. Over the course of his treatment of Co lin, Dr. Russell periodically tested Colin for antibodies to various bacteria and viruses. Tests were frequently repeated in spite of previous negative results and no evidence of active infection in the meantime.714 Colin was treated with two antiviral drugs715 and antibiotics,716 but Dr. Russell never identified for what condition they were prescribed.717 He also treated Colin with a number of antifungal drugs,718 antidepressants, and asthma medications, as indicated above. Colin's parents and Dr. Russell sometimes attributed Colin's progress to various 713 I note that paragraphs nearly identical to the two paragraphs quoted above (with the exception of the current medications list) appear on Colin's medical records for most other visits ( see, e.g. , Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 73, 79, 82, 85, 89, 91, 93 for visits ranging from February, 2005 through January, 2008). Therewere occasionally more specific notations about a new skill, such as \"sliding down stairs,\" appearing in theJanuary, 2006 visit. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 95. The August, 2006 record is very similar, but notable in that itindicated that Colin \"has not had an improvement in alertness, zoniness, and brightness\" and that he was having fewer meltdowns. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 87 (emphasis added). 714 For example, Colin consistently tested negative for herpes viruses 1 and 2 ( see, e.g. , Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 2, 28, 44, 48, 57) from 2004-07. These viruses are associated with cold sores and genitalinfections. See M OSBY 'S LABS at 772. None of Dr. Russell's records ever indicated that Colin had evidence of a herpes 1 or 2 viral infection. 715 These were Famvir and Valtrex. 716 The antibiotic identified in the records was Zithromax, which is the trade name for azithromycin. It is commonly prescribed to children for treatment of pneumonia, otitis media, pharyngitis, or tonsilitis. See DORLAND 'S at 2075, 187-88. There is nothing in Dr. Russell's records to indicate that Colin had any of these conditions. 717 Colin did test positive for herpes 6 virus, which is the virus that causes roseola (exanthem subitum), a short-lived disease of children that produces a rash and fever. A positive antibody test would suggest exposure. See DORLAND 'S at 651 (exanthem subitum), 1642 (roseolovirus). Perhaps Colin's repeated treatment with Valtrex and Famvir, both drugs that target herpes viruses, was based on theseantibody findings, but, if so, Dr. Russell did not expl ain that. Laboratory reports regarding his herpes 6 virus titers were sometimes inconsistent. Compare Pet. Ex. 6, p. 41 with Pet. Ex. 6, p. 39. These two tests appear to have been performed at different laboratories, with the high titer reported by SpecialtyLabs and the normal titer reported by Focus Diagnostics. Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 39, 41. 718 These include Diflucan and Lamisil. 'S at 712 (fluconazole), 1866 (terbinafine hydrochloride). 291treatments. In June, 2004, Mrs. Dwyer noted that Colin had \"made a lot of good progress\" and was \"much more verbal,\" but had struggled with OCD after a week on Diflucan. This went away after two weeks. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 103. Doctor Russell attributed this to \"die-off,\" presumably of yeast. He indicated that he was \"very happy with [Colin's] progress, and he seems to already be making major gains,\" apparentlyreferring to the Diflucan treatment. For reas ons not stated in his records, Dr. Russell prescribed Valtrex, an antiviral drug, to begin in two weeks. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 103. The Dwyers later reported that, after an initial \"die-off period\" 719 after starting Valtrex, they saw improvement in his speech and behavior, observations that were shared by Colin's teachers. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 102. By way of comparison, progress reports from the McCarton School in January, 2005 observed that while Colin was progressi ng, \"his compliance [was] still variable,\" and he continued to have tantrums and exhibit self-stimulatory behaviors. Pet. Ex. 11, p. 65. Colin, who was six years old at the time of these reports and had been undergoing alternative medical treatment for ov er two years, \"communicate[d] his wants and needs using primarily 1-word utter ances during spontaneous speech and 2-word utterances when provided with a model.\" Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 70-71. In a brief note dated October 11, 2005 that may have been a telephone consultation, Dr. Russell commented that Co lin had \"slipped cognatively (sic) over the last month,\" something Dr. Russell attri buted to a yeast problem. There are no contemporaneous lab results from this time pertaining to Colin's yeast levels. The record from the McCarton School closes t in time to this visit is a progress report from November 28, 2005. It indicated that \"Colin continue[d] to demonstrate ... tantrumming and exhibit[] self-stimulatory and se lf-injurious behaviors.\" Pet. Ex. 11, p. 43. In fact, much of the \"progress\" descr ibed in this McCarton School record is almost identical to that described 10 months ear lier. Both the progress and the problems described are nearly identical. Compare Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 43-46 with Pet. Ex. 11, pp. 65- 68. In January, 2006, Dr. Russell's progr ess notes changed to a computerized checklist and narrative format. See Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 95-96. At this point, his records of Colin's treatments appear in a more standar dized format. Although the \"History of Present Illness\" section changed slightly from visit to visit, most of the entries are similar, if not identical, from visit to vi sit. The \"Medication List\" section included Colin's current medications; the \"History of Present I llness\" section included a list of most of the 719 What had \"died off\" was not addressed in the record. Valtrex is an antiviral drug prescribed to treat herpes 1 and 2 infections, neither of which Colin had. Colin's pediatrician expressed his concernabout the Valtrex treatment in an October 19, 2004 telephone call to Dr. Russell. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 23. The pediatrician noted that Valtrex appeared to be affecting Colin's liver function, based on AST and ALTlevels ( see Pet. Ex. 6, p. 53) and that he did not condone prescribing Valtrex to a five year old. Doctor Russell agreed that Colin should see a gastroenterologist. Pet. Ex. 1, p. 23. 292interventions, medical and otherwise, Colin had received to date. Changes in Dr. Russell's treatment and evaluation of Colin from June, 2006, through June, 2008, were minimal, as were t he number of visits for which records were provided.720 See Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 71-88. A gap appears in the records between September, 2006, and the next visit, in March, 2007.721 See Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 84-85. In March, 2007, Dr. Russell suggested a trial of antibiotics, although he did not indicate what warranted antibiotic treatment, and nothi ng in the record suggested an infection. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 83. Laboratory testing during the period bet ween August, 2006, and the last records filed were not materially different from the earlier testing, with few exceptions. A slightly low CO2 level was reported in February, 2007 (Pet. Ex. 6, p. 24), but it was not low when compared to age-appropriate norms ( see MOSBY 'S LABS at 157). In the first homocysteine test performed on Colin, his result s were normal. Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19. His creatinine was reported as low (Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19), but compared to age-appropriate norms, it was normal ( see MOSBY 'S LABS at 207). Allergy testing revealed no IgE response to several foods that had been previ ously reported as provoking an allergic response. Compare Pet. Ex. 6, p. 7 with Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 129-30. These were the last laboratory tests filed in Colin's records. 5. Genetic Testing.In response to comments by Dr. Leventhal that Colin had not had any genetic testing (Res. Ex. CC at 7; Dwyer Tr. at 232), both Colin and Mr. Dwyer were genetically tested, 722 and petitioners properly supplemented t he record with the results on March 31, 2009. The results indicated that Colin did not have an \"imbalance\" for the genomic sequences in the test, which was indi cated as performed on patients with global developmental delays and \"should have t he capacity to detect...79 specific disorders/syndromes.\" Pet. Ex. 20, pp. 2-3. The results did not indicate whether Colin was specifically tested for genes associ ated with ASD or what the 79 specific disorders/syndromes tested were. G. Expert and Treating Physician Opinions. 1. Treating Physicians. 720 Although Dr. Russell's notes usually ended with a note about returning to the clinic in a set period of time ( see, e.g. , Pet. Ex. 6, p. 78 ('RTC in/on 6 weeks +/- 2 days\")), the time between visits did not coincide with these instructions. In spite of the instructions, the next recorded visit was some sixmonths later. It is impossible to determine if there are missing records, or just an extended time betweenvisits. 721 The first two pages of the March, 2007, record are duplicated at Pet. Ex. 6, pp. 81-82. 722 There is no indication in the record whether Mrs. Dwyer was tested as well. Pet. Ex. 20, p. 2. 293None of Colin's treating physicians causally connected Colin's TCVs to his ASD. Doctor Bock appeared to focus on Colin's non-existent second MMR vaccination aspossibly causal. 723 See Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 3, 5. His treatment focus could be interpreted as implicating heavy metals in Colin's case, but as chelation continued in spite of the lack of mercury found, he may have been focusing on lead or arsenic. In any event, henever implicated TCVs as causal. Doct or Russell tested repeatedly for bacteria and viruses, but did not make any record notati ons regarding Colin's TCVs as a possible or probable cause. 2. Doctor Mumper. 724 Echoing Dr. Kinsbourne's opinion on causat ion in general, Dr. Mumper opined \"that thimerosal-containing vaccines must be on the list of differential diagnoses\" for Colin's ASD. Dwyer Tr. at 151. Doctor Mumper testified: I reasonably looked for and did not find other alternative sources of mercury; that I looked for and did not find other alternative diagnoses forhis pattern of regressive autism. Because his laboratory data and clinical course showed evidence of so many of the medical problems I would expect to be in a child with autism who had difficulty excreting toxins, it is my best professional judgment ... t hat thimerosal-containing vaccines substantially contributed to [Colin's ] medical problems and his regressive autism. Dwyer Tr. at 151-52. She held this opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Dwyer Tr. at 155. Doctor Mumper relied on Dr. Aposhian for the existence of mercury efflux disorders. Dwyer Tr. at 196-97; see also Tr. at 1228. She relied on the largely negative mercury tests Colin received as evidence that he had difficulty excreting mercury, and on his only positive mercury te st as evidence of an extremely elevated body burden of mercury. She also cont ended that the negative blood mercury tests were proof that he didn't have ongoing exposure from other sources. Dwyer Tr. at 135- 723 MMR vaccines do not contain thimerosal; thus, even if Colin received a second, unrecorded vaccination, it would not implicate the causation theory in this case. 724 Respondent argued that Dr. Mumper was not qualified to opine on ASD causation. See Res. Post-Hearing Br. at 81-82. The most significant of their points is that Dr. Mumper does not diagnose ASD in children; she requires her ASD patients to have an independent diagnosis before she treats them. Id. at 82; see also Tr. at 1480-81. There is a degree of inconsistency with being willing to opine on the cause of a condition, while declining to diagnose it. 29437. However, it was Colin's \"chronic\" early exposure,725 not acute mercury toxicity, that concerned her most. It was \"the chronic ex posure that accumulates at a critical developmental window\" and particularly the very early exposure via the three hepatitis B vaccinations by seven weeks of age.726 Dwyer Tr. at 199. These vaccinations resulted in mercury deposits in his \"brain, kidney, fat and potentially lymphatic glands.\" DwyerTr. at 199-200. She also implicated Colin's lo w selenium levels as evidence of mercury problems. Tr. at 137. Doctor Mumper agreed that Colin did not have the history of antibiotic use and ear infections that she found significant in the Mead case, nor the prenatal antibiotic use she found significant in the King case, but nevertheless believed that TCVs contributed to Colin's ASD. Dwyer Tr. at 188-89. There was only one reference to Dr. Deth in Dr. Mumper's testimony in Colin's case, which was in response to a question by respondent's counsel. Dwyer Tr. at 163. During the general causation hearing, 727 she explained more about her reliance on his hypotheses regarding methionine synthas e, methylation, and epigenetics, and thimerosal's effects on these processes. Tr. at 1224-29. She appeared to adopt his opinions on the role of sulfur metabolism and oxidative stress in ASD. She testified that Colin's low sulfate, cysteine, and glutathione levels would affect his ability to detoxify heavy metals (Dwyer Tr. at 131), but she di d not mention his homocysteine level, which was reported as normal. See Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19. She also relied on Colin's laboratory testing for amino acids, citric acid mark ers, lactate, neurofilament, neurotransmitters, myelin basic protein, lipid peroxide, CO2, and mercury as evidence that he had problems with sulfur metabolis m, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Dwyer Tr. at 125-28, 133, 139-43, 145. Doctor Mumper's opinion appeared to be primarily based on laboratory testing performed by Dr. Bock. Her opinion was not based on any one test result, but rather onthe accumulation of a constellation of laborator y tests in conjunction with Colin's history. Dwyer Tr. at 200-01. The difficulty with these tests is that they were all performed a considerable period of time after Colin was diagnosed with ASD, and even longer afterColin's regression manifested. Thus, they are fairly weak circumstantial evidence of his health or oxidative stress status around the time of onset of his disorder, and at the time of his immunizations. 725 Episodic exposure through periodic administrati on of TCVs is not normally characterized as chronic. It may be that Dr. Mumper was referring here to the accumulation of inorganic mercury in Colin'sbrain as a result of this exposure. 726 However, I have found that Colin received only two hepatitis B vaccines by that point. 727 Petitioners expressly asked that I consider certain transcript pages of Dr. Mumper's testimony from the Mead and King hearing (Dwyer Tr. at 94-95). 295More specific difficulties concern the bona fides of the laboratories performing the testing, and whether the test results were based on norms for children. Colin had some tests that reflected some degree of oxidativ e stress, but Colin's poor nutrition status represented a significant confounder in many of these results. Doctor Mumper acknowledged these testing limitations. See Dwyer Tr. at 177-78, 191-92. Doctor Mumper conceded that the effect iveness of the DAN treatments provided by Dr. Bock could not be determined (Dwyer Tr. at 189-90), and thus it appeared that she did not rely on Dr. Bock's attributions of positive results from his treatments. The testing she did rely upon is discussed below. a. Immunosciences Laboratory Testing.728 Colin's neurofilament and myelin basic pr otein IgM antibody tests in July, 2002 were mildly elevated, but the IgA and IgG ant ibodies for both were within range. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 100, 102-03. Dwyer Tr. at 125- 28. The neurofilament test measures GFAP antibodies, and, according to Dr. Mumper, his elevated results reflect a possible \"loss of structural integrity of the astrocytes and ongoing neuroinflammatory processes.\" Dwyer Tr. at 126. This suggests neuroinflammation gliosis, tying into Dr.Kinsbourne's testimony about neuroinf lammation in children with autism, 729 pathology with astrocytes, and problems with glial cells. Dwyer Tr. at 126. She did not address the significance of the IgA and IgG being within range. According to Dr. Mumper, the elevated myelin basic protein antibody test suggested that the myelin sheath surroundi ng nerve cells was degenerating, a process that occurs in multiple sclerosis. Dwyer Tr. at 127-28. Doctor Mumper interpreted these antibodies as a marker for autoimm unity, and noted that Colin had either eczema or a fungal infection at four months of age, which could be an early sign of an immune dysregulation. Dwyer Tr. at 161-62. Doctor Mumper agreed that this test result was not within the ambit of Dr. Kinsbourne's causat ion hypothesis, as he did not implicate demyelination as a part of his causal mechanism. Dwyer Tr. at 162. Sheacknowledged that the Vargas paper's aut hors did not equate neuroinflammation with autoimmunity, and she agreed that Dr. Deth was not proposing autoimmunity as a part of his oxidative stress model of autis m causation. Dwyer Tr. at 162-63. Doctor Mumper acknowledged that both of these tests were very nonspecific, 728 In spite of the fact that ASD cannot be diagnosed through laboratory testing, Immunosciences Laboratory offered a panel of tests called the \"Premier Autism Panel,\" at a cost of $600.00. Additional recommended tests could be as much as $1200.00. Dwyer Tr. at 158-59. Tests for neurofilament andmyelin basic protein were part of the Premier Autism Panel, as well as other testing panels. See Res. Tr. Ex. 13. 729 Doctor Kinsbourne never commented on neurofilament antibodies as a marker for a neuroinflammatory process, a point Dr. Mumper acknowledged. Dwyer Tr. at 160. 296and have been reported as elevated in indivi duals who were otherwise normal. Neither test directly measures brain in flammation. Dwyer Tr. at 163-64; see also Tr. at 1477. A more basic problem with this test ing is the fact that Immunosciences Laboratory ceased clinical testing in partial settlement of a lawsuit regarding the loss of the laboratory's certification to perform testi ng. Dwyer Tr. at 166-67, 176; Res. Tr. Ex. 19. Specifically with regard to the neurofilament and myelin basic protein testing, there were no written policies and procedures for patient preparation, specimen collection, storage and preservation, conditions fo r specimen transportation, and specimen acceptability and rejection. Dwyer Tr . at 173; Res. Tr. Ex. 18 at 5-6. When she reviewed respondent's information regarding Immunosciences Laboratory, Dr. Mumper indicated that s he \"would give relatively less credence or perhaps even be forced to discount the reliability of those two particular lab tests given the information in the settlement agreement....\" Dwyer Tr. at 176. b. Great Smokies Laboratory Testing. The glutathione, lipid peroxide, cysteine,730 and plasma sulfate tests discussed below were all performed at Great Smok ies Laboratory in July and December, 2002, when Colin was three and one-half to four years of age. Dwyer Tr. at 177. Although Dr. Mumper had testified earlier that she was not comfortable in relying on any testing from Great Smokies \"in a matter of this much importance,\"731 she appeared to rely on these Great Smokies results in Colin's case. Doctor Mumper did not know whether these tests were normed for children. Dwyer Tr. at 177-78. These tests are not listed in MOSBY 'S LABS, a manual for diagnostic and laboratory tests. Doctor Mumper noted that Colin had reduced levels of the good type of glutathione, the type that hel ps with detoxification, i mmune function, mitochondrial function, and healthy gut epithelium, characte rizing his levels as \"in the red zone.\" Dwyer Tr. at 129; see also Pet. Ex. 4, p. 96. He also had high lipid peroxides, which measure lipid damage by oxidants and free radi cals. Free radicals are a marker for oxidative stress. Dwyer Tr. at 129; see also Pet. Ex. 4, p. 96. Later in the same year, in December 2002, Colin had the same test with similar results. Dwyer Tr. at 129-30; see also Pet. Ex. 4, p. 78. Doctor Mumper noted that Colin had lo w levels of cysteine, which is the precursor for glutathione, and a low cysteine level would suggest that he had a reduced ability to handle heavy metal toxicity. Dwyer Tr. at 131; see also Pet. Ex. 4, p. 97. Although Dr. Mumper attributed to the low level of cysteine to abnormalities in the 730 The transcript incorrectly reflects this as \"cystine,\" although the laboratory reports involve cysteine. Dwyer Tr. at 177; Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 79, 97. 731 See Tr. at 1532-33 (referring to results involving another child in the Theory 2 test cases). 297methylation pathway (Dwyer Tr. at 131), the methylation pathway is controlled by dietary methionine ( see Section VII.C.2.). She did not mention that Colin's homocysteine levels were normal in tests performed by another laboratory (Pet. Ex. 6, p. 19), and that homocysteine is a prec ursor for both cysteine and glutathione. Colin also had low levels of plasma sulfat e, which Dr. Mumper called a part of the detoxification mechanism dealing with excr etion of toxins. Dwyer Tr. at 131; see also Pet. Ex. 4, p. 80. c. Mercury Testing. Both of Colin's blood tests for mercury were negative. If Colin had mercury in his blood, it was below the detection threshold. Dwyer Tr. at 178-79, 182-83; Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 75, 131. This test, coupled with the initial post-chelation test discussed below, indicated that Colin was not acutely ex posed to mercury. Dwyer Tr. at 134-36. The first (and only) positive test came after chelation. Doctor Mumper characterized it as very elevated, indica ting a \"significant body burden of mercury.\" Dwyer Tr. at 133. However, she admitted t hat this characterization was not based on any study of post-chelation mercury levels in children, and her characterization was based on \"what she had been taught.\" Dwyer Tr. at 184-85, 201-04. She agreed that the test report itself indicated that the re ference ranges used were representative of a healthy population without chelation or pr ovocation. Dwyer Tr. at 184. She noted that Colin's test results for mercury did not follow a pattern observed in research conducted by the ARI, which show ed initial lead elevations after chelation, followed by mercury elevations. Dwyer Tr. at 182. She admitted the possibility that the tests showing undetectable levels of mercur y indicated that he was not having problems excreting mercury on his own, but that the tests showing no mercury might indicate that Colin had mercury stores that were not a ccessible to chelating agents. Dwyer Tr. at 185. Doctor Mumper agreed that there wa s no data correlating the amount of mercury chelated to body burden of mercury. Dwyer Tr. at 203. The only test to show detectible levels of mercury was performed by Doctor's Data. See Pet. Ex. 4, p. 90. Doctor Mumper i ndicated that if the post-chelation test from September 2002 were unreliable, s he would have only a number of laboratory tests that were consistent with, but not s pecifically suggestive of, TCVs contributing to Colin's autism. Dwyer Tr. at 186. She acknowledged that the mercury excreted could not be attributed to any particular source of mercury, either ethylmercury or methylmercury. Dwyer Tr. at 186-87. Doctor Mumper also noted that Colin's selenium level was low on one test (Pet. Ex. 4, p. 75), and indicated that \"[s]eleni um is one of the mechanisms that the body uses for glutathione function and to help get rid of mercury and so it will be used upwhen the body is trying to do that process.\" Dwyer Tr. at 137. While it is true that 298inorganic mercury in the brain binds to selenium,732 there is no evidence that brain levels of selenium are measured by plasma testing. Furthermore, there is no evidence that selenium is connected at all to glut athione. There was no evidence that selenium plays any role in forming glutathione precur sors. Finally, Dr. Bock's early testing showed Colin's selenium level was normal (Pe t. Ex. 4, p. 131); Colin's low selenium test followed a number of therapeutic in terventions, including chelation, secretin, and glutathione treatments. d. Other Testing. Colin had one high lactate test. Pet. Ex. 4, p. 67. Lactate is an anaerobic breakdown product of glucose, and it tends to be higher when there is a lack of mitochondrial ATP. There is a very long diffe rential diagnosis for what may cause lactic acidosis, including exercise or vomiting and di arrhea. Dwyer Tr. at 139. There was no other evidence that Colin had an ATP problem , other than possibly the elevated citric acid results from this same testing. Doct or Mumper testified that elevated citric acid markers are seen in people who have heavy metal toxicity, and that would be one of thedifferential diagnoses, based on these results. Dwyer Tr. at 140. She associated these results with a pattern that suggested interfer ence with the citric acid cycle, by which cellular energy is produced. Dwyer Tr. at 141. Although Dr. Mumper also considered Co lin's CO2 testing in her opinion on causation (Dwyer Tr. at 141) , the age-appropriate norms indicated that Colin's results were low on only one occasion. In any event, she acknowledged that a low CO2 levelhas a huge differential diagnosis, and can be pres ent in any condition that would cause metabolic acidosis. 733 It can be low if the child is screaming before a blood draw. Apparently considering Colin's test results to be abnormal, she opined that the results were consistent with a mild, ongoing met abolic acidosis, although she admitted that Colin screamed frequently. Dwyer Tr. at 141, 190-91. Colin had \"extremely low levels of a number of different amino acids.\" Dwyer Tr. at 142-43; Pet. Ex. 4, pp. 116-17. Doctor Mumper thought that the low levels of 732 Selenium is generally believed to play a role in mercury detoxification by binding to inorganic mercury in the brain. See Mottet, PML 197, at 376-77 . See also Clarkson and Magos 2006, PML 35, at 628. It is also considered an antioxidant. Selenium is a trace mineral required in small amounts and isobtained through diet. It is found in beef, fish, chicken, and turkey, as well as in some nuts and grains. NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp (last visited Mar. 3, 2010). Colin's selenium deficiency may well have been related to his restricted diet. 733 In commenting on Dr. Mumper's testimony in the Mead and King cases about CO2 levels, Dr. Brent noted that tests for serum CO2 should not be interpreted the way Dr. Mumper interpreted them. She testified that a low bicarbonate (CO2) level was indicative of acidosis and metabolic stress. However,these levels are very dependent on breathing speed. The more rapidly one breathes, the faster thereduction in CO2 levels. A crying child, not an uncommon scenario as the result of a blood draw, oftenresults in a lowered CO2 level. Tr. at 1856-57. 299methionine, taurine, cystathionine, and cysti ne were particularly important, noting the role of methionine in methylation. S he also commented on the extraordinarily low amount of taurine, noting that it would place Colin \"at a relative disadvantage in terms of his methylation biochemistry and in terms of his detoxification bioc hemistry.\" Dwyer Tr. at 143. Although poor nutrition can contribute to low amino acids, the end result is an impact on methylation biochemistry and detoxif ication biochemistry, suggesting both a marker and the cause of the problem. Dwyer Tr. at 191. The records reflect that Colin was a problem eater, which may be an explanation for why the amino acid levels wereso low across the board. Dwyer Tr. at 192. Doctor Mumper found Colin's laboratory re sults for neurotransmitters particularly important. Dwyer Tr. at 144-45. She te stified that the metabolism markers for neurotransmitters were high, suggesti ng increased synthesis of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This refl ects a sympathetic nervous system in overdrive. The sympathetic nervous syst em keeps someone agitated and would be consistent with reports of hyperactivity. Dwyer Tr. at 145. He also had an elevation in an analyte that reflects serotonin biochemistr y. She thought the low level of kynurenate and elevated level of quinolinate were parti cularly significant, because quinolinate interacts with can degenerate, and cause glutamate neurotoxicity. Dwyer Tr. at 146. A high level of quinolinate and a low level of kynurenate would lead to a suspici on of neurotoxicity. Dwyer Tr. at 146-47. However, these markers do not suggest a c ause for whatever neurotoxicity might be present. Two other markers Dr. Mumper found of significance were glucarate, which is \"compatible with induction of enzymes to try to handle either toxic episodes or pesticide exposure or fungicides.\" Dwyer Tr. at 148. To the best of her knowledge, this function is not involved with detoxifying mercury. Dwy er Tr. at 148. The pyroglutamate is a marker for either glycine or glutathi one deficiency. Dwyer Tr. at 148. 3. Dr. Haynes.Doctor Haynes' report was \"limited to an analysis of whether Colin Dwyer would be classified as at risk for mercury toxici ty base[d] on his exposure to Thimerosal- containing vaccines (TCVs). His response to challenge testing and other metabolicabnormalities, demonstrated through testing of Colin, strongly support his genetic/ metabolic susceptibility to mercury toxicity.\" Pet. Ex. 15 at 2. Doctor Haynes did not specify what metabolic testing he consider ed pertinent to his opinion, which he held \"to a reasonable degree of medical pr obability.\" Pet. Ex. 15 at 2. He indicated that mercury-induced neur otoxicity was characterized by loss of voluntary movement, developmental delays, mental retardation, dysarthria, 734 seizure 734 Dysarthria is speech that is slurred, slow, and difficult to understand. See DORLAND 'S at 572. 300disorders, and behavioral disturbances. Pet. Ex. 15 at 2. He did not indicate which, if any, of these conditions were present in Colin. Doctor Haynes briefly mentioned t hat human detoxification mechanisms had considerable genetic variability. His opinion regarding the presence of such mechanisms in ASD was not highly illuminating. It consisted of one sentence: \"Autistic syndromes often demonstrate metabolic mark ers that imply a genetic predisposition.\" Pet. Ex. 15 at 3. He did not specify a predi sposition to what, nor did he indicate what markers, if any, Colin displayed. He also opined that \"[c]helation testing\" in Colin, as well as unspecified \"other metabolic results conform to the susceptibility pattern found in mercury susceptible individuals.\" Pet. Ex. 15, p. 3. He did not explain the \"pattern\" to which he referred. He briefly menti oned glutathione, and that Colin demonstrated decreased levels of glutathione, apparently referring to the Great Smokies Laboratory testing. He asserted these test results showed a reduced ability to respond to oxidative stress. He indicated that Colin's pre-challenge and post-DMSA challenge urinary mercury levels \"fit[ ] the model of mercury effl ux disorder found in autistic children.\" Pet. Ex. 15 at 3. Once again, he did not indicate to what model he referred. I note that Dr. Mumper indicated that Colin's results were not typical of those found in other children with ASD who were chelated. Dwyer Tr. at 182. Doctor Haynes' entirely conclusory three-page report never mentioned the dose of mercury Colin received. I did not find Dr . Haynes' report to be helpful in establishing a cause for Colin's ASD. Although some of the standard symptoms of mercury toxicity he listed were consistent with those repor ted by other witnesses and evidence, some were not. He implied that Colin was \"mercur y toxic,\" but never pointed to any evidence that Colin had symptoms consistent with such toxicity. As I cannot determine the basis for any of his opinions, I cannot assess thei r reliability, and thus am unwilling to give them much weight in a causation determination. 4. Doctor Leventhal.Doctor Leventhal, respondent's specific causation expert, opined that Colin's TCVs did not cause or contribute to his autism. 735 Dwyer Tr. at 222. Although Colin experienced a loss of skills at certain points in his development, it was not a suddenregression. 736 Dwyer Tr. at 225. Based on the data he had examined, he did not think that regression was a separate phenotype.737 Dwyer Tr. at 254-55. 735 As Colin had not been evaluated by the standard diagnostic instruments, the ADI and ADOS, Dr. Leventhal opined that the autism diagnosis was highl y likely, but not definitive. Dwyer Tr. at 223 . 736 Doctor Leventhal indicated that he did not us e the term \"regressive autism\" in his practice. Dwyer Tr. at 225. 737 Consistent with the evidence in the general c ausation case, Dr. Leventhal testified that most children with autism experience some loss of skills. Dwyer Tr. at 256-57. He called the cases in whichthere is no prior abnormality \"exceedingly rare\" and the general view is that they are more a defect in 301Doctor Leventhal testified that the re cord in Colin's case was not adequate to determine whether his development was comple tely normal prior to his regression, but his language development was not normal at 20 m onths of age. Dwyer Tr. at 263, 268. He noted Colin's relative decline in weight from the 50th percentile at his six-month check-up on May 27, 1999, dropping to the 25th percentile by his one year visit, and indicated that children with ASD tend to be pi cky eaters as early as four to nine months of age. Dwyer Tr. at 226; Res. Ex. CC at 2; Pet. Ex. 1, pp. 70, 74, 81. He considered this to be some evidence of emerging ASD, but declined to call it a definitive symptom. Dwyer Tr. at 264. As for the testing that Dr. Mumper relied upon, Dr. Leventhal would not have ordered most of the tests. Even in the ca se of abnormal laboratory findings, the findings have to be correlated with a clinical finding in the patient in order to have relevance. Dwyer Tr. at 235. Laboratory values have to be considered in context. Dwyer Tr. at 238-39. He disagreed with Dr. Mumper that Colin's testing indicated that Colin had oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, methyl ation abnormalities, increased body burden of mercury, or heavy metal toxicity. Report of Dr. Leventhal, Res. Ex. CC, at 7. He called her conclusions \"not supported by the record.\" Id. Direct evidence of neuroinflammation could be obtained by lumbar punc ture if the clinical picture warranted testing. If he thought a child had brain infl ammation, he would not rely upon peripheral blood markers. Dwyer Tr. at 236-37.738 Doctor Leventhal testified that aut ism is not entirely genetic, and that environmental factors contribute to the appear ance of autistic symptoms. Dwyer Tr. at 246. Currently, only 1-2% of the childr en he has diagnosed with autism have a known, identifiable genetic cause. Dwyer Tr. at 249. Although there may be environmental contributions to ASD, TCVs have been carefu lly examined as possible contributors, and there is no evidence that they cont ribute to ASD. Dwyer Tr. at 285. H. Evaluation of Specific Causation Experts and Their Opinions. Both Drs. Mumper and Leventhal have si gnificant experience in evaluating and treating children with ASDs. On the whole, Dr. Leventhal was better qualified to opine on ASD's causes than Dr. Mumper, given his more pertinent academic qualifications (he is a psychiatrist; Dr. Mumper is a pediatri cian) and the nature of their practices (Dr. taking an appropriate history or an inability to measure problems in preverbal children. Dwyer Tr. at 258- 59. In this, he disagreed with Dr. Rust, who testified that he was unable to find prior abnormaldevelopment in about 20% of the children he evaluated. See Tr. at 2388. In Dr. Leventhal's current experience, he could not find evidence of prior abno rmal development in about 10% of cases, and, even in those, he assumed a failure to find the prior abnormality rather than one not existing. See Dwyer Tr. at 260-61. 738 Doctor Rust also commented on the quality of the laboratories performing testing on children with ASD: \"[T]he tendency has been for these laboratories to be sought out by a particular cadre ofphysicians whose views of autism fall outside that of the general medical community.\" Res. Ex. W at 7. 302Leventhal practices at an autism center of excellence; Dr. Mumper at a pediatrics practice with a half-time focus on ch ildren with ASD and other developmental problems). I considered Dr. Mumper's experi ence with the Autism Research Institute in assessing her qualifications, but the amount of res earch it actually conducts is difficult to determine. The one publication filed (t he 2005 ARI Monograph, PML 9) did not appear to be of high quality and there was no indication of peer review. See Section VI.D.2.d. In contrast, Dr. Leventhal was a co-author of one of the standard diagnostic instruments used in assessing children with ASD, and is involved in numerous other researchprojects in such fields as genetics and epidemiology. Doctor Mumper's willingness to rely on testing she considered of dubious reliability gave me pause, in addition to her willingness to make causal determinations based on laboratory testing not specific for ASD . Many of the test results she relied upon could be attributed to nutritional problem s in a child with an extremely restricted diet. Others focused on peripheral markers that could not reflect what was happening in the brain. See Dwyer Tr. at 159-60. She proffered opinions on Colin's mercury levels based on tests showing an absence of mercury in the presence of chelation, and opined that the one positive test result was extrem ely elevated without any reliable basis to do so. On the other hand, some aspects of Dr . Leventhal's testimony suggested that he required scientific certainty, rather than a preponderance of the evidence, in order to opine in favor of causation. For example, he was unwilling to associate causally some prenatal exposures with ASD, although other of respondent's experts were of the opinion that a causal association was probable. 739 His summary dismissal of Dr. Rust, a highly qualified neurologist with significant experience in diagnosing and treating ASD, as \"probably...a pediatrician\" was also troubling. See Dwyer Tr. at 261. On the whole, however, I found Dr. Leventhal's testimony more reliable and grounded in science than that of Dr. Mumper . Having conducted little to no research herself, Dr. Mumper relied on the opinion of Dr. Aposhian regarding mercury efflux disorders in ASD. I rejected that opinion in Section VI. She relied on Dr. Deth's opinions regarding sulfur metabolism and oxidat ive stress. However, even if the test results upon which she based her opinion regar ding Colin's sulfur metabolism and level of oxidative stress are accurate and reliable, they say little about mercury as a causal 739 He did not believe a causal relationship between prenatal thalidomide exposure and autism had been demonstrated (Dwyer Tr. at 247), although Dr. Rodier and others of respondent's experts opinedthat one was likely. He did not think a causal link between maternal rubella and autism had beendemonstrated, although he noted that there was an \"association\" between the two. Dwyer Tr. at 248-49. With regard to terbutaline, he appeared to share the opinion of Dr. Rodier that no causal association had been demonstrated. Dwyer Tr. at 247-48. 303factor.740 Children with many diseases and diso rders display markers of oxidative stress. Diet alone is a significant confounder of plasma levels of the oxidative biomarkers upon which Dr. Mumper relied, and she acknowledged that diet could skew these results. She relied on Dr. Kins bourne's opinion about neuroinflammation in ASD (see Tr. at 1228-29), and tried to tie Colin's neurof ilament test results to that opinion, but those results were performed by an unreliabl e laboratory. Furthermore, Dr. Kinsbourne did not suggest that neurofilament testing would be helpful or useful in detecting neuroinflammation. Most significantly, even if Colin had some degree ofneuroinflammation, which the Vargas study, PML 69, would suggest is likely in those with ASD, neuroinflammation is so nonspecific that it would be of little evidentiary value to establish that mercury was its cause. Doctor Mumper's willingness to rely on Colin's mercury test results as evidence of high levels of mercury in his body was par ticularly troubling. She admitted that his results were not typical of those she saw in other autistic children. She admitted that she knew of no research into normal mercur y excretion levels after chelation against which Colin's one positive mercury test could be measured. 741 It appeared that regardless of the results for mercury levels , Dr. Mumper was willing to opine that they reflected mercury's role in ASD. If levels were low, it was because the child hadexcretion difficulties even in response to c helation or was hypersusceptible to the low level of mercury present. If the levels were high, then the child was retaining mercury, demonstrating excretion difficulties, and t hus had more mercury available to cause neuroinflammation. Thus, either the presence or the absence of mercury in test results in a child with ASD could be interpreted as \"proof\" of a mercury excretion problem. Finally, because Colin did not appear to be exposed to mercury on any continuing basisfrom diet and was not breast fed, he likely had a lower level of mercury in his system than other children. Thus, his TCV exposure would not be likely to \"tip him over the edge.\" I. Applying Althen. The burden on the petitioners in Colin's s pecific case is to demonstrate by preponderant evidence that Colin's ASD was caused by his vaccines. They assertedthat the thimerosal component of those vaccines either caused or substantially contributed to his ASD. To meet their burden under Althen , petitioners must demonstrate by preponderant evidence \"(1) a medical theory causally connecting thevaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the 740 In this regard, I note that Dr. Mumper never mentioned Dr. Bock's use of methylcobalamin to treat Colin. According to Dr. Deth's hypothesis and experiments ( see supra note 64 regarding Dr. Deth's research grant from ARI related to methylcobalamin; see generally Section VII.D.4), mercury adversely impacts methylcobalamin levels, but Colin was not responsive to methylcobalamin replacement. 741 Doctor Mumper testified that there were no data that reflected mercury excretion patterns in children post-chelation. Tr. at 202. 304vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.\" Althen v. Sec'y, HHS , 418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In their post-hearing brief, petitioners acknowledged their burden to establish each of Althen 's three factors by a preponderance of the evidence. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 78. Petitioners correctly noted that sci entific certainty regarding causation is not required by the Vaccine Act, and that circum stantial evidence showing that a vaccine was a preponderant cause is sufficient. Pet. Po st-Hearing Br. at 78. Petitioners framed Althen 's first prong as requiring them to demonstr ate that the immunizations in question can cause the type of injury at issue, and the second prong as \"addressing the question of whether the particular vaccines did cause the particular condition at issue.\" Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 78. 1. Medical Theory . Evaluating petitioners' medi cal theory is complicated by the many links in the chain of causation hypothesized. Some of the links are not reasonably subject to dispute, others are partially correct, and st ill others are just plain wrong. Concisely stated, their hypothesis is that Colin's \"neur odevelopmental injuries are the result of a neuroinflammatory process triggered by inorgani c mercury...deposited in [his] brain[] as a byproduct of exposure to TCVs in the first two years months [sic] of life.\" Pet. Post- Hearing Br. at 12. The inorganic mercury triggered neuroinflammation, characterized by the activation of the brain's innate i mmune system. This neuroinflammation produced two interrelated effects. First, it created an environment of oxidative stress in the brain, \"with a complex cycle of impaired and disrupt ed biochemical processes that interfered with brain function.\" Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 12 (Dr. Deth's hypothesis). Second, it produced an excess of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, leading to a persistent state of overexcitati on or overarousal. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 12 (Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis). Petitioners asserted that exposure to vacci nes leads to an accumulation of \"toxic\" mercury in the brain. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 17. They asserted that inorganic mercury can cause neuroinflammation, which can di srupt neuronal functioning, leading to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, which is amp lified by mercury-induced oxidative stress. See Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 24, 33, 40-44. This imbalance manifested in the development of other symptoms of ASD in a genetically susceptible child. Pet. Post- Hearing Br. at 42, 54-58. As the recitation and discussion of the evidence in Sections VI-VIII above demonstrate, petitioners failed to establis h that their medical theory was probable, plausible, or reliable. They failed to pr oduce sufficient reliable evidence to show that TCVs, either alone or in combination with other environmental mercury exposure, were a cause of ASD in children susceptible or vu lnerable to such exposure. They failed to produce sufficient reliable evidence to dem onstrate that TCVs, either alone or in 305combination with other environmental merc ury exposure, can produce mercury levels capable of causing neuroinflammation. Thus, they failed to show that TCVs belong onthe list of potential causes of ASD. They framed the general causation questi on in terms of regression. \"Can TCVs in general be a substantial factor in causi ng autistic regression in some susceptible or vulnerable number of children?\" Pet. Post-H earing Br. at 78. Petitioners relied on the general causation evidence \"to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that TCVs could have been substantial contributing causes of [the] autistic regression[]\" in Colin's case. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 14. In making this argument, they appeared todistinguish Colin from other autis tic children without loss of skills. See Pet. Post- Hearing Br. at 12 (\"As a result of the impai rment and disruption of brain function caused by TCV-induced neuroinflammation, each boy [referring to the three Theory 2vaccinees] suffered a regression in his development, characterized by the loss ofpreviously acquired skills\"). Although they cl aimed that they were not seeking to show that regression is a separate diagnostic category or syndrome ( see Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 51), they relied on Colin's regression as a evidence of an environmental trigger or \"second hit\" demonstrating the effect of TCVs on a genetically susceptible child. Although petitioners argued t hat \"none of the epidemiology addresses autistic regression of the sort these three boys exper ienced,\" they did not explicitly state that Colin experienced the \"clearly regressive autism\" about which Dr. Greenland testified. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 13. Petitioners correctly asserted that they have no burden to present epidemiologic evidence demonstrating an association between ASD and TCVs, calling such evidence\"scant, at best.\" Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 13. The testimony of their own epidemiologist was even stronger. Doctor Greenland testifi ed that he did not find the only studies purporting to show an increased risk of autis m associated with TCVs-studies by Dr. and Mr. Geier-to be of evidentiary value. Tr. at 122-23. While certain subpoints of their causat ion hypothesis-their medical theory-were clearly established or uncontested, most we re not. Although they called their evidence \"robust and reliable\" and claimed that a prima facie case for causation in general had been established ( see Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 81), I have concluded otherwise. Althen requires more than merely asserting a medical theory. Petitioners must offer a reputable medical theory, and inherent in that standard is a requirement that the theory be biologically plausible. See Walther , 485 eputable). The theory of TCV causation is simply not reliable, and can no longer be considered \"biologically plausible,\" 742 in view of 742 The IOM did use the term \"biologically plausib le\" in referring to the TCV-ASD hypothesis in 2001, but what it meant by the term was something other than a reputable and reliable theory. See IOM 2001 Report, RML 254, at 83. By 2004, in view of t he additional evidence accumulated in the intervening three years, the IOM rejected the hypothesis in the strongest terms available to it. IOM 2004 Report, RML 306all that is known about mercury in the brain. 2. Logical Sequence of Cause and Effect . Petitioners equated Althen 's second prong to establishing whether causation had been shown in Colin's specific case. Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 78-79. They argued that\"ample indirect and circumstantial evidenc e\" established that Colin's TCVs caused neuroinflammation that caused his ASD. Id. at 81. Even if Dr. Leventhal applied a heightened evidentiary standard to determining caus ation in Colin's specific case, I have not. At best, the evidence established t hat Colin received vaccines that probably contained thimerosal and that he had a diagnos is of ASD. No sequence of cause and effect between the two can be logical, in vi ew of the conclusion that petitioners have failed to establish a causal connection in general between ASD and TCVs. Furthermore, Dr. Mumper's causal opinion is based, in large part if not in its entirety, on the opinions of Drs. Kinsbourne, Deth, and Aposhian, whose opinions I have rejected as scientifically implausible and unsound. Notwithstanding this defect, the specific factors she cited as important in Colin's case largely concerned testing performed by laboratories with questionable reli ability. Many of the laboratory tests upon which she relied are not tests appearing in standard laboratory manuals or tests that would even be ordered by most practi tioners, and the data they provide are not diagnostic of ASD. Treatments designed to tar get the \"problems\" noted in Colin's test results were not efficacious, either in the view of Colin's parents or in the view of Colin's subsequent treating physician. 743 In their post-hearing brief, petitioner s appear to acknowledge the problematic nature of Colin's test results. Although Dr. Mumper testified about a number of test results that contributed to her opinion that Co lin's ASD was caused by his TCVs, in their post-hearing brief they only mentioned a \"laten t, genetic inabilit[y] to properly metabolize and excrete mercury.\" Pet. Post-Hearing Br. at 82. Colin's only positive mercury test occurred after chelation, and its results were not measured against any standardized normal values. In spite of numerous other r ounds of chelation with a variety of chemical and \"natural\" chelators, no detectible levels of mercury were ever again excreted. This result is not compatible with a child wit h problems metabolizing and excreting mercury. Petitioners' causation claim is unaffe cted by Dr. Greenland's opinion that the existing epidemiological studies of ASD c annot detect a causal connection with TCVs on a small subgroup. The hypothetical subgr oup he described involved regression after previously normal development. Contra ry to petitioners' assertions ( see Pet. Post- 255, at 3,7; see also Tr. at 3080. 743 This comment should not be interpreted as concluding that Dr. Russell's testing and treatment regimen was any better at addressing Colin's ASD, although some of the drug therapies may have beeneffective in addressing specific components of his behavior. 307Hearing Br. at 81), Colin was not development ally normal at the time he received his last TCV. Colin's ASD had already begun to manifest by the time he was 20 months of age. Thus, Dr. Greenland's opinion that the epi demiological studies of ASD cannot rule out an effect on a small subgroup of children is irrelevant to Colin's case. Ruling out known causes of ASD, as Dr. Mumper did in her report and testimony, is not sufficient to put TCVs on the list of possible causes. \"Althoughprobative . . . a simplistic elimination of ot her potential causes\" is insufficient to show actual causation. Moberly 592 1323 (citing Althen also v. Warner-Lambert Co. , 424 F.3d 249, 254 (2d Cir. 2005) (using differential diagnosis to eliminate other causes is insuffi cient to demonstrate causation). Thus, the process of differential diagnosis cannot be applied to conclude that Colin's ASD must have been caused by TCVs, once other causes are ruled out. A differential diagnosis isonly as good as the list of possible causes. 3. A Proximate Temporal Relationship. Onset after vaccination is not enough, standing alone, to satisfy Althen 's third prong. Petitioners have the burden to demons trate the existenc e of a \"scientific temporal relationship.\" F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The time fram e must be medically acceptable. De Bazan 539 at 1352. Petitioners did not address this prong of the Althen standard in their briefs and this omission is a significant flaw. The failu re to show that a disease arose in the time expected by the medical community means a pet itioner is not entitled to compensation. Pafford , 451 F.3d at 1358-60. It is clear that Colin's ASD manifested with speech delay at or before 20 months of age, before he received his last round of vaccinations. At that point in his life, he had already received vaccines containing as much as 212.5 g of ethylmercury. However, none of petitioners' experts opined on the time frame in which mercury must be received in order to cause autism in a developing brain. The weight of the evidence was that ASD's origins are largely prenatal, and thus any environmental insult contributing to its largely genet ic cause must have occurred prenatally. Respondent's experts indicated that if post- natal causes played any role in the many neuropathological differences found in individual s with ASD, they must occur very early in the post-natal period, but the experts di d not think postnatal causes were likely or probable. At best, petitioners have demonstrated that Colin's ASD manifested after most of his vaccinations. That would be true of any child with this condition who had receivedvaccines, because ASD cannot be reliably diagnosed until at least one year of age,even if subtle indicators may have exis ted earlier. Most ASD symptoms become apparent to parents at 18-24 months of age, and thus onset will follow vaccinations in almost every child with ASD. 3084. No Burden on Respondent to Establish an Alternate Cause. Petitioners have failed to establish any of Althen 's three factors. Thus, they have failed to establish that Colin's vaccines were a substantial cause of his injury. Becausethey have failed to establish causation by a preponderance of the evidence, the burden never shifted to respondent to establish an alternative cause for Colin's condition. De Bazan , 539 F.3d at 1353-54. 5. Summary. In concluding that petitioners have failed to establish that Colin's TCVs caused his ASD, I emphasize that I have not applied a heightened evidentiary burden. I did not require scientific certainty, nor direct evidence of causation. Daubert requires that an opinion be supported by something more than subjective belief; it must be grounded in\"the methods and procedures of science.\" 509 U.S. at 590. There is no evidence that mercury has ever caused an ASD, only speculation that it might. At best, there is someevidence of an ongoing inflammatory process in ASD, but no indication that it is caused by mercury, and many indications that it is not. The excitation-inhibition theory is likewise unsupported in the peer reviewed medi cal literature; at best, there is some speculation that some ASD symptoms may be a reflection of an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, but no proof of any biological ov erarousal when the sym ptoms are observed. Scientists use the terms \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" with very specific meanings. A hypothesis is an idea proffered to explain an event. A theory is what is developed aftera hypothesis has been subjected to many attempts to disprove it, and thus, it is likelycorrect. 744 This is an important distinction, because in biology, almost anything is possible. The pertinent question is whether so mething is probable or likely. Petitioners had several hypotheses but nothing that approac hed a theory. As Dr. Rust commented: \"Hypotheses are a dime a dozen.\" Tr. at 2373. A number of governmental and non-gov ernmental scientific agencies have looked at the issue of a relationship between TCVs and ASD. These agencies includethe National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, American College of Medical Toxicology, American Academy of Pediatrics, World Health Organization, U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Eu ropean Medicine Agency, and the American Academy of Family Practice. Tr. at 1857-58; see also Res. Tr. Ex. 4, slide 47. They have all concluded that there is no causal connection between the two. Unfortunately, the Dwyers (and uncounted other parents of children with ASD) have relied upon practitioners and researchers who peddled hope, not opinionsgrounded in science and medicine. My heart goes out to parents like the Dwyers who 744 See Tr. at 1978-80, 4314-15. 309struggle daily, emotionally and financially, to ca re for their children, but I must decide cases based on the law and not sentiment. The law in this case requires preponderant evidence that TCVs caused or substantially contributed to Colin's ASD, and, by that standard, petitioners are not entitled to compensation. Section XI. Conclusion . Petitioners have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Colin's condition was either caused or si gnificantly aggravated by his vaccinations. Thus, they have failed to establish entitle ment to compensation and the petition for compensation is therefore DENIED.
