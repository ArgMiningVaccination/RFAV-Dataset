It was my 3rd time I don't think I will try anywhere else. It was so nice to be welcomed back by the staff, everybody there is so friendly and nothing is ever too much for them. All I can say is Go! You will love it! - JoVisited February 2018 We can't think of better destination to do a Detox! The liquid diet was surprisingly easy to follow and everything was simply delicious. We both achieved great results. The hotel is stunning and the specialists are friendly and caring. It was great to be there in February, as it was peaceful and relaxing - paradise! - ChrisVisited September 2017 Wonderful holiday! Members of staff are very friendly and helpful, accommodation is stunning - truly 5 stars - and the food is outstanding. Spa treatments were the best part of the holiday! Health and Fitness Travel was great at suggesting and organising all for me. - DeniseVisited August 2017 Thank you, Health and Fitness Travel for such an amazing vacation! It was one of my top 3 best holidays ever. The Spa is simply the best I've ever seen, the hotel is very comfortable, members of staff are super friendly and the location is great. My advice is don't think twice - you will love it! - SandraVisited April 2017 The Spa and members of staff are truly amazing! They have gone the extra mile to make sure my stay was as comfortable as possible! All my treatments and times were arranged according to my needs. Perfect, from start to finish. Highs - The architecture and landscape have a rustic charm, with beautiful flowers and a private beach view. It is stylish without being pretentious. - Treatments are a fusion of Thalassa, spa, contemporary wellness and anti-ageing solutions, providing you with an all-round well-being experience. - The spa facilities are adult-only ensuring optimal relaxation. - There is a comprehensive Longevity Vitality Activity Plan of group classes - There is a booking service for surrounding golf courses, meaning you don't have to waste time turning up and waiting around. - If you are a fish and seafood lover, the Terrace Grill prepares excellent fresh dishes. - For an added thrill, why not try some of the water sports available, including jet skiing, scuba diving and surfing. - The medicine aspect of the resort is really great for individuals with specific physiological ailments. Lows - The rooms are not super close to the main spa area, therefore if you struggle with mobility this might be an issue (although they do have golf buggies to get you around) - There is only one main restaurant option - The pool can be a bit chilly Other programmes at Vilalara Longevity Thalassa & Medical Spa Why Book with Health and Fitness Travel?
