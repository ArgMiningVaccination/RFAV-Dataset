Soul Retrieval is a conscious entrance into the lucid dream state during which the practitioner and their spirit level 'team' use specific observation and retrieval methods of reintegrating a person's fractured and disembodied sense of themselves thus transforming them into their whole, radiant and true knowledge of themselves. It is a beautiful ceremonial experience, for the practitioner and their person. When we use the word 'soul' we are referring to that part of us that is eternal. It was never born and will never die. We can lose our connection with that most sacred part of ourselves. Often as very young children we experience trauma and shock to the degree that we dissociate from ourselves and this is the beginning of what we call \"soul loss\". Bit by bit we turn away from ourselves. This is not a 'bad' thing. It is a normal way of dealing with difficult situations. It is also normal, at some point, to reconnect fully and wholeheartedly with ourselves and thus to know again our eternal, radiant being. What You Will Love In a kindred, supportive and welcoming environment we will take each of you step-by-step, building your confidence and skills needed to effectively practice this healing journey. You will learn how to enter and navigate the awakened, conscious dream state. You will meet your own spirit helpers, aspects of yourself, who open your connections to your own spirit level. Then we will put it all together to do a Soul Retrieval. With every step of the way, you will deepen your connection with your soul, as well as cultivate a profound and beautiful method of serving your fellow humans. Who Can Attend?
