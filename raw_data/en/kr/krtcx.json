It is quite amazing how many ailments you can treat at home with the right tools and knowledge. In our house, we have two preschoolers who are basically walking and talking petri dishes. This is why we like to stock our shelves with some herbs that are also safe for children. In these lists we are mainly going to focus on preserved herbal medicines, but keep in mind, the herb garden is a great way to grow your medicinal plants too! Dried Herbs: Having dried herbs is a must for your home apothecary.

You can defuse them into the air, you can apply to the skin with a carrier oil, you can add them to your handmade cleaning products, you can add them to your lotions, balms and salves.
