While it is true that the first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have landed in Chicago and front-line health workers are receiving it, we must not make the mistake of letting our guard down. We need to protect our most at-risk citizens first with the initial limited supply of doses, and there is no easy estimate about when all of us will be vaccinated. ________ The Chicago Tribune publishes letters from readers reflecting their thoughts on news and Tribune content.

I have publicly stated that we should collect, analyze and review more safety and efficacy data on clinical trial participants younger than 18. But my confidence in the vaccines is such that, if my priority-risk group were called in to receive a dose, I would be first in line. Vaccinations will be one of the mechanisms we use to bring this global health crisis to an end. Until that time comes, we must exercise common sense and remain vigilant in our daily lives. More data and science will lead us to a better place if we continue to grant them our patience. \u2014 Dr. Archana Chatterjee, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago Comparing Pritzker, Trump, Biden Recent news stories about Gov. J.B. Pritzker, President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden cause one to think more deeply about their style of governing and personal character. Pritzker and Trump, both billionaires and novices in political governing, are opposites. Pritzker wears the thin veneer of cultural refinement, not realizing that lurking below it is basic human instinct, both good and bad. Trump, on the other hand, is a street fighter and wears his instincts on his sleeve, not seeing the role self-restraint plays in life. Neither Pritzker nor Trump is a balanced realist. But Biden is essentially a compromiser: The pros and cons of any situation can be accommodated to achieve a compromise. Even core principles can be sacrificed to gain an acceptable result, as Biden's flip-flops have shown. He is a flexible, short-term realist at the expense of cherished principle. All three do have some things in common \u2014 wanting to be publicly liked and loved, wanting no public criticism and wanting to blame others for their governing failures. \u2014 Dennis Dohm, Oak Lawn Pritzker didn't throw us a bone I couldn't agree more with the Tribune editorial ( [\"Pritzker proposes budget cuts, but why blame voters?,\"](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-pritzker-tax-coronavirus-budget-cuts-20201216-uf5icz3ojzd2ndmsckwg3vu26e-story.html) Dec. 17) about Gov. J.B. Pritzker's blaming of Republicans for the drubbing of the income tax referendum. It was spot-on. Let me add one more nail in that coffin. Pritzker has no clue how to negotiate. He has announced budget cuts after the defeat of his tax proposal. Did he ever think maybe, just maybe, the referendum would have passed if he had taken those measures before Election Day? Perhaps at the time when all of those small businesses started to close in May? Maybe this particularly sad Illinois legislature could have thrown us a bone with a little contrition. The chances of passage would have been immensely improved if Pritzker would have been a leader by being fiscally responsible early on; I for one would have voted yes. \u2014 Dave Kibble, Lombard Too big for their britches Would this be a good time to remind Sen. Bernie Sanders, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Ilhan Omar, and other so-called progressive Democrats that no one voted them into the White House? That they cannot even necessarily claim that they put Joe Biden in office as most Democrats do not lean that far left? \u2014 Laurence Siegel, Manteno Stop giving tweets credence It's time for the major networks and reputable newspapers to stop reporting on Donald Trump's tweets that claim fraud in the election. The Electoral College has declared Joe Biden the winner in this election. We need to stop promoting anything that undermines the public's confidence in our democratic voting process. It's old news. Give it a rest! \u2014 Maryann Cushing, Chicago You can score a lot and still lose On May 17, 1979, the Chicago Cubs scored 22 runs in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies \u2014 and lost! How could that be possible? It was among the most runs they ever scored in a game. Did they remain on the field declaring victory? Did they demand a recount? Did they claim the other team cheated? Did they demand an investigation? Did Cub fans declare massive fraud? No. The Phillies simply outscored them, and that was that. \u2014 David Wechsler, Glenview Hunter Biden tax inquiry In his Dec 17 syndicated column [\"Hunting for Hunter. Where has the media been?,\"](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-hunter-biden-tax-investigation-thomas-20201216-tyk3womwvvam5obcxbhbmz46zm-story.html) Cal Thomas attacks \"the media\" for their perceived failure to report more on the Hunter Biden tax investigation before the election. He's aghast that Attorney General William Barr \"sat on the news,\" and he accuses NPR of \"ignoring\" the New York Post laptop story. His conclusion is that \"the media\" is thus directly responsible for Donald Trump losing the election. Am I missing something? Which office was Hunter Biden running for? \u2014 Nicholas Kapche, Chicago Democrats on receiving end Oh what fun it is to watch the Hunter Biden story play out, as new details emerge. In fact, it's reminiscent of the badgering Donald Trump Jr. received from news stations after meeting with a Russian lawyer. As we can see, what goes around eventually comes around. 'Tis the season for Democrats to be on the receiving end. \u2014 JoAnn Lee Frank, Clearwater, Florida Why are officers still on duty? Regarding the 2019 raid of Anjanette Young's home: Why aren't those male police officers suspended without pay? It is not too late to have all of them involved in this shameful and totally disrespectful action to receive the logical negative consequences they so richly deserve!
