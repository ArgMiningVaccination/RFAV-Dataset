Heat and cold, gentle electrical impulses, ultrasound, diathermy, hydrotherapy and exercise therapy are also used.

Prescription Medicines: Sometimes the best possible intervention includes the use of antibiotics or other pharmaceutical drugs. Your naturopathic physician can and will prescribe these when appropriate. Hormone Therapy: Hormone therapy is for those who have decreased levels on lab testing, and/or display hormone deficiency symptoms. Hormone levels are checked and monitored during therapy. "}
