We think of rose geranium as a dermal adaptogen. Indigenous to Africa, rose geranium now lives and thrives around the world. It grows easily, almost profusely, and has an ability to thrive nearly anywhere. Rose geranium's ability to thrive wherever it lands communicates to the astute observer its tremendous resilience. When used topically, rose geranium delivers this same adaptability and resilience to our skin. The matrix of phytochemical constituents within this plant re-educates the skin on how to function properly and find its balance. Rose Geranium HydroSoul, along with its cooling and pH balancing abilities, is particularly beneficial to skin that is experiencing an imbalance of oil production. Dry skin? Rose Geranium. Oily skin? Rose Geranium. Combination skin? Rose Geranium. That is why this duo, and our entire Rose line of products, is so supportive for skin conditions that are usually considered polarities, or unrelated; dry, oily, and combination. Instead of forcing the skin into a state of submission, it empowers the skin to self-regulate. Rejuvenating and refining Rosehip Balancing Serum is ideal for skin that is sun damaged, hyperpigmented, scarred, oily, dry, or combination. Abundant in whole-form trans retinoic acid, carotenoids, lycopene, and essential fatty acids, it is a feast for the skin and a dream when paired with our Rose Geranium HydroSoul. Oil + Water: By using Oil and Water we support and mimic the skin's protective hydrolipid barrier. This simple pairing realigns our skin with its own innate rhythm, supports the skin's own natural defenses, enhances the skin's ability to detoxify, and encourages the skin's own moisturizing and hydration strategy. When layered together oils hold the waters to the skin, while waters anchor the moisture from the oils more deeply. This pairing is a perfect delivery system for nutrients. Essential fatty acids, antioxidants and both water-soluble and fat-soluble phytonutrients are delivered and completely bioavailable in this form. Most people who apply a twice daily application of their Oil Serum and HydroSoul find that this simple pairing provides enough moisture and hydration so that they need nothing else for their skin to feel properly hydrated and moisturized.
