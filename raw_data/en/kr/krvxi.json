Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium diphosphonic acid - um salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sen - sitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper - kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in hors - es less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormal - ities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

CooneyAAEP News February 2019 III Using compounded products within the standard of care In recent years, a number of newly approved equine phar- maceutical products have come to market. However, we recognize that within equine practice there are still signifi-cant gaps in the number of FDA-approved equine products and, in some cases, products are approved with a route of administration that may not be appropriate for all of our equine patients. Increasingly, some compounding pharmacies are offering (1) preparations that are very similar to approved products, (2) a new formulation of an approved ingredient (e.g. an injectable form of omeprazole), and (3) formula-tions of new products containing active ingredients not approved in the U.S. market (e.g. toltrazuril\u2014and there are three FDA-approved products labeled for use in horses for treatment of EPM). Although these may be tempting to consider, equine practitioners should consider what consti-tutes the standard of care and our ethical obligation to provide that level of care to our patients. The AAEP's Equine Veterinary Compounding Guidelines state that falling below the standard of care occurs \"when he/she fails to exercise the level of care, skill, diligence and treatment that is recognized as the standard of acceptable and prevailing veterinary medicine.\" When to use a compounded drug \"What is best for the horse?\" That question should drive our decisions when it comes to how we treat our equine patients and how we deal with their owners. I think we would agree that utilizing a compounded product that has not been evaluated/validated for safety, efficacy, stability or potency\u2014when there is an FDA-approved product(s) available in the appropriate dosage form to treat our patient for the indicated disease/condition\u2014does not live up to an acceptable standard of care. Certainly there are times when compounded products are necessary and appropriate for our patients. But using a compounded product in lieu of a very similar or identical approved product is neither necessary or appropriate. Veterinarians should understand that \"cheaper drug cost\" is not a valid reason for the use of compounded products when FDA-approved products are available for their patients.Additionally, some veterinarians perceive compounded products to be equivalent to \"generic\" drugs. Generic drugs have undergone an FDA-approval process and are manufactured under the same strict quality control standards as are all FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. Compounded products are not generic drugs and are not equivalent to generic drugs. For a veterinarian to represent a compounded product as equivalent to an FDA-approved drug is misleading and unethical. Research the compounding pharmacy When compounded products are indicated, it is the ethical responsibility of the veterinarian to perform his or her due diligence when selecting a compounding pharmacy. Ask questions of the pharmacy, including: r\u0001 \"SF\u0001UIFZ\u0001MJDFOTFE\u0001JO\u0001UIF\u0001TUBUF\u0001XIFSF\u0001UIF\u0001QSPEVDU\u0001JT\u0001 prescribed? r\u0001 )BT\u0001UIF\u0001QIBSNBDZ\u0001FTUBCMJTIFE\u0001B\u0001iCFZPOE\u0001VTF\u0001EBUFu\u0001 for they test each lot? r\u0001 %PFT\u0001UIF\u0001QIBSNBDZ\u0001SFQPSU\u0001BEWFSTF\u0001FWFOUT\u0001BOE\u0001EP\u0001UIFZ\u0001 have a recall mechanism in place? that sets minimum are prescribing? r\u0001 %P\u0001UIFZ\u0001IBWF\u0001DMJOJDBM\u0001FWJEFODF\u0001UIJT\u0001QSPEVDU\u0001XJMM\u0001 perform for the prescribed indication in the horse?ETHICS By Kenton Morgan, DVM, DACT Dr. Morgan is managing veterinarian with Zoetis' Equine Technical Services group and chair of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.continued on page IV Veterinarians should understand that \"cheaper drug cost\" is not a valid reason for the use of compounded products when FDA-approved products are available for their patients.ASSOCIATIONIV AAEP News February 2019 ASSOCIATIONETHICS Using compounded products within the standard of care, continued r\u0001 )BWF\u0001UIFZ\u0001UFTUFE\u0001UIF\u0001QSPEVDU\u0001GPS\u0001QVSJUZ \u0001QPUFODZ \u0001 stability and sterility (if it is an injectable form)? r\u0001 %PFT\u0001UIF\u0001QIBSNBDZ\u0001DBSSZ\u0001MJBCJMJUZ\u0001JOTVSBODF Although this is not a complete list, it illustrates the importance of researching the pharmacies providing the products you will be using in your patients. Manage your risk Also, select an ethical compounding pharmacy that has the best interests of both the horse and you in mind. Several years ago, a compounding pharmacy in central Kentucky made a compounding error that resulted in the deaths of multiple horses. The pharmacy was sued by horse owners and the case was settled for an undisclosed amount. However, the pharmacy then sued the prescrib-ing veterinarian who called in the prescription. The veterinarian was exonerated but not until going through a complex and expensive litigation process. This also highlights the importance of managing your risk associated with using a compounding pharmacy. In addition to the ethical considerations, the prescribing veterinarian should understand that his or her profession-al liability policy may or may not respond to allegations of negligence arising from the use of compounded drugs. Veterinarians insured with the AVMA-PLIT may review comments at avmaplit.com. Always use FDA-approved drugs when available; use compounded products only when necessary and not in lieu of approved drugs for the appropriate indication. It is best for the horse and the ethical thing to do. Touch Point: Your clients want you to offer more services\u2014really It's true: AAEP market research revealed that 20% of your clients would use you more if you offered more services. This is extremely positive news for equine practice. How do you identify the services your clients wish you provided? r\u0001 Ask your clients. Client satisfaction surveys that are sent post-visit or annually can be the tool through which you learn what your clients want. r\u0001 Analyze the feedback. Surveys only prove useful when someone in the practice is dedicated to evaluating the responses. Online survey tools like SurveyMonkey are cost effective, tabulate the responses for you and make the process simple. The human brain trust in the practice will still need to determine what the survey data may mean for your mix of client services. r\u0001 To add or not to add, that is the question. If your data reveals specific services your clients would like you to offer, then a cost-benefit analysis is your next step. Offering a new service may require staff training, purchasing a new piece of equipment or hiring a veterinarian with the required skill set. There are simple formulas that can help you determine if the benefit in terms of revenue exceeds the cost of adding the service to your menu. The Touch program has the easy-to-use tools you need to survey your clients. Visit touch.aaep.org to choose from three types of client surveys as well as download step-by-step instructions for using a survey in your practice. The Touch program is exclusively available to AAEP members. AAEP News February 2019 V ASSOCIATION What is the 'standard of practice' for a pre-purchase exam? The recent AAEP Annual Convention included a very good in-depth session on pre-purchase examinations in the English sport horse. The presenters represented great expertise in the world of elite performance horses and provided sound information and science. In the weeks since, discussions within the profession have elicited questions as to the level of \"standard of practice\" that applies to the pre-purchase examination in all English sport horses and, indeed, in all disci-plines. Some have expressed fear that if they do not conduct extensive imaging as part of their examination that they may not be operating at the accepted standard of practice. Much has been written on the pre-purchase examination and its application to equine practice across all disciplines and uses. The exami-nation is conducted for a purchaser after a thorough conversation with that buyer/client and a clear under-standing of the purchaser's goals for the horse at this time. This discussion is the basis for the examination and should include an explanation of the ancillary testing and imaging available to the client. The veterinarian and client then make the decision as to what applies to this particular horse. All decisions should be documented in the record and agreed to by both parties The pre-purchase examination should begin with a thorough physical examination of the horse in question. This is the standard of practice, and it makes no difference what the price of the horse might be. It is only after that physical and the understanding of the purchaser's needs that additional testing and imaging is applied. It may require no imaging or it may require extensive imaging. That is up to the client. Examinations of elite-level horses may certainly require extensive imaging of varied modalities to provide the information to assist the purchaser in their decision-making process of whether to purchase a horse. Again, this is determined by the purchaser's wishes after discussion. Through the years there have been attempts to have the AAEP establish certain standards for the pre-pur-chase examination; repeatedly, the association has been advised by legal experts that it should not establish these standards but rather have the science and established norms within the equine industries, and the wishes of the purchaser, dictate what the examination should include. In conclusion, we believe that the principle of the Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship and the needs of the client at the time of the examina-tion should dictate the extent of ancillary testing and imaging. No practitioner should fear that they are not meeting the \"standard\" if they are conducting a quality examina-tion that meets their client's needs.By R. Reynolds Cowles, DVM; Christopher B.

Renowned for her work in equine colic, Dr. Hassel is also among the world's most successful amateur tri-athletes. She is a two-time age group world champion and 15-time podium finisher in the Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, the sport's pinnacle event to which she first qualified and competed in 2000. After winning her age division in 2017, she finished third last year, crossing the finish line in 10 hours, 36 minutes. Dr. Hassel's workload prevents her from training as much as other tri-athletes, so her workouts are shorter but more intense. She trains between 8 and 12 hours per week during the winter offseason, and up to 15 hours per week during race season. Training occurs in the mornings before work so that evenings are devoted to family time with her husband, also a triathlete, and teenage stepdaughter. She undertakes longer training sessions on weekends that she's not on call. \"The key is making it a priority,\" she said. \"You have to be disciplined with when you go to bed, when you get up, and you generally aren't going to regret getting up early and doing something for yourself before starting the day.\" She swims between 2,500 and 3,500 yards per session three days per week with her Masters Swimming group, an organized program that helps build endurance and speed. Other mornings, she's logging miles in either her running or cycling shoes\u2014indoors during the winter months. The training is strenuous so it's important that it be fun. \"My Masters workouts are a blast because we're a bunch of friends working out together. Even my indoor bike sessions\u2014I use a program in which I'm an online avatar among a couple thousand people around the world riding simultaneously,\" said Dr. Hassel, an accomplished cyclist who competes with a Fort Collins-based team in half a dozen endurance cycling races each spring. \"I love my training. If I don't train, I get really grumpy!\" The grueling nature of triathlon has instilled considerable mental strength, but nutrition and recovery are also integral to Dr. Hassel's success. She pays attention to the nutritional habits of high-performance Ironman competitors and marathoners, especially when there is scientific evidence that products might be superior for optimizing calorie intake and performance. Meanwhile, finding ways to improve recovery\u2014from both the inside and outside\u2014is key and, according to Dr. Hassel, probably the most important thing as you age. Because of the race's toll on the body, Dr. Hassel will skip the Ironman World Championship this year and instead focus on the 2019 Half-Ironman World Championship in Nice, France, in September. It will be a family affair as both she and her husband have qualified for the event. Even though the race won't be quite as physically demanding as the Ironman Hawaii, Dr. Hassel will prepare just as much, and she would have it no other way. \"I enjoy pushing myself to my limit, getting better and performing at my highest ability on race day,\" she said. \"No matter what place I end up, if I feel like I had a really good race where I gave it my very all, I'm happy with the result.\" For practitioners toying with the idea of getting more physically active but concerned about the demands of the profession, Dr. Hassel encourages establishing motivation and consis-tency by finding a training partner, setting a workout schedule and even getting a coach. \"Just get serious about your goals and start,\" she said. \"Prioritizing yourself and your health will only improve your productivity each day at work and in life.\" WELLNESS Dr. Hassel enjoys a long bike session in the days prior to the 2018 Ironman World Championship.

Foals that underwent umbilical remnant resection to treat infection, patent urachus or a combination of the two between 2004 and 2016 were included in the study. A total of 82 foals met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 13 days at the time of surgery. Forty-two foals (51.2%) underwent surgery due to infection, 20 (24.4%) due to patent urachus and 20 (24.4%) had both. Concurrent diseases were present in 50 foals (60.6%) prior to surgery, 20 of which had multiple concurrent conditions, with diarrhoea (n =19) and septic arthritis and/or physitis (n =19) being the most common. Seventy-three (89%) foals survived to discharge. Concurrent septic arthritis and/or were the only predictors of nonsurvival. Thirty-two foals (39%) had post- operative complications, with anaesthesia time and failure of passive transfer (FPT) being signi cant risk factors. Failure of passive transfer and longer anaesthesia times were associated with increased odds for post-operative complications. Short-term survival of foals undergoing surgical excision of umbilical remnants is favourable but may be adversely affected by concurrent septic arthritis and/or physitis. Survival of S. equi in soiled bedding In this study Alexandria Poulin and colleagues at the University of Maine, USA, evaluated the survival of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi and zooepidemicus in soiled equine bedding (SEB) and compost. In Experiments 1 and 2, Dacron bags containing SEB were inoculated with 1010 colony forming units (cfu) of each subspecies, and stored at 21 -23\u00b0C for 24 h, then placed in compost windrows containing SEB and feed waste. Streptococci were quanti ed immediately after inoculation in the bags, and during the 336 h after placement in the windrow. In Experiment 3, autoclaved and nonautoclaved SEB was inoculated with 1010 cfu of each subspecies and sampled from 0 to 264 h. In Experiment 4, SEB was dried at 37\u00b0C for 48 h and sterile water added (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mL) to ve subsamples of 100 g of dried bedding, which were inoculated with 1010 cfu of each subspecies and sampled at intervals from 0 to 120 h. In Experiments 1 and 2, heavy Streptococcal growth was detected immediately after inoculation of Dacron bags, but no Streptococci were isolated 48 h after placement in compost windrows. In Experiment 3, S. zooepidemicus was isolated from SEB up to 168 h; in nonsterilised SEB, Streptococci were isolated up to 72 h. In Experiment 4, S. equi was isolated from dried SEB, with no added water, up to 120 h, whereas in dried SEB, with added water, S. equi was isolated up to 48 h. These data suggest that, depending on moisture, microbes in SEB may eliminate equine Streptococci .Suspensory branch injury This retrospective case study by Dimitri Kadic and colleagues at Newmarket Equine Hospital in the UK aimed to report the characteristics of lesions of the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branches (SLB) and to describe their surgical management and outcome. Abaxial marginal tears/avulsions of the SLB were diagnosed in 32 horses at Newmarket Equine Hospital between 2007 and 2015. Of those, 29 had the diagnosis con rmed by surgical exploration and were therefore included in the study. All were Thoroughbreds in flat race training with time of injury varying from acute to several months prior to referral. At presentation, 75% (n =24) of horses were lame and the majority (75.8%, n =22) had forelimb lesions, with the lateral SLB being the most commonly affected (81.1%; n =26). In all cases, there was disruption of the palmar/plantar abaxial margin adjacent to the proximal sesamoid bone with a hypoechoic to anechoic defect and extrusion of echogenic material. At surgery, lesions had consistent locations and morphology of palmar/plantar defects in the epidesmon containing bundles of haemorrhagic ligament bres that had avulsed from the PSB. The affected SLB bres were removed by sharp dissection and debrided with a motorised surgical resector. Nineteen horses (66%) went on to race, with a range of 1 -27 race starts (mean 9; median 4). Four horses that went on to race did not win or place. Lesions of the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branches appear to show consistent features, suggestive of a single pathologic entity, which differs from other types of suspensory ligament branch injuries. Subchondral bone trauma This retrospective study by Giulia Lipreri and colleagues in the UK compared outcomes following conservative vs. surgical management of sports horses with subchondral bone trauma of the proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx (PP) diagnosed by low- eld magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medical records (2010 -2017) of horses admitted to two referral hospitals were reviewed. Twenty-one mature sports horses with evidence of high water signal within the proximal sagittal groove of the PP according to low- eld MRI of the fetlock, with no de nitive radiographic evidence of fracture were selected for this study. Historical, clinical, radiographic, and MRI ndings and treatment choice were recorded. Conservative management consisted of con nement to a stall followed by gradual reintroduction to exercise. Surgical management consisted of cortical screw xation across the proximal aspect of the PP. Long-term outcome was determined by telephone questionnaire or by reviewing clinical records. Outcome was compared between the two groups using Fisher 's exact test. Follow-up was available in 17 of the 21 horses, including eight horses treated conservatively and nine treated surgically. No difference in outcome was detected in this study; four of eight horses were sound after conservative management, and ve of nine horses were sound after surgery. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd58 10.1111/eve.13039Approximately half of the horses diagnosed with osseous trauma within the proximal aspect of the PP returned to athletic activity, regardless of conservative or surgical management. The authors concluded that the prognosis for return to athletic functions in horses with osseous trauma within the proximal aspect of the PP is guarded. Minimally invasive castration technique In this prospective study Albert Torrent Crosa and Marc Desjardins ,based in the USA and Canada, described the use of a modi ed open castration technique with a scrotal approach and primary closure. Elective castration was performed with a modi ed open technique on 38 horses (one pony, one miniature horse and 36 horses of other breeds) under general anaesthesia. The procedure included minimal dissection into the scrotal region for removal of testes, with cremaster muscles left intact and the parietal vaginal tunic closed in place. Primary closure of surgical wounds was performed. Horses were monitored for signs of complications, and signalment, surgery-related variables, results of ultrasonographic imaging, post-operative treatments and outcomes were recorded. Follow-up information was obtained from owners 6 months after surgery. Medical records were reviewed, and descriptive data were reported. Median anaesthesia and surgery times were 113.5 and 60 min, respectively. Duration of hospitalisation ranged from 1 to 3 days. No intraoperative complications were observed. Post-operative complications (moderate swelling in the scrotal region) developed in 2 of 38 (5%) patients. Mild scrotal swelling (n =5) and transient pyrexia (typically mild; n =9) also occurred; there were no signs of post-operative bleeding, infection, or colic. All horses gradually returned to exercise from 10 days after the procedure. Cosmetic results were considered excellent. This modi ed castration technique was considered simple to perform and advantageous because of the low complication rate, excellent cosmetic results, and prompt return to intended use after surgery. Use of mesenchymal stem cells for osteoarthritis This study by Laura Barrachina and colleagues in Spain aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of repeated administrations of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) primed factor (TNF)- aand interferon- cin an equine model of chemically induced osteoarthritis. Arthritis was induced in both radio-carpal (RC)-joints by amphotericin-B in 18 ponies, divided into three groups depending on the treatment injected: MSC-na \u20acve (n =7), MSC-primed (n =7) and control (n =4). The study consisted of two phases and used one RC-joint of each animal in each phase, with 4 months between phases, in order to assess two end-points. Clinical, synovial, radiological and ultrasonographic follow-up was performed. At 6 months, animals were subjected to euthanasia and both carpi were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gross anatomy, histopathology, histochemistry and gene expression.Clinical and synovial in flammatory signs reduced more quickly in MSC-treated groups and repeated allogeneic administration did not produce adverse reactions. The MSC- primed group showed slight and transient local in flammation after the second injection. Radiology and MRI did not show signi cant differences between treated and control groups, whereas ultrasonography suggested reduced synovial effusion in MSC-treated groups. Both MSC-treated groups showed enhanced cartilage gross appearance at 2 compared to 6 months (MSC-na \u20acve). Cartilage histopathology did not reveal differences but histochemistry suggested delayed progression of proteoglycan loss in MSC- treated groups. Synovium histopathology indicated decreased in flammation in MSC-primed and MSC-na \u20acve at 2 and 6 months, respectively. At 2 months, cartilage from the MSC-primed group signi cantly upregulated collagen type II (COL2A1) and transforming growth factor (TGF)- b1 and downregulated cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin b1. In synovium, both MSC- treatments decreased matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression at 2 months and MSC- primed also aand IL-1 b. bene cial effects, mostly observed at short-term. Despite no huge differences between MSC-treatments, the ndings suggested enhanced anti- inflammatory and regulatory potential of MSC-primed. While further research is needed to better understand these effects and clarify immunogenicity implications, these ndings contribute to the knowledge about MSC therapeutics and how they could be in fluenced.

Or failing to develop appropriate clinical skills? In the last 35 years, we have seen huge technological advances in equine veterinary medicine with the development of ultrasonography, scintigraphy, arthroscopy, computed and tomography (CT), gastroscopy, objective gait assessment using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and associated software. This has unquestionably led to enormous advances in our diagnostic capabilities, the recognition of new conditions and, in some instances, improvement in clinical skills. The art of palpation of the distal aspect of the limbs has the potential to become enhanced by comparison with ultrasonographic ndings, and interpretation of digital radiographs can be improved by comparison with ndings from MRI or CT, sometimes negating the need for more advanced imaging. However, with substantial nancial investment in equipment, there is a temptation to over use technology, and to take short cuts in basic clinical observation and investigation. For example, skeletal scintigraphy has been widely used in equine lameness and poor performance investigation. There is no doubt that in racehorse practice, with the high incidence of stress-related bone injury, scintigraphy is very valuable; however, in mature sports horses that is not necessarily the case. In fact, a recent study of 480 horses demonstrated that, when used as a screening tool, the sensitivity for nal diagnosis was low (35.7%), although speci city was high (98.9%) and the agreement was only moderate ( j=0.45) (Quiney et al. 2018). There was a high frequency of occurrence of false positive results for the sacroiliac joint region and the subchondral bone of the distal hock joints. It was concluded that scintigraphic examination is unlikely to lead to a full and correct diagnosis of the cause(s) of lameness or poor performance in sports horses when it is used as an isolated or indiscriminate screening tool. Too often I learn of horses which owners are convinced have a pain-related problem based on changes in performance or behaviour. The horse is examined by a veterinarian in-hand and on the lunge and they are not able to detect any underlying lameness. The horse undergoes a whole body scintigraphic examination. If the ndings are negative, the owner is informed that there is nothing wrong with the horse. If regions of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake are found, those areas are examined radiographically and often treated, unfortunately, frequently with no observable improvement for the owner. These outcomes lead to huge owner dissatisfaction and lack of faith in the skills of the veterinary profession. Complex lameness cases or poor performance, often associated with low-grade lameness in more than one limb, are much more effectively diagnosed by careful clinical appraisal, usually involving ridden exercise, combined with diagnostic analgesia. However, this means that the observer has to be trained to know what to look for, which cannot possibly be achieved in the already overcrowded undergraduate veterinary curriculum. These cases do not lend themselves to investigation in conjunction with IMUs withthe current technology. There is no doubt that objective gait assessment has the potential to hone our diagnostic skills and remove bias in interpretation of the responses to diagnostic analgesia, but it can only be used effectively in conjunction with careful clinical appraisal. Currently, it has limitations in the assessment of ridden horses, especially when the clinical problems are only evident under specialised circumstances, for example, flying changes. If over reliance is placed on the use of IMUs in simple lameness cases, then complex cases potentially become even more dif cult to evaluate, because there is a need to continue to use and develop our clinical observational skills. It is not unreasonable for horses that are performing poorly to undergo gastroscopy, but it is crucial that ndings are related to the clinical presentation. If a horse has become irritable when tacked up and reluctant to canter when ridden, it is highly unlikely that grade 1 or 2 squamous ulceration is the primary underlying cause of this behaviour. Diagnoses need to match the severity of the clinical presentation. While there is no doubt that gastric ulceration can cause poor performance (Franklin et al. 2008), we see many horses which have been treated successfully for grade 3 ulcers, with no subsequent alteration of ridden performance. The development of digital radiography has enormously improved image quality of the distal aspect of the limb and has enabled examination of regions that we were previously inaccessible in general equine practice. The caudal cervical region and the thoracolumbar region are typical examples. However, it is clear that knowledge of image interpretation is not keeping pace with these developments. Over-reliance on diagnostic imaging without relating ndings to the clinical presentation is potentially very dangerous. Take, for example, a horse which has clinical signs consistent with thoracolumbar region pain. There is the temptation to examine the area radiographically and the horse may be found to have impinging spinous processes of the 13th to 15th thoracic vertebrae. However, unless the saddle t for horse and rider is assessed and it is recognised that there is a major problem with saddle t, surgery may erroneously be recommended, when actually all that is needed is improved saddle t. It has become fashionable to recommend that a horse presenting with head-shaking behaviour undergoes CT examination of the head. We know that there is a high prevalence of ndings consistent with osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint (Anderson 2016); however, these are not necessarily of clinical signi cance, but there is a danger that they will be overinterpreted by the uninformed. It seems much more logical to assess the response to diagnostic analgesia of the infraorbital nerve and only if this is negative to proceed to advanced diagnostic imaging. Of 101 horses that presented with head-shaking behaviour and underwent CT, only four had abnormalities of the head considered likely to be the cause of head-shaking (Fairburn 2017). In veterinary medicine, there is both the art of diagnosis and the application of scienti c knowledge.

C. Trimble* , L. A. Beard and E. G. Davis Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center, Manhattan, Kansas, USA. Horse gelding was presented to the Kansas State Veterinary Health Center for acute onset of diffuse, nonpruritic, generalised and coalescing urticaria. A single dose of dexamethasone resulted in resolution of the urticaria within 24 h; however, 48 h after discharge, he presented with mild colic. The patient was febrile and thoracic ultrasound was abnormal, evidenced by bilateral pleural echogenic irregularities, mild pulmonary consolidation and slight unilateral pleural effusion. Thoracic radiographs also revealed caudoventral soft tissue opacity in the same region of the ultrasonographic abnormalities. Transtracheal wash was performed and broad spectrum antimicrobials initiated. Poor clinical response to therapy and marked peripheral eosinophilia resulted in the necessity for bronchoalveolar lavage, which revealed a predominance of pulmonary eosinophils. A diagnosis of acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia was made. Treatment included a tapering dose of dexamethasone over 4 weeks. Due to incomplete disease resolution, the patient was moved to an alternate environment which resulted in disease resolution. Introduction Eosinophilia (both peripheral and local) is a relatively rarecondition in horses when compared with small animals. Eosinophils are granulocytes produced by the bone marrow that express a variety of proteins which include major basic protein, eosinophilic cationic protein, neurotoxin and peroxidase. These proteins inactivate heparin, histamine release, contribute to epithelial destruction, enhance mucus secretion, activate mast cells and cause bronchospasm. Furthermore, eosinophils are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGD2) and leucotrienes (LTC4) (Tizard 2012). In mammals, accumulation of eosinophils in peripheral blood or tissue may be the result of either primary or secondary causes. Primary eosinophilia occurs due to an acquired abnormality of the myeloid lineage (eosinophilic leukaemia). Secondary eosinophilia is eosinophilopoietic cytokines by nonmyeloid cells. Dysregulated cytokine production is thought to be responsible for eosinophilia seen in the various eosinophilic disorders in man such as idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and both the acute and chronic forms of idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (Carrington et and 2005; Klion 2006). In reported eosinophilic disorders include enteritis (Bosseler et al. 2013; Archer et al. 2014; D /C19ez deCastro et al. 2016), various forms of pneumonitis (Berry et al. 1991; Marchand et al. 1998; Bell et al. 2008), synovitis and inltrative ocular disease (MacKay and Urquhart 1979) and in flammatory airway disease (IAD) (Hare and Viel 1998). While the currently reported case may initially appear to be consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic in flammatory airway disease, or other forms of eosinophilic pneumonitis, the clinical course of disease and response to therapy are more consistent with the diagnosis of acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia. The current report documents this unusual cause of pneumonitis and its management in a Quarter Horse gelding. Case history A 16-year-old, 526 kg Quarter Horse gelding was presented to the Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center (VHC) in early autumn for an acute onset (24 h) of diffuse, nonpruritic, generalised and coalescing urticaria. One week prior to presentation, the gelding was transported 6 h from western Kansas, where he was maintained primarily on pasture, to a boarding facility with dry lots. This was a routine that had been replicated the previous 2 years, so that he could be stabled near campus during the academic year (September through May). The gelding had no reported history of health problems prior to presentation aside from a cough early in exercise in dusty environments and decreased energy over the summer. All vaccines (AAEP core) had been administered within the last 6 months and ivermectin had been given 6 weeks previously. There was no reported contact with donkeys. The owner administered 500 mg of flunixin meglumine (Banamine)1intramuscularly (i.m.) 12 h prior to presentation which failed to resolve the urticaria and the gelding was presented to the VHC. The gelding had a body condition score of 5/9. The majority of the physical examination was unremarkable; however, profound, diffuse, nonpruritic urticaria from the cervical musculature to flanks was present and extended to all four limbs ( Fig 1 ). Wheals were approximately 1 -3c m flat and nonulcerative, indicative of a type 1 hypersensitivity response. A complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry and skin biopsy were declined by the owner at that time. The horse received dexamethasone \u00a92017 EVJ was not hospitalised and recommendations for home care included topical cleansing with a nonirritating shampoo, machine washing of all blankets and fly sheets and the use of fly spray. The owner reported the urticaria had resolved 24 h following presentation. The owner observed the gelding stretching out without urination and faecal output was decreased 36 h following discovery of urticaria,. Flunixin meglumine (unknown amount) was administered; however, signs did not resolve and the horse was again presented to the VHC. Physical examination revealed pyrexia (38.7 /C176C), normal heart rate and rhythm, an elevated respiratory rate (28 breaths/min) and increased bronchovesicular sounds bilaterally with and without a rebreathing examination. No tracheal rattle or cough were present at rest, or with tracheal compression. Nasogastric intubation, rectal palpation and abdominal ultrasound were normal. The gelding defaecated normally immediately following examination. Thoracic ultrasonographic examination demonstrated diffuse, bilateral, irregular echogenicities in the pleural echo and B lines (comet tails). The right caudoventral lung eld was more severely affected, with a small area of pulmonary consolidation (1 91 cm in diameter) and trace amount of pleural fluid (1 cm). Thoracic radiographs revealed a caudoventral soft tissue opacity in the same regions that abnormalities were identi ed on thoracic auscultation and ultrasonographic examination. A CBC and serum biochemistry were unremarkable except for a mild leucopenia (5.59109cells/L; rr 6 -129109cells/L) and mildly elevated GGT (27 u/L; rr 6 -24 u/L). A working diagnosis of pneumonia was made and a percutaneous transtracheal wash performed for aerobic and anaerobic culture, as the most common cause of thesecollective ndings is bacterial bronchopneumonia. Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated which included potassium penicillin G (22,000 o r management pyrexia and bacterial pneumonia. The gelding remained pyrexic (38.6 -39\u00b0C), anorexic and profoundly depressed over the next 48 h despite antimicrobial and flunixin therapy. A CBC revealed resolution of the leucopenia, yet a mild lymphopenia (1.4 9109cells/L; rr 1.5 -79109cells/L) was present. Further, a marked eosinophilia (2.3 9109cells/L; rr 0 -19109cells/L) was identi ed. Transtracheal wash culture results revealed scarce Staphylococcus aureus and a nonhaemolytic Staphylococcus sp. which was isolated from enrichment only, which were both considered to be probable contaminants by the bacteriology laboratory. Based on persistently abnormal clinical signs, negative culture results and a peripheral eosinophilia, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Results revealed a local eosinophilia 35% (rr <1%), 34% <2%), few Curschmann 's spirals indicating mucus plugging, without evidence of organisms (bacteria, fungi, or pulmonary parasites) or neoplastic cells. Diagnosis Problems included urticaria, pyrexia, lethargy, abnormal thoracic ultrasound and radiographs, increased bronchovesicular sounds, a lack of response to therapy and a marked peripheral and local eosinophilia (CBC and in BAL fluid (BALF)). Differential MEED, parasitic eosinophilic bronchitis and IAD/ equine asthma syndrome. Additional diagnostics included a faecal egg count, repeat abdominal ultrasound, abdominocentesis (no fluid obtained) and gastroscopy, as the primary complaint on the repeat presentation was abdominal pain. Qualitative faecal egg count yielded strongyle type egg 1 +, while no parasites were seen on quantitative. No abnormalities were identi ed on abdominal ultrasound or gastroscopy. Based on the history, clinical presentation and diagnostic ndings, a diagnosis of acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) was made. Treatment The gelding was discharged to the owner with treatments to include 14 days of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (20 mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d.)5for prevention of secondary infection and a tapering course of dexamethasone over 2 weeks, similar to the described treatment for MEED (McCue et al. 2003). Dosing began at 0.04 mg/kg bwt once daily, as the gelding responded favourably on the rst day of presentation to a relatively low dose. It was given i.v. initially in hospital, then i.m. by the owner. After 1 week of dexamethasone administered i.m. dexamethasone (2 mg/mL)2was administered at 0.02 mg/kg bwt orally once daily for 1 week, then every other day for four treatments. In addition, it was recommended that the gelding be dewormed with fenbendazole (10 mg/kg bwt per os s.i.d.)1for 5 days for possible parasitic pneumonia (e.g. due to larvae of Parascaris equorum or adults of Dictyocaulus arnfeldi ), although no evidence of parasites (ova or larvae of Fig 1: Diffuse, nonpruritic urticaria was present from the cervical musculature to the flanks and present on all four limbs. Wheals were approximately 1 -3 cm, flat and nonulcerative. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd63 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY D. arnfeldi) was detected on BAL cytology. Environmental recommendations included being fed hay on the ground, ideally soaked to eliminate dust exposure. Exercise was discouraged to avoid marked increases in pulmonary work, as there was concern that increased respiratory effort would contribute to turbulent air flow and dust exposure through higher speed activity, which could exacerbate pulmonary inflammation. One week after initiating corticosteroid therapy, a CBC con rmed that the peripheral eosinophilia had resolved (0.79109cells/L; rr 0 -19109cells/L) and a mild lymphopenia was present (0.8 9109cells/L; rr 1.5 -79109cells/L), presumably secondary to corticosteroid therapy. Neutrophil count has increased from the previous week, yet was still within normal limits (7.0 9103cells/L; rr 2.7 -7.59103cells/L). Fourteen days after initiating corticosteroid therapy, peripheral eosinophil concentration remained within normal reference ranges at 0.29109cells/L. Physical examination, including respiratory evaluation (rebreathing examination) and thoracic ultrasound were improved yet, mild, bilateral pleural echogenic irregularities and B lines remained on ultrasonographic examination. The owner reported the gelding was brighter and eating well, although the day after switching to oral dosing, the gelding developed urticaria (less diffuse) once again, indicating the tapering course may have been too rapid. Therapeutic recommendations at that time included a further tapering 2 week course of dexamethasone beginning at 0.02 mg/kg bwt once daily i.m. before a one month recheck. Outcome On examination 1 month after initial presentation, the patient was bright, alert and responsive. Physical and respiratory examinations were within normal limits. Thoracic ultrasound found further improvement from previous evaluation, with almost completely resolved pleural echogenic irregularities. However, a CBC revealed a marked peripheral eosinophilia (2.49109cells/L; rr 0 -19109cells/L). Similarly, a BAL revealed a marked eosinophilia (72%; rr 10% macrophages 20 -50%), 2% mast cells (rr <2%), with no evidence of organisms or neoplastic cells ( Fig 2 ). Additional therapeutic recommendations included anthelmintic treatment with moxidectin (Quest; 0.4 mg/kg bwt per os once)2for potential parasitic infestation and continued corticosteroid therapy. In addition to systemic dexamethasone, aerosolised corticosteroid such as beclomethasone or fluticasone was suggested, as well as environmental changes to include marked reduction of dust exposure. The owner declined further medical therapy and elected to transport the gelding back to western Kansas to resume pasture management in the original environment. A CBC was performed 2 weeks after the gelding was returned to the original farm and the peripheral eosinophilia had resolved (0.3 9109cells/L). Six months later, the gelding was reportedly doing well clinically and a CBC was within normal limits, including eosinophil concentration (0.1 9109cells/L). Follow-up At 8 months following initial presentation, the owner reported no coughing and the horse had been handling exercise well. The gelding had improved overall body condition (BCS 7/9) and had a good quality hair coat with no evidence ofurticaria. He was bright, alert and responsive. Physical and respiratory examinations were within normal limits. Thoracic ultrasound revealed complete resolution of pleuralirregularities and a CBC was normal with no eosinophils in and a moderate (subjective) increase in mast cells, but these were not included in the differential count at the discretion of the clinical pathologist. Discussion Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (IEP) is an uncommondisease of horses, which has both acute and chronic forms. There are similar acute and chronic disease processes in man that parallel both forms in the horse, yet scienti c literature describing the conditions is sparse in both species. Acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (abbreviated 'IAEP 'in the human literature) is rare and incompletely described in both species. In one case report by Dixon et al. (1992), a pony developed acute but mild respiratory disease a few days after receiving an in fluenza vaccine that progressed to severe respiratory distress. The pony was unresponsive to bronchodilators, management changes and antibiotics. The pony was febrile, had an eosinophilic rich a) b) Fig 2: Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at both 10 3a) and 40 3 magni cation; Black arrowheads indicate \u00a92017 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY exudate in the airways (no evidence of lungworm) and demonstrated a peripheral eosinophilia. The condition responded favourably to long-term dexamethasone therapy. Fewer than 200 cases of IAEP are reported in the human literature, but the disease tends to be acute and severe, potentially necessitating mechanical ventilation (Pope- Harman et al. 1996; Cottin and Cordier 2005). Current investigations are aimed at determining potential links of IAEP to smoking, minocycline administration and the potential causative agents behind the high prevalence of the condition in 9/11 responders and military personnel who have served in Iraq such as aluminum and magnesium silicates, asbestos, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate and carbon nanotubes (Roufosse et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2010). Interestingly, this gelding 's disease seemed to resolve once the environment was altered, demonstrated by the resolution of the clinical signs and eosinophilia. There could be a potential hypersensitivity to certain particulates in dust in certain areas. Although BALF eosinophils at the nal examination were 2% above the normal reference range, this was a signi cant improvement from 72%. It is hypothesised that if this horse were to be returned to an adverse environment, he would demonstrate similar clinical signs. Chronic idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (ICEP) in the horse is described in one study by Bell et al. (2008), consisting of seven horses of mixed breeds and ages. All horses had a history of chronic respiratory disease with a duration of at least 5 months. None of the horses improved with antibiotic treatment or management changes and all had peripheral and local eosinophila (BALF 4 -39.5%). Lung biopsies found eosinophilic in ltrates and pulmonary brosis. Four of seven horses improved with long-term corticosteroid therapy, yet thoracic radiographs remained abnormal (Bell et al. 2008). Quite similarly, in man, ICEP is slowly progressive in nature and characterised by pulmonary interstitial eosinophilic in ltrates and peripheral and alveolar eosinophilia, with limited extra-pulmonary involvement (Carrington et al. 1969). Relapse has been reported to occur in both IAEP and ICEP in people (Carrington et al. 1969; Pope-Harman Cordier 2005; Klion et al. 2006). Corticosteroid therapy is aimed at reducing cytokine expression, notably interleukin- 5 (IL-5). As part of the Th2 response, IL-5 is released in response to antigen presented by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages. Costimulation through IL-1 the normal disintegration (apoptosis) of eosinophils, is of great interest in this case. Il-5 promotes differentiation of the activated B cells into plasma cells, and enhances IL-4 induced IgE production. As IgE is released in response to an allergic or type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, it then binds to Fc eR1 receptors, causing mast cell degeneration, further enhancing eosinophilic recruitment. Furthermore, both Th2 cells and mast cells produce eotaxins which concurrently stimulate bone marrow eosinophilic response and IgE expression. Eosinophils may also be directly stimulated by allergens, upregulating CR3 response. Degranulation of eosinophils releases toxic mediators such as peroxidase and leukotrienes to kill parasites and bacteria, which also causes damage to respiratoryepithelium, as seen in IEP (Tizard 2012). Thus, in addition to corticosteroids, other therapies under investigation are aimedat targeting IgE and anti-IgE antibody (IgG1 antibodies that bind free and membrane bound IgE to halt the type 1 hypersensitivity reaction) (Roufosse et al. 2004). Although the current case had certain similarities to previously reported cases of eosinophilic IAD (Hare and Viel 1998), which is comparable to human and feline asthma, the authors do not believe the current report is consistent with eosinophilic IAD. The horse in the current report had peripheral and pulmonary eosinophilia which may have been interpreted by some clinicians as a diagnosis of IAD, yet, in contrast, this horse also had two episodes of urticaria, was febrile and depressed and seemed to respond more favourably than most IAD horses to anti-in flammatory therapy and environmental change. Horses with eosinophilic IAD typically display exercise intolerance and pulmonary eosinophilia, yet they rarely have peripheral eosinophilia. Eosinophilic IAD-affected patients do not develop urticaria, pyrexia, profound depression, anorexia, abnormal resting pulmonary auscultation or have abnormal thoracic ultrasound ndings. In a study by Riihim \u20acakiet al. (2008), it was reported that 3/12 asymptomatic Standardbreds demonstrated a transient, marked BALF eosinophilia, consistent with eosinophilic IAD. However, these 3 horses were excluded from the data, as they reportedly had subclinical respiratory disease, similar to our case. Interestingly, in that same study, there was a seasonality (summer) linked with a higher eosinophil count and this case occurred in the late summer. A previous report by Hare and Viel (1998) characterised eosinophilic IAD-affected horses and revealed that IAD- affected horses were presented for exercise intolerance of approximately 2 weeks 'duration, cough and prolonged respiratory recovery with or without mucopurulent nasal discharge following exercise. In contrast, the gelding described in the current report displayed both clinical and clinicopathological signs of IAEP, which responded favourably, but not completely, to systemically administered corticosteroid therapy. The case also displayed an intermittent peripheral eosinophilia that developed in the face of therapy, which is not consistent with IAD. Previous reports of IAEP describe that anti-in flammatory therapy may be required for up to 3 months in both human and equine patients to achieve disease resolution. Although the reported case received systemic dexamethasone for only 1 month before environmental change, there was evidence of improvement while on corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore, the owner reported that following environment change, the gelding has remained clinically stable supporting the diagnosis of IAEP. Ideally, a lung or bronchial biopsy would have been performed to provide a clearer diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia; however, the authors and owner felt the invasiveness and potential complications associated with the procedures outweighed the potential diagnostic con rmation. Based on the currently available information regarding human disease, IAEP is classi ed as a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, with a marked IL-5 expression and subsequent eosinophil proliferation, which is also consistent with urticaria. Cellular proliferation and cytokine expression lead to respiratory epithelial damage with clinical signs of associated pneumonia. There is evidence to demonstrate that bothchemical and environmental triggers may induce disease in horses and man. Furthermore, the current report \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd65 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY demonstrates an equine patient with marked and favourable response to environmental modi cation. Ideally, further exploration into the effect of environmental triggers may further elucidate the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity in affected individuals. Evaluation of suspect cases should include monitoring of BAL fluid to de nitively characterise disease resolution and response to treatment protocols.

Schmitz Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, College Station, Texas, USA. *Corresponding author email: mcoleman@cvm.tamu.edu Keywords: ndings of 12 cases of splenic abscessation in horses presented to Texas A&M University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1993 to 2015. The objective of this study was to describe the signalment, clinical and laboratory ndings, diagnostics, treatment and outcome of horses affected with splenic abscessation. Only horses in which a splenic abscess was by microbiological or cytological con rmation from a percutaneous, surgical, or necropsy sample were included in this study. No apparent breed or sex predilection was identi ed. The mean age of presentation was 9 years, with a range of 1 -21 years of age. The most common presenting clinical signs were nonspeci c signs including fever, anorexia and lethargy. A variety of bacterial organisms were identi ed and treatment with antimicrobial agents or surgical exploration was attempted in several of the cases. None of the cases survived to discharge from the hospital. Introduction Splenic abscessation in the horse is rare. Limited case reports inthe literature describe the condition following penetration of wire from the large intestines, blunt abdominal trauma resulting in splenic haematoma formation and gastric perforation associated with Gastrophilus et al. 1986; et al. 1987; Saulez et al. 2009). Several aetiological agents have been implicated including Streptococcus equi and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (Pratt et al. 2005; Pusterla et al. 2007). Clinical features are typically nonspeci ca n d include anorexia, lethargy and weight loss. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the spleen has been shown to be effective in diagnosing splenic lesions (Alsop et al. 2007); however, it is often challenging to differentiate between neoplasia and abscessation. Additionally, few differences have been noted in clinical and laboratory data in differentiating intra-abdominal abscessation from neoplasia (Zicker et al. 1990). The reported outcome of splenic abscessation in horses is variable; however, to the authors 'knowledge, there are only a few case reports or small series available in the literature and no larger studies looking exclusively at splenic abscesses. Thus, the objective of this study is to describe the signalment, clinical and laboratory ndings, diagnostics, treatment and outcome of horses affected with splenic abscessation. Materials and methods Case selection Clinical records at Texas A&M University College of VeterinaryMedicine and Biomedical Sciences, Veterinary MedicalTeaching Hospital from 1993 to 2015 were reviewed for horses diagnosed with splenic abscessation. Horses of any age that had a diagnosis of splenic abscessation by microbiological or cytological con rmation from a percutaneous, surgical, or necropsy sample were included in this study. Horses suspected of having a splenic abscess based on physical examination, clinicopathological testing, or diagnostic imaging, without microbiologic, cytological, or histopathological con rmation were excluded from the study. Twelve cases were retrieved. The following information was extracted from the records: signalment, physical examination and clinical signs, duration of clinical signs, clinicopathological ndings, microbiological and cytological ndings, included haematology, serum biochemistry analysis, abdominocentesis, rectal examination, ultrasound examination, exploratory ceilotomy and necropsy evaluation. Results Case signalment Twelve horses quali ed for inclusion in the study. Horses ranged in age from 1 to 21 years, with a mean of 9 years. Several breeds were represented including 9 Quarter Horses, one Paint, one Arabian and one Appaloosa. Of the 12 cases, there were 8 mares, 3 geldings and one stallion. Clinical ndings Clinical signs had been noted in the horses prior to referral to Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital for a mean of 13.1 days (range 1 -37 days). Historical and physical examination ndings included fever (11/12), anorexia (10/12), lethargy (10/ 12), weight loss (7/12), signs abdominal pain (5/12), diarrhoea (2/12) and recent abortion (2/12). Additionally, there was one case with each of the following clinical signs: haematuria, reluctance to walk, premature ventricular contractions, venous thrombosis and a draining wound over the distal limb. One case had nystagmus, an absent menace and recumbency upon presentation. Diagnosis Haematology was performed in 11 of the 12 horses. A leucocytosis characterised by a neutrophilia and hyper brinogenia was noted in all 11 cases. The mean total white blood cell count was 21.6 9 109/L (range 12.0 -43.09109/L) and the mean absolute neutrophil count 15.3 9109/L (range 10.6 -34.89109/L). Mean brinogen was 8.4 g/L with a range of 5.0 -10.0 g/L. Additionally, a hyperproteinaemia was noted in all cases with a mean of 91 g/L (range 81 -103 g/L). Total globulins was available in 8/11 cases, all of which were elevated. The mean globulin concentration was 59 \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd67 g/L). Serum amyloid A was not assessed in any of these patients. Serum biochemistry was available in all 12 cases with at least one abnormality noted in all cases. Lactate was available in 6/12 cases, with an increase noted in 4/6 cases (mean 11.1 mmol/L, range 3.6 -26.1 mmol/L). Gamma glutamyltransferase was elevated in 11/12 cases with of 171.5 l/L (range 56-426 l/L) and aspartate aminotransferase was elevated 3/ 12 cases with a mean of 701.3 l/L (range 418 -861 l/L). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were elevated in 5/12 cases. The mean BUN was 17.3 mmol/L (range 4.3 -31.4 mmol/L) and Minor electrolyte abnormalities were noted in 9/12 cases. Several additional diagnostics were performed including abdominocentesis, rectal examination and abdominal ultrasound examination. An abdominocentesis and peritoneal fluid analysis was performed in 8/12 cases. The mean total nucleated cell count was 144.9 9109/L (range 62.6 -260.09 109/L) and mean total protein was 56 g/L (range 45 -72 g/L). Intracellular bacteria were cytologically identi ed in 3/8 samples. E. coli was isolated from two of the samples and a coagulase negative Staphylococcus was identi ed in another sample. A rectal examination was performed in 8/12 cases with normal ndings in 6/8 and a mass identi ed rectally in 2/8 examinations. Transabdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed in all 12 cases. Abnormal ndings included identi cation of a splenic mass in 8/12 cases (example, Fig 1 ), increased free peritoneal fluid in 5/12 cases, abnormal hepatic architecture in 3/12 cases, distended small intestines in 2/12 cases and hydronephrosis of the right kidney in 1/12 cases. There were no abnormal ndings in 1/12 examinations. Aspiration, aerobic culture and anaerobic culture of the splenic abscess was performed in all 12 cases. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided aspiration was attempted in 5/12 cases and aspiration during necropsy examination was performed in 9/11 cases. In two cases, both a percutaneous aspiration and necropsy sample were submitted for evaluation. Cytological evaluation of all samples was consistent with septic suppurative inflammation. Only one horse had a pure bacterial growth in which a Streptococcus zooepidemicus was identi ed. Multiple organisms were identi ed in all other samples including E. coli (6), Two samples were cultured, but no organisms were identi ed. There were no parasitic or fungal agents identi ed. Treatment Treatment was attempted in 3/12 cases. One case was treated for 30 days on the farm with broad-spectrum antibiotics including procaine penicillin G (22,000 mg/kg 12 h), (6.6 q. 24 h) and metronidazole (10 mg/kg per os q. 12 h). The horse subsequently became acutely febrile and tachycardic and died during transport to the hospital. Two additional cases were treated for one week prior to euthanasia. One case received potassium penicillin(22,000 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h) and gentamicin (6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h) and the other case received 44 mg/kg of chloramphenicol orally every 8 h. Euthanasia was elected in both cases due to persistent clinical signs and failure to improve. Exploratory ceilotomy was performed in 4/12 cases. Due to severe abdominal adhesions in all four cases that were surgically evaluated, euthanasia was elected during surgery and compete necropsy examination performed. Outcome Of the 12 cases, there were no cases that survived to dischargefrom the hospital. Eleven of the 12 cases were subjected to euthanasia due to a poor prognosis and one case died during transport to the hospital. Necropsy examination was performed and the presence of a splenic abscess con rmed in all 12 cases. The aetiology of the splenic abscess was determined in four cases. In two cases, a metallic wire penetrated the gastrointestinal tract and migrated into the spleen. In one case, a puncture wound in the intercostal muscles into the abdominal cavity resulted in splenic abscessation. In the nal case, severe Strongylus vulgaris migration was the presumed cause of splenic abscessation. Signi cant gastrointestinal adhesions were noted in 10/12 cases with the stomach, small and large intestines and/ or caecum involved. Evidence of peritonitis was noted in 8/12 cases. Splenic vein thrombosis was noted in three cases. Signs ofhepatic disease were noted in several cases including lymphoplasmacytic portal hepatitis (1), periportal hepatic brosis (1), intrahepatic cholestasis (1), hepatic vein thrombosis (1) and a focal puncture of the liver with a wire (1). Additionally, signs of renal disease characterised by tubulointersitital nephritis in two cases and renal vein infarction in another case. Epicardial haemorrhage consistent with septicaemia was noted in two ndings included epiploic vein thrombosis and neutrophilic pneumonia. Discussion Functionally, the spleen is an effective lter of organisms and particulates. Consequently, the spleen is thought to be resistant to infection (Chiang et al. 2003), with uncommon reports of abscessation in man (Chang et al. 2006) and small animal medicine (Spangler and Culbertson 1992). Similarly, splenic abscesses are uncommon in equine medicine, with few existing reports in the literature. The present study reports Dorsal D1: 10.36 cm D2: 11.81 cm Left Abdomen Fig 1: Transabdominal ultrasound image of a splenic abscess in a 10-year-old Quarter Horse mare. Diagnosis was following percutaneous ultrasound-guided aspiration. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd68 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / 12 adult equine cases of con rmed splenic abscess collected over a 22 year period. Consistent with other studies of horses with abdominal abscesses (Rumbaugh et al. 1978; Pratt et al. 2005; Pusterla et al. 2007; Arnold and Chaf n 2012), clinical signs of splenic abscessation are nonspeci c. The most common clinical signs reported in the present study included fever, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, tachycardia, tachypnoea and signs of abdominal pain. Clinicopathological ndings were also nonspeci c including most commonly signs of systemic inflammation. Interestingly, changes in liver enzymes were noted in 11/12 cases; however, post-mortem evaluation revealed hepatic disease in only 5/12 cases. Lesions identi ed cholestasis, hepatic vein thrombosis and a focal puncture of the liver with a wire. The cause of the elevated liver enzymes in which hepatic disease was not identi ed at necropsy is unknown, although interesting. Elevation in hepatic enzymes in the absence of hepatic disease is not noted in other cases of splenic abscessation in the literature. Transabdominal ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic modality for splenic or abdominal abscesses. Characterisation of the size, extent and location of the lesion may guide further diagnostic or therapeutic intervention and response to therapy. The use of ultrasonography is often rewarding in detecting the presence of a splenic mass; however, distinguishing between abscessation and neoplasia may be challenging. Zicker et al. evaluated the clinical and laboratory data of 40 cases of abdominal masses in an effort to determine whether speci c features or the history, clinical signs, or diagnostic ndings would be useful in antemortem differentiation of intra-abdominal neoplasms from intra-abdominal abscesses in horses. A denitive diagnosis could not be determined based exclusively on ultrasonographic ndings of abdominal abscesses, including those masses present in the spleen (Zicker et al. 1990). In the present study, transabdominal ultrasound was performed in all cases, though failed to identify a splenic mass in four cases. There are several plausible explanations for failure to identify a splenic mass including location and size of the mass and technical skills and experience of the ultrasonographer. An increase in free peritoneal fluid (depth of fluid not reported) was noted in all four cases and hepatomegaly noted in one case. It is possible that a signi cant increase in peritoneal fluid limited the visibility of the spleen; however, contrast enhancement is expected with a fluid interface. Bacteriological ndings in the present study are consistent with the ndings of previous studies, with multiple organisms frequently identi ed. Ultrasound-guided aspirates of the lesion were obtained and diagnostic in all ve cases in which it was attempted (5/12 cases), supporting the utility of this technique. A single organism, Streptoc occus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, was identi ed in only one case which was obtained via ultrasound-guidance. Medical therapy was attempted in this case; however, euthanasia was elected due to failure to improve. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is a reported cause of splenic (or intraabdominal) abscesses in horses. While Corynebacterium spp. were identi ed in several cases, C. pseudotuberulosis was not speci cally identi ed. This disease has been reported in Texas (May eld and Martin 1979), but is considered uncommon. During the present study period, several cases of suspected C. pseudotuberulosis splenic abscessation presented to our hospital. Medical management yielded successful outcomes in these cases. However,con rmation of the causative organism was not available and thus these cases were excluded from the present study. Treatment options for abdominal abscesses include long- term antimicrobials (Aleman et al. 2003; Pusterla et al. 2007), or surgical excision, drainage, or lavage (Rigg et al. 1987; Skidell 1996; Mair and Sherlock 2011); however, descriptions of medical and surgical management of splenic abscesses are limited in the literature (Swan 1968; Spier et al. 1986; Dart et al. 1987; Zicker et al. 1990). Steel et al. (1998) reported a successful outcome in a 6-year-old Quarter Horse mare. A splenic mass was identi ed via transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound and cytological evaluation of an ultrasound-guided aspiration and biopsy were consistent with a septic suppurative in flammation including Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative lamentous bacteria. Bacterial culture of the samples, however, did not yield a causative organism. Treatment with procaine penicillin (22 mg/kg bwt 12 h) and gentamicin (6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h) for 10 days (Steel et al. 1998) yielded a successful outcome. In a study of 25 cases of abdominal abscesses, Rumbaugh et al. (1978) reported that long-term antimicrobial therapy resulted in clinical improvement in about 70% of horses. However, there were only two cases of splenic abscesses in this study and the outcome of these particular cases is unclear. In the present study, medical management was unsuccessfully attempted in three cases and surgical exploration was attempted in four cases. Intestinal and mesenteric adhesions to the abscess were reportedintraoperatively in all four of these cases, prompting the decision to euthanise. Treatment options for intra-abdominal adhesions are limited. There are several limitations to this study. The small case population of only 12 cases collected over a 22-year period was a signi cant limitation. Additionally, a stringent case inclusion criteria was both a strength and weakness of the study. Unlike other reports of abdominal or splenic abscess, in which inclusion was based on clinical suspicion and ultrasonographic ndings, the cases in this study required con rmatory culture, cytology, or histopathology of the splenic mass. These inclusion criteria likely selected against cases with a successful outcome in which extensive diagnostics were not performed. Unfortunately, the 100% mortality rate of the study likely overestimates the true prognosis. Furthermore, the decision to subject cases to euthanasia may have been based on variables such as nancial limitations and individual clinicians 'perception of prognosis. Thus, results regarding prognosis of these cases should be interpreted with extreme caution. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that clinical presentation and clinicalpathological ndings in horses with splenic abscessation is a useful imaging modality and percutaneous aspiration has diagnostic utility. While prognosis of the cases in the current study appears poor, this nding should be interpreted with caution. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Every year at the BEVA musculoskeletal ultrasonography course I am surprised by the lack of a systematic approach to limb palpation and how frequently clinically relevant palpable abnormalities are overlooked. I have to conclude that those crucial palpation skills are either not being taught adequately, or they are not being practised on a regular basis. In-depth clinical assessments may be time-consuming, but can be charged effectively. We must be honest with ourselves about what may or may not be learnt using other clinical techniques, and use advanced tools only when clinically indicated. We must also be self-critical of whether we have the requisite skills needed to acquire images which are of diagnostic quality and to interpret them correctly. Even if the answers are yes, the ndings still have to be appropriately related to the clinical presentation. By constant and repeated observations and thinking, we can re ne our ability to look and see -vital skills for any equine clinician. Look and you will nd it -what is unsought will go undetected.

Hardy Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, College Station, Texas, USA. mare presented for evaluation of severe, acute bilateral epistaxis of several hours 'duration. Endoscopic evaluation revealed active haemorrhage from the right guttural pouch and signi cant dorsal compression of the nasopharynx. Rapid and severe retropharyngeal swelling developed, prompting placement of a temporary tracheostomy. Guttural pouch mycosis was suspected and right internal carotid, external carotid and maxillary arteries was successfully performed. It was suspected that haemorrhage from the vasculature of the guttural pouch tracked caudally into the retropharyngeal region resulting in signi cant swelling, pharyngeal collapse and a severely compromised airway. Clinicians should be aware of this rare complication of guttural pouch epistaxis. Introduction Guttural pouch mycosis (GPM) in the horse. Fatal haemorrhage resulting from fungal erosions of the internal carotid artery, external carotid artery or maxillary artery within the guttural pouch have been described (Leveill /C19eet al. 2000). Horses with GPM-induced lesions typically present with moderate to severe epistaxis, with many horses having several episodes of more mild epistaxis prior to a life-threatening haemorrhage. Medical and surgical interventions have been described (Owen and McKelvey 1979; Caron et al. 1987; Greet 1987; Freeman Lane 1989; Matsuda et al. 1999; Leveill /C19eet al. 2000), but successful treatment of the epistaxis is dependent upon early recognition and prompt intervention. The most common complication isfatal haemorrhage; however, other serious complications may occur, particularly following surgical repair. These include the development of neurological disorders and blindness (Hardy et al. 1990) and infection of the atlanto- occipital joint (Dixon and Rowlands 1981). The objective of the case reported here is to describe a rare but clinically relevant complication of GPM-induced epistaxis of the horse. Case history An 11-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented to Texas A&MCollege of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital for evaluation of acute onset bilateral epistaxis starting several hours prior to presentation. Endoscopic evaluation by the referringveterinarian revealed haemorrhage of the right guttural pouch and prompt referral was elected. Historically, the mare had a brief, self-limiting episode of epistaxis from the right nostril approximately 5 weeks prior. Since that time, no additional abnormalities were noted. Clinical ndings On initial physical examination, the mare was bright and alert with a normal rectal temperature (37.7 \u00b0C), heart rate (48 beats/min) and respiratory rate (12 breaths/min). The mare had mild bilateral epistaxis, greater in the right nostril than the left nostril and a moderate amount of retropharyngeal swelling. Mucous membranes were pink and moist with a capillary re ll time of <2 s. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Packed cell volume was 37% and total protein was 64 g/L. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry analysis revealed a mild stress leukogram, but all other parameters were within normal limits. Endoscopy of the upper airway was performed without sedation. Blood was present on the floor of both ventral nasal meati. Signi cant dorsal pharyngeal compression was noted ( Fig 1 ) and a large blood clot was present at the opening of the right guttural pouch. Active haemorrhage within the right pouch limited visibility, but a diphtheritic membrane was identi ed on the internal carotid artery. The left guttural pouch was unremarkable. Immediately following endoscopic examination, the mare became extremely anxious and massive haemorrhage occurred from both nostrils. Brief repeat upper airway endoscopy revealed rapidly increasing collapse of the dorsal pharynx. Subsequently, the retropharyngeal swelling doubled in size ( Fig 2 ) and severe respiratory distress prompted placement of an emergency tracheostomy to establish an adequate airway. Due to severe haemorrhage, further diagnostics of the retropharyngeal swelling, such as ultrasonographic evaluation, were not performed and surgical intervention was promptly pursued. Treatment A 14 gauge intravenous catheter was placed in the left jugular vein. The mare was administered detomidine (0.01 mg/kg bwt i.v.) for sedation and intravenous fluid therapy with lactated Ringer 's solution. Immediate surgical intervention via transarterial coil embolisation was elected. Preoperatively, the mare tetanus toxoid vaccination (as the recent vaccination history was unknown). The mare was sedated with xylazine (1 mg/kg bwt), Intubation was performed through the tracheostomy site the mare was maintained on sevo florane (SevoFlo1) inhalant in oxygen with mechanical ventilation. The mare was placed in left lateral recumbency, with the head and neck extended. The proximal aspect of the right jugular groove was clipped, prepared, and draped in aseptic fashion. Transarterial coil embolisation of the right internal carotid, external carotid and maxillary arteries was performed as previously described (Leveill /C19eet al. 2000). Brie fly, a 15 cm incision was made at the junction of the proximal and middle third of the neck, dorsal to the jugular vein. The brachiocephalicus and omohyoideus muscles were bluntly separated to the carotidsheath. The carotid sheath was elevated and opened. The vagosympathetic trunk was carefully separated from the common carotid artery, and replaced in its normal position. The common carotid artery was maintained elevated using umbilical tape placed around the carotid rostrally and caudally. An angiographic needle was introduced into the carotid artery in a distoproximal direction. A 6 French introducer (Check Flo introducer2) was placed in the common carotid artery using a guidewire. A 6 French single end-hole nylon angiographic catheter (Tip de flecting angiography catheter2) was then advanced into the common carotid under fluoroscopic guidance, using iohexol as contrast agent. The catheter was advanced rostrally and into the internal carotid artery, to the level of the basisphenoid bone. The sigmoid flexure of the rostral internal carotid artery was identi ed and two 5 mm, Dacron bre- covered, stainless steel occluding spring embolisation coils2 were introduced into the catheter and inserted into the internal carotid using a 0.038 guide wire2. Complete occlusion was veri ed using fluoroscopy following injection of contrast agent ( Fig 3 ). The catheter was withdrawn to the site where the internal carotid enters the guttural pouch as identi ed by fluoroscopy. Embolisation of the proximal internal carotid was performed in the same manner. The catheter was then retracted into the common carotid artery and redirected into the maxillary artery, distal to the super cial temporal artery and proximal to the infraorbital, buccal and mandibular alveolar arteries. Two 8 mm coils were introducedinto the maxillary artery. Finally, the catheter was withdrawn into the external carotid artery on the cardiac side of the caudal auricular artery, and two 8 mm, four 10 mm and two 12 mm coils were used to occlude this artery in the same manner as previously described. Complete occlusion of all arteries was veri ed by injection of iohexol into the artery via the catheter and repeat fluoroscopy. The catheter and introducer were removed and the common carotid artery was closed using 4-0 silk suture with an inverted cruciate pattern. The brachiocephalicus and omohyoideus muscles were closed with 2-0 polyglactin 910 with a simple continuous pattern, and the skin was closed with staples. Recovery from general anaesthesia was unremarkable. Post-operatively, the mare was maintained on intravenous fluid therapy (lactate Ringer 's solution at rate of 2 L/h), procaine G, gentamicin, flunixin meglumine and omeprazole (Gastrogard mg/kg per os q. 12 h). A moderate left-sided facial nerve paralysis characterised by muzzle deviation to the right was noted. The cause of this is unknown, however, pressure on the nerve during general anaesthesia was suspected. The retropharyngeal swelling remained stable. On Day 2 of hospitalisation, the mare was bright and alert, with a moderate tachycardia (60 -70 beats/min). Packed cell volume was 35% and total protein was 50 g/L. By Day 3, the tachycardia had resolved, the swelling of the retropharyngeal region was signi cantly improved, and the facial nerve paralysis was nearly resolved. Repeat endoscopy of the upper respiratory tract and guttural pouches revealed a fungal plaque on the medial wall of the right guttural pouch ( Fig 4 ). The tracheostomy tube was removed and the mare was able to maintain adequate ventilation. The antibiotics were discontinued on Day 3 and treatment with flunixin meglumine was tapered. No additional abnormalities were noted and the mare was discharged from the hospital on Day 5.

The right guttural pouch had evidence of mild in flammation, but was otherwise unremarkable ( Fig 5 ). The retropharyngeal swelling and facial nerve paralysis had completely resolved. The mare had returned to work successfully as a dressage horse. Discussion Guttural pouch mycosis is caused by fungal invasion into the mucosal lining of the guttural pouch and can cause life- threatening haemorrhage to the horse (Cook 1968; Greet 1987). The most common source of haemorrhage is the internal carotid artery, however, haemorrhage of the external carotid artery and maxillary artery have been reported (Smith and Barber 1984; Greet 1987; Freeman et al. 1989). The case reported here is novelin that the haemorrhage from the vasculature of the guttural pouch was suspected to track caudally into the retrophargyneal region resulting in signi cant swelling in that area. As a result, severe respiratory distress warranting placement of an emergency tracheostomy occurred. To the authors 'knowledge, this complication of haemorrhage associated with GPM has not been reported previously. Further diagnostic investigations of the retropharyngeal swelling were not performed in this case due to the urgency of surgically controlling the active haemorrhage.While con rmation that the swelling was a direct result of haemorrhage would have strengthened our suspicion, other causes of retropharyngeal swelling were deemed unlikely. It is important to note that GPM is not the only cause of epistaxis originating from the guttural pouch. Other potential aetiologies may include bacterial infection, aneurysm, foreign body (Dias et al. 2016), fracture of the stylohyoid bone and rupture of the longus capitus muscle. Thus, the potential for retropharyngeal haemorrhage and swelling with life- threatening compromise to the airway should be considered in any case of guttural pouch haemorrhage. Rupture of the longus capitis muscle can present with similar clinical signs including bilateral epistaxis and retropharyngeal swelling (Sweeney et al. 1993). Typical endoscopic ndings in the case of a ruptured longus capitus muscle include collapse of the dorsal pharynx, haemorrhage with the arteries within and medial compression of the guttural pouch on the affected side. This was considered to be an unlikely cause in the case presented in this report based on post-operative endoscopic ndings of mycotic plaques. Haemorrhage into with rupture capitis ventralis muscle with concurrent guttural pouch mycosis was reported in one horse (Knight 1977). While radiographs were not performed in the present case, there was no endoscopic evidence of a ruptured rectus capitis ventralis muscle.

Fig 4: Endoscopy the right guttural day aftertransarterial showing a on the median extending to the caudal aspect of the guttural pouch. Fig 5: Endoscopy of right guttural pouch 90 days after 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY When active haemorrhage is present during endoscopy, preventing the localisation of the fungal plaques, the authors always perform embolisation of all vessels possibly affected. Furthermore, even if the fungal plaque appears to be only on the internal carotid, one author (J.H.), has seen cases where the caudal auricular artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, was seen coursing towards the lesion and was the documented cause of haemorrhage (as seen with fluoroscopy and injection of contrast agent). Therefore, this author (J.H.) recommends occlusion of all arteries unless the lesion on the internal artery is very discrete. The exact cause of retropharyngeal haemorrhage in this case was unknown. The case presented in this report was an unusual presentation of guttural pouch mycosis resulting in retropharyngeal haemorrhage. It is important for clinicians to recognise the risk of retropharyngeal haemorrhage secondary to GPM as a compromised airway may result. Clinicians should be aware that life-threatening airway compression secondary to retropharyngeal haemorrhage is a potential complication of guttural pouch epistaxis.

Guttural pouch mycosis remains an intriguing and mysterious disease in the horse (Lepage et al. 2004). The article by Coleman and Hardy in this issue (2019) reports a clinical case of retropharyngeal haemorrhage as a complication of guttural pouch mycosis. This observation should encourage clinicians to consider guttural pouch mycosis in arriving at a differential diagnosis. An endoscopic image, such as the lateral photograph shown in the present case report, may not be suf cient to prove that the observed haemorrhage and/or oedema are only limited to the retropharyngeal area. However, this is a convincing argument to decide whether to perform a tracheostomy. Importantly, this observation should be considered by any clinician who suspects guttural pouch mycosis. As a result, endoscopic examination should be performed in case of active, or very recent epistaxis. Radiographic and ultrasound examination may prove to be an effective approach to diagnose diseases of the guttural pouch and retropharyngeal areas. This should encourage clinicians to pursue research on guttural pouch mycosis in order to explore the mechanisms leading to mycotic infection and to fully characterise the pathological features and their consequences. Even this observation supports the fact that arterial circulation exclusion by intraluminal embolisation contributes to the mycotic lesions regression, there is in fact no demonstration of the pathogenic mechanisms of the involution of these lesions. Clinicians often use endoscopy to explore epistaxis. This examination may be challenging due to the coagulated blood present at the entry of the guttural pouch and there is a risk of inducing bleeding; nevertheless, many veterinarians perform endoscopy to explore mycotic lesions, or any other cause of haemorrhage. Endoscopy may induce some bleedings; to note that they may also occur during other procedures such as palpation of the guttural region or even spontaneously. In our equine clinic, we have successfully developed ultrasound examination of the guttural pouch area in normal horses (Sharman et al. 2012) and in some horses with several guttural pouch diseases, but not yet with mycosis ( Figs 1 and 2). In horses presenting with guttural pouch mycosis, the presence of blood could improve the acoustic window,enabling us to visualise vessel structures, as well as parietal lesions. We have been able to visualise the purulent material and hypertrophy of the retropharyngeal lymph node in horses with empyema. In the case reported by Coleman and Hardy (2019), ultrasound examination may have been useful todiagnose swelling of the guttural pouch area and follow the apparent fast evolution of the haematoma in a relatively closed area; a radiographic pouch a)07 b)MAMa M Fig 1: Ultrasound images of the guttural pouch from a normal horse. a) This image was acquired with a linear probe and b) was acquired with a microconvex probe.

In future, this ultrasound procedure might allow clinicians to assess the arterial abnormalities, observe the lesions induced by bleeding and analyse the presentation and localisation of mycotic plaques.What do we really know about the pathological mechanisms of guttural pouch mycosis? Its description remains as proposed by Cook et al. (1968) and Peterson et al. (1970). It is also interesting to compare this disease in horses to rhinosinusitis in dogs.

Since the seminal publication of Cook, bleeding has been associated with mycotic invasion of the internal carotid artery wall, or of other vessels ( Figs 6 -10). Experimental mycotic infection has recently been reported in horses (Greppi et al. 2017) ( Figs 11 and 12). In this study, one infected animal was subjected to euthanasia during the disease progression and macroscopically, mycotic lesions appeared as joined plaques with limited adhesion to the guttural pouch wall. Of note is that in naturally induced guttural pouch mycosis, mycotic invasion of the hyoid bone may occur in addition to the arterial walls ( Figs 5 and 13). Mycotic neurotoxins probably play a role in the in flammation of the cranial nerves Guttural pouchInternal carotid 2000 m Fig 8: Section of the guttural pouch region presented in Figure 7 associated with the internal carotid artery, showing erosion and brino-necrotic in flammation extending from the pouch to the adjacent tissues (H&E).

In the case reported here, inflammation induced by fungi may have been responsible for the rupture of the guttural pouch wall and/or of the vascular ruptures leading to the presence of blood in the retroguttural area between the different anatomical elements; post-endoscopy control using ultrasonography with saline infusion could have been useful to identify potential rupture of the pouch wall. Finally, the outcome of the clinical case in the present issue was good and endoscopic survey, 3 months after surgery, revealed only mild in flammation as well as a limited wall brosis, as previously reported by Greet (1987). To date, there is no clear explanation for the spontaneous involution and disappearance of the mycotic plaques. Even al. 2015) may have modi ed the temperature, humidity rate and level of tissue oxygenation which may have altered the fungi multiplication, there is no scienti c evidence supporting this hypothesis. Interestingly, using our experimental model of guttural pouchmycosis, we have reported that mycotic lesions disappeared in less than 30 days in absence of any treatment ( Figs 6 and 7). Nevertheless, we should bear in mind that vascular exclusion, mainly by transarterial coil embolisation, remains the best way to prevent massive haemorrhage due to erosive lesions into the guttural pouches (except for bleeding in the absence of arterial traumatic lesions).

Clinical examination revealed a right-sided facial paralysis with mild masticatory muscle atrophy, mild dysphagia and exposure keratitis. Apart from the FN de cits, neurological examination of the remaining cranial nerves showed no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination using a 3.0 Tesla scanner showed that in comparison to the left FN, the intracranial section of the right FN between the pons and internal acoustic canal was thinner, whereas it appeared indistinct and thickened within the internal acoustic canal and facial canal. Signs of meningitis or encephalitis were not present on MRI. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild pleocytosis. The owner of the lly requested euthanasia due to the guarded prognosis. At necropsy, the intracranial section of the right FN was macroscopically thinner than the left side and within the facial canal, a 5 mm tissue stump could be identi ed with an absent extracranial part of the right FN. Histological examination of the brain stem showed different architecture of the left and right motor nuclei of the FN: in the left nucleus, motor neurons of a normal size and well stainable Nissl bodies were present, whereas in the right nucleus, neurons with Nissl bodies were decreased in number and size. Further, a cytoplasmic rich cell population with a nucleus size compatible with normal neurons was present. These cells were suspected to be atrophic neurons. The tissue stump within the facial canal was histologically identi ed as connective tissue. Unilateral malformation of the FN has not previously been described in the horse. This lly showed a right-sided, intracranial hypoplasia accompanied by an extracranial aplasia of the FN causing complete, congenital facial nerve paralysis, which corresponded to a difference in the architecture of the affected motor nucleus of the FN. Introduction Facial nerve (FN) paralysis is classi ed as acquired or congenital; the latter is present at birth and can be caused by congenital trauma, or developmental disorders. Facial nerve paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral and complete or incomplete. Complete facial nerve paralysis is caused by damage to the facial nucleus, or to the FN proximal to where it emerges fromthe stylomastoid foramen. Incomplete facial nerve paralysis is caused by lesions that affect the individual branches of the facial nerve (Wissdorf et al. 2010; De Lahunta et al. 2015).Unilateral acquired paralysis of the facial nerve is not uncommon in the horse and is often associated with traumatic injury during general anaesthesia (Flaherty et al. 2005), or is the main clinical nding in horses with temporomandibular osteoarthropathy. Congenital FN paralysis in horses has not previously been reported. The present case report describes the clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and post- mortem macroscopical and histological ndings in a lly with complete, congenital unilateral facial nerve paralysis attributable to a malformation with hypoplasia and aplasia of the facial nerve. History A 17-month-old Warmblood lly was referred to the Equine Clinic, Vetsuisse Faculty of Zurich, Switzerland, for evaluation of facial asymmetry present since birth. There were no complications during pregnancy and birth of the lly was uneventful. The mare had been routinely vaccinated against influenza and tetanus. Clinical ndings The lly appeared mildly obtunded in the box, but was normal during clinical examination. She had a body condition score of 2/5 and a rough hair coat. There was drooping of the right ear, ptosis of the right eye, mild enlargement of both submandibular lymph nodes and green odourless discharge from the right nostril ( Fig 1 ). The right masseter muscle appeared mildly thinner than the left one. The lly had mild dysphagia evidenced by dif culties in propelling the food bolus caudally through the oral cavity and occasional quidding. Mild corneal oedema and peripheral corneal vascularisation were seen in the right eye. Beside the mild obtunded behaviour in her box, the lly showed no abnormalities of her mental status and posture. Neurological examination of the gait, neck, forelimbs, hindlimbs, as well as anus and tail revealed no abnormal ndings. No muscular weakness nor proprioceptive de cits were detected. A thorough neurological examination of the cranial nerves was performed and the results are summarised inTable 1 . Haematology was unremarkable. The temperament of the lly prevented endoscopic examination in the awake status, although the pharynx and larynx and their functionality should preferably be evaluatedin an unsedated patient. Therefore, the lly was doi: 10.1111/eve.12765examination of the upper airways. Feed particles were seen in the right ventral and middle nasal meatus, but not in the larynx or trachea and there was moderate follicular pharyngitis. Although the lly was sedated, swallowing re flex and laryngeal function appeared normal and no lesions were seen within the larynx. Subsequent oral examination revealed no abnormalities. Taken together, these ndings indicated right-sided, complete facial paralysis, with exposure keratitis and masticatory muscle atrophy on the right side. Diagnostic imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis A laterolateral radiograph of the head centred on the base of the skull showed no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging using a 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips Ingenia scanner)2 with a 32 channel receive-transmit coil (dS Torso anterior coil solution)2was carried out with the lly under general anaesthesia. Transverse FLAIR (TR 11000/TE 125 ms, FOV 400 mm, slice thickness, 4 mm, slice gap, 4.4 mm, NSA 1, FA 90), transverse and sagittal T2-weighted TSE (TR 17858 or 26466/TE 100 ms, FOV 400 mm, slice thickness 3 mm, slice gap 3.3 mm, NSA 2, FA 90) and transverse T2 *-weighted FFE CLEAR (TR 1219.2/TE 16.1 ms, FOV 400 mm, slice thickness 3 mm, slice gap 3.3 mm, NSA 2, FA 18) images were initially obtained. Pre- and post-contrast transverse T1w 3D (TFESENSE) sequences were then taken (TR 4.8 ms, FOV Fig 1: Right-sided facial nerve hypoplasia in a 17-month-old Warmblood lly.

In all MRI sequences, the intracranial section of the right FN between the pons and internal acoustic canal appeared thinner than the left FN ( Fig 2a ). Within the internal acousticcanal and facial canal, the right FN was irregularly delineated and appeared indistinct and and immediately medially to the parotid gland, the course of the right and left facial nerves could not be traced to their site of exit from the skull. After i.v. injection of contrast agent, the signal intensity of both facial nerves and their nuclei appeared normal and there was no enhancement. There were no abnormalities in the area of the internal genu of the FN and facial colliculus and the fourth ventricle appeared to be symmetrical ( Fig 2b ). The FN was best seen on T1-weighted images because of the smaller slice thickness. On 3D MRI images, thickness of the right masseter muscle was mildly decreased; however, signal intensity did not differ from the left masseter in all sequences. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from the atlanto- occipital cisterna after MRI appeared macroscopically transparent, but was slightly xanthochromic after centrifugation and had a mild lymphocytic 9.6/ lL, reference: (red cell count: 623.8/ lL, reference: 0 -558/ lL, Reed and Andrews 2010). Although the CSF showed mild in flammatory changes, no signs of in flammation were detected within the brain nor meninges on MRI. Based on the appearance of the right FN, a tentative diagnosis of a right-sided hypoplasia of the intracranial segment of the facial nerve was made. At the owner 's request, the lly was subjected to euthanasia. Post-mortem ndings The entire brain including the origins of the cranial nerves was exenterated and both facial nerves anatomically prepared. The ventral aspect of the right tympanic bulla was opened to evaluate the facial canal and its content. No abnormalities were detected on macroscopical examination of the brain and meninges. The intracranial segment of the right FN was thinner than that of the left FN. The right facial canal contained a 5 mm, blindly ending tissue stump and the whole extracranial part of the right FN was macroscopically absent. The right masseter muscle, especially the outer layers, was apparently thinner compared with the left one. At the level of the orbita, just below the zygomatic arch, thickness was 3 cm on the right side and 4 cm on the left side. There was no histological evidence of in flammation within the meninges nor the brain. At the level of the trapezoid bodies, the motor nuclei of the left and right FN were compared with each other (Fig 3a ). At low magni cation, an obvious decrease in number and size of motor neurons was visible within the right motor nucleus ( Fig 3b,c ). At a higher magni cation, the motor neurons of the left FN ( Fig 3d ) were of normal size with well stained Nissl bodies. In contrast, within the right motor nucleus, various cell populations were visible: (i) a lower number of motor neurons with educible Nissl bodies ( Fig cells with sparsely-stained, foamy cytoplasm and blurred cell borders without clear Nissl bodies (Fig 3e ). The size of the nuclei was compatible with a normal nucleus of a motor neuron and immunohistochemistry of these cells showed no glial brillary acid protein (GFAP). Therefore, these cells were suspected to be atrophic neurons, rather than glia cells.

These motor neurons appeared atrophic. Moreover, cells with abundant, faintly-stained and foamy cytoplasm (star *), but with a nucleus size compatible with motor neurons (black arrow), were only present in the right motor nucleus. These cells lacked distinct cell borders and distinct Nissl bodies (objective 20 3). According to additional immunohistochemistry, smaller motor neurons and cells with abundant cytoplasm were both suspected to be atrophic neurons. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd83 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY / Additional immunohistochemistry (anti-class III \u00df-tubulin antibodies) revealed positive staining of smaller and fewer neurons with less neuronal processes in the right motor nucleus of the FN compared with the left nucleus. Furthermore, anti-Iba-1 immunohistochemistry revealed a similar number of microglial cells in both nuclei. Within a circular region of 6.4 mm2, the total count of cells with Nissl bodies was 84, normally sized motor neurons with well stained Nissl bodies ( Fig 3b ) in the left facial nucleus, whereas on the right side, 60 much smaller neurons ( Fig 3c ) were detected. Within the right motor nucleus, the total number of cells with sparsely stained, foamy cytoplasm and no clear Nissl bodies was 74. The total number of neurons in the right facial nucleus was therefore decreased compared with the left side. However, if the cell population with foamy cytoplasm were included, the total cell count on the right side was higher (134 cells: 60 smaller neurons and 74 cells with foamy cytoplasm). Particular sections through the nuclei of the trigeminus, vagus, hypoglossus and vestibularis nerves were histologically normal on both sides. The glossopharyngeal nucleus was not histologically evaluated. The tissue stump within the facial canal was histologically identi ed as connective tissue without any nerve bres. There were also a small number of striated muscle bres thought to be part of the stapedius muscle, which originates close to the facial canal ( Fig 4 ). The pharyngeal region was not histologically evaluated. The right eye had histological evidence of mild, chronic, super cial stromal keratitis. The histological architecture of the investigated probes of the left and right masseter muscles, neither in longitudinal or transverse sections, did not differ. On both sides, myosin stainings (monoclonal anti-myosin (skeletal, slow) for type 1 anti-skeletal myosin (FAST) for type 2 myo bres) revealed only type 1 bres. Further, all myo bres showed a homogenous appearance and no difference in myo bre size and diameter was present, sincethere was a macroscopical decrease in thickness of the right masseter muscle compared with the left side. Discussion To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst report of complete, congenital unilateral facial nerve paralysis in a horse with a motor nucleus hypoplasia and an aplasia of the extracranial part of the right facial nerve. The facial nerve of horses is accompanied by the vestibulochochlear nerve as it courses to the internal acoustic canal and into the facial canal, which is located close to the middle ear ( Fig 5a ). Within the facial canal, the FN is deflected caudally in an almost vertical direction forming the external genu of the facial nerve, where the genicular ganglion is located. The greater petrosal nerve, the stapedius nerve and chorda tympany arise from the facial nerve within the facial canal ( Fig 5a ). The facial nerve emerges from the skull through the stylomastoid foramen and then passes rostrally as a motor nerve ( Fig 5b ). Complete facial nerve paralysis is caused by damage to the facial nerve before it emerges from the stylomastoid foramen. Horses with complete facial nerve paralysis have drooping of the ear on the affected side, ipsilateral ptosis and deviation of the upper and lower lips toward the unaffected side. In addition to these clinical signs, the lly in this case report showed keratitis on the right side. This may have been caused by a lesion of the preganglionic parasympathetic bres, which innervate the lacrimal resulting in tear production and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Schwarz et al. 2008; Koch and Witte 2014); a Schirmer 's test would have been helpful. Another explanation for the keratitis was the loss of upper eyelid movement, which is required for distribution of tears over the surface of the eye (exposure keratitis). Clinical signs in horses with incomplete facial nerve paralysis depend on the site of injury and the affected branch of the facial nerve. After passing through the stylomastoid foramen, the FN gives rise to the caudal auricular and internal auricular nerves, which mainly innervate the ear muscles. The auriculopalpebral branch of the facial nerve is located at the base of the ear. Further distally, the facial nerve divides into the buccal branches, which innervate all the muscles of the cheeks, lips and nostrils. Horses with lesions of the buccal branches of the facial nerve may have dif culty transporting the food bolus towards the pharynx because of paralysis of the buccinator muscle. In the present case, there was a mild atrophy of the right masseter muscle, which is innervated by the mandibular nerve. Since the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve within the brainstem was histologically unremarkable on both sides, nonuse atrophy was suspected. Neither histological evidence of myo bres with smaller diameters, nor signs of angular atrophy (single cells) or packages (small group atrophy or large group atrophy, respectively), which would be indicative for denervation atrophy, was present. Grossly apparent atrophy may be the result from mild overall reduction of myo bre diameter; however, histomorphometric analysis was not performed in this case. Although histological architecture of the right masseter muscle was unremarkable, clinical and MRI ndings as well as macroscopical necropsy showed a mild atrophy of the right masseter muscle. Therefore, the aetiology of this mild asymmetry of the right masseter muscle remains unclear. Fig 4: Histological section of the tissue stump within the right facial canal stained with Van Gieson 's stain showing connective tissue (black arrow) with broad collagenous bres (red), striated muscle bres (green-orange, arrowhead) and sparse adipose tissue, but no nervous tissue (objective 20 3). \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd84 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY At the level of its division into the buccal branches, the facial nerve receives sensory trigeminal nerve bres via the auriculotemporal nerve. There was no obvious damage to the trigeminal nerve at the level of the brainstem or at the level of the auriculotemporal nerve in the lly (Nickel et al. 2004; Salomon 2015). There are a number of possible reasons for the dysphagia seen in the lly; glossopharyngeal, vagal and hypoglossal nerve dysfunction have been shown to cause dysphagia in the horse (De Lahunta et al. 2015). However, the vagal and hypoglossal nuclei were histologically normal on both sides, though the glossopharyngeal nucleus was not evaluated. In contrast to congenital facial paralysis, which to our knowledge has not been reported in horses, acquired complete facial nerve paralysis in horses has been described with temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (Palus et al. 2012; Koch and Witte 2014), otitis media or interna (Rand et al. 2012), fractures of the temporal bone (Pownder et al. 2010), encephalitis (Barton et al. 2015), equine polyneuritis syndrome (Hahn 2006), diseases of the guttural pouch (Pollock 2007), developmental anomalies (Borel et al. 2014) and neoplasia of the brain stem (Manso-Diaz et al. 2015). In human medicine, congenital facial nerve paralysis is described as a hereditary developmental hypoplasia of the motor nucleus of the facial nerve within the brainstem and is usually bilateral (Verzijl et al. 2004). Congenital facial nerve paralysis may be part of several syndromes such as Goldenhar or Moebius syndrome, in which other anomalies are observed (Terzis and Noah 2002; Berker et al. 2004). The results of MRI in the lly showed no evidence of asymmetry of the region of the nucleus of the facial nerve or the internal genu of the facial nerve. In brainstem hypoplasia in man, MRI shows absence of the facial colliculus of the internal genu of the facial nerve and flattening of the floor of the fourth ventricle (Pedraza et al. 2000). The origin of the facial nerve at the brainstem was readily identi ed on MRI images, as described by Gonc /C223alves et al. 2015 and Arencibia et al. 2001; but identi cation of the facial nerve in the petrous part of the temporal bone was limited using MRI. Interpretation of the vague nerve changes in the internal acoustic canal and facial canal seen via MRI was not possible. It has been shown that high resolution sequences increase the detection of facial neuropathy (Smith et al. 2012). For MRI scanning of the facial nerve in man, high resolution T2-weighted gradient echo MRI, for Ba) b) c)A 1 C2 D Fig 5: a -c) Schematic drawings of a normal facial nerve in a horse and facial nerve hypoplasia in a 17-month-old Warmbloodlly. a) Caudolateral schematic view of the left temporal bone and neighbouring structures.

This allows multiplane image reconstruction and precise imaging of the facial nerve and its demarcation from adjacent nerves and the CSF at the level of the inner ear. The scanner software for these special MRI sequences was not available when the lly was examined. Nonetheless, the changes seen were consistent with connective tissue, which was con rmed histologically ( Fig 5c ). We did not carry out histological examination of the petrous part of the temporal bone at the level of the inner and outer ear or high resolution computed tomographic studies, which may have provided more detailed images of the relationship between the temporal bone and facial and vestibulocochlear nerves (Watanabe et al. 2000). The petrous part of the temporal bone is a relatively small structure and therefore investigation of the hypoplastic facial nerve in the lly described in this report was not straightforward. Slight cellular increase in the CSF indicates in ltration of immune cells in the central nervous system. Although more typical for in flammatory diseases, immunoreaction can also be caused by neurodegenerative diseases (Dheen et al. 2007). Histological changes in this case were not consistent with an in flammatory disease, since the number of microglial cells did not differ in both motor nuclei of the FN. However, residual previous infection cannot be completely ruled out. The macroscopic examination showed that the intracranial segment of the right facial nerve was thinner than the normal left side and the extracranial part of the right facial nerve was absent. A corresponding lesion in the right motor nucleus of the FN was present by a disorder in the architecture consisting in the occurrence of fewer and much smaller, rather atrophic motor neurons and many cytoplasmic rich, not clearly identi ed cells. The peripheral absence of the facial nerve after the stylomastoid foramen corresponded in an evidently altered architecture of its nucleus in the brainstem. Results of different stainings (GFAP and immunohistochemistry) lead to the suspicion that both cell populations (motor neurons with educible Nissl bodies and cells with foamy cytoplasm) may be atrophic neurons, since many of these cells were antitubulin positive. The GFAP expression, indicative for microglial cells, was similar in both motor nuclei of the FN. The cause for this neuronal atrophy is unknown and intrauterine pathologies are suspected. The total number of atrophic neurons in the right nucleus was not reduced compared with the left nucleus, but rather elevated. Whether this represents a true inherited higher number of atrophic neurons or an artefact by a slightly crooked sectional plane is unclear. To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst report of a complete, congenital facial nerve paralysis attributable to unilateral hypoplasia of the facial nerve in a horse. Identi cation of the underlying morphological abnormalities in vivo is dif cult because the anatomical structures involved are complex and delicate. Diagnosis of cranial nerve anomalies requires special sequences when using MRI and necessitates considerable effort even during a post-mortem examination.

The condition is typically acquired resulting from damage to the nervefollowing events such as trauma, prolonged pressure to the nerve, guttural pouch disease, (De Lahunta et al. 2015). Further, nerve function can become compromised by infectious disease, such as meningitis/ encephalitis (Toth et al. 2012), protozoal myeloencephalitis (Reed et al. 2016) and hypothyroidism (Schwarz et al. 2008). Although there are two reports of foals developing facial nerve dysfunction shortly after birth, Sch \u20aconet al. (2019) in this issue is the rst to document unilateral facial nerve paralysis in a foal as a developmental congenital anomaly in the veterinary literature. The postnatal nerve paralysis in the other two foals was associated with equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (Gray et al. 2001) and vascular hamartoma (Borel et al. 2014). Cranial nerves (CN) are 12 pairs of nerves that arise from the cerebrum (CN I and CN II) and brainstem (CN III -CN XII) and, individually or in groups, pass through foramina in the skull to reach their target areas of innervation in the face and neck. During development, the facial nerve is derived from the second branchial arch, or hyoid arch, which forms components of the stylohyoid apparatus and middle ear, and contributes to the innervation of the muscles of facial expression and the digastric muscle. The core of each branchial arch comprises neural crest cells that migrate along the arches, helping to form the characteristic muscular, cranial nerve and arterial component of each arch. In addition to innervation of the muscles of facial expression, the facial nerve provides sensory input from the rostral two- thirds of the tongue and oral cavity, and supplies preganglionic parasympathetic bres to several ganglia within the head and neck, including the lacrimal glands. The nucleus of the facial nerve contains the cell bodies for muscular efferent nerves and, in the horse, is located just caudal to the pons in the medulla (Sisson et al. 1975). Once the nerve exits the brainstem, it enters the internal acoustic meatus, an opening in the petrous part of the temporal bone, and within the temporal bone travels through the facial canal where it forms the geniculate ganglion. The geniculate ganglion contains the cell bodies for afferent nerves for taste sensation. The facial nerve exits the facial canal and the cranium via the stylomastoid foramen and passes ventrally, underneath the gland. It crosses the caudal border of the ramus of the mandible ventral to the transverse artery, about 4 cm ventral to the articulation of the jaw before it emerges from the parotid gland either before or after dividing into the dorsaland ventral buccal branches. It is here, where these branches course over the masseter muscle, that the nerves are least protected and most prone to traumatic damage. Several branches come off the facial nerve; ve do this intracranially, within the facial canal, and the rest do this extracranially, between the stylomastoid foramen and the border of the jaw (Sisson et al. 1975; Table 1 ). Loss of function after damage to the facial nerve varies with location, severity and chronicity of the lesion. Lesion location can generally be identi ed by identifying groups of muscles affected and tracing them back to speci c nerve endings. Clinical signs of facial nerve dysfunction are summarised in Table 2 . Unilateral complete facial paralysis is a result of injury to the left or right facial nucleus or the intracranial, proximal, portion of the nerve and, therefore, results in an inability to move ipsilateral eyelids, ears, lips and nostrils. Incomplete or milder injury to the facial nucleus or proximal nerve can lead to facial paresis, which is reduced movement of the muscles of facial expression, but incomplete facial nerve paralysis or paresis can also occur secondary to injury to the more distal portion of the facial nerve affecting one or more branches of the facial nerve. A lesion of the auriculopalpebral branch, near the zygomatic arch, results in paresis or paralysis of the eyelids and ear only. A lesion of the buccal branch, as it courses along the surface of the masseter muscles, results in paresis or paralysis of the lips and nostrils only. As expected, animals with bilateral lesions show complete loss of function on both sides of the face, resulting in a lip droop with drooling due to decreased prehensile abilities, in addition to bilateral ear droop and ptosis, and risk for bilateral keratitis. With complete facial nerve paralysis, parasympathetic function is often also impaired, and ipsilateral tear and saliva production is reduced or absent which contributes to corneal disease and dysphagia. Reduced or absent tear production, in conjunction with paresis or paralysis of the eyelids, can result in corneal exposure with resultant ulceration, which was also the case in the foal described by Sch \u20aconet al. (2019). Although the authors in that report did not perform aSchirmer 's tear test, the necropsy ndings suggested the nerve ended in a stump of connective tissue found within the facial canal at the level at which the greater petrosal nerve that carries parasympathetic bres to the lacrimal gland (Table 1 ) would have come off the facial nerve trunk. A Schirmer 's tear test is useful in neurolocalisation of the speci c area of damage to the facial nerve, and to determine whether treatment with arti cial tears could be bene cial to the animal. Reduced saliva production can be detected when simultaneously palpating the mucous membranes on both sides and comparing the degree of moisture. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd88 in further neurolocalisation of the lesion; given the proximity of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the facial nerve in certain locations, it is not uncommon to see clinical signs of facial and vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) nerve dysfunctions concurrently. If the animal has facial paralysis with a head tilt, nystagmus, or other evidence of vestibular de cits, but no hemiparesis, quadriparesis or conscious proprioceptive decits, then a lesion of the facial nerve exists as it exits the brainstem or passes through the petrous temporal bone. If there are clinical signs of damage to multiple cranial nerves and if the animal has ataxia, hemiparesis, quadriparesis or conscious proprioceptive de cits in addition to facial nerve paralysis, a brainstem lesion is likely. Congenital defects were found in six foals (0.013%) in an older survey that evaluated case records of 450 horses with signs of neurological disease; these were cases of microphthalmia, cerebral hypoplasia, cerebellar abiotrophy, hydranencephaly, arthrogryposis and bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia (Tyler et al. 1993). This report also identi ed 83 cases of cervical vertebral malformation, 26 cases of neonatal maladjustment syndrome, and six cases of perinatal central nervous system trauma. Other congenital anomalies of the nervous system that have been reported in foals include spina bi da, cerebellar hypoplasia and juvenile epilepsy (McAuliffe and Slovis 2008). It appears that the report by Sch \u20aconet al. (2019) is the second to document cranial nerve hypoplasia in the horse, but the rst to report a congenital developmental facial nerve anomaly. Congenital blindness and deafness has been reported in companion animals, e.g. congenital optic nerve hypoplasia in puppies (Martins and Brooks 2013) and congenital deafness associated with a white coat and blue eyes in some cats(Ryugo and Menotti-Raymond 2012). There are no reports, however, of congenital facial nerve anomalies in veterinary species. In humans, the term congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) is used to refer to nonprogressive, sporadic or familial, developmental anomalies of cranial nerves characterised by abnormal eye, eyelid and/or facial movements. Most of these conditions are characterised by abnormal movements including strabismus, globe retraction and limited abduction and/or adduction of the eyes. Abnormal eye movements or abnormal positioning of the eye was not reported in the foal seen by Sch \u20aconet al. (2019). In humans, two CCDDs, hereditary developmental facial paralysis and M \u20acobius syndrome, involve facial weakness resulting from abnormal development of the facial nerve and/or nucleus, sometimes with associated ocular motor abnormalities (Assaf 2011; Terzis and Anesti 2011; Singh et al. 2016). M \u20acobius syndrome represents a broad spectrum of clinical ndings ranging from isolated unilateral facial paralysis to bilateral absence of facial and abducens nerve (CN VI) function. Multiple other cranial nerves, (CN extraocular motor nerves, can be affected. M\u20acobius syndrome is a developmental disorder of the brainstem rather than an isolated cranial nerve developmental disorder, with hypoplasia of the brainstem identi ed in the regions of the nuclei of CN VI and VII (Assaf 2011; Kadakia et al. 2015). M \u20acobius syndrome is almost always a sporadic disorder commonly associated with craniofacial dysmorphism, lingual and/or pharyngeal dysfunction at birth and limb malformations. The speci caetiology of M \u20acobius syndrome is unknown, but is thought to include an embryological developmental defect in the rhombomere segments including the facial nerve nuclei, and anTABLE 1: Intracranial and extracranial branches of the facial nerve Intracranial Greater Arises from the geniculate ganglion; contains preganglionic parasympathetic bres the lacrimal glands the oral and nasal mucous membrane glands Lesser petrosal Consists of a small branch that emerges from the geniculate ganglion close to the chorda tympani and bres from the tympanic plexus; ends ganglion Stapedial Contains motor innervation to the stapedius muscle in the middle ear Chorda tympani Small nerve that pursues a recurrent course in a small canal in the mastoid part of the temporal bone to reach the tympanic cavity; passes over the guttural pouch, beneath the maxillary artery, and joins the lingual nerve; sends bres to the mandibular ganglia and contains sensory taste bres for the rostral two-thirds of the tongue and and sublingual salivary glands Caudal auricular Arises from the facial nerve at its emergence from the facial canal and supplies the auriculares caudalis and dorsalis and the skin of the convex side of the external ear Extracranial Internal auricular Branches off close to the caudal auricular nerve; ascends in parotid gland and supplies motor sensory innervation to the external ear Digastric branch Innervates the cauda belly of the digastricus muscle and its occipitomandibular part, the stylohyoideus and occipitohyoideus Auriculopalpebral Arises near the caudal border the mandible; branchesform auricular plexus; the zygomatic branch runs to the medial side of the eye and forms a plexus with the ophthalmic nerve; innervation of periocular muscles Cervical branch Small branch that anastomoses with cutaneous branches of the cervical nerves Small branches Branches are detached to the guttural pouch and the parotid gland Dorsal buccal on the dorsal aspect of the masseter, dips under the zygomaticus muscle to the muscles of the upper lip and nostril Ventral buccal branch Crosses the masseter muscle obliquely and AE / FEBRUARY interruption of the vascular supply resulting in ischaemic injury (Kadakia et al. 2015). Few cases are presumably caused by a genetic mutation as evidenced by familial inheritance. Other than the facial nerve paralysis, no other abnormalities were detected in the foal described by Sch \u20acon et al. (2019). In humans, congenital facial paralysis/palsy refers to conditions that are acquired during or at birth (e.g. from trauma), while developmental facial paralysis is the result of true dysontogenesis. Hereditary developmental facial paresis is the isolated dysfunction of the facial nerve. It is usually an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder, proposed to be the outcome of faulty development of the facial nucleus and/or cranial nerve (Singh et al. 2016). Three phenotypes have been identi ed to date: Hereditary congenital 1/HCFP1, which is characterised by bilaterally asymmetrical nonprogressive facial weakness, without associated musculoskeletal abnormalities and mode of inheritance isautosomal dominant. Hereditary congenital facial paresis 2/ HCFP2 is characterised by a unilateral or bilateral asymmetrical involvement. Facial weakness is nonprogressive and variable among muscles supplied by the three branches of the facial nerve, without musculoskeletal abnormalities. There can be accompanying hearing loss and rarely congenital deafness. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Hereditary congenital facial paresis 3/HCFP3 is characterised by bilateral facial weakness and bilateral hearing de cit. In addition, mild dysmorphism including midface hypoplasia, and smooth philtrum can be seen. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive, hence its rarity. In the foal described by Sch\u20aconet al. (2019), a normal response to noise was reported on the right and left sides although there are no details provided on how the testing was performed. It would have been interesting to compare a brainstem auditory evoked response between left and right sides in this foal to evaluateTABLE 2: Clinical examination ndings in horses with facial nerve paralysis and advanced topognostic tests used in human medicine for localising facial nerve lesions Neurologic examination (acute deneravation)Ipsilateral muscle paralysis and facial asymmetry: Ear droop Ptosis Muzzle deviation away from the lesion Affected nostril is unable to dilate on inspiration Lips on the paralysed side may hang loosely resulting in drooling, and when the animal eats or drinks, food and water may fall from the lips Palpebral ssure becomes slightly smaller (loss of tone in the frontalis muscles above the eyelid) Epiphora might be present if there is corneal irritation A bitter substance such as atropine will not be recognised when applied to the distal tongue Palpebral response: Eyelids do not close Eyeball retracts into orbit (with normal function of CN V and VI) third eyelid elevates as the globe retracts If both eyes are tested simultaneously, movement on each side can be compared Neurologic examination (chronic denervation)Ear carriage may be higher because of muscle brosis and contracture, which can be palpated Fibrosis of the lip muscles can be palpated, and the lip on the affected side is higher than on the normal side Muscle brosis and contracture cause the nose to deviate towards the lesion, and the muscles feel rm and in flexible Shirmer 's tear testReduced tear production when parasympathetic innervation to lacrimal glands is lost (greater petrosal nerve) reflex testInvoluntary contraction of the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles that occurs in response to high-intensity sound stimuli The stapedius muscle is innervated by the stapedial nerve, a branch off the facial nerve,so measurement of the re flex can be used to locate the injury along the nerve: if the injury is distal to the stapedius muscle, the re flex is still functional Taste test Evaluation of the chorda tympani nerve which branches off the facial nerve trunk just prior to the nerve exiting the skull through the stylomastoid foramen Application of bitter substances on the different locations of the tongue Salivary flow test Measures secretion rates of the submandibular salivary do Characteristics for denervation such as spontaneous depolarisations with positive sharp waves and brillation potentials occur 10 -20 days after denervation Nerve excitability testing The nerve is stimulated and the current needed to elicit a response (muscle twitching) is measured Response to minimum and maximum stimuli are evaluated Evoked motor potentials EMG is recorded following stimulation of the nerve Amplitude of the maximum response is compared between the affected and normal facial nerve Evaluation of adjacentcranial 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY the hearing system and cranial nerve VIII, that lie in such proximity to the facial nerve, further. Currently, there are a multitude of ancillary diagnostics available to aid in lesion localisation when presented with a horse with cranial nerve de cit(s) ( Table 2 ). The rst step is to do a thorough physical examination followed by a thorough neurologic examination to determine extent of de cits and nerves involved. The current case highlights the need to involve a clinician with expertise in the eld of neurology upon initial examination. Given the nerve involved, an ophthalmological assessment including a Shirmer 's tear test could have provided the information needed to document the loss of function of the parasympathetic input to the lacrimal ducts. Given the possibility of other cranial nerve decits and/or brainstem disease a more detailed evaluation of ocular movements (vestibulo-ocular re flex, or Doll 's eye) and hearing would have been clinically bene cial. In humans, available topographic tests for facial nerve function are the Shirmer 's tear test, stapedius re flex, taste examination and salivary flow test (Slattery III and Azzizadeh 2014; Table 2 ). The next line of diagnostics when faced with a horse with facial nerve paralysis would likely include upper airway endoscopy to speci cally look for diseases affecting mycosis, empyema, or temporohyoid osteoarthropathy and skull radiographs to identify possible fractures. In humans, numerous electrodiagnostic tests are available to evaluate the nerve, including electromyography ( Table 2 ). Also, since not only the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) but also the middle ear bony structures are nearby the facial nerve, and because those are frequently affected in congenital developmental facial paralysis, assessment of hearing is considered important, including evaluation of brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Although there was no report of hearing loss or MRI abnormalities along the facial canal in the foal described by Sch \u20acon et al. (2019), complete (histo)pathological evaluation of the petrous portion of the temporal bone or nuclei of the vestibulocochlear nerve was not provided. This may have provided more insight into the relationship between the temporal bone and facial canal and facial and vestibulocochlear nerves. More advanced imaging techniques are becoming available, however remain costly and typically require general anaesthesia. MRI presents the best option for consistently imaging the facial nerve as it emerges from the medulla oblongata through the facial canal before entering the internal acoustic meatus in horses (Gonc /C223alves et al. 2015). On the other hand, computed tomography (CT) allows partial observation of the nerve, but excellent visualisation of the canals and foramina through which the nerve courses to extracranial regions of innervation. The foal in the report by Sch\u20acon et al. (2019) underwent an MRI under general anaesthesia, however, interpretation of results proved dif cult. Authors discuss advanced techniques and software that is used in humans to improve resolution and image reconstruction for precise imaging of the nerve and its demarcations. Continued advancements in imaging willallow for improvements in ante mortem diagnostic methods and development of therapeutic interventions. Treatment of horses with facial nerve disease is typically focused around halting ongoing disease and regeneration and support of neurons that are spared. This includes treatment of any underlying conditions (e.g. ceratohyoidectomy fortemporohyoid osteoarthropathy and treatment of guttural pouch mycosis) and use of anti-in flammatory drugs. There are anecdotal reports of positive outcomes following acupuncture in horses with facial nerve paralysis, however, as far as the author is aware, none have been described in the literature. In rats, positive outcomes on facial nerve functional recovery have been reported following electrical stimulation of the nerve postaxotomy (Lal et al. 2008), after the use of laser therapy (Anders et al. 1993), and after systemic administration of diphenylpiperazines (Tong and Rich 1997). Many of these treatments and more are still in their experimental phases and should be approached with caution when applied to horses. The goals for treatment of human patients with development facial nerve paralysis are to restore facial symmetry and synchronous coordinated animation of the facial musculature, to enable the patient to express emotion, protection of the eye and restoration of blink, and to provide oral continence. This involves many complex surgeries such as a Cross Facial Nerve Grafts procedure for direct neurotisation and continued adjustments of musculature and vasculature. Further, aggressive physiotherapy is needed with the goal of motor re- education (Terzis and Anesti 2011). In conclusion, this report documents the rst case of a congenital facial nerve anomaly in a foal. With the advancements in clinical examination and imaging modalities available to veterinarians, we suspect more of these cases will be detected in future. Extrapolating from human medicine, with more sophisticated imaging technologies and discoveryof genes directing brainstem formation, characterisation of a more coherent clinical picture of the developmental disorders of cranial nerves in horses will be possible. This report will contribute to increased awareness and recognition of similar disorders in the veterinary eld. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

THO may result in neurological de cits but a thorough neurological examination was unremarkable in this case. THO is a progressive disease of uncertain aetiology that can result in pain during normal movement of the tongue and larynx during mastication and deglutition. In the absence of other clinical signs or pathology, it was proposed that the shear mouth was secondary to THO in this case. The THO was surgically treated by undertaking a left-sided ceratohyoidectomy (CHO) ( Fig 2 ). The shear mouth malocclusion resolved with minimal odontoplasty over the course of 18 months. The inference from these observations is that the shear mouth was secondary to THO and surgical treatment for THO was directly responsible for the resolution of the shear mouth.

There are several proposed causes but this is the rst time that the condition has been directly attributed to the presence of THO. This malocclusion should be added to the long list ofclinical signs attributable to THO.Clinical Commentary The danger of isolating dentistry from veterinary medicine J. Easley Equine Veterinary Practice, LLC, Shelbyville, Kentucky, USA Corresponding author email: easleydvm@aol.com Keywords: horse; dentistry Equestrians appreciate a horse with a 'good mouth '. The understanding of what constitutes a 'good mouth 'has never been clearly understood by horsemen or veterinarians. In the last 20 years, we as veterinarians have come to a better understanding of equine mastication biomechanics, dental and oral anatomy and physiology, dental disease and its relationship with the overall health and wellbeing of the horse (Dixon 2017). In recent years, veterinary scientists have explored and expanded our understanding of chewing patterns and the mechanical forces placed on teeth during mastication (Simhofer et al. 2010). Dental wear is affected by four main factors: (1) time spent chewing, (2) pattern of mastication, (3) abrasive nature of the material eaten and (4) the hardness of the dental tissues. Today, we have a better understanding of hypsodont tooth formation, composition and changes of enamel, dentine and cementum in the tooth as it matures with age and occlusal wear. However, the effects of malocclusions on dental occlusal wear are not fully understood. The article on shear mouth that accompanies this commentary and one published in 2016, demonstrates another factor that affects mastication and dental occlusal wear -pain (Moore 2016; Grant and Barnett 2019). This is an area of equine veterinary medicine that is very difcult to evaluate objectively. How do you identify and quantitate oral/dental/masticatory pain in the horse? This has been a major factor in allowing unscienti c and 'quack ' remedies to be promoted in the equine dental area. Researchers have tried with some good results to use facial expressions for a 'pain score 'on affected horses (Gleerup et al. 2014). There is still a great deal yet to be learned about equine pain and its relationship with mastication and dental disease. Our lack of knowledge in this area has slowed the progression of evidence-based dentistry and kept much of equine dental practice veiled in superstition. With more scienti c understanding of dental disease -not just periodontal disease and endodontic disease but newly described forms of disease -evidence-based studies now provide more details. EOTRH rst described in 2007 affects older horses and peripheral caries has been found to be associated with diet and oral acidity. Both these conditions are associated with oral and dental pain (Staszyk et al. 2008; Borkent et al. 2016). It is critical to properly diagnose a problem before embarking on treatment. In the past, it was assumed thatmost equine dental problems could be treated with a rasp or molar cutter. With modern research, we recognise the rasp is still a useful tool but its use cannot 'x'most forms of dental disease. In fact, I would contend floating teeth is not a treatment of dental disease in and of itself.Equine dentistry is an integral part of equine veterinary practice. The way we, as a profession, approach a dental case has changed from concentrating only on sharp enamel points and occlusal wear abnormalities to looking closely at the entire masticatory system. This includes the osseous and dental hard structures as well as the surrounding support structures. These are the oral soft tissues, the tongue, hyoid apparatus, salivary glands and ducts, the temporomandibular joints, muscles of mastication, nerves and blood vessels that support them, lymphatic vessels and nodes, upper airway and paranasal sinuses. Examination of most of these structures can be carried out under eld conditions but sedation and diagnostic equipment is needed. A good physical examination followed by an oralexamination under sedation employing digital palpation and visual examination with a mouth speculum, good light source and dental mirror can delineate problem areas in the mouth. However, to diagnose many conditions a more detailed work-up becomes necessary. Oral endoscopy and upper respiratory endoscopy are often required to visualise many dental conditions, sinus drainage and guttural pouch abnormalities. Radiographs are often essential to evaluate bony abnormalities, dental structures below the gingival margins and the paranasal sinuses. Since skull radiographs superimpose right and left dental structures, it is always recommended to attempt open mouth radiographic views. Conditions involving the TMJs and hyoid bones can also be evaluated with radiographs. Abnormal soft tissue lesions or masses should be biopsied and evaluated with histopathology. Advanced imaging techniques often shed light on conditions that conventional radiographs cannot detect. Nuclear scintigraphy may identify areas of active bone turnover and in flammation. This technology has been found to be very sensitive but not very speci c for the detection of dental disease. Ultrasound has been useful in revealing soft tissue swellings in the facial and jaw areas, facial and jaw fractures, and draining tracts. MRI is helpful in diagnosing and categorising a number of soft tissue lesions in the skull but is not the best for evaluating dental structures. CT is effective in diagnosing and characterising many forms of dental and sinonasal disease in the horse. The case of shear mouth secondary to temporohyoid osteoarthropathy that accompanies this commentary demon- strates the recommended progression of examination techniques needed to come to a diagnosis in many horses with dental related disease. This case was properly examined, worked up and the probable cause of the pain diagnosed. With correction of the root cause of pain, the abnormal dental wear pattern (shear mouth) returned to normal over time. It would have been easy to have floated the teeth level over a period of time and attributed the shear mouth to TMJ \u00a92018 doi: 10.1111/eve.12946disease or some other reason the jaw did not move properly, but this would not have corrected the dental wear problem or relieved the horse 's chronic pain. In short, pain relief and addressing correction of shear mouth with simply floating should be viewed as the 'tip of the iceberg '!Working up a dental case with such measures, will leave the patient, owner, trainer and caretakers as well as the veterinarian with little satisfaction.

M. Dixon* Division of Veterinary Clinical Studies, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Midlothian, Summary Peripheral caries (PC) is an increasingly recognised equine dental disorder with unknown predisposing factors that differs from the well described maxillary cheek teeth infundibular caries. Advanced PC can lead to premature wear and fracture of cheek teeth and thus is of welfare importance. Recent studies have shown large variation in the prevalence of PC in different European countries, with a trend towards a greatly increasing prevalence. One hundred and one equine heads sourced from a Scottish rendering plant were examined for the presence and grade of PC using the modi ed Honma equine dental caries grading system. The presence of cheek teeth calculus, diastemata and fractures was also recorded. Peripheral caries was present in 91% of horses; only affected the cheek teeth and was predominantly (72.6%) Grade 1 Class 1 (localised pitting lesions only affecting cementum). The caudal three cheek teeth were more commonly affected (74.7% prevalence) as compared to the rostral three cheek teeth (32.1% prevalence). The palatal aspect of maxillary and the buccal aspect of mandibular cheek teeth were signi cantly (245% and 170%, respectively) more commonly affected by PC than the opposite sides. Female horses were more commonly affected than males. Because post-mortem examination allows the most detailed oral examination to be performed, this may partly explain the higher PC prevalence found in the current, as compared to previous studies, in addition to the particular population examined in this study. Introduction An imbalance of the complex bacterial bio lm that overlies normal teeth, probably in fluenced by environmental factors, can lead to these micro-organisms creating an acidic oral environment by fermentation of dietary carbohydrates (Borkent and Dixon 2017). This acidic environment on the tooth surface, beneath the abnormal dental bio lm (that could now be termed dental plaque ) can result in dental caries, which is dened as the decalci cation of calci ed dental tissues by microbial acids, with resultant microbial destruction of the organic matrix (Soames and Southam 2005). Unlike brachydont dentition such as human teeth, the clinical crowns of (hypsodont) equine teeth are covered by a layer of peripheral cementum, a relatively soft calci ed dental tissue that becomes decalci ed at a less acidic pH (i.e. pH 6.7) than does the enamel (pH 5.5) covering the clinical crown of brachydont teeth. Consequently, peripheral cementum is the rst calci ed dental tissue to be affected by PC in equids. The rough dentalsurface created by PC damage may then allow plaque and food material to adhere more readily to it, thus promoting further PC (Gere and Dixon 2010). Damage or loss of the mechanically flexible cementum caused by PC can lead to decreased support for the underlying, hard but brittle enamel, thus predisposing to dental fractures (Dacre 2005), as well as directly exposing enamel to the caries-inducing environment, possibly allowing caries of enamel, and later of the underlying dentine, or even pulpar infection and tooth death to occur. Recent studies (Gere and Dixon 2010; Ramzan and Palmer 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2013; Borkent et al. 2016) have shown PC to most commonly affect the caudal three cheek teeth (CT; Triadan 09s, 10s and 11s) indicating that a more cariogenic environment is present in the caudal aspect of the oral cavities of affected horses. The aims of this post-mortem study were to determine the prevalence, intraoral distribution and severity of PC in a population of horses from southern Scotland and also to examine for possible relationships between the presence of PC with age, sex, head size and the presence of concurrent CT diastemata and fractures. Materials and methods The study was performed between March 2014 and December 2015 at The University of Edinburgh Veterinary School. Frozen heads from horses with unknown histories that had died or were subjected to euthanasia because of serious disorders, were collected from a southern Scottish rendering plant. Based on incisor appearance, the horse heads were placed into ve age groups (0 -5, 6 -10, 11 -15, 16 -20 and >20 years), and were grouped into horse or pony types based on head size. Sex was determined by the presence or absence of full-sized canine teeth. The sex of heads aged <6 years, without canine teeth could not be determined. The heads were thawed out and then disarticulated at the temporomandibular joints to allow direct visualisation of all teeth. The oral cavities were hosed with water to remove loose food and each tooth was then visually examined and photographed on both sides of the crowns to allow a subsequent review of ndings by a second observer. The presence and severity of PC (using the above-noted Honma classi cation system as modi ed by Dacre 2005, Table 1 and Fig 1 ) on the buccal and lingual/palatal aspects of each cheek tooth and on the lingual/palatal and labial aspects of each canine and incisor tooth were recorded. The presence of PC, dental fractures, calculus and diastemata were also recorded. \u00a92017 EVJ 10.1111/eve.12783Data were recorded and analysed using Microsoft Excel 2008 for Mac, Version 12.3.6.

Severity Of the 1777 buccal or lingual/palatal aspects of 1252 teeth affected by PC (mean of 1.41 sides of each PC affected tooth were carious), 72.6% (1290) were Grade 1 Class 1; 19.4% (344) were Grade 1 Class 2; 6.7% (119) were Grade 2; 0.9% (16) were Grade 3, and 0.5% (8) were Grade 4.

Every horse in the 11-15 and 16 -20 age groups and 89.7% of the >20 age group had PC ( Fig 6 ). The prevalence of PC differed signi cantly between the age groups (Fisher 's exact test, P =0.01).

A high prevalence (69.4%) of PC was also recorded by Ramzan and Palmer (2011) in a UK clinical study using oral endoscopy in sedated horses. Borkent et al.

Although post-mortem examination allows the most detailed dental examination, this factor could not fully explain the very high PC prevalence (91%) found in this study, because PC lesions, especially on the palatal aspect of maxillary CT, even of the caudal three CT, would readily be detected during a competent oral examination using a dental mirror or endoscope. The equine heads used in the current study were obtained from a rendering plant, that collected horses that had died or were subjected to euthanasia on humane grounds for various disorders and so this particular population also likely influenced the high prevalence of recorded PC. Gere and Dixon (2010) found a 6.1% PC prevalence in horses in a Swedish post-mortem study, which greatly differs from the current nding. Such interpopulation differences in PC prevalence are possibly due to different feeding and management between these Swedish and UK equine populations. Using similar clinical examination techniques to Borkent et al. (2016), Rodrigues et al. (2013) found a PCprevalence of just 5.5% in Portuguese and Spanish donkeys that lived permanently at pasture. Previously, Lundstrom and Pettersson (1988, 1990) found just a 0.9% PC prevalence in a Swedish post-mortem survey, which is hard to reconcile with the current ndings. The higher prevalence of PC (10.2%) found in Swedish trotting horses compared to nonracehorses (1.3%) in the Gere and Dixon (2010) post-mortem study was hypothesised to be due to the feeding of haylage and high levels of concentrates to the former group which promoted an acidic oral environment and the development of caries. However, a recent UK-wide clinical survey found no relationship between PC prevalence and haylage feeding and only an association with certain level of concentrates (i.e. 2.1 -3 kg/day) (Borkent et al. 2016). This study con rmed previous observations that PC more commonly affected the three caudal (74.7% PC) than the rostral three CT (32.1% PC) as recorded by Gere and Dixon (2010), Ramzan and Palmer (2011), Rodrigues et al. (2013) and Borkent et al. (2016). It has been proposed that the more carious environment present in the caudal oral cavity of affected horses could be due to reduced salivary pH buffering in this area, as most equine salivary out flow is from the parotid salivary gland into the rostral oral cavity (Gere and Dixon 2010). The study also found that CT calculus was only located on the buccal aspect of the rostral three CT adjacent to the parotid duct out flow; however, PC was never present beneath this calculus. This study found that PC is more than twice as likely to occur on the palatal (51.3% PC prevalence) vs. the buccal (20.9%) aspect of maxillary CT, and in contrast on the buccal (49.1% PC) vs. the lingual (28.9% PC) aspect of mandibular CT, a previously unreported nding. The reason for these large differences in the predilection sites of PC between mandibular and maxillary CT is unclear, but may be related to the mechanics of food and saliva flow in the equine oral cavity, with resultant differences in food contact between the upper and lower CT in fluencing bio lm formation. Biochemical and microbiological studies at different intraoral sites could help explain the various intraoral differences in PC lesion distribution. Although Borkent et al. (2016) found positive relationships between the presence of PC and some intercurrent dental abnormalities including CT diastemata, no difference in PC prevalence between populations with and without diastemata or dental fractures was found in this study. The very high overall prevalence of PC (91%) and limited size of the current population likely in fluenced this nding. Equid dental health tends to decrease with age, as found by Du Toit (2008) in large populations of donkeys. Although PC prevalence was found to change with age in this study, the 11 -20-year-old horses had the highest PC prevalence, indicating a nonlinear relationship to age unlike the ndings of Du Toit (2008). This nding may also be in fluenced by the relatively small sample in this study not being representative of the actual population, the source of the examined heads, the overall high PC prevalence and of age-related management changes such as retired horses being fed less concentrates and spending more time at pasture. It is interesting that all female horses examined in this study had PC, whilst 12% of males did not. The small population size limits the value of this observation and it is not supported by a larger epidemiological study (Borkent et al. 2016) that found no sex-related difference in PC prevalence. Nevertheless, Lukacs and Largaespada (2006) suggested that Fig 7: Post-mortem image showing calculus on the buccal aspects of mandibular 06 -08 teeth with associated severe gingival disease. [Colour gure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Fig 8: Following removal of calculus from the specimen shown in Figure 7, the underlying peripheral cementum shows no peripheral caries. [Colour gure 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY differences in sex hormone salivary levels between women and men could predispose to dental caries in women. Muhler and Shafer (1955) found that oestrogens increased the rate of caries developments in rats, but androgens had no effect. Further studies to determine the in fluence of saliva and its components in the formation of PC in horses would be useful in this regard. Most (72.6%) PC lesions recorded in this study were Grade 1 Class 1. Unless they progressed, these localised lesions would cause minimal clinical signs, but would contribute to a slight increase in dental wear due to loss of structural cementum. Erridge et al. (2012) showed that macroscopic grading of PC lesions markedly underestimates the severity of the disease as compared to histology of affected teeth, with lesions that grossly appeared to only affect cementum (i.e. Grade 1 caries) sometimes affected the underlying enamel (Grade 2 caries) or even dentine (Grade 3 caries). Although this gross study found that PC lesions were predominantly (92%) Grade 1, this survey may underestimate the actual severity of the disease. In conclusion, the high prevalence of PC in UK horses is an important area that needs further investigation, including microbiological studies of the complex oral micro flora to help understand the aetiopathogenesis of this increasingly recognised disease.

This review provides guidelines for optimal nutrition of the older horse with practical approaches to improve or maintain body condition and support general health. Introduction In developed countries, the proportion of aged horses within the equine population appears to be increasing, due in part to improved health care and nutrition plus a change in thepublic perception and expectations regarding ageing horses (Ralston and Harris 2013). Age itself can be measured in many different ways. Chronological age can be misleading because some animals age 'more successfully 'than others over the same time period, in part due to breed, and previous use as well as individual variability. Physiological age uses clinical as well as biological markers to re flect age-related changes and may be more helpful in the future as we better understand the processes of equine ageing. Demographic old age has been de ned as the point at which there is only 25% survivorship of the population at or above that speci c age. One UK study found this age to be 15 years (Mellor et al. 1999) although this will vary from country to country and the threshold age is likely to be much higher today, e.g. McGowan et al. (2010) reported nearly 38% of animals in their Australian based survey were older than 15. In a previous survey (Brosnahan and Paradis 2003), owners considered their horse to be old at ~22 years. Owners today commonly use a combination of both chronological and phenotypical age to classify their individual animal as being old/aged. Relevant age-related changes Gastrointestinal tract and digestion Age-related changes in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are reported in other species (Saffrey 2014). Certainly in man, disorders of the GIT are often prevalent in the elderly and include chronic constipation, re flux, delayed gastric emptying and impaired absorption due to bacterial overgrowth (Firth and Prather 2002). Gastrointestinal tract motility may be reduced in man and rats as a result of ageing, possibly due to impaired function of smooth muscle cells, disruption of the enteric nervous supply, and/or calcium dysregulation (Saffrey 2013). Mucosal immune defences are impaired with age andthe elderly show an increased susceptibility to gut infections and in flammation (Man et al. 2014). Studies in ageing rats have also shown reduced expression and activity of lactase and sucrase which are likely to impact on absorption of nutrients (Lee et al. 1997). Little work has been carried out in the horse with respect to age associated changes in the GIT, although recently Dougal et al. (2014) looked at the faecal microbiota, as a re flection of the hindgut microbial population, in adult (5 -12 years) and aged (19 -28 years) horses. Although there was no change in the bacterial community structure in these healthy animals associated with age, there was a reduction in the diversity of bacteria as previously reported in man. In people, it is believed that thisreflects decreasing energy requirements of the elderly along with altered gut transit times and/or antimicrobial drug use (Saffrey 2013). Initial work (Ralston et al. 1989) comparing the digestibility of a commercially available alfalfa pellet diet in a group of old horses ( >20 years) and younger adult horses ( <10 years), suggested an age associated decline in phosphorus, and crude protein apparent digestibility as well as crude bre apparent digestibility. However, these changes may just have reflected parasitic damage and/or poor dentition rather than age per se (Ralston et al. 2001; Ralston and Harris 2013). Elzinga et al . (2014) compared the macronutrient digestibility of three different diets (hay only, hay with an oil rich complementary feed and hay with a starch and sugar rich complementary feed) when fed to both adult (5 -12 years) and aged horses (19 -28 years). No difference in the digestibility of energy, crude protein, bre, fat, calcium or phosphorus was found between the two groups of healthy animals, which had received regular anthelmintic as well as dental treatment. The authors concluded that under most practical feeding conditions differences in digestive capacity are unlikely to be present in healthy aged horses vs. adult horses as long as regular anthelmintic treatment has been given and dentition is good. Body condition and muscle mass In a self-reporting owner study, 68% of horses 20 years were rated as good to moderate body condition (Brosnahan and Paradis 2003). This was comparable to that of the younger animals. A total of 28% of the older individuals were rated as fat or very fat and only 4% had a poor, or very poor score. A similar study by Ireland et al. (2011a) looked at the demographics, management and veterinary care of 918 horses aged 15 years or over in the UK and found that 80.9% of the horses 15 years of age were reported to be in good body condition, 8.2% were underweight and 10.5% overweight. A total of 17% of owners, however, had noticed weight loss in their horse over the past 12 months. This suggests that many healthy older horses do not have dif culty in \u00a92017 doi: 10.1111/eve.12749maintaining weight and in fact their energy requirements may not differ signi cantly from that of the younger adult. Obesity can therefore be as much of a problem in the older horse as it is in the general equine leisure population (Giles et al. 2014). Weight loss in the older horse is indicative of a medical or social problem where the animal is unable (or unwilling) to access, digest or absorb the nutrients provided. Sarcopenia (decrease in skeletal muscle mass) commonly occurs with age in man and may be associated with altered dietary habits as well as levels of physical activity (Booth and Zwetsloot 2010; Rennie et al. 2010). Loss of muscle mass was reported by 20% of owners of older horses in a UK survey and loss of muscle tone was thought to be a sign of ageing by 24% (Ireland et al. 2011a,b). Whilst changes in levels of exercise will undoubtedly affect muscle mass, a study of both older ( >20 years) and younger horses on a light exercise programme demonstrated improved maintenance of muscle mass regardless of age when supplementary lysine and threonine was fed (Graham-Thiers and Kron eld 2005). Decreased muscle mass is also a clinical feature of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (McFarlane 2011). However, a recent article showed that whilst there may be a lower rate of muscle protein synthesis in aged horses, age had no effect on any other indicators of whole body or muscle protein synthesis or on measures of systemic or muscle in flammation (Wagner et al. 2013). The authors suggested therefore that core protein requirements may not differ according to age in healthy individuals. Thermoregulatory control Older horses ( >20 years) were reported to require more calories than middle aged mares in order to maintain bodyweight when kept outdoors during the winter months in Colorado (Ralston et al. 1988). This suggests that provision of shelter, warm rugs and supplementary feeding may be essential during the colder weather. More recent work has shown that ageing can also compromise thermoregulation during exercise (McKeever et al. 2010). As extremes of body temperature are likely to impact on appetite, it could be equally important to keep a horse cool in the summer months, for example clipping out the long hair coat of a horse with PPID (Ralston and Harris 2013). Immune function An equine age-related decline in immune function, 'immunosenescence ', has been reported with a decline in the total lymphocyte count as well as in speci c subsets such as CD8 +and B cells (Horohov et al. 2010; Muirhead et al. 2010). This is likely to affect the anamnestic response to vaccination and vulnerability to infection. The ability of horses to produce antibodies in response to viral antigens, for example, has been shown to gradually decrease with age (Horohov et al. 1999). It has also been suggested that low plasma ascorbic acid concentrations associated with pituitary dysfunction may adversely impact immune competence (Ralston et al. 1988). Horses also show 'inflamm-ageing '(Adams et al. 2008; McFarlane and Holbrook 2008) similar to that described in aged man with signi cantly higher levels of circulating inflammatory interleukins and tumour necrosis factor. This may contribute to the development of certain age-related diseases. Importantly, in flamm-ageing has been shown to be exaggerated in the obese, older horse (Adams et al. 2009). Inthe UK survey by Ireland et al. (2011a) and US survey by Brosnahan and Paradis (2003), 10.5 and 28% of aged horses, respectively were reported as overweight potentially increasing their risk of age-related disease. An overweight, aged horse may therefore be as much of a concern as an underweight, aged horse. Key factors affecting the nutritional needs of the older horse It is important to recognise that the nutritional considerations of the healthy active aged horse will be similar as for their younger conspeci cs. It is when health is compromised through conditions affecting one or more body systems that additional factors need to be considered. Perhaps even more important in this age group, management practices and social behaviour issues can also affect the health and nutritional needs. Dental disease One of the biggest challenges, therefore, faced by the olderhorse (and donkey) is failing dentition, which may not always be recognised by their owners (McGowan 2009; du Toit et al. 2009). Clinical signs, suggestive of a dental problem, include the quidding of partially chewed food, halitosis, sinusitis, food pocketing in the cheeks, weight loss, inappetance, oesophageal choke and colic, especially large colon impactions. In the study by Ireland et al. (2011a), 10% of owners surveyed had noticed quidding or dysphagia in their horses (half of which struggled with long bre). Other signs that may relate to failing dentition such as weight loss, colic and changes in faeces were reported in 16.8, 8.7 and 5.1% of cases, respectively ( Fig 1 ). In the Ireland study, whilst 74% of horses received dental care at least once a year, 18% did not receive regular dental visits. In view of the concerns reported by owners relating to quidding, weight loss and faecal composition, it could be inferred that some owners view these changes as a naturalpart of ageing rather than a re flection of dental disease. Another potential issue is that when owners notice quidding or weight loss, many will increase the concentrate component of the horse 's diet. This can potentially Fig 1: This crib biter would struggle to pull hay from a small- holed net or graze very short grass. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd103 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY exacerbate abnormal dental wear unless underlying dental issues are dealt with rst (Dacre 2005). In addition, previous post-mortem studies have identi ed high levels of under- diagnosed and potentially very signi cant dental disorders in older horses (Brigham and Duncanson 2000). The authors concluded that the welfare and ability to digest food would have been improved in 72% of cases with appropriate dental treatment. Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) is a painful disorder of incisor and canine teeth in some ageing horses (Staszyk et al. 2008). The aetiology is unclear, but thought to be related to periodontal inflammation. It should be suspected if the horse exhibits pain on gentle 'tapping 'of the incisors. Diagnosis is con rmed by the signs of thickening with mottled resorption of dental roots of the incisors and canines on radiographs. Extraction of affected teeth is the treatment of choice (Rawlinson and Earley 2013). Shortening the height of abnormally long and sharp teeth should be considered to improve the comfort of the animal, but it is important to note that even radical correction of severe dental disease may not be effective in improving the animal 's ability to eat long bre/forage. Changes to dietary management may be necessary, as discussed below, to maintain body condition. Insulin resistance; pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction and equine metabolic syndrome Ageing se appears to be associated with insulin dysregulation (Mastro 2013). The clinical signs of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) are well known and include hypertrichosis, muscle wasting and increased risk of laminitis (McFarlane 2011). Equine metabolic syndrome is characterised by insulin dysregulation, (local or generalised obesity) and increased risk of laminitis (Frank et al. 2010; Geor and Harris 2013a,b) and is commonly thought to be present in middle aged and older animals. Orthopaedic disease Reduction or loss of appetite is part of many pain assessmentscales in both human and animal research and it is likely that any source of chronic pain will reduce appetite in the horse and donkey (Ashley et al. 2005). As the centre of gravity shifts with movement and changes in head position (Skerrit and McLelland 1984), horses with osteoarthritis, especially in the neck and forelimbs, may experience increased pain when the head is lowered, making grazing uncomfortable ( Fig 2 ). Generalised osteoarthritis can reduce the desire to ambulate and therefore signi cantly decrease grass intake especially if the pasture is sloping or badly poached. Osteoarthritis within the cervical vertebrae may also hinder grazing and cause discomfort when pulling hay from a net. Inappetence in the older horse In man, changes in the regulation of appetite and the lack of hunger frequently observed in association with ageing have been described as 'anorexia of ageing '(Malafarina et al. 2013). This condition results from a combination of comorbidities, social factors such as loneliness, polypharmacy, changes in sensory organs such as smell, sight and taste as well as possible alterations in the hormones that stimulate appetite. No treatment has yet been found to be effective in man and whether or not such a phenomenon exists in otherspecies is unknown, but equine patients may be subject to some of these contributory factors. From the authors ' experience, some older horses become increasingly 'picky ' about their feeds even changing what they would prefer to eat every few days. In particular, this seems to occur in the older horse that has had a medical emergency such as colic, although it is dif cult to know if this is due to disease or changing tastes. Social or behavioural issues The horse is a social animal and shows a high degree of social facilitation in a herd environment with partial and complete group synchrony of activities (Rifa 1990). Complete herd synchrony is most likely to be shown when grazing and walking rather than lying down or sleeping and will often be led by the stallion of the herd. Thus, a companion may be useful to encourage a horse with a reduced appetite to graze. However, in a study by Redgate and Davidson (2007), where concentrates were fed, whilst the close presence of another horse was bene cial to /C24half of the horses, it proved stressful to the remainder. This may re flect a more 'competitive 'reaction around concentrate feeds in certain individuals. Hierarchy also plays a part in access to food. A study of Icelandic horses (Ingolfsdottir and Sigurjonsdottir 2008) showed that the higher ranked horses spent signi cantly more time eating hay than pasture, compared with the lower ranked animals and they also improved their body condition over the winter, whilst the opposite was true of the lower ranked horses. An old horse may fall down the group hierarchy with age, so any supplementary feed may need to be given in a separate corral. This is particularly important if poor dentition means the horse takes longer to eat ( Fig 3 ). Evaluation As for younger horses, a starting point for any feeding recommendations is assessment of body condition score (BCS). Maintenance of a BCS of between 2.5 and 3.5 (Scale 0-5, Carroll and Huntington 1988) or 4.5 and 6 (Scale 1 -9, Henneke et al. 1983) is ideal, dependent on season and concurrent conditions such as PPID. Practically, whilst lacking Fig 2: Osteoarthritis in the forelimbs or neck can make eating from floor level uncomfortable for the older horse. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd104 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY the accuracy of a weighbridge, a weigh tape can yield useful information as regards weight loss/gain providing the same brand of tape and positioning is used each time. The current diet should be reviewed in light of the horse 's clinical status and dentition. A full history, to include both clinical and environmental/social factors, should be taken. Environmental factors include temperature, provision of shelter and rugs, suitability of paddock, recent change in yard, anthelmintic use and ease of access to supplementary feeding. Social factors include any change in eld companions and group hierarchy. The clinical examination should rule out any source of chronic pain that may cause inappetance, and include a faecal worm egg count; further diagnostic tests are justi ed if weight loss or a history of laminitis is reported.A dental examination using a full mouth speculum and light source is required to evaluate the teeth as regards function and potential sources of pain ( Figs 4 and 5 ). Excessive bre length in the faeces ( >3.7 mm) is also suggestive of ineffective mastication and dental pathology (Easley 2003), as is a history of choke or impaction colic. It is helpful to witness the horse eating a variety of feeds to assess for range of jaw movement, any signs of discomfort and quidding. Management considerations Simple measures such as feeding from a raised bucket on a gate bracket ( Fig 6 ), provision of large holed hay nets and guided use of pain relief can make a considerable difference to feed intake and comfort (Jarvis 2009; Ralston and Harris 2013). Selection of a level eld and locating the water tank, shelter and feed all in close proximity to reduce unnecessary ambulation will bene t the older arthritic horse. Prevention of bullying, ensuring good access to feeding stations and water is essential. Feeding recommendations (summarised in the accompanying feeding chart) As described by Ralston and Harris (2013) old horses can be divided into four groups with respect to their nutritional needs (Table 1 ). Young at heart Those that are maintaining good body condition, clinically normal and 'in use ', i.e. the horse that is old in years but has no apparent age-related or clinically important disorders and is still being used for performance and/or reproduction. Such horses can maintain optimal bodyweight and condition on a standard 'adult 'ration formulated for their level of activity and reproductive status. Nutritional advice : Continue on current management regimen, assuming it is balanced for their needs, but continue to monitor weight and to maintain routine vaccination, dental and parasite control programmes. Many healthy, Fig 3: Herd hierarchy may mean older horses are pushed away from forage/feed. A simple corral allows extra feeds to be given and can be helpful for slow eaters. Fig 4: A 32-year-old horse was presented with a gradual declinein appetite and weight loss. Inspection of the oral cavity revealed a stick rmly lodged between the upper molars, causing severe ulceration of the hard palate. No signs of dysphagia or sialorrhea were seen on initial examination. Fig 5: This horse demonstrated dysphagia. Sharp enamel points on cheek tooth 211 had caused deep mucosal ulceration. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd105 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY older horses not in work, with good dentition, can maintain condition when fed between 1.5 and 2.5% bodyweight (bwt) on a drymatter (DM) basis, of good quality hay/forage. Supplementary feeding is only necessary if the horse is unable to maintain weight on forage alone or inadequate dentition has limited the horse 's ability to chew long bre (Ralston and Harris 2013). Free access to water, a salt lick and a forage balancer should be provided. Aged and obese Those that are overweight/obese but clinically normal, i.e. the horse that is old in years and still functioning normally, but has a reduced level of physical activity and a tendency to gain weight. Nutritional advice : Consider following the recommendations for weight reduction (e.g. Geor and Harris 2013a,b). Continue to monitor weight through weekly use of a weigh tape (heart and belly girth plus rump width may be useful to monitor) and to maintain routine vaccination, dental and parasite control. Aged with a tendency to lose weight Those with dif culty to maintain weight but clinically normal, i.e. the horse that is old in years, clinically normal but no longer able to maintain weight on a normal diet. Nutritional advice : Con rm that teeth and parasite control programmes are adequate and that hepatic and renal functions are within normal limits. Gradually change to a higher calorie and more nutrient rich diet. Commercial feeds designed to prevent weight loss and restore optimal condition in older horses are now commonly available. Ideally, these should provide good quality protein (10 -14%) with soybean meal or legumes as the main sources, added vegetable oil/fat (7 -10%), phosphorus (0.3 -0.45%) andrestricted calcium (0.45 -1.0%). Unlike a horse with metabolic syndrome, a PPID animal often shows muscle atrophy and weight loss despite a normal or increased appetite (McFarlane 2011). The geriatric with concurrent health and/or physical problems Nutritional advice : Provide treatment and support for the speci c underlying conditions. It may not be possible to address all of the issues in such horses adequately. It is better to feed something that reasonably meets the horse 's nutritional needs and that it will consume voluntarily than to feed a ration it will not consume. Pasture provides an easy to digest source of forage and requires little mastication if dentition is compromised. However, concurrent conditions such as PPID, especially when associated with insulin dysregulation, may necessitate limiting access to pasture to reduce the risk of laminitis. Forage, or forage replacers with a nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content <12% and preferably 10% should then be provided (Geor and Harris 2013a,b). Ideally, for those with dental compromise, the use of softer hays with a high leaf to stem ratio, haylage or chopped hay may be bene cial, although an older report suggests that feeding chopped bre can exacerbate interdental food packing if diastemata are present (Miles and Grigson 1990) and may be best avoided if periodontal disease is of concern. Signi cant dental compromise may necessitate a 'no long bre'(NLF) diet in order to minimise the risk of choke or impaction colic and improve utilisation of feed. Such a ration should still be bre based e.g. include high bre pellets, hay cubes and soaked sugar beet pulp (an unmolassed version is available for laminitics). Alfalfa as chaff or pellets can help to provide good quality protein. Alternatively, part or all of the ration can consist of a compound complementary feed designed for the older horse (typically fed at 0.5 -1% bwt). Most senior products are formulated with a crude protein of between 12 -16% with a good level of lysine to help maintain muscle mass and a vegetable oil /fat content of 4 -7% for energy. Any cereals, other than oats, should have been heat treated to improve precaecal starch digestion. A variety of senior commercial feeds are currently available. Feeds with a restricted high sugar and starch content will be required for some older animals, especially those prone to laminitis or with con rmed PPID. For those horses with a very aged mouth even short chopped bres may not be suitable and an appropriate ground- bre-based feed may need to be soaked to create a mash. Soaking the food radically increases the bulk and limits the number of calories the horse can consume in one feeding session ( Fig 7 ). Ideally dividing the daily ration into four or ve smaller feeds prevents the horse being over faced, or if possible allow the horse to graze on the mashover a period of time. Vegetable oils can be added to boost the calori c content of the mash as they are calorie dense and require no chewing. It is important to introduce gradually additional oils as the GIT can take 4 -14 days to adapt in healthy horses (Warren and Vineyard 2013). If top dressing oil onto feed, ideally start with less than a quarter of a cup (30 -60 mL) per meal and increase slowly over a period of 2 - 3 weeks until a maximum of 1 -2 cups (250 -500 mL/500 kg horse) is reached. This will minimise the risk of diarrhoea or colic. Generally, corn Fig 6: Inexpensive mangers that t over the gate/fence improve comfort, encouraging the horse to eat. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd106 2019 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY TABLE 1: Feeding guide.

Other naturally high oil-providing feedstuffs (appropriately processed and forti ed) such as ricebran (with additional calcium to balance the high phosphorus content), soybeans and flaxseed can be more palatable to the fussy eater, additional vitamin E supplementation is recommended at 1 - 1.5 iu/mL of additional oil (Zeyner and Harris 2013). Ralston et al. (1988) reported that aged horses had lower plasma ascorbic acid concentrations than younger healthy horses and went on to describe increased antibody response to vaccination in older horses that received a vitamin C supplement. Oxidative stress within the pars pituitary has been suggested to be partly responsible for the neurodegenerative process associated with PPID (Sof fler 2007) and supplementation with antioxidants (vitamin E, selenium) may be useful in theory, although this is unproven. Sufcient clean water must be available and accessible at all times as polyuria and polydipsia may be present in PPID cases. Immunosuppression is likely in advanced cases of PPID and faecal worm egg monitoring (McFarlane et al. 2010) and early treatment of bacterial infections such as periodontal disease is essential. Vitamin C supplementation can be helpful in such cases as mentioned above. Some horses have been shown to develop severe hypertriglyceridaemia (Dunkel et al. 2014) secondary to PPID with serum triglyceride levels reaching 10.5 -60.3 mmol/L (reference range 0.17 -0.46 mmol/L). None of the animals appeared to be clinically affected despite gross lipaemia and moderately raised hepatic enzymes. The authors felt the onset of insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia in PPID cases that led to the dyslipidaemia was prolonged enough to enable horses to adapt. Treatment with pergolide was effective in reducing the serum triglyceride levels. Many nutraceuticals and botanicals claim to resolve the clinical signs of PPID; however, to date all are unproven and in the case of Vitex agnus castus (Chasteberry) has been suggested in one study to result in deterioration (Beech 2002). Joint nutraceuticals In a recent survey, 37.8% of horses over the age of 15 years received a 'joint supplement '(Ireland et al. 2011b); however,a review of 15 in vivo clinical trials involving glucosamine based nutraceuticals concluded that the overall quality of evidence for these products was low (Pearson and Lindinger 2009). It is also important to note, however, that in Europe such products should not be marketed as curing or alleviating lameness as this is a medicinal claim (https://www.gov.uk/government/ organisations/veterinary-medicines-directorate). Worryingly, a study of glucosamine levels in 23 commercially available equine oral joint supplements, albeit some time ago in the USA (Oke et al. 2006) , demonstrated that nine products failed to meet their label claim for content and one product contained 0% glucosamine. This paper also highlighted the wide range of suggested daily dosing of glucosamine, anywhere from 1800 to 12,000 mg re flecting the uncertainty of nutraceutical use. Questions also remain regarding the absorption of oral forms of glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate (Welch et al. 2012). A bene cial response has been perceived by owners in some individuals; however, good remedial farriery and appropriate use of suitable anti-in flammatories are essential in supporting the older horse with generalised osteoarthritis. In all cases the owners and treating veterinarian need to monitor response and amend management accordingly. Conclusion Healthy older horses with good body condition and normal dentition seldom require a different diet from that of a younger adult horse. However, ageing is associated with conditions such as PPID, osteoarthritis and failing dentition, which can require tailored feeding regimens in order to maintain body condition. In the event of weight loss, a detailed history is fundamental as many social and environmental factors can impact on calorie intake and expenditure, such as competition from herd mates and falling winter temperatures. Concurrent conditions need to be taken into account as any source of chronic pain has the ability to reduce appetite. The clinical examination should include a full dental assessment as poor dentition may mean that whilst suf cient food is provided the horse is unable to utilise the ration.

M. J. De Cozar Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic, Mereworth, Kent, UK Corresponding author email: Michael@BellEquine.com Learning objective Critically appraise available evidence in the literature to determine whether during lameness evaluation administration of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists ( a2agonists) reduces the accuracy of interpreting diagnostic analgesia compared with no administration of a2agonists. Clinical question and background Establishing the location of lameness in dif cult, fractious or sensitive horses can be a signi cant challenge for the equine veterinary surgeon, especially with the increasing demands of clients to localise the lameness source. The 2013 British Equine Veterinary Association accident survey highlighted the dangers of our occupation and the types of situations equine veterinarians regularly nd themselves in. Diagnostic analgesia has become a mainstay of equine lameness investigation, and is seen as a cost-effective and valid method of localising potential sources of pain. Physical restraint, via use of a twitch, bridle or stocks, in most cases is successful, but often chemical restraint, through sedation, may be required. Although, the use of sedation is not a new method, a lot of its use in equine lameness evaluation is anecdotal in its evidence. There is concern that the use of sedation may in fluence the lameness examination via analgesic effects and ataxia. Many historical research papers and texts (Dyson and Kidd 1993; Barr 2010; Ross and Dyson 2011) elude to the use of sedation, in particular a2agonists, in aiding with diagnostic analgesia and base their use on handler safety and improved patient tolerance. PICO question and search strategy Patient: Equines undergoing diagnostic analgesia for lameness evaluation. Use of a2agonists compared with none. Outcome: Accuracy in diagnosis of lameness improvement. CAB abstracts were searched using the following *). Of 79 results, screening was based on the title and abstract in regards to question relevancy. Although all addressed use of a2agonists in equines and illustrated the major pharmacology of a2 agonists, none reported use of sedation in equine lameness exams. A further screen on PubMed (using Equine *AND Lameness *AND Sedation *) obtained three relevant results.Results Buchner et al. (1999) Although a relatively dated article, the paper set out to evaluate the locomotion patterns in both sound and lame horses after administering detomidine and antagonising with atipamezole prior to lameness assessment. In total, 17 horses (nine sound, eight chronically forelimb lame) were used in the study, with a repeated measures design. Horses were seen trotting on a treadmill at various time points post-sedation, focusing particularly on stride length and hoof movements in the forelimbs. Level of sedation was based on heart rate and head height. The same exercise was performed the following day; with sedation being antagonised with atipamezole after 15 min. Results showed that detomidine-sedated horses at 15 min develop a longer stride length, which could be reversed with atipamezole. The authors report no difference in perceived lameness using a head acceleration asymmetry system, and when using a2antagonists, there was no relapse into sedation. The authors suggest that detomidine administration does not decrease the lameness grade, but does change the locomotor pattern. This may make assessment of response to diagnostic analgesia dif cult in mild cases. Additionally, a2antagonists may be useful, but can be expensive. Rettig et al. (2016) A more recent article evaluated the effects of low dose xylazine on fore- and hindlimb lameness by using body mounted inertial sensors. In total, 44 horses of various comfort levels were divided into xylazine treatment and saline control groups. Degree of sedation was assessed by head height and ataxia grade. Horses were then assessed on a straight line, focusing on vertical head height and vertical pelvic movement asymmetry. There was no signi cant difference in head movement and pelvic movement asymmetry between time 0 and 20 min, and time 0 and 60 min in both treatment groups. Although, some horses with forelimb lameness changed their lameness grade, this was not signi cant between treatments. This was not the case with hindlimb lameness. This study provided some supportive evidence that the use of a2agonists does not mask lameness. Da Silva Azevedo et al. (2015) This study had a similar protocol to Rettig et al. using inertial sensors, but compared the difference between xylazine and acepromazine in lameness evaluation. Interestingly, no analgesic effect of xylazine was found at low doses, with no signi cant difference in lameness before and after 10.1111/eve.12877Can this evidence be applied to my clinical scenario? All studies (Buchner et al. 1999; Da Silva Azevedo et al. 2015; Rettig et al. 2016) provide support for a2agonists use in lameness investigations, although the long action of effect with detomidine may prevent its use in fast-acting nerve and synovial blocks (Clarke et al. 2014). The use of short-acting xylazine does not appear to mask lameness, although, care must be taken in interpreting diagnostic analgesia in mild forelimb lameness after sedation. Further questions raised? During the appraisal, a few questions were raised, including ridden assessment of horses after sedation with a2agonist, opioid combinations and the potential side effects of a2 antagonists. Moreover, the possibility of species variation in the pharmacology of a2agonists, which was raised, has some evidence (Latzel 2012).
