This survey wanted to explore different 34 types of interventions across Switzerland and to identify the most relevant complaints treated 35 by therapists, their job satisfaction and satisfaction concerning the collaboration with medical 36 doctors. 37 Methods : This cross sectional study of therapists registered in the Experience Medicine 38 Register (EMR) was conducted as online survey in 2017 in Switzerland in three different 39 languages. Therapists first selected one possible treatment option as their most often used 40 intervention for their patients. Afterwards, they indicated the complaints treated with this kind 41 of intervention. Data were analysed descriptively. 42 Results : Of 17,647 initially invited therapists 3,942 responded (22.3%) and data of 3,638 43 therapists could be analysed. Therapists were often females in own practice and had high job 44 satisfaction, but were less satisfied with the collaboration with medical doctors. Therapists 45 stated that they most often provide classical massage, craniosacral therapy, Traditional 46 Chinese Medicine, naturopathic practices and medical massage. French speaking therapists 47 stated that they more often provide osteopathy and manual lymph drainage but less often 48 craniosacral therapy than German speaking therapists. Headache and back pain were named 49 as the most common treated complaints. 50 Conclusions : Therapies used by non-medical complementary therapists varied across the 51 different regions in Switzerland. However, we found no regional differences in the complaints 52 being treated by therapists. 53 54 Keywords: Survey, complementary medicine, job satisfaction, health services research, cross 55 sectional study, Switzerland 56 4 1. Introduction 57 Complementary medicine was implemented in the Swiss constitution [1] after public voting 58 [2] and health policy makers made efforts to make complementary therapies available for the 59 public. Physicians can actually offer five different treatments in Switzerland (acupuncture, 60 anthroposophic medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), homeopathy, and 61 phytomedicine) within the basic health insurance [3, 4]. In addition to that, in Switzerland, 62 non-medical complementary therapists can also offer their service to patients. About 27,000 63 complementary therapists are registered in Switzerland, which is a pre-requisite for the 64 reimbursement of their service. More than 200 different types of non-medical complementary 65 treatments are registered and therapists with an accreditation in a registry (like Experience 66 Medicine Register EMR) can bill patients for such treatments in a standardised way. This is 67 either reimbursed within a supplementary private health insurance or is paid out of pocket. 68 Despite the fact that around 200 different interventions are available in Switzerland, 69 about 20 of them cover most of the reimbursed treatments from the supplementary private 70 health insurance (health insurance company SWICA, personal communication). On a 71 European level, acupuncture is the most prevalent treatment with a ratio of about 21 therapists 72 per 100.000 inhabitants [5]. Also, in Switzerland acupuncture is often used and about 60% of 73 the general practitioners refer patients to acupuncture [6]. Homeopathy (11/100.000), herbal 74 medicine (6.5/100.000), naturopathy (5/100.000) also account for many consultations on an 75 European level whereas manual therapies including osteopathy (1.2/100.000) and 76 anthroposophic medicine (1/100.000) and others are less often used [5, 6]. The professional 77 interplay between regular medical care (i.e. general practitioners) and complementary 78 treatments are not studied well so far and upcoming studies might help to understand this 79 interprofessional collaboration better. 80 From a consumer perspective there is a regional variability in the use of 81 complementary therapy across Switzerland and also patient characteristics contribute to such 82 5 user patterns. Results from the Swiss Health Survey showed a high er utilisation of osteopathy 83 especially in the French part of Switzerland compared to other parts of the country [7]. 84 Patients with chronic diseases, poor health status and an additional supplemental health 85 insurance more often use complementary interventions in Switzerland [8]. According to an 86 analysis that compared data from 2007 and 2012 there was an increase in the use of 87 homeopathy, osteopathy and herbal medicine but other interventions were used less often [8]. 88 The use of complementary therapies also depends on the complaints, which patients 89 experience. A recent survey across Europe showed that neck and back pain, cancer, and 90 digestive symptoms are the most important reasons to consult a complementary therapy 91 provider [9]. Non-medical complementary therapists in Germany reported to treat mainly 92 general or unspecific complaints, musculoskeletal complaints and psychological disorders 93 [10]. 94 To get a better insight into the professional situation of complementary therapists and 95 their use of treatments in Switzerland we aim ed to explore the variation of the different 96 interventions across the country and to identify the most relevant ly treated medical 97 complaints. In addition, we wanted to investigate work related job satisfaction of therapists 98 and the satisfaction concerning the cooperation with medical practitioners. 99 100 2. Methods 101 2.1 Selection and description of therapists 102 All therapists who have been registered at least 12 months in the Experience Medicine 103 Register (EMR) for one of the most frequently used 20 treatments according to SWICA 104 customer statistics were included in the study (the list of included treatments can be found in 105 Appendix 1). A total of 17,647 therapists (14,788 with German language, 2,614 with French 106 language ) fulfill ed this inclusion criteria and where invited to participate in the online-survey. 107 The EMR includes the information about preferred language (only German and French), 108 6 however we also made the survey available in Italian. The higher number of German speaking 109 therapists reflects the structure of the members in the database. Therapists who reported less 110 than 10 hours practicing time per week in the survey were excluded from the analysis. 111 All participating therapists were informed about the study aim before starting to fill in 112 their responses. All data was collected in an anonymous way and no identification of 113 therapists is possible since data from register is only available by EMR and survey data is 114 only available by the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine (IKI). The study 115 protocol and the survey questions were sent to the cantonal ethics committee of Zurich (Req- 116 2017-00136) and evaluated as not being under the scope of the Swiss human research law . 117 118 2.2 Study design 119 This cross-sectional survey was performed in Switzerland. The quantitative data was collected 120 with an online survey which was distributed by email to therapists in the EMR regist ry, who 121 offer one of the 20 most prevalent complementary interventions in Switzerland (see list in 122 Appendix 1). An email sent from the EMR informed the therapists about the study and 123 encouraged them to participate. The email enclosed a link to the online survey, and the data 124 was stored by an external server at the University Hospital Zurich. The study was announced 125 in advance by the EMR through their newsletters in order to increase the response rate later 126 on. Two reminder-emails were sent (two and four weeks after the initial email) to all 127 registered therapists. The survey was accessible for a total of two months. A schematic 128 illustration of the study design is displayed in figure 1. 129 130 2.3 Procedure and survey 131 The anonymous online-survey was created with the open source online-survey tool soSci 132 Survey (soSci Survey GmbH, Munich, Germany). The survey was available in three 133 7 languages (German, French, Italian), each representing one geographical part of Switzerland. 134 Participants could freely choo se their language on the entry page. The survey consisted of 135 three sections. 136 Section 1: The questions in the first section checked whether participants match ed with 137 inclusion criteria (>12 months registered at EMR, office hours >10 hours per week, >12 138 months working in practice). Participants not matching those criteria could not proceed with 139 the survey. 140 Section 2: The second section consisted of questions about the therapists ' working 141 environment and clients. We asked about the work site (i.e. agglomeration, urban, rural), the 142 typical patients in terms of age group (i.e. children, adolescents, young adolescents, adults, 143 elderly) and the type of disorders (acute, chronic, both ). The duration of the treatment was 144 examined with two questions: mean duration of the first treatment and mean duration of the 145 follow-up treatment s. We also assessed the therapis ts most frequently used intervention and 146 the most prevalent complaints of the typical patients which were treated with the respective 147 intervention. In total, therapists had a comprehensive list of 91 different complaints, which 148 could be selected by respondents from this list. This list was generated from the International 149 Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) [11, 12]. 150 In the analysis we grouped redundant data from the list of complaints into larger 151 clusters in order to generate information about the prevalence of these comprehensive 152 symptom domains. In the first step, this list of complaints was grouped based on medical 153 reasoning (i.e. related disorders like stroke and paralysis were combined) and high 154 correlations between complaints, which might result in these complaints being summarised 155 into a broader cluster (like musculoskeletal disorders with complaints like osteoporosis, 156 rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia etc.). We generated a list of 25 clusters of complaints with 157 1 to 8 single complaints. In the second step we calculated the mean prevalence across all 158 8 complaints in one cluster, resulting in one value for the prevalence of this domain in the 159 therapist population. 160 Additionally, satisfaction concerning the collaboration with the physicians (numeric 161 rating scale (NRS), 0-10) and job satisfaction (first year of activity, currently and in five 162 years ; NRS, 0-10) were assessed. 163 Section 3: In the last section, socio-demographic information was obtained, including sex, 164 age, education, and level of employment of the therapists (i.e. fulltime/part-time employed, 165 self-employed). 166 167 2.4 Analysis 168 Statistical analysis of the data was performed with the software SPSS Version 23 [13] and R 169 (Version 3.5.1) [14]. For the analysis, data was stratified according to the language of the 170 therapists. For the description of socio-demographic information, satisfaction, interventions 171 and complaints we used descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages for categorical 172 variables, mean, standard deviation and median for continuous variables). 173 174 3. Results 175 3.1 Sample description 176 Of the 17,402 invited complementary therapists, 3,942 started the survey. Out of those, 304 177 were excluded due to incomplete data about type of treatment the therapists provide, business 178 hours with less than 10 hours per week or a working activity as therapist in own practice with 179 less than 12 months. The data of 3,638 participants (3,198 using German language, 352 180 French, 88 Italian) was analysed in a descriptive way (table 1). Interestingly the gender of the 181 therapists varies across language regions with most female therapist with German language 182 (84.2%; n = 2,692) and less females in French speaking (71.9 %; n = 253) or Italian speaking 183 therapists (63.6% (n = 56). In total, the mean age was 51.1 (\u00b126.4) years and 91.1% (n = 184 9 3,332) of the therapists were self-employed. On average, the therapists worked for 14.0 year s 185 (\u00b17.8) with a mean of 25.5 office hours (\u00b111.0) per week. The mean duration of the first 186 treatment was reported to be 73.8 (\u00b121.6) minutes (mode 90 minutes), whereas the duration of 187 the following treatment was around one hour (58.1\u00b114.5 minutes). 188 189 3.2 Job satisfaction and satisfaction with professional cooperation 190 The general job satisfaction of the therapists was high with a mean of 7.3 (\u00b12.3) in the first 191 year of their work as therapists (table 2). The current job satisfaction was even higher with a 192 mean of 8.9 (\u00b11.3), as well as the expected job satisfaction with work in five years with a 193 mean of 8.9 (\u00b11.4). However, the satisfaction with the cooperation with physicians was rather 194 low with 4.4 (\u00b12.7) with a considerable variation between therapists. 195 196 3.3 Treatments 197 The type of therapeutic treatments stratified by therapists' language is presented in table 3. 198 Within the total sample, classical massage was the most frequently mentioned treatment by 199 therapists with 16.1% (n = 586), followed by craniosacral therapy (8.9%, n = 325) and 200 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments (8.2%, n = 298). The least often mentioned 201 treatments were acupressure (1.2%, n = 42), Western phytotherapy (0.5%, n = 17), and 202 polarity (0.2%, n = 6). 203 The comparison of the therapeutic treatments across languages showed considerable 204 variation. Classical massage was the most frequently offered treatment by German speaking 205 therapists (16.2%, n = 519) whereas osteopathy/etiopathy was the most frequently offered by 206 French speaking therapist (23.3%; n = 82). In Italian speaking therapists, medical massage 207 was most prevalent (13.6%; n = 12). While craniosacral therapy ranked second for German 208 speaking therapists (9.8%, n = 315), similar to French speaking therapists (16.8%, n = 59), 209 only 0.6% (n = 2) of the Italian speaking therapists considered craniosacral therapy as their 210 10 major treatment. Acupunct(ure)-massage was mentioned by 6.6% (n = 212) of the German 211 speaking therapists (8th rank), while none of the French or Italian speaking therapists used this 212 treatment. 213 214 3.4 Medical complaints 215 As presented in table 4, most of the therapists commonly treat patients with both, chronic and 216 acute complaints (63.6%, n = 3,211), whereas 30.9% (n = 1,123) mostly deal with chronic 217 patients and only 5.4% (n = 197) work with acute ill patients. The most frequently treated 218 complaint was headache/migraine, followed by neck-/back pain with 90.0% and stress with 219 76.4%. These findings are presented in the Appendix 2. 220 These complaints were grouped into 25 clusters of complaints and table 5 shows the 221 findings about the average percentage of complaints in each cluster. Again, headache, back 222 pain, and mental disorders are commonly treated domains. But also, complaints of women 223 during pregnancy and neuralgia in the face are often treated problems. Overall there was no 224 clear difference between language regions. Information about the grouping of complaints is 225 shown in Appendix 3. 226 227 4. Discussion 228 Our study is the first nation-wide survey in Switzerland investigating a large cohort of non- 229 medical complementary therapists and indicating that such therapists offer a huge variability 230 of treatment options. The first ten most prevalent treatments are offered by at least 5% of the 231 therapists each. According to our findings, the therapists usually spend 90 minutes for the first 232 session and 60 minutes for follow-up consultations. According to our findings, the therapists 233 have a focus on treating pain and mental health. 234 Our survey showed regional variation within Switzerland in the offered interventions 235 of non-medical complementary therapists. This finding is in line with the considerable 236 11 differences in healthcare practice across regions, hospitals and physician practices for almost 237 every condition and procedure around the world [15] and in Switzerland [16-18]. 238 Many factors can explain variations in healthcare [19]. First, factors related to 239 geographical regions might affect the demand for complementary therapies, such as patients' 240 attitudes towards these treatments, cultural-related factors, the comorbidity of patients, or 241 socioeconomic factors [20]. Second, differences in the supply of complementary therapies can 242 also exist. These differences are based on the availability of healthcare providers, the absence 243 of a standard training programme for healthcare professionals, the lack of standardisation of 244 CAM practitioners and their practice standards [20], the scarcity of rigorous clinical 245 guidelines, or the reimbursement and the government policies. In this line, complementary 246 therapies may be considered as a good example of 'supply -sensitive care', as the frequency of 247 its use might depend on the local availability of healthcare providers. However, this 248 explanation is difficult to check in the Swiss context as the registration at EMR is not 249 compulsory, and other registers can also be used to become reimbursed as a therapist. 250 An important point to mention is that variation in clinical practice is not always 251 inappropriate as some variation is, in fact, adequate. An example of adequate variation may be 252 due to the consideration of the patients' values and prefe rences. This survey did not aim to 253 identify 'unwarr anted variation ', that is, a practice variation that is not explained by the 254 illness, patient risk factors or patient preferences [15, 21]. Therefore, it is yet to be determined 255 if the heterogeneity in practices in non-medical complementary therapy in Switzerland is 256 unwarranted or not. 257 Our study confirms earlier findings with patients suffering from chronic low back pain 258 showing that osteopathy is the most often used complementary treatment in the French 259 speaking part of Switzerland [22]. Dubois et al. found that about half of the patients received 260 osteopathic treatment for their back pain. 261 12 According to our findings, the complaints treated by non-medical complementary 262 therapists encompass chronic disorders and acute disorders equally with a strong focus on 263 pain and mental health. Earlier studies from Switzerland emphasised that especially patients 264 with a longer treatment history, a longer duration of complaints and non-responsiveness to 265 conventional medical treatment might use complementary therapies [23, 24]. We have no data 266 on the non-responsiveness to conventional medical treatment since we did not ask th e 267 therapist about the motives of patients to seek their treatment. The most prevalent complaints 268 mentioned by the therapists in our study are musculoskeletal disorders, pain and mental health 269 disorders, which support the findings about reasons for CAM use from Busato et al, 2006. 270 The non-medical complementary therapists in our study were in general highly 271 satisfied with their job. A study from Germany comparing general practitioners with or 272 without CAM use found a similar job satisfaction between both groups [25]. However, the job 273 satisfaction was much lower compared to a similar sample of GPs in Switzerland [26]. Since 274 no predictors for job satisfaction of complementary therapist in Switzerland have been 275 published we searched for studies about GPs and factors associated with high job satisfaction. 276 This data showed, that autonomy and variation in work tasks is associated with high job 277 satisfaction [27]. For general practitioners it was found that less working hours per week are 278 associated with higher job satisfaction, which supports our findings [28] in our sample that is 279 mainly working part time. As other drivers for the high job satisfaction of therapists in our 280 sample, the lower number of patients per day and the large freedom in working tasks based on 281 the own set agenda can be named. According to our findings, the mean duration of a regular 282 consultation is about 60 minutes which considerab ly cuts down the number of patients seen 283 per day by Swiss therapists. Also, the high number of females in our sample m ay contribute to 284 the high job satisfaction. Female gender in itself might contribute to the overall job 285 satisfaction across different jobs, which was in parts explained by a lower expectation of 286 females towards their job in general [29]. In summary the working context of the therapist 287 13 might be characterised by criteria for low job dissatisfaction (i.e. negative working conditions, 288 regulations, supervision) and criteria for high job satisfaction (i.e. recognition, salary, 289 personal growth) according to the two factor theory by Frederick Herzberg [30]. Most of the 290 therapist work in their own practice and the impact of the team is not that relevant neither for 291 their satisfaction nor their dissatisfaction. 292 A positive job satisfaction can also be regarded as a positive starting point for a 293 therapeutic encounter. Studies on medical personal found an association between job 294 satisfaction of the service provider and the satisfaction with the care of the patients [31, 32]. 295 Based on our findings, we can hypothesise that these therapists face in general a rather low 296 risk of burn out, which is often driven by low job satisfaction [33]. 297 The therapists indicated a moderate satisfaction with the collaboration with physicians. 298 A closer look for the distribution of this data showed that many therapists rated this item with 299 5 on a 10- point scale. This might be interpreted as \"this is not relev ant for me in my work\". 300 From a health services perspective there might be a need for care models, that build a bridge 301 between medical care and treatments by complementary therapists. However, the re might be 302 beliefs on both sides that are barriers for a clo ser collaboration. There are studies that indicate 303 that GPs and other medical professions have more favourable attitudes towards 304 complementary care if they are, for example, of younger age, have positive own experiences, 305 practice in an urban area [34, 35]. There are many medical practitioners who would refer 306 patients to a therapist. In addition, the access to both health care professions might play a role: 307 Since medical practitioners and therapists can be directly accessed by patients in Switzerland 308 the collaboration of both professions might have a low impact from a patien ts' perspective . 309 Results from other countries show ed that patients often use CAM in parallel to regular 310 medical care [36], but it is also common not to disclose CAM treatment to medical 311 practitioners [37]. Our results indicate that referral practice between both health care sectors is 312 underdeveloped so far, which is a finding already reported in other countries [38]. 313 14 314 4.1 Strengths and limitations 315 Our survey had a response rate of more than 20%, which is a good result for an anonymous 316 web-based survey without any reimbursement, but self-selection bias might be present (i.e. 317 therapists with less duties have more time to contribute). Some subsamples are quite small 318 which is caused by the fact that some regions or interventions strategies are not that often 319 represented in the EMR registry and registration at EMR is not compulsary. The 320 generalisability of the results is limited by these two aspects (non-response and 321 overrepresentation of German speaking therapists). As a reader one might assume that it is a 322 weakness to force therapists to select one specific treatment they use most often since they 323 might be trained for more than one therapy. However, the number of therapists having only 324 one therapy registered is about 70%. This is a large nation-wide study on an important group 325 of health care providers in Switzerland using a widespread register of these therapists. The 326 combination of different medical complaints was necessary to allow a better overview about 327 complex information, but as each summary approach it is based on assumptions and has its 328 limitations. Therefore, we present in Appendix 4 the original data about prevalence of treated 329 complaints across regions with all complaints before clustering. The complaints are grouped 330 in this presentation according to the clusters of the analyses. 331 332 4.2 Conclusion 333 The type of therapy used by non-medical complementary therapi sts varied across the different 334 regions in Switzerland. However, we found no regional difference in the complaints being 335 treated by therapists. 336 337 Consent for publication 338 All authors approved this manuscript for publication. 339 15 340 Availability of data and material 341 Access to data sets will be granted individually upon a reasonable request. 342 343 Conflict of interest & funding 344 The authors do not have any conflict of interest to declare.
