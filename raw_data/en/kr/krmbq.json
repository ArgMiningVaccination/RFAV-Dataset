For many women, the transition through [perimenopause](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/perimenopause/) and menopause is no walk in the park, especially when symptoms are severe or show up all at once. But there's some good new in all of this, and it's that nature provides a wide array of vitamins, nutrients and medicinal plants and herbs that help to significantly to relieve menopause symptoms. The [\"natural approach\" to menopause symptom relief](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/) works in a completely different way than many conventional medical solutions like synthetic hormone replacement and synthetic drugs. Because vitamins and herbs work with your body to rebalance your hormones and support your overall health, natural supplements for perimenopause and menopause can actually prevent or reduce the severity of nearly all of your symptoms rather than just masking them temporarily. Natural supplements and vitamins for menopause In our experience, women are often not aware of the power that vitamins, plants and herbal remedies have to prevent symptoms. In many cases, their strength comes from an adaptogenic effects. Certain plants and herbs can adapt to the needs of your body because they share specific molecular features with your own hormones. This can encourage hormone production, slow it down, or even mimic your own hormones depending on your body's unique needs. Here is a list of the best herbs and supplements for menopause symptoms, plus the evidence behind their effectiveness and relevant safety information. Black cohosh [Black cohosh is a plant native to North America](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/black-cohosh-for-menopause-symptom-relief/) that has been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for menopause symptoms and other women's hormonal health issues. The herb has been studied and there is a growing body of [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20085176/) that black cohosh helps to reduce symptoms of menopause, including night sweats and flashes. As one of the best natural mood enhancers for menopause, the herb helps with menopause depression and mood by boosting your serotonin levels. The herb can be taken alone or as part of a multi-herb formula. At higher dosages, side effects may include headaches and GI issues. Omega 3s New [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5481805/) shows that Omega-3 fatty acids help to ease psychological distress and depressive symptoms often suffered by menopausal and perimenopausal women. Taking a [high quality Omega-3 supplement](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/collections/daily-wellness/products/omega-3-essential-fatty-acids) also helps to reduce joint pain and protect women's heart and bone health. Magnesium Magnesium eases anxiety and sleep disturbances related to [hormonal imbalances](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/hormonal-imbalance/) in perimenopause and menopause. Magnesium also helps to improve heart health and reduce blood pressure, combat osteoporosis, and, particularly if you take magnesium citrate, help with constipation. Most women don't get enough magnesium in their diets so taking a [magnesium supplement](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/magnesium-citrate) is often key for symptom relief. Magnolia bark Magnolia bark is a powerful supplement for menopause prepared from the bark, leaves, and flowers of the houpo magnolia tree. Used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine, current [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5365644/) has found that magnolia bark is effective for helping to hot flashes, insomnia, anxiety, depression, irritability, vaginal dryness and [loss of libido during menopause](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/increase-your-libido-and-sex-drive-in-menopause/). Red clover: natural hormone replacement [Red clover](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/tea-makes-menopause-easier/) is a natural hormone replacement that acts like weak estrogens in your body. Because they complement your own, more potent, estrogens, they can help even out both erratic levels of both highs and low estrogen. According to a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22135679/) published in Obstetrics and Gynecology International, red clover also helps with other menopause-related symptoms like low libido, anxiety/depression, sleep troubles and fatigue. And there's more scientific good news: red clover's compounds relieve PMS and improve both women's heart health and the appearance of skin and hair as we age. Wild yam for menopause Wild yam extract is naturally rich in diosgenin, a plant compound structurally bioidentical to progesterone found in the body. Bringing progesterone levels back in balance will help to offset [estrogen dominance](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/estrogen-dominance/) and its related symptoms, including hot flashes and low libido. Wild yam extract may be especially helpful for hair loss in perimenopause and menopause. Chastetree berry Chastetree berry (Vitex agnus-castus) helps restore your natural ovulation and progesterone production until your body is finally ready to stop cycling altogether. If you're experiencing cramping, breast tenderness, food cravings and bloating, it's often an indication that your [progesterone levels are falling](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/menopause-and-perimenopause/progesterone-for-menopause-relief/) while estrogen is staying high. Because chasetree berry helps to gently raise your progesterone levels, it can bring these hormones back into balance and reduce symptoms. Ashwagandha: for stress and anxiety in menopause Hormonal changes in menopause can make whatever stress you have feel that much bigger by exacerbating the physical effects of stress on your body. Suddenly you have less energy, more anxiety, mood swings, and maybe even depression. Ashwagandha is one of the best herbs for stress and anxiety in menopause. Ashwagandha ranks hight among natural mood enhancers for menopause because the herb is an adaptogen\u2014another 'normalizer'\u2014which makes it a great tonic for the adrenal glands. Ashwagandha can also boost a sluggish thyroid, and it counteracts depression and makes your brain function better, especially for [memory issues due to stress](https://www.womenshealthnetwork.com/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/the-link-between-stress-and-forgetfulness/). Passionflower Used by traditional cultures to treat symptoms like irritability, anxiety, and insomnia, passion flower contains natural monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are known to have antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties. Passionflower also helps to increase levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical in the brain that induces relaxation and reduces anxiety. A study entitled \" [Passionflower in the treatment of generalized anxiety: a pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial with oxazepam](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227531401_Passionflower_in_the_treatment_of_generalized_anxiety_A_pilot_double-blind_randomized_controlled_trial_with_oxazepam),\" published in the October 2001 \"Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics\" found that passionflower was as effective as oxazepam as treating generalized anxiety disorder and had fewer side effects. Phytoestrogens fight hot flashes Many fruits and vegetables are also supercharged with \"phytoestrogens\" that are particularly beneficial to women struggling with hot flashes and other menopause symtoms. Phytoestrogens include isoflavones and lignans, two compounds that work gently with your body to recalibrate hormonal balance at the cellular level. Soybeans and foods made from soy \u2014 like tofu \u2014 are phytoestrogen-rich because they contain isoflavones. Flax seeds are another great choice because they're high in lignans. Grind up 1-3 tablespoons of flax seeds every day and add them to soups, salads and smoothies. You also get phytoestrogens in parsley, fennel, celery, garlic, onions, and all sorts of seeds, nuts and legumes. Ginseng Stress makes menopause symptoms worse \u2014 and this is where ginseng comes in. Siberian ginseng \u2014 also called \"eleuthoro\" \u2014 acts to limit excess stress-induced high cortisol levels in your system by inhibiting the cortisol-boosting enzyme C-Jun N-terminal kinase. Through this action, ginseng helps to protect your body from stress, which in turn diminishes fatigue, improves stamina and helps to regulate blood sugar. Dong quai for menstrual symptom relief Originally used in China, dong quai (Angelica sinensis) was introduced to Western medicine in 1899 and has been used ever since for treating hormonal disorders, especially those related to menstruation. Dong quai has been [shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/angelica-sinensis) to help relieve menstrual cramps and other symptoms like hormonal headache, insomnia, and moodiness. Among natural practitioners, dong quai is thought to be more effective when used in combination with black cohosh.
