I felt advanced trainingwasthe best way to sharpen my thinking.\" Asadoctoralcandidate in UConn'sNeagSchool of Education, Shriver says, he learned to thinkmore critically, torigorously analyzeinformation and to sharpen his ideas. \"Thatkind oftrainingcan help you to figure out how to allocateprogram resources in Chinaor spend time on volunteer mobilization,\" says Shriver, who today is chairman and CEOof Special Olympics and is finalizing preparations for the2005 Special Olympics World Gamesin Nagano,Japan,this February. In the more than 35years since it was started,Special Olympics hasbecome a globalorganization providing year-round sports trainingandathleticcompetition for more than one million children and adultswithintellectual disabilities in more than 150 nations. The organization also strives to help athletesrealizetheir potential and beproductive intheircommunities.

H is new book, Captive Beauty:ZooPortraitsbyFrankNoe/ker, was published earlier this yearby University ofIllinoisPress. 52 UCONN TRADITIONSFromtheforeword toCaptiveBeauty FrankNoelker's work makes a powerful statement. It is both beautiful and profoundly disturbing. Hehas captured, in this series of portraits, the very essence of the problem of zoos. Forherewe see \"wild\"animals who are no longer wild. Insome instances the wallsoftheir cageshave been skillfully painted so that, at a quickglance,they appear to be large, spacious enclosures - in their naturalhabitat,almost. Yetthe artwork, the painted trees and vines and flowers, serves only to render more heartbreaking theirstarkimprisonment. This book isnotintended asanindictment againstall zoos but rather asa plea for greater understanding of the animal beings within them.Letus hope that the day willcome when the steel-barred cage,the concrete island,and bare, sterileenclosures of all sortswillbe with for our sympathy andunderstanding, in makingthis happen.
