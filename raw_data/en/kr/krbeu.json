Discuss differences between the medical model and recovery model approaches to health care services. Discuss principles and practices of psychiatric rehabilitation (PSR) used within the recovery model. Describe who peer specialists are and what they do in VHA health care services. Explain the roles of VHA peer specialists in PSR services and the recovery process for Veteran health care service users. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Definition of Recovery SAMHSA has defined recovery from mental illnesses and substance use disorders as \"a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self - directed life, and strive to reach their full potential .\" SAMHSA has defined four major dimensions that support a life in recovery: (1)Health : Overcoming or managing one's disease(s) or symptoms \u2014for example, abstaining from use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and non -prescribed medications if one has an addiction problem \u2014and for everyone in recovery, making informed, healthy choices that support physical and emotional wellbeing . (2) Home : A stable and safe place to live. (3) Purpose : Meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or creative endeavors, and the independence, income and resources to participate in society. (4) Community : Relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Recovery involves... A process of finding and living a satisfying and meaningful life as a person defines it for himself/herself. Changing attitudes, values, feelings, goals, skills, and/or roles. Overcoming both internalized and external stigma about illness. Reclaiming a positive sense of self. An ongoing personalized journey of healing and transformation. Strengthening and reclaiming roles beyond being a health care service user in the mental health system. Actively self -managing one's life and wellness. (Harrington et al., 2011, p. 44) VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Fundamental Components of Recovery VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Fundamental Components of Recovery Self-Direction : Through autonomy and choice, individuals can take control over their own path of recovery. Through self -advocacy and making informed decisions about using available resources and supports, individuals are able to achieve a self -determined life of wellness and fulfillment. Individualized and Person -Centered : Each person's path to recovery is unique. No two people will have the exact same journey. Therefore, the treatment services and resources offered to the individual must be tailored to that individual and take into consideration the individual's unique strengths, needs, preferences, experiences, and cultural background(s). VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Fundamental Components of Recovery (Continued) Empowerment : Through self -advocacy and making informed decisions about available options, individuals are enabled to determine the path of their own recovery. Holistic : Recovery encompasses the totality of a person's life. It involves the mind, body, spirit, and community of an individual. It embraces all aspects of a person's self -determined needs, including housing, employment, education, health care, and meaningful relationships and roles in the person's community. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Fundamental Components of Recovery (Continued) Non -Linear : Recovery is not a step -by-step process but one based on continual growth, occasional setbacks, and learning from experience. Awareness of oneself, willingness to learn from past experiences, and awareness of available supportive resources can help guide an individual's recovery journey. Respect : The protection of an individual's rights is essential to recovery. A person's values, opinions, and right to make his/her own health care decisions should be honored whenever possible. Having self -respect and believing in oneself can greatly enhance the recovery process. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Fundamental Components of Recovery (Continued) Responsibility : An individual is responsible for his/her own self -care and recovery journey. Courage is key. Hope : Hope is essential to recovery. Belief that recovery is possible, that a better future can be had, is necessary in order to successfully transcend the limitations of one's current life challenges. Strengths -Based : Recovery draws on an individual's resiliencies, abilities, talents, and coping skills to ensure optimal wellness. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Fundamental Components of Recovery (Continued) Peer Support : Peer support occurs when an individual recovering from a mental illness and/or substance use disorder uses his/her lived experience in service of another individual currently living with similar health issues. Lived experience is shared, empathy is demonstrated, and hope is instilled. The comfort of knowing they are not alone and someone else has \"been there\" can help individuals transcend challenges that they are experiencing. Through this exchange of mutuality, the process of recovery is greatly enhanced and influenced for the better. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Assessment & Treatment Approaches VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Medical Model Approach to Assessment & Treatment Assessment : Identify symptoms that the person is experiencing. Use the symptoms to provide a diagnosis (ex. bipolar disorder). Goals of treatment : Reduce or eliminate the symptoms. Stabilize the person so that the person stays out of the hospital. The person remains compliant with treatment (ex. taking prescribed medication). Example treatment approaches : Prescribe medication. Refer the person for individual psychotherapy and/or group therapy. While important, the medical model approach only addresses appropriate diagnosis and symptom management of a mental illness and/or substance use disorder. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Recovery Model Approach to Assessment & Treatment The recovery model looks at symptoms of mental illnesses or substance use issues as barriers in the way of the person achieving his/her life goals. This model focuses on looking at personal strengths, individual courage, self - esteem, problem -solving skills, coping mechanisms, rehabilitation, and hope. In the recovery model, medications, psychotherapy, and other more traditional treatments still have an important role, but symptom reduction and/or management is not the end goal. The main goals are to maximize the individual's abilities and opportunities to achieve important personal goals around work, education, relationships, meaningful roles, and overall wellness. Symptom (impairment) management occurs in service of these larger life goals. Psychiatric rehabilitation (PSR) services address the dysfunctions , disabilities , and disadvantages associated with mental illnesses and/or substance use disorders. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Why should the VA health care system care about the recovery model? President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Report (2003) : Emphasized recovery from serious mental illnesses, including person -centered care, family involvement in treatment services, and peer support services. VHA Mental Health Strategic Plan (2004) : Outlined several national goals for VHA health care services, in particular a dramatic increase in recovery -oriented services. VHA remains strongly committed to this approach as reflected in its funding of new programs, services (ex. peer support services), and staff positions (e.g., local recovery coordinators; peer specialists). VHA Handbook 1160.01, Uniform Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics (2008) : States the minimum clinical requirements for VHA mental health services and notes that the mental health services must be recovery - oriented. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Definition of Psychiatric Rehabilitation (PSR) Psychiatric rehabilitation (also known as psychosocial rehabilitation) promotes recovery, full community integration, and improved quality of life for persons who have been diagnosed with any mental health and/or substance use condition that seriously impairs their ability to lead meaningful lives. Psychiatric rehabilitation services are collaborative, person -directed and individualized. These services are an essential element of the health care and human services spectrum and should be evidence -based. Psychiatric rehabilitation services focus on helping individuals develop skills and access resources needed to increase their capacity to be successful and satisfied in the living, working, learning, and social environments of their choice. (Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association, 2016) VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION PSR Goals and Values Goals Recovery Community integration Improved quality of life Values Self-determination Respect for the dignity and worth of every individual Hope Belief in the capacity of every person to learn and grow Cultural sensitivity and respect VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION PSR Principles All treatment services are tailored to the individual. The individual chooses his/her treatment goals and preferred services whenever possible. The individual collaborates in the decision -making process with his/her health care provider(s). Offered services and resources are tailored to support the individual in finding and maintaining meaningful role(s) in his/her community. The individual's strengths are assessed and optimized to support progress toward his/her goals. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION PSR Principles (Continued) Situational assessments are done to determine the skills that a person has and what (if any) accommodations or environmental modifications may be need to be made for the person to successfully function in the environments of his/her choice (Pratt et al., 2007, p. 122). Health care services are provided in an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to ensure that the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs of the individual are met and supported. Health care services should be coordinated to avoid duplication, and they should be accessible for as long as the individual needs them. PSR practitioners \"do not question the ability of someone to work but assist the individual to acquire the skills, resources, and supports necessary for success\" (Pratt et al., 2007, p. 124). VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION PSR Principles (Continued) PSR practitioners teach individuals new skills and/or help them enhance existing skills (ex. communication skills; social skills; basic living skills, etc.) needed to successfully achieve a desired goal. PSR practitioners help individuals to access accommodations needed for the individuals to function successfully in the roles and environments that they desire. PSR practitioners collaborate with the individual and his/her identified family members to support the individual's recovery process. For ongoing quality assurance purposes, PSR practitioners must continuously assess and evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions in successfully meeting health care service users' chosen goals. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Examples of PSR Services Supported Housing Supported Employment Supported Education Family Services Peer Support VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Supported Housing Integrated, community -based housing opportunities are available for individuals with mental health and/or substance use conditions. The supported housing options are self -directed, chosen by the individual, and supported by the following interventions: Available staff telephone support 24/7 for assistance in crises Financial resources (ex. assistance with money management/budgeting ) Basic needs (furnishing, supplies) Example of VHA housing resource for Veterans: VA Supported Housing (VASH) Program (Pratt et al., 2002, pp. 291, 228) VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Supported Employment Vocational rehabilitation can be an empowering benefit to individuals with mental health and/or substance use conditions. Supported employment services includes the following: Individualized job searches focused on competitive employment Services focused on the person's desired vocational goal(s) and preferences Concentrated focus on individual aptitudes Advocacy for possible accommodations if needed for the job Supports last as long as needed and desired by the individual In VHA health care services, vocational rehabilitation services are offered through the Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) Program: Transitional Work Experience \u2014Temporary job placements Supported Employment \u2014Competitive and (hopefully) permanent jobs VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Supported Education In supported education services, the focus is on assisting the individual with necessary resources and supports to help the individual consider educational pursuits as part of his/her recovery goals. Examples of VHA supported education services can include assistance with the following: GI Bill benefits Developing successful study skills Tutoring Addressing concerns regarding the roles and responsibilities of a student and stressors around returning to a classroom setting VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Family Services Family support and family wellness play an important part in an individual's system of natural supports. Examples of family services include: Psychoeducation groups \u2014Information is shared about the symptoms and treatments of mental illnesses and/or substance use conditions Behavioral problem -solving \u2014Brainstorm and work to find solutions to daily issues and crises Family support groups \u2014Families listen, share stories, and empathize with other families experiencing similar challenges Crisis management Marriage and family counseling Parenting skills groups VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Peer Support Peer support is exampled when an individual recovering from a mental health and/or substance use condition uses his/her lived experience in service of another person currently living with similar health issues. Lived experience is shared, empathy is demonstrated, and hope is instilled. Through this exchange of mutuality, the process of recovery is greatly enhanced and influenced for the better. Peer specialists are individuals with histories of persistent health issues who are successful in maintaining their recovery and are trained to use their lived experiences to help fellow health care service users with personal recovery goals. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION What do VHA peer specialists do? DO Facilitate peer support groups Share their recovery stories to engage Veterans in their own recovery process Advocate for Veteran health care service users Act as role models of recovery Provide crisis support Keep open communication with other health care professionals Work as a member of a treatment program's interdisciplinary team DON'T DO Provide psychotherapy Do other staff's jobs/fulfill other health care professionals' roles Collude with Veterans against other health care professionals Cross boundaries Support Veterans in their self- destructive and/or illegal behaviors Criticize their colleagues when meeting with Veteran health care service users VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Where do peer specialists work in the VA health care system? Acute inpatient care and long -term inpatient care mental health treatment units Compensated Work Therapy programs Community -based outpatient centers Mental Health Intensive Case Management teams (MHICM)/Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams Substance abuse treatment programs Crisis intervention teams Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Programs (PRRCs) Primary care clinics Homelessness programs Transitional residences VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION VHA Peer Specialists' Roles as PSR Practitioners Communicate a belief that a person can and will recover . \"I believe you can have the life you want to live, and I will support you in your journey to get there. I have hope for you.\" Listen. Really listen . Do not judge, dismiss, or advise. Just listen. Engage in conversations about goals, dreams, and wishes. Ask questions like, \"What would be a satisfying life for you? How can you get there? How can I help?\" Use stories to inspire . Encourage Veteran health care service users to tell their stories. Share success stories \u2014your own recovery story. Believe in the potential of each person to recover in his or her own way.

VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Scenarios for Group Discussion VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Scenario #1 You are a VHA peer specialist and meet a Veteran named Bob for the first time. During his introduction, Bob states, \"I'm a schizophrenic drug addict.\" Question : What are some recovery -oriented responses that you could give to Bob's introduction? VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Scenario #2 You are a VHA peer specialist, and Tina is a Veteran for whom you are providing individual peer support mentoring. Tina often tells you how unhappy she is with all of the rules and structure of the community residence (group home) where she currently lives. Tina tells you that she wants to live in her own apartment . When this issue is discussed in the program's interdisciplinary team meeting , you hear other team members say, \"She's not ready to live in her own place ,\" and \"She won't be able to handle it.\" Questions : (1) What are some recovery -oriented interventions that you could try with Tina in this situation? (2) What are some recovery - oriented interventions that you could try with the interdisciplinary team? VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Scenario #3 You are a VHA peer specialist who is working in a residential substance abuse treatment program. You are working with a Veteran named Jay who is staying in the program after completing a recent detox associated with his alcohol abuse. Jay is currently experiencing a lot of challenges in his personal life. His wife told him that unless Jay makes certain changes, she will file for divorce and pursue sole custody of their two young children. This could lead to legal issues for Jay around child support payments which would be difficult because Jay is currently unemployed. He recently lost his engineering job because of his substance abuse problems. He is beginning to feel more hopeless with each passing day. Jay talks to you about his concerns and wonders how you can help him . Questions : (1) What are some recovery -oriented interventions that you could try with Jay? (2) What PSR services could you refer Jay to? VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Scenario #4 Sandra is an OIF/OEF/OND Veteran. At a recent outreach event, she learned about your VHA facility's peer support services and was given your contact information as one of the facility's peer specialists. Sandra comes to see you and asks you questions about services available to women Veterans at the facility. Sandra tells you that she had not enrolled in VA health care services previously because she has been nervous about receiving care in a predominantly male health care system. She has been concerned that being in such an environment might trigger issues around her experiences of military sexual trauma. During the course of your conversation, Sandra mentions that she heard a little about the Post - 9/11 GI Bill and has thought about returning to school to study to become a therapist, but she is not sure what her GI Bill benefits include. She also wonders whether she would be a successful student since it has been years since she attended classes.
