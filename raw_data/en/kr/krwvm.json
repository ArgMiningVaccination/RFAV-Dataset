Singing bowls are be a gentle and subtle way to release stress, tap into our energetic bodies and utilise the power of harmony as a therapeutic application of Sound. The process of finding the right bowl or set of bowls is a unique and fine-tuned process that Hayley has extensive experience in working with her Sound Ceremony Students since its conception. As each Crystal Tones singing bowl is completely unique, the direct guidance of a distributor is required in order to acquire a set that works harmonically together. There is no way to customise a set as production is made each week and sells very fast, we must work with CT in order to discover what is available in any given moment that fits the criteria of bowls that you would like. A set of three alchemy bowls is likely to be anywhere from $2500-$6500 depending on the crystals and number of alchemies chosen. Below you will see the pricing structures determined by Crystal Tones. There is a $444 discount for three bowl alchemy sets. Finding your own Sound Bowl Healing Set...

She offers a FREE 15-minute Crystal Singing Bowl Consultation so she can learn a little more about what you are looking for and discuss your sound needs as well as answer any questions you may have. Then, together you will begin the process of finding your unique set. This can take a few weeks back and forth with Crystal Tones, so please remember to be patient. Further costs to be aware of are a Ballistic Case for your bowls to nest in ($159/$169 for up to 10 inch bowls), and shipping within the US is usually between $80-120. Crystal Tones will ship anywhere in the world, however you will likely need to settle the customs taxes to be paid before receiving your bowls for international orders. See our [online catalogue of the Crystal Tones alchemies](/crystal-tones-alchemy-collection). As each bowl is completely unique, know that very often Crystal Tones will create mixed alchemy bowls. In order to understand how the pricing of mixed alchemy bowls work, the bowl will be categorised according to the highest grouping (G1-G7 etc) and an Added Alchemy charge ($500/ $700 for 10 inch+) is then added to the cost of the bowl. Added Bases or Rims do not change the grouping, but simply add the extra Add On fee as per the Pricing Chart. If the bowl is considered \"Tall\" it will be the next Group above in terms of its pricing. Please know this is the pricing structure of Crystal Tones, it is not defined by us. "}
