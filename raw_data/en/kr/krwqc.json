MAHONEY Coordinator, Policy & Access, Dengue Vaccine Initiative, International Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea AMRITA CHILUWAL Fellow, International Technology Transfer Institute, Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property, University of New Hampshire School of Law, Concord, United States of America STANLEY P. KOWALSKI Professor, Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property, University of New Hampshire School of Law, Concord, United States of America Abstract This Global Challenges Report1 presents a \"global access\" fr eedom to operate de velopment against dengue hemorrhagic fever (hereinaf4 ter referred to as \"dengue\"), a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD)3 endemic to tropical regions. Developing a vaccine ag ainst dengue is challenging because there are four closely related viruses that can cause the disease. Sev4 eral vaccines are in various stages of development, includ4 ing by developing country institutions from both the public and private sector. Clinical trials are underway on five candidate vaccines with encouraging results. After an extended executive summary (Section 1) and an introduction and description of the methodology (Section 2), the report reviews the scientific basis of the various vaccines under development (Section 3). A successful vaccine should immunize against all four types, and sub4 stantial progress towards the development of such a vac4 cine has been made in the last decade. The range of vac4 cines under development include live attenuated vaccines, live chimeric virus vaccines and live recombinant, DNA and subunit vaccines. Each type comes with its own unique challenges and benefits, though live attenuated vaccines have been the most successful to date4. Se ction 4 presents the patent situation relating to six of the dengue vaccines under development. Some 10,800 pat4 ents and patent applications were found to have \"dengue\" in the abstract, title, text or claims, corresponding to 4,500 patent families. Of these, 700 families were found to be outside the scope. Of the remaining 3,800 patent families, 55 patents or patent families were deemed pertinent to the six vaccines discussed in this report. The number of pat4 ent families related to a given vaccine ranged from five to 22. Most of these were filed in developed countries with only a small number also filed in select developing coun4 tries. Each of the patent groups occupied a well4defined space in the patent landscape, with little overlap in the specific technological field. This finding has important im4 plications for IP management strategies in that few, if any, cross4licensing deals may be required to bring any given vaccine to market. This aspect is further discussed in Sec4 tion 5 on the licensing status of the vaccines under devel4 opment. The results of this \"global access\" FTO suggest that there are few major constraints related to patents that could complicate developing4country access to the vaccines un4 der development. It should be noted that the analysis is limited to patent data and licensing information. Market considerations such as economies of scale, pricing and regulatory approval, or efficacy of the vaccine itself, are beyond its scope. Notwithstanding the relatively few pat4ents applied for or issued in developing countries, an ef4 fective transfer of productive capacity of any of the vac4 cines to developing countries would require consideration of additional elements beyond patent data. Those include regulatory requirements, issues relating to know4how, and possible access to materials, such as cell lines. The re4 port, nevertheless, identifies the state of product develop4 ment, identifies key players, and the patent and licensing status, which together facilitate the development of effec4 tive strategies, including collaborations, as appropriate. These should enable early product deployment in areas where dengue most affects people's lives and thus lead to accelerated access to dengue vaccines by those most in need. This report provides an informal guide for those wishing to better understand the important interplay of intellectual property (IP) with product development, manufacture and delivery (viz. access). It can be seen as an example of using patent information to address major global chal4 lenges, including access to medicines, and thus contribute to informed policy discussions, strategic research planning and technology transfer, and in that way, benefit humanity. 1 This report is based on a confidential \"global access\" FTO review, prepared b y bioDevelopmentsSInternational Institute, and commissioned by the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI), a consortium of the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Vaccine Access Center of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Funding for the confidenS tial FTO review was provided by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through DVI. The report has been updated, expanded and edited for public release by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in collaboS ration with both the Franklin Pierce Center for IP, University of New HampS shire School of Law, and DVI. As with any FTO review, this report provides a snapshot of the situation at present and does not constitute a legal opinion on patent infringement in relation to dengue vaccine development. The situation will evolve over time as patents are filed, issued, modified and withdrawn or licensed. The vaccine development and licensing information is current as of June 2011 and the patent information as of December 2010. The website links were last accessed in June 2012 2 An FTO opinion is a legal opinion by patent counsel, assessing whether m aking, using, or selling a specific product in a specific market is likely to infringe existing patents or other types of IP rights. The resulting informaS tion contributes to risk assessment and management strategies that may involve various options. The latter include inSlicensing, crossSlicensing, substituting technologies, \"waitingSandSseeing\", investing in workSaround technologies, abandoning a project, or acquiring the company with relevant IP assets. A \"global access\" FTO review differs from an FTO opinion in that it is a broad patent analysis without specific legal opinions as to infringement, with a specific focus on developing country \"access\". 3 See WHO resources (http://tiny.cc/4fajhw and http://tiny.cc/llebiw ) for information on dengue and http://tiny.cc/aiajhw for WHO's list of NTDs. 4 See the Dengue Vaccine Initiative's resources on http://tiny.cc/5bbjhw .

Endemic in tropical regions, an estimated 500,000 individuals are seriously affected every year by this disease, which can be fatal. For the global health community, ensuring broad access to any dengue vaccines that are developed is therefore a priority. Devel4 opment of and access to vaccines require a range of ac4 tivities, including research and development (R&D), navi4 gation of the relevant regulatory processes, manufacturing, marketing and trade, and intellectual property (IP) man4 agement. 1.2 THE DENGUE VACCINE GLOBAL ACCESS F REEDOM TO OPERATE (FTO) REVIEW A vaccine or drug is typically manufactured by the devel4 o per of the product and/or licensed to a third party for pro4 duction. In any case, the vaccine developer needs to have assembled all of the relevant IP rights (IPRs) information in order to enjoy FTO. FTO means that, for a given product or service, at a given point in time, with respect to a given market, no intellectual property or tangible property rights from any third party are infringed. The goals of this \"global access\" FTO review5 (see note at th e end of this Section) are to: 1. understand how IPRs may affect access to dengue fever vaccines in developing countries; 2. assess the ways in which some vaccine developers may be affected by IPRs and the extent of freedom they have to license their products to developing coun4 tries; and 3. evaluate the freedom of vaccine developers in devel4 oping countries to market their vaccines outside their home countries. The results presented here are based on a product decon4 struction analysis as well as patent searches that were conducted using both open and subscription4based ser4 vices. A production deconstruction analysis consists of understanding, analyzing and dissecting the technology into its components, and formulating a series of FTO ana4 lytical questions. A \"global access\" FTO review differs from a legal opinion in that a thorough legal status search of pertinent patents was not conducted. Much of the relevant information was obtained from vaccine developers through interviews. Further, possible patents applicable to future large scale production technologies are not in4 cluded; methods are still in early stages of development and will be specifically tailored to the downstream re4 quirements of the discrete vaccine technology. Five of the six vaccines considered by this analysis are still under de4 velopment, the exception being the discontinued Mahidol University/Sanofi Pasteur vaccine. 1.3 PATENT SEARCH RESULTS Some 10,800 patents and patent applications were found to have \"dengue\" in the abstract, title, text or claims, corre4 sponding to 4,500 patent families. A patent family is a group of patents/patent applications that are issued or published in various countries to protect a single invention by the same inventor(s). Of these, 700 families6 were out4 si de the scope of dengue vaccines, diagnostics or thera4 peutics. Of the remaining 3,800 patent families, merely 55 patents or patent families were deemed pertinent to the six vaccines discussed in this report. For any given vaccine, the total number of related patents ranged from five to 22. Most of these patents were only filed in developed coun4 tries, though a small number of patents were also filed in select developing countries, as shown in Table 1. Among the search databases used were WIPO PATENTSCOPE\u00ae, USPTO, esp@cenet\u00ae and Patent Storm (free of charge), and Thomson Innovation and Mi4 croPatent\u00ae (premium pay4per4view or subscription4based services). Annex A also lists the family data for the 55 relevant patent documents identified in this report with corresponding In4 ternational Patent Documentation Center (INPADOC)7 family members, as per jurisdictional codes in alphabetical order. Patents and patent applications that were identified were classified as: 1. relevant; 2. might be relevant, pending further discussion; 3. not immediately relevant, but warranting consideration within the context of future developments in dengue vaccines; and 4. definitely not relevant. Each of the patents/patent families occupies a well4defined space in the patent landscape, with little overlap in the specific technological field. This can be seen from the map in Figure 1, generated using Aureka\u00ae ThemescapeTM so ftware. It illustrates the distance between patents as well as major concentrations of patents. The number of letters is indicative of the number of patents, but, due to proximity, not all patents are visible. P\u20143 Following interviews with a variety of R&D organizations, w e eliminated most of the patents that fell into the second category. Careful analysis resulted in 55 patent families (of which many are composed mainly of patent applica4 tions) being deemed relevant to the six vaccines under development. Depending on the specific vaccine, between five and 22 patent families are of core relevance. Overall, few patents have been filed in developing countries. Table 2 lists the applicants or assignees of potentially ap4 plicable patents. Details regarding these applicants and assignees are provided in Section 3, while data on the countries in which patents have been filed are provided in the tables of Section 4. Section 5 discusses areas in which there is disagreement over the applicability of pat4ents to a given vaccine. Many of the above listed docu4 ments are patent applications that have not yet matured into issued patents. Thus, the number of applicable pat4 ents may change over time. The specific claim formulation in different jurisdictions will also likely vary due to differ4 ences in patent law, resulting in a given patent to be appli4 cable in one jurisdiction, but not necessarily in another. In addition, although we reviewed WIPO filing data and inter4 viewed many research groups and applicants, some appli4 cants may decide to enter the national phase under the PCT filing at a later time; such data have not been in4 cluded to date. Finally, new patents will be filed and pub4 lished, so that the number of patents listed in the table below will constantly evolve.

P\u20146 1.4 LICENSING A number of IP licensing agreements, covering both in4licensing o f inputs and out4licensing of products, were identified. These are discussed in Section 4. They are summarized below in Ta4 ble 3. Table 12 in Section 5 provides additional details. 1.5 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FTO REVIEW AND POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DENGUE VACCINE INITIATIVE (DVI) Overall, the results of this \"global access\" FTO review s uggest that there are relatively few major IP constraints that would complicate global deployment of any of the six types of vaccines in various stages of development. This appears to be the case for several reasons: Many of the inputs are already in the public domain. Basic technologies for developing and manufacturing vaccines are well4established, and many have been in use for well over a century. However, with the advance of biotechnol4 ogy in vaccine research, development and manufacturing, IP issues may arise, depending on the type of methodolo4 gies and materials employed. Issues stemming from the use of recombinant DNA technology are the principal ones identified in this report because these technologies en4 abled tremendous advances in vaccinology. T able 3: I P LICENSING STATUS OF THE SIX VACCINES Technology Developer InRlicensed Enabling Technology OutRlicensed Vaccine Technology Acambis/Sanofi Pasteur NonSexclusive license from NIH, possibly from the Mayo Clinic, and from St. Louis University. Acambis has exclusively licensed the ChimericVax DEN2 platform technology to Sanofi Pasteur for subsequent development. Hawaii Biotech, Inc. (now Merck & Co.) Hawaii Biotech has licensed the proprietary expression vector from GlaxoSmithKline for production of flavivirus vaccines for use with all flavivirus vaccines worldwide. Hawaii Biotech has not licensed its vaccine patents. The rights to the Hawaii Biotech, Inc. vaccine were procured by Merck & Co. in 2010. US CDC - InViragen CDC granted an exclusive license to InViragen for its DENS2 PDKS53 chimeras. InViragen has obtained an exclusive license from the CDC for a patent family. InViragen has obtained a nonSexclusive license for another patent family. InViragen has signed a manufacturing agreement with Shantha Biotechnics, Hyderabad, India. US NIH - Developing Country Manufacturers Not known. Presumably few or none. Several industrial sponsors in Asia and Brazil have been awarded nonSexclusive licenses for the rDen30 formulations, including Butantan Foundation (Brazil), Biological E (India) and Panacea Biotech (India). US WRAIR - GSK Not known. Presumably few or none. The vaccine development partnership between WRAIR and GSK is based on a Cooperative R&D Agreement (CRADA) which captures all relevant patents. CDC: US Center for Disease Control and Prevention; NIH: US National Institutes of Health; WRAIR: Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. P\u20147 The degree of overlap in terms of patents among the six m ajor vaccines is quite low, with each candidate vaccine occupying a distinct, defined area, as illustrated by Figure 1 above. The proximity of the InViragen, Acambis and NIH patent documents in the Themescape Map is not an unex4 pected result, as these technologies are all variants of the Chimeric Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccines. Neverthe4 less, each group of patents is distinct. This leads to the practical conclusion that from an IP management perspec4 tive, the commercialization of any given vaccine can take place independently of the others. The manufacturing and distribution of any of the six types of vaccines could therefore likely take place in most devel4 oping countries without the need for a license from any of the vaccine developers. This is due to the fact that, to date, few patents have been issued or filed in developing countries. Exceptions to this have been listed in Table 1 above, which lists the countries in which patents have been issued or applications filed. Table 3 only provides information about patents, and not other IP, such as trademarks, trade secrets, regulatory data or know4how. Further, the table does not include possible constraints related to access to essential materi4 als, such as cell lines, that may be required for the efficient production of the vaccine. In other words, taking the Acambis/Sanofi Pasteur vaccine as an example, any entity wishing to manufacture or commercialize the vaccine out4 side China, the Republic of Korea or the Philippines may be able to do so without a license. Notwithstanding this conclusion, which is purely based on patent rights, a man4 ufacturer might accelerate the production process and vaccine registration with a license to regulatory data and know4how. In sum, the primary issues identified in this \"global access\" FTO review include: 1. For any given technological approach to the six d engue vaccines under development, there ap4 pears to be minimal overlap, in terms of proprietary rights, with other approaches. This suggests that the patents on one vaccine technology will not ma4 terially interfere with any other vaccine technology. This is reflected in the Aureka Themescape MapManager data. For DVI, the result is that any discussions on licensing with one vaccine devel4 oper can take place independently of those with other vaccine developers. 2. Each of the entities developing the six vaccines ap4 p ears to enjoy FTO. Our findings suggest that, with respect to major IP, the developers either used their own IP or had already in4licensed from third parties. Notwithstanding this, the Lai4related technologies may merit further analysis. Specifically, the Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a repre4 sentative document, covers fundamental technolo4 gies that are potentially relevant to the current ad4 vanced phase dengue vaccine approaches em4 Biotech and Acam4 bis/Sanofi Pasteur, while US5494671 and its family members are likely to be relevant to the technolo4 gies developed by Hawaii Biotech. All late stage vaccine developers should thus consider revisiting the entire list of Lai et al. patents in order to deter4 mine whether the patents might present down4 stream constraints on their vaccines. Possible IP management approaches might include licenses or non4assertion covenants8. The Sanofi Pasteur patent application, ( US20080014219), which covers both a method of application and a kit thereof could potentially apply to all six vaccines under consideration here9. The appli4 ca tion covers dengue vaccine preparations comprising two or four dengue serotypes, as well as any kit that has any combination of any two dengue serotypes. The claims also cover any scheme that administers two serotypes (whether separate or mixed together as one unit) followed at some future date (30 days to ap4 proximately one year) by the administration of two more serotypes (whether separate or mixed together as one unit). A number of strategies could be pursued to overcome some of the potential constraints pre4 sented by this application. These could include: pat4 ent challenges based on prior art or non4obviousness arguments; the production of a kit with three sero4 types; a non4assertion covenant from Sanofi Pasteur applicable to low and middle income countries; or li4 censing. 3. The only significant potential overlap identified dur4 ing this \"global access\" FTO review was found to lie between the vaccine technologies under develop4 ment by Fiocruz and those by Acambis/Sanofi Pas4 teur. The primary concern is that the Fiocruz vac4 cine technologies (the subject of patent family as represented by WO2007051267) would overlap with the Acambis technology (ChimeriVaxTM4DEN pa tent portfolio) and thus would potentially be sub4 ject to a prior art challenge or obstructed by FTO restrictions. That is, Acambis/Sanofi Pasteur may face certain challenges because vaccine technolo4 gies under development may embody elements that could impinge on the proprietary rights of Sanofi Pasteur. As of this writing, the issue is unresolved and will likely require additional legal analysis in or4 der to delineate both the prior art and the FTO is4 sues. 4. For the six major vaccine technologies examined in this study, only a few patent applications have been P\u20148 filed in developing countries. This has been con4 f irmed through interviews with the institutions de4 veloping the vaccines. The countries in which one or more patents have been issued or filed include Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa and Vietnam. Over time, however, one would expect a trend to4 wards greater patent application filings in develop4 ing countries, and past activity should not be con4 strued as a reliable predictor of future activities. Since a number of patent applications may still en4 ter the national phase under PCT filing in develop4 ing countries, it may be advisable to regularly up4 date the \"global access\" FTO review or, at a mini4 mum, monitor the 55 patents discussed in this re4 port. In view of its above4mentioned goals and results, the study can be seen as an example of using patent information to address major global challenges, including access to med4 icines. Furthermore, its findings can contribute, among others, to inform policy discussions, strategic research planning, technology transfer, and in that way, benefit hu4 manity. 5 Since DVI is not a developer or manufacturer of vaccines, a detailed and c ostly legal FTO opinion was not required. 6 This report predominantly cites 'WO', or Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), p atent applications because when patent families are generated, the algorithm used by Derwent\u00ae typically lists WO patents. Only representative parent patents are cited, rather than entire patent families. Due to differences in international and United States (US) patent law, claims in PCT and US apS plications are often not identical. To discern the precise extent of the patent grant for any given country, an analysis of the specific patent as issued in that country would be necessary. Further, patent families are not identical in their claim structures; rather, they are related via lineage to a common filing. This limitation does not materially affect the conclusions of this report, alS though it would have a direct bearing on the number of patents to be licensed within a patent family, which would typically originate from the same licenS sor. 7 The I n ternational Patent Documentation Center (INPADOC), is an internaS tional patent collection. The database is produced and maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). It contains patent families and legal status information, and is updated weekly (http://tiny.cc/2nbjhw ). 8 Krattiger A., T he Use of Nonassertion Covenants: A Tool to Facilitate Humanitarian Licensing, Manage Liability, and Foster Global Access , IntelS lectual Property Management in Health and Agricultural Innovation: A Handbook of Best Practices (eds.

P\u20149 Section 2: Background of the Study and Methodologies 2.1 INTRODUCTION Dengue is an acute febrile disease that afflicts children a nd young adults. It is endemic in tropical regions, where it affects an estimated 500,000 people every year. Symp4 toms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nau4 sea, rash, and vomiting; they can progress to bloody stools, bloody urine, dehydration, shock, and death. The development and dissemination of vaccines for dengue is therefore a priority for the global health community. For a vaccine to be created and made available, a range of activities are necessary, including research and devel4 opment (R&D), navigation of the relevant regulatory sys4 tems, IP management, manufacturing, marketing, and trade. Within the context of IP management, there are three principal elements: 1. In4licensing of technologies related to the vaccine and its manufacture; 2. Protecting new inventions, including the protection of trademarks and know4how, as appropriate; and 3. Out4licensing of the vaccine and production process to manufacturers. Typically, a vaccine or drug is either manufactured by the developer of the product and/or licensed to a third party for production. In any case, the manufacturer needs to have \"assembled\" all of the IP required in order to have FTO10. Fo r instance, third party manufacturers will need to obtain licenses that cover the developer's IPRs as well as the IPRs of others; ideally, the developer would be in a posi4 tion to offer a master license that includes all relevant IPRs. Ensuring FTO is an ongoing process, since the pat4 ent landscape changes as new patents are issued and old ones expire. FTOs are typically initiated before significant resources have been spent on manufacturing or commer4 cialization, and they are regularly updated. This approach provides for the early identification of key patent holders and it facilitates early licensing discussions or the imple4 mentation of alternative strategies. 2.2 OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY: A \"GLOBAL ACCESS\" FTO This study was carried out for the Pediatric Dengue Vac4 c ine Initiative (PDVI), now called the Dengue Vaccine Ini4 tiative (DVI), which is concerned with global access to den4gue vaccines. DVI is seeking a clearer understanding of the probable development of both the market and the IP landscape, both of which will influence licensing between vaccine developers and manufacturers, especially in de4 veloping countries. As DVI is neither a developer nor manufacturer of vaccines, a detailed and costly legal FTO opinion is not necessary. A \"global access\" FTO, how4 ever, provides DVI with a valuable strategic input allowing it to define appropriate partnership strategies and strength4 ening its position when negotiating with the vaccine devel4 opers. The objective, of this \"global access\" FTO, therefore, is: to understand how IPRs may affect access to den4 gue vaccines in developing countries; to assess how some of the companies that are de4 veloping vaccines will be affected by IPRs and what freedom they have to license the product in the event they need a manufacturing partner; and to evaluate the freedom of vaccine developers in developing countries to market their vaccines out4 side their home countries. For reasons related to patent searches, the vaccines un4 der development were classified into six different tech4 nologies or approaches (see Sections 3.1 to 3.6 for a brief description of each): 1. Traditional live attenuated vaccines; 2. 5. Recombinant dengue virus protein vaccines; and 6. DNA vaccines. 2.3 METHODOLOGIES Scientific and technical literature review The authors reviewed the relevant scientific literature, to4 gether with pertinent reports supplied by DVI. This en4 abled them to identify the principal scientific and technical strategies being pursued by each vaccine developer and the key components of the various vaccines. It should be noted that the specific laboratory protocols were not re4 viewed and the planned large4scale production methods were not analyzed. This would have been premature and would have exceeded the scope of this review. Deconstruction of the vaccines under development Following the scientific and technical review, each of the main candidate vaccines was deconstructed, leading to the creation of a list of the vaccine component parts. P\u201410 It was assumed that the various entities developing the v accines under consideration have the appropriate com4 mercial licenses for the enabling technologies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction enzymes, reverse genetics, genetic constructs, promoters, plasmids, various molecular technologies and transformation tech4 nologies. Patent searches Based on the deconstruction of each of the candidate vac4 cines, searches for relevant patents were conducted using a combination of readily available patent databases, Among the search databases used, WIPO PATENTSCOPE\u00ae, USPTO, esp@cenet\u00ae and Patent Storm were free of charge, and Thomson Innovation and MicroPatent\u00ae were premium pay4per4view or subscription4 based services. A subscription to Aureka\u00ae was also made for this review, which was instrumental in developing the three4dimensional results in Section 4. An iterative, re4 dundant patent search was also conducted to ensure that no major patents or patent applications would be missed. Patent mapping with Aureka ThemeScape MapManager Mapping programs such as Themescape parses docu4 ments and statistically analyzes the key terms, or topics, that those documents have in common. This tool draws on US (United States), DE (Germany), EP (European Pat4 ent), GB (United Kingdom), and WO (PCT applications 4 WIPO) data. Aureka Themescape11 is a text mining tool that ana4 ly zes text in large sets of documents and creates an over4 view of the subject matter. The analysis is faster and iden4 tifies more subject categories than could reasonably be accomplished by a human reader. In addition, results are condensed into a visual representation of the topics that can be further investigated. Based on the topics in patent documents, Aureka ThemeScape creates interactive, self4organizing content maps that visually provide an overview of patent portfolios while also representing the conceptual relationships among the patent documents. The program identifies the relevant key themes (coordinately expressed topics) and then visually portrays them and their relationship to each other on a contour map. The Aureka ThemeScape map function thus transforms a set of patent documents into a topographical landscape, based on its assessment of a range of categories, themes, and concepts. By showing where patents exist in relation to other pat4 ents, this geographic, big picture view facilitates identifica4 tion of areas of potential overlap and enables the reader to compare the concentration of efforts within the given tech4nology space. See Annex B for additional, detailed infor4 mation regarding the Aureka Themescape . Aureka patent maps for patents related to the six types of advanced stage dengue vaccine technologies were generated based on the 55 patents/patent families deemed most likely to be relevant. Interviews Once the key patents had been identified and mapped, the authors interviewed a range of individuals from institutions (both public and private) that were either working on the development of the vaccines or that had out4licensed rele4 vant technologies to be developed. Institutions included Acambis, Biological E, Bio4Manguinhos, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hawaii Biotech, Inc./Merck & Co, InViragen, National Institutes of Health, Panacea, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative, Sanofi (formerly Sanofi Aventis), and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The first and last authors of this report also visited Butantan, Fiocruz, and the International Vaccine Institute. These interviews allowed the authors to more accurately analyze the relevance of the identified patents and to clarify specific issues. As part of the interviews, the licensing status of each patent was discussed to the fullest possible extent. 2.4 IMPORTANT REMARKS & LIMITATIONS O N THE MEANING OF THE RESULTS The results of the patent searches are provided in two f orms. First, in Section 3, the primary patents identified for each of the technologies and/or inventors and/or research groups are presented. Second , in Section 4, the relevant patents for each of the products under development are discussed. In Section 3, for purposes of clarity, generally only one representative patent was listed, based on a given priority date (as opposed to listing entire patent families, such as Derwent\u00ae World Patent Index or INPADOC patent fami4 lies). Due to the complexities of patent prosecution that often follows a priority document, redundancy with over4 lapping US patents, applications, and PCT applications was allowed in order to avoid excess, undue and/or over4 zealous stringency in terms of data inclusion. This ap4 proach permits a workable balance, and allows for crisper conclusions but may lead to the exclusion of a small num4 ber of patents. Nevertheless, this approach is practical and reflective of the reality that if a license is required for one patent of a given family, negotiations with the same entity are likely to be conducted. Hence, patents that may have been omitted from this study are likely to be included should licensing negotiations be initiated at a later date. P\u201411 The results presented in this study only include partial v accine production methodology patents, as most large scale production methods are still in the early stages of development, and/or will be specifically tailored to the downstream requirements of the discrete dengue vaccine technological approaches. For instance, recombinant pro4 tein will differ from chimeric viral vaccines in terms of pro4 duction specifics and scale4up requirements. Hence an update of this \"global access\" FTO will have to be con4 ducted at some appropriate stage in the future. In several instances, patents and/or patent applications have been identified that could have broad applicability to all of the dengue vaccine technologies currently in the late production stage and/or clinical trial pipeline. Identified patents and patent applications were initially classified as given in Table 4. Following interviews with the various R&D groups, we were able to eliminate most patents in group 2. Many of the patent documents listed in this report are pub4 lished patent applications. During the patent prosecution process, claims are subject to change at the PCT or na4 tional level. Hence, many claims as written in the patent applications may not be included in issued patents. The re4sult of this would be that fewer patents might be appli4 cable than identified at this stage. Issued patents and published applications in various coun4 tries around the world are also listed. Such data was iden4 tified either by searching national or PCT databases. There is a delay of approximately 30 months between PCT and national filing. Therefore, we expect more patents to have entered, or to be entering, the national phase in vari4 ous countries. Our interviews with the inventor institutions allowed us to reduce such uncertainties. Although assignees are listed in patents and patent appli4 cations, this does not necessarily mean that these are cur4 rently the entities holding rights to issue licenses. Our in4 terviews allowed us to ascertain licensor information, which is provided in the relevant sections. Some patents may not need to be licensed because they will expire or have expired before commercialization (e.g., JP1120285, with the application date of November 5, 1987). Where EP is listed, it is important to note that this may include any of the countries that are members of the Euro4 pean Patent Organization (EPO). Finally, we predominantly cite WO (i.e. patent applications under PCT) because these numbers and website links concurrently provide national phase information of rele4 vance. Due to different patent statutes and patent laws, claims in the US and PCT application are generally not identical. Hence, in order to precisely know the extent of the patent grant for a given country, it would be necessary to analyze the patent as issued in a given jurisdiction of interest. Patent families are not identical in terms of claim structure; they are related via lineage to a common filing. We do not believe that this limitation materially or substan4 tially affects the conclusions of this report. P\u201412 Table 4: C LASSIFICATION OF PATENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR RELEVANCE TO A GIVEN PRODUCT 1. Patents and/or patent applications that appear to be relevant, even \"core\" to the analysis, and must therefore be carefully considered; 2. Patents and/or patent applications that might be relevant, pending further discussions with specific dengue vaccine development groups and leaders; 3. Patents and/or patent applications that do not appear to be immediately relevant, but should be considered within the context of future developments in dengue vaccines; and 4. Patents that are definitely not relevant. 10 F TO means that, for a given product or service, at a given point in time, with respect to a given market, no intellectual property or tangible property rights from any third party are infringed. Tangible property limitations may also arise through material transfer agreements on materials used in the deS velopment of a product. \"Assemble\" in this context means to have inS licensed, crossSlicensed, or otherwise obtained rights to a particular IP or set of IP protected properties.

A viral vaccine produced via this route offers several distinct advantages, such as durable humoral and cellular immune responses that have a broad antigenic response to both structural and non4structural viral proteins (anti4 gens). However, there are at least some theoretical con4 cerns (see below). This classic virology4approach has been the workhorse of vaccine development for over a century. For example, more than 60 zears ago, the polio vaccine, for example, was developed via passage through monkeys, and Albert B. Sabin produced a workable dengue vaccine via pas4 sage in mouse brain. In the case of dengue, a more reliable method for produc4 tion of a live attenuated vaccine has been via serial pas4 sage through cell lines (e.g., primary dog kidney (PDK) cells certified as vaccine substrate). This useful method was discovered by Scott Halstead while at the University of Hawaii. With each viral passage, there is a probability of an attenuating point mutation arising in the viral ge4 nomes (virions) which are cultured in foreign host cells (e.g., PDK cells). Used to screen and evaluate the biological properties of the virus after a series of (typically 10) passages, markers of attenuation include: temperature4restricted replication; small plaque and growth in human monocytes. Vaccine candidates are typically identified at passages ranging from 10 to 50. A concern with traditional live attenuated viruses includes the possibility of such a virus reverting to a virulent, wild4 type phenotype, which is a theoretical yet a potentially very serious event. This could occur, for example, if there were a recombination between viruses that constitute the tetra4 valent mix. An additional concern with these tetravalent vaccines is viral or immune interference between sero4 types.

This vaccine was developed by con4 ventional serial passages through PDK cells. The primary sequence of the attenuated strain is known, but the mo4 lecular basis for attenuation is not known. This vaccine candidate encountered problems at the clinical trials phase. A tetravalent vaccine candidate has also been developed at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and licensed to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). This vaccine was developed by conventional passage techniques, via multi4 ple passages through PDK cells with a final passage through fetal rhesus lung (FRhl) cells. The primary se4 quence of the attenuated strain is known, but the molecu4 lar basis for attenuation is not known. The vaccine is in phase II clinical trials.

The backbone (platform) sequence is either se4 lected from a well4characterized attenuated vaccine (e.g., uses YFV derived via genetic engi4 (e.g., NIH the genetically engi4 neered attenuated rDen130 virus). The chimeric virus constitutes the vaccine: it combines a required attenuation phenotype with expression of the target antigens, thus the best of both worlds. Chimeric live attenuated vaccines have been developed by one of two broad routes. Chimeras are built in such a way that they are either: 1. heterologous (comprised of both dengue and non4 dengue viral segments); or 2. homologous (comprised of dengue genomic viral segments derived from different strains/serotypes). A distinct advantage of genetically engineered chimeric live attenuated vaccines over traditional live attenuated vaccines is the precision of their construction. Tetravalent chimeric vaccine formulations are assembled with stan4 dardized attenuated backbone sequences. This eliminates the theoretical possibility associated with traditional vac4 cines of reversion via intra4vaccine/viral genetic recombi4P\u201416 nation. In addition, chimeric vaccines may reduce the po4 te ntial for viral or immune interference among serotypes.

To develop a tetravalent formulation, the prM and E genes from the four dengue serotypes were used to construct four chimeric viral vaccines, with DENV4144 cloned into the platform construct. These vaccines are replication competent, genetically stable, and do not be4 come more neurovirulent upon 20 passages in Vero cells. Acambis has exclusively licensed the ChimeriVax4DEN2 platform technology to Sanofi Pasteur for subsequent de4 velopment. Acambis obtained two, nonexclusive licenses from NIH to practice the technologies covered by the Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a representative document. The Washington and St. Louis Universities in St. Louis, Missouri, and Acambis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have licensed these technologies to Aventis Pasteur, Lyon (YFV [17D] backbone: ChimeriVaxD2). The original these licensed technologies was St. Louis Uni4 versity, which granted an exclusive license to Acambis, which was then exclusively sub4licensed to Sanofi Pasteur along with the entire package of Acambis patents. At the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huang, Kinney, and colleagues have developed a dengue4dengue homologous chimera. This chimera was produced via cloning the prM/E genes of DENV41, 3, and 4 into the DENV42 16681 PDK453 virus backbone (originally from Mahidol University, Thailand). Subsequent develop4 ment of the DEN41, 3 and 4 chimeras has been pursued by a collaborative effort involving the CDC and Mahidol University. It appears that this research has substantially moved to InViragen (Fort Collins, Colorado). In 2006, the CDC granted InViragen an exclusive license to its DEN42 PDK453 chimeras. In InViragen with Shantha Biotechnics in Hydera4 bad, India. At the US Department of Health/NIH, Whitehead and col4 leagues have taken a different approach. Using reverse genetic engineering methodologies, they have developed an attenuated virus (e.g., rDen430). Attenuation was achieved by the introduction of non4lethal deletions into the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Although these products have demonstrated immunogenic potential per se, they are not entirely suitable as vaccine candidates. Whereas rDen130 and rDen430 appear to be suitable compo4 nents for the candidate tetravalent vaccine, rDen230 and rDen330 have been further genetically engineered into chimeric constructs (rDen2/430, rDen3/430) in order to confer suitable attenuation for vaccine development. Hence, the rDen430 strain has been utilized as the back4 bone for the assembly of recombinant attenuated dengue4 dengue chimeric vaccine candidates containing the 304 nucleotide deletion and the prM/E genes of DEN1, 2, and 3. These vaccine candidates were determined to be at4 tenuated and immunogenic in monkeys. Several industrial sponsors in Asia and Brazil have been awarded nonexclu4 sive licenses for the rDen430 formulations. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also de4 veloped a chimeric virus. In this case, the DEN 244 prM and E genes were inserted into a DEN41 backbone at4 tenuated by replacing three nucleotides in the terminal 3' stem structure (DEN2mutF).

In brief, the technological steps of reverse genetics are: 1. Synthesis of full length cDNA of the flaviviral genomic RNA; 2. Modification of the cDNA via molecular engineering; 3. Re4derivation of RNA from transfected cells; and 4. Derivation of infectious particles when the resulting RNA is transfected into permissive Vero cells. An important advantage of this approach over traditional passage attenuation methodologies is precision. Instead of random mutations, which might arise in the critical E4 protein (antigenic determinant regions), reverse genetics technology provides the tools whereby mutations can be rationally designed and developed, conferring attenuation while retaining immunogenicity.

The molecular attenuation of the dengue virus by in4 troducing selected mutations/deletions; 2. The insertion of dengue structural into the genomic a classically attenuated dengue (see chimeric and 3. The insertion of prM/E into the genomic backbone of the yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine strain as a vector (see chimeric vaccines). A group led by Dr. Stephen Whitehead at the US NIAID has produced a recombinant dengue virus that harbors a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3' non4coding region for each of the four serotypes (the rDen130, rDen230, rDen330, and rDen430 viruses). Using modern genetic P\u201420 engineering technology (reverse genetics), presumed p athogenic viral genomic sequences were removed, and these were then developed into clones of the engineered virus capable of replication in Vero cell4lines. These have been used directly as vaccine candidates, or as compo4 nents of chimeric constructs (see chimeric vaccines). Al4 though they have demonstrated immunogenic potential per se, they are not entirely suitable as vaccine candidates. Whereas rDen130 and rDen430 appear to be suitable components for the candidate tetravalent vaccine, rDen230 and rDen330 have been further genetically engineered into chimeric constructs (rDen2/430, rDen3/430) in order to confer suitable attenuation for vaccine development. Researchers at the US FDA (Markoff and colleagues) have introduced several mutations into the stem and loop structure of the terminus of the 3' untranslated region of the viral genome to produce a molecularly engineered at4 tenuated virus (DEN2mutF). Although replication is defec4 tive in mosquito cell lines, this mutant replicates well in monkey cells and is both attenuated and immunogenic in challenged monkeys.

In other words, the protein P\u201422 itself constitutes the vaccine. In general, the humoral im4 m une response for these vaccines tends to predominate over cellular response: most protein4based vaccines for4 mulated with adjuvant primarily stimulate CD4 cells, which elicit B cell differentiation and antibody synthesis and not the CD8 cytotoxic T4cell response. Hence, recombinant protein vaccines share many, if not all, of the limitations of inactivated DENV vaccines.

(now owned by Merck & Co.) have developed a recombinant, subunit, tetravalent vaccine for the dengue virus. Produced in Drosophila cells (Drosophila S2 expression system which maintains glyco4 sylation and tertiary conformation), the vaccine is com4 posed of fusion proteins. Four truncated dengue serotype subunit proteins (the NH24terminal 80% of the are joined to the complete NS1 protein of DEN3. The ex4 pressed proteins maintain the native tertiary structure criti4 cal for generating an immune response. Furthermore, the recombinant proteins do not seem to interfere with each other when given in combination (in contrast to live4 attenuated vaccine candidates). The Drosophila S2 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), are in the public domain. The vaccine is formu4 lated in proprietary adjuvant (GPI40100), among others. The specific adjuvant for the commercial product has not been determined as yet. Hawaii Biotech maintains the patent family, of which US6080725 is a representative document, on this adjuvant. These patents were acquired via the Advantogen merger. However, they subsequently switched to alum as the adjuvant. Led by Mune and Guzman, a group working at the Center f or Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana, Cu4 ba, has developed a recombinant truncated E protein of the Den 4 virus expressed in Pichia pastoris . Although immunogenic, this antigen provided only partial protection in challenged monkeys. In addition, structural subunits of the DEN E protein have been fused to the meningococcal P64k carrier protein to produce a bacterial ( E. coli ) expres4 sion system. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Putnak, Eckels, and colleagues at the WRAIR conducted experiments to pro4 duce dengue virus structural baculovirus (Baculovirus/Sf9) sys4 tem. DEN41 virus envelope glyocoproteins expressed in this system elicited an immune response in challenged mice. Although not viruses per se, virus4like particles (VLPs) are like live viruses insofar as they stimulate and prime both B4 cell differentiation and antibody synthesis, as well as the cytotoxic T4cell response. VLPs consist of viral structural proteins (prM/M and E) that are self4assembled into poly4 meric particles in recombinant cell cultures. Primarily worked on by Konishi and colleagues, VLPs have mostly been developed for potential vaccine strategies against West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, and tick4borne encephalitis, with the dengue genome functioning as the carrier backbone in (or platform of) the hybrid constructs.

Cellular protein machinery then synthesizes antigens encoded by the vaccine plasmid: in other words, a DNA vaccine ex4 presses its antigen4coding sequences intra4cellularly. DNA vaccines, therefore, are dynamic agents, more akin to live viral vaccines than to non4replicating vaccines such as purified inactivated viruses or protein antigens. Since its discovery and introduction in the early 1990s, DNA vaccine technology has been studied extensively in various infectious diseases. It has been shown to be ef4 fective in several virus systems (HIV, hepatitis B, rabies, influenza). DNA vaccines stimulate both long4term cell4 mediated and humoral immune responses, in many cases effectively mimicking the effects of live (replicating) vac4 cines. However, since DNA vaccines drive the intra4 cellular synthesis of antigens, major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC41) antigen presentation is favored, leading to a greater cellular immune response. DNA engineering of plasmids permits significant precision in design, making the co4delivery of targeting signals and immune modulators possible, along with the specific anti4 gens that can be engineered for greater efficacy (for ex4 ample, innovatively engineered fusion proteins). Advantages of DNA vaccines include their non4replicating nature and long4term stability in storage, which would greatly facilitate distribution to remote endemic regions where cold storage facilities might be less than optimal. Also, DNA vaccines entail relatively low production costs. Furthermore, unlike live, attenuated viral vaccines, DNA vaccines cannot revert to a virulent strain. Potential disadvantages of DNA vaccines include several theoretical concerns. Immunized vaccine DNA might inte4 grate into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell, possibly leading to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, which would then lead to the development of malignancies. In addition, DNA vaccines might induce long4term immunological tolerance and also the production of anti4DNA antibodies that could contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders. However, these concerns have not been empirically demonstrated. Key Publications: Donnelly J.J., Wahren B. and Liu M.A., DNA Vaccines: Progress and Challenges, The Journal of Immunology 175:6334639 (2005). 3.6.2 Relevance for and Status of DNA Dengue Vaccines Although several groups around the world have conducted a t least preliminary, laboratory research on DNA vaccines for dengue, only two identified research groups appear to be involved in the development of a dengue DNA vaccine that has the potential to progress to clinical trials. First, the group led by Raviprakash at the US Naval Medi4 cal Research Center, has used DNA shuffling and screen4 ing technologies to produce chimeric DNA constructs ex4 pressing antigens from all four dengue serotypes. Several of have been evaluated in rhesus macaque . Vacci4 nated monkeys developed antibodies that neutralized all four dengue serotypes in vitro. When challenged with live dengue41 or dengue42 virus, partial protection against dengue41 was observed. Second , the group of Konishi, Kosugi and Imoto, from Ko4 be University School of Medicine, Japan, has developed a dengue tetravalent DNA vaccine consisting of plasmids expressing pre4membrane and envelope genes of each of four serotypes of dengue viruses. Mice, immunized twice with the tetravalent vaccine, developed neutralizing anti4 bodies against all serotypes, with no interference among the four components included in this combination vaccine. P\u201425 Hence, as these studies have demonstrated, it is theoreti4 c ally possible to generate a DNA vaccine wherein the plasmid construct would code for a chimeric protein that expresses antigenic sites for each of the four dengue sero4 types, making it essentially a tretravalent vaccine. The stability of the DNA vaccines could greatly facilitate their distribution to low4income countries where cold storage capabilities might be less than optimal. Such countries are also predominant in the geographic regions where dengue is endemic. All DNA vaccines still appear to be in the preclinical stages of development. Studies have been conducted in mice and monkeys.

P\u201427 Section 4: Patent Activity Analysis 4.1 INTRODUCTION: OVERALL DENGUE VACCINE PATENTS Our search of dengue patents yielded a list of nearly 3,800 patent families with dengue in the abstract, title, or text of the patent applications or issued patents in the United States of America. Figure 2 shows the resulting landscape, with patents related to vaccines highlighted in white dots. The concentrations of the patents related to the six prod4 ucts are overwhelmingly in the north/northeastern area. An analysis of the outliers (western and southern area) shows that these are either related to diagnostics or adju4 vants, or as in the case of the southwestern area, to live DNA vaccines. Annex C provides figures of the full dengue landscape of nearly 3,800 patents with those patents highlighted which we deemed related to the Acambis, InViragen, and Hawaii Biotech products. They show that all relevant patents are indeed in the northeastern corner. The Aureka Themes4 cape figures presented here (Figure 2) represent mag4 nifications of this region. Of the nearly 3,800 patent families considered, only about 225 fall within the broad area of the six products under development. Based on a detailed analysis of each of these 225 patents, 107 patents or patent families could be eliminated as they were not deemed relevant to any of the six products under development. Figure 2: P ATENT LANDSCAPE RESULTING FROM A SEARCH FOR DENGUERRELATED PATENTS WITH THOSE FOR DENGUE VACCINE HIGHLIGHTED (WHITE DOTS) P\u201428 The remaining 118 patents/patent families were further a nalyzed and subsequent telephone interviews with den4 gue vaccine specialists and/or developers allowed for the elimination of a remaining group of 63 patents/patent ap4 plications. These 63 are listed in Table 5 below and Annex D provides the same list of patents with relevant annota4 tions as to why they were eliminated. There remained therefore 55 patents or patent families (consisting of both issued patents and patent applications) and PCT applications that were deemed relevant to the six advanced stage dengue vaccine technologies considered as part of this study. The summary is provided in Table 1, presented in Section 1, Executive Summary. As noted earlier, the entire patent families are not listed; for many of the patents or patent applications listed here, one or all related patents of the same family are also deemed not relevant. 4.2 ACAMBIS/SANOFI PASTEUR: YELLOW F EVERRDENGUE CHIMERA VACCINE Figure 3 shows patents/patent applications by \"Acam4 b is\" (Assignee) and/or \"Monath\" (Inventor) highlighted in white dots. Note that major activity is in the northern, and predominantly northwestern, ridges. This area has a par4 tial overlap with the Whitehead and NIH activities. Table 6 provides the patent details. Further, the total num4 ber of patent documents listed in the following tables is 63, more than the above4mentioned total of 55. This is due to the fact that two patents, namely US20080014219 (the Sanofi Pasteur patent) and US6676936 (one of the Lai et al. patents) potentially apply to more than one vaccine. The concentrations of the patents related to the six prod4 ucts under development are overwhelmingly in the north4 ern and northeastern area of the landscape.

This applies to all tables in this Section. P\u201444 Section 5: Licensing Status and Discussion 5.1 OVERVIEW The results of this \"global access\" FTO suggest that there a re few major IP constraints that would complicate, from an IP perspective, developing4country access to the six major vaccines that are in late4stage development. This appears to be the case for several reasons: First, many of the inputs were already in the public do4 main. Second , the degree of overlap, in terms of proprietary rights, among the six major vaccines appears to be mini4 mal, with each candidate occupying a defined area; the Aureka\u00ae ThemescapeTM figures in this \"global access\" FT O lend support to this observation. Third, the technological approaches of third party dengue vaccine developers do not appear to overlap with those of the six major vaccine developers. For example, the Cuban (Guzman et al.) patents that disclose recombinant dengue protein vaccines are not applicable to the Hawaii Biotech vaccines, as they cover fusion protein constructs (Hawaii Biotech patents are for truncated dengue protein con4 structs). IPRs of other vaccine approaches, such as of DNA vaccines, are quite irrelevant here since there is es4 sentially no technological overlap. Basic technologies for developing and manufacturing vac4 cines are well established; many have been in use for well over a century and fall squarely into the public domain. These technologies should not pose IP constraints and would not require licensing or other IP4access strategies such as non4assertion covenants. However, with the ad4 vance of biotechnology in vaccine research, development, and manufacture, IP issues may possibly arise, depending on the type of methodologies and materials employed. A brief examination of the principal dengue vaccine tech4 nologies follows, with an emphasis on the technological inputs that might pose proprietary questions. The knownlicensing information is set forth in the below sections. It is important to note that the NIH, Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a representative document, covers fundamental technologies potentially relevant to the cur4 rent advanced4phase dengue vaccine approaches (WRAIR, Hawaii Biotech, Acamis/Sanofi Pasteur, NIH). Another Lai et al. patent family (represented by US5494671), is possibly relevant to the technologies de4 veloped by Hawaii Biotech; however, the expiration date of these patents may precede the actual commercial dis4 tribution of a vaccine. It is assumed that the various entities developing the vac4 cines under consideration have appropriate commercial licenses for the enabling technologies. Those include but are not limited to PCR, restriction enzymes, reverse genet4 ics, genetic constructs [promoters, plasmids], various mo4 lecular technologies, transformation technologies, and ac4 cess to proprietary cell lines as well as confidential know4 how. The licensing status is summarized in Table 12. 5.2 ACAMBIS/SANOFI PASTEUR: YELLOW F EVERRDENGUE CHIMERA VACCINE T he Acambis platform technology utilizes yel4 low fever virus (YF) 17D vaccine strain capsid and non4 structural genes to deliver the envelope gene of other fla4 viviruses as live attenuated chimeric viruses. Upstream R&D IP constraints might be associated with molecular techniques used to generate the chimeric con4 struct, e.g., polymerase chain reaction methods and re4 agents, molecular cloning technologies and related tech4 nologies. When purchased through legitimate commercial channels, these are typically accompanied by a user's li4 cense that stipulates the terms and limitations of use. Re4 verse genetics patents might also apply. 5.3 FIOCRUZ AND ACAMBIS/SANOFI P ASTEUR T here are different perspectives as to the precise situation regarding the Fiocruz chimeric dengue viral platforms. In addition, the patenting status is evolving fairly fast in this specific area. The text that follows aims at identifying the key issues that may warrant further investigation. P\u201445 Table 12: L ICENSING SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL, LATERSTAGE DENGUE VACCINE DEVELOPERS Vaccine Developer InRLicensed Enabling Technologies OutRLicensed Vaccine Technologies Acambis/Sanofi Pasteur Acambis obtained two, nonexclusive licenses from NIH to practice the technologies covered by the Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a representative document. Acambis might have obtained a license from the Mayo Clinic to practice the technologies covered in US5023171 that describes PCR geneSsplicing methodologies. The original owner of a core technology (YFV [17D] backbone: ChimeriVaxD2) was St. Louis University, which granted an exclusive license to Acambis, which was then exclusively sublicensed to Sanofi Pasteur along with the entire package of Acambis patents. Acambis has exclusively licensed the ChimeriVaxSDEN2 platform technology to Sanofi Pasteur for subsequent development. CDCSInViragen The CDC has granted an exclusive license of its DENS2 PDKS53 chimeras to InViragen. InViragen has obtained an exclusive license from the CDC for the patent US7094411, which belongs to the patent family represented by US7641909; license terms include a series of low singleSdigit royalty payments based on sales. InViragen has obtained a nonexclusive license for the patent US6676936 (the original assignee on this patent is listed as: the United States of America as represented by the Department of Health and Human Services). InViragen has signed a manufacturing agreement with Shantha Biotechnics, Hyderabad, India. Hawaii Biotech, Inc. Hawaii Biotech has licensed the proprietary expression vector from GlaxoSmithKline (for production of flavivirus vaccines) for use with all flavivirus vaccines worldwide (US6046025, US6046025). Hawaii Biotech has not licensed its vaccine patents. The rights to the Hawaii Biotech vaccine were procured by Merck & Co. in 2010. NIHSDeveloping Country Manufacturers Not known Several industrial sponsors in Asia and Brazil have been awarded nonexclusive licenses for the rDen30 formulations (US20090258036). The Butantan Foundation (Sao Paulo, Brazil) has taken a nonexclusive license for the rDen30 candidate vaccine(s) and has also received seed virus from NIAID for vaccine development. The field of use may be limited to live attenuated vaccines against dengue in humans. Said license provides exclusivity in Brazil and in the rest of Latin America. Biological E, Hyderabad, India (nonexclusive rights for commercialization) and Panacea Biotech, New Delhi, India (nonexclusive rights for commercialization) have also been awarded licenses. WRAIRSGSK Not known The vaccine development partnership between WRAIR and GSK is based on a Cooperative R&D Agreement (CRADA). This CRADA captures all relevant patents. P\u201446 Licensing status : Acambis has exclusively licensed the ChimeriVax4DEN2 platform technology to Sanofi Pas4 teur for subsequent development. On December 4, 2007, Maxygen, Inc. announced that it had licensed its proprie4 tary dengue4virus4antigen technology to Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi (formerly Sanofi Aventis). Under the terms of the agreement, Maxygen will transfer a portfolio of preclinical dengue antigens for development and worldwide commercialization of a second4generation vaccine. In addition to royalties, total event payments to Maxygen, including an upfront fee, could total $24.5 mil4 lion.16 To develop its platform, Acambis obtained two non4 exclusive licenses from NIH to practice the technologies covered by the Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a representative document. In addition, Acambis might have obtained a license from the Mayo Clinic to practice the technologies covered in US5023171 that describes PCR gene4splicing methodologies. Unanswered questions with regard to licensing status: The licensing status of any of the listed patents that are or may be relevant to the Acambis vaccine. Existence of any other IP licenses, such as for know4 how/trade secrets. International filing status of patent portfolio. Some information has been provided: PCT/US98/03894 has led to two issued patents. One is relevant: US6962708, the so4called Master ChimeriVax family; comprising backbone and capsid, YF envelope and membrane proteins nonfunctional, membrane and envelope tein of second flavivirus expressed; of admini4 stration of above chimera (where second flavivirus is JE or DEN \u00bd/3/4) to Rx to prevent JE or dengue, re4 spectively. Another application claims specific chime4 ras and therapeutic uses. Non4US patents and appli4 cations: granted in Australia, China, New Zealand, Russian Federation, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Eu4 ropean Union (opposition period ended 03/06); Re4 public of Korea (09/05). Divisional European patent applications claiming signal sequences, other than YF, to produce viable chimeras. Pending patent granting in Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Czech Republic, Hungary, Is4 rael, Japan, Mexico, Norway and Poland. 5.4 HAWAII BIOTECH/MERCK: ENVELOPE P ROTEIN SUBUNIT VACCINE Significant scientific effort has gone into the development o f the current strategy to use recombinant truncated (transmembrane domain4deleted) envelope glycoproteins (80%) expressed as soluble products in the Drosophila S2 expression system. The expressed proteins have been shown by structural studies to maintain the native tertiary structure critical for eliciting a protective immune response. Hawaii Biotech has recently hired a much4needed formula4 tion expert. The current formulation of antigens with Alhy4 drogel in phosphate4buffered saline (PBS) appears to be stable. Antigen binding is approximately 80%. No effort has been made to increase the binding. Hawaii Biotech has recognized that there is considerable work to be done to optimize the formulation. The first clinical study planned for the Hawaii Biotech den4 gue vaccine will be a phase I clinical trial, sponsored by the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, evaluating the GSK live attenuated dengue vaccine and the Hawaii Biotech recombinant vaccine administered sequentially. In this study, the two vaccines will be administered one before the other to see if priming with one and boosting with the other will improve the immunogenicity of either product given alone. It is expected that, in alternate studies, each vaccine will assume the role of both the \"prime\" and the \"boost.\" A unique and efficient manufacturing method has been developed in conjunction with Xcellerex (Marlborough, MA, United States of America). The system utilizes WAVE cell factories to expand cells to the 25 L level and a 200 L dis4 posable, plastic4lined bioreactor for final expansion and induction. The entire system is closed and disposable with the exception of the purification columns, which are re4 used. This system and method appear quite robust and readily scalable to the 1000 L level. Cycle time is 22 days at the 200 L level and an estimated 24 days at the 1000 L level. The media is a commercial, animal product-free media. The Xcellerex system appears to be very well suit4 ed to technology transfer. The downstream process in4 cludes purification by immune adsorption chromatography (IAC), viral inactivation by acidification (<pH 3.8, 24 hr), viral filtration through a 20 nanometers filter, and buffer exchange by diafiltration. After the final filtration, the mon4 ovalent material is stored at between 420 and 470 degrees Celsius. Overall, the manufacturing process is well designed and the process development very advanced. The use of IAC instead of conventional chromatographic measures was found to be essential to preserving the integrity of the terti4 ary structure of the proteins, which are partially denatured by ion exchange chromatography. The Hawaii Biotech vaccine might encounter IP constraints with regard to early R&D inputs, for example molecular technologies associated with cloning and expression of candidate gene sequences, as well as with subsequent production methodologies, such as IAC and optimization. Proprietary issues vis4\u00e04vis the Xcellerex system should not be a concern but should nonetheless be examined and P\u201447 clarified. In addition, contemplated prime boost ap4 p roaches could present IP issues, depending on the pre4 cise approach taken. The formulation appears to be han4 dled by in4house technologies; including the use of differ4 ent adjuvants. Licensing status: Hawaii Biotech has not licensed its own patents. To produce the vaccine, Hawaii Biotech has li4 censed the proprietary expression vector from Glaxo SmithKline (for production of flavivirus vaccines) for use with all flavivirus vaccines anywhere in the world. The Drosophila S2 cells, obtained from the ATCC, are in the public domain. The vaccine is formulated in proprietary adjuvant (GPI40100), among others. The specific adjuvant for the commercial product has not yet been determined. Hawaii Biotech maintains the patent family, of which US6080725 is a representative document on this adjuvant (JPI100 Saponin). These patents were acquired via the Advantogen merger in May 2006 (they were initially owned by Galenica). Hawaii Biotech has a stated strategy of pur4 suing partnerships and licensing agreements for the later stages of developments. However, they subsequently switched to alum as the adjuvant for the Hawaii Biotech vaccine. The NIH Lai et al. patent family, of which US5494671 is a representative document, has been dis4 cussed with the NIH as to the possibility of licensing, how4 ever, the technology may never be licensed if the patent expires before the Hawaii Biotech product enters the mar4 ket. The Cuban (Guzman et al.) patents that disclose re4 combinant dengue protein vaccines are not applicable be4 cause they cover fusion protein constructs (Hawaii Biotech patents are for truncated dengue protein constructs). 5.5 MAHIDOL UNIVERSITY/SANOFI PASTEUR: L IVE ATTENUATED VACCINE This vaccine candidate was developed through conven4 ti onal PDK cell passages. Techniques used to develop this type of vaccine candidate are well established, many having been in use since the early days of the last century. Cell lines used might have proprietary constraints; how4 ever, many of these are likely to be available from cell cul4 ture collections, e.g., ATCC. Sanofi Pasteur has discon4 tinued work on this vaccine. The vaccine is no longer un4 der development. 5.6 US CDCRINVIRAGEN: DENGUERDENGUE C HIMERA VACCINE The backbone (platform) sequence CDC/InViragen uses to c onstruct its vaccine is the DENV42 The VERO4Derived Vaccine Dengue serotype 53) uses the DEN42 16681 virus attenuated by serial passages on PDK cells. Sanitization of the strain was performed by purifying and transfecting viral RNA into Vero cells. The process com4 prises the following steps: 1. extracting and purifying plaque4purified LVA2 strain, e.g., DEN42 16681/PDK50 3. transfecting Vero cell, in 4. recovering of the neo4synthesized virus; and 5. purifying a VDV strain by plaque purification and op4 tionally amplifying it in host cells, especially Vero cells. The parent strain of PDK453 was a Thai virus4coded 16681 isolated by the Mahidol University/AFRIMS teams in Bangkok and passaged 53 times in primary dog kidney cells. Subsequent development of the DEN41, 3, and 4 chimeras was accomplished by a joint CDC and Mahidol University collaboration. The Vero cell technology is a well4known technology that has been used for different commercial products (in4 jectable and oral polio vaccines, rabies vaccine). In the present invention, qualified Vero cells were advanta4 geously used. This dengue4dengue homologous chimera was produced via cloning the prM/E genes of DENV41, 3, and 4 into viruses). Preliminary formulation studies have enabled InViragen to develop a unique proprietary excipient formulation that provides excellent preservation of infectivity during lyophi4 lization and after rehydration (as noted under IP, InViragen indicated that they have already filed a patent application for the relevant formulation work). Vaccine4certified WCB4 Vero cells transfected with dengue viral to Shantha in Hyderabad to develop cGMP seed stocks. With regard to potential IP constraints on the aforemen4 tioned technologies, the Vero4cell technologies (cell4 culture techniques, transfection, optimization) appear to be well established, with usage in vaccine development for a long time. The excipient formulation under consideration appears to be the property of InViragen. Hence, as with other vaccine technologies, the primary questions sur4 rounding potential IP issues relate to molecular techniques used to generate the chimeric construct, e.g., polymerase chain reaction methods and reagents, molecular cloning technologies and related technologies. When purchased through legitimate commercial channels, these are typi4 cally accompanied by a user's license that stipulates the terms and limitations of use. Reverse genetics patents might also apply Licensing status : The CDC has granted an exclusive li4P\u201448 cense to InViragen with Shantha Biotechnics, Hyderabad, India. InViragen has obtained an exclusive license from the CDC for the patent US7641909; license terms include a series of low single4digit royalty payments based on sales. In addition, InViragen has obtained a nonexclusive license for the pat4 ent US6676936 (the original assignee on this patent is listed as: the United States of America as represented by the Department of Health and Human Services). Unanswered questions with regard to licensing status: existence of any other IP licenses (such as for know4 how/trade secrets) international filing status of patent portfolio a license from CDC to InViragen and Shantha in India; nature of the relationship between InViragen and 5.7 US NIHRDEVELOPING COUNTRY M ANUFACTURERS: DENGUERDENGUE R30 CHIMERA VACCINE The 30 Dengue candidate vaccine takes advantage of m odern genetic techniques to first excise presumed path4 ogenic genetic sequences of the virus, then re4establish clones of the modified virus capable of replicating at high titers in FDA4approved Vero cell lines. The backbone (platform) sequence is the genetically engineered attenu4 ated rDen130 virus. The technological steps of reverse genetics are: 1. Synthesis of full length cDNA of the flaviviral genomic RNA; 2. Modification of the cDNA via molecular engineering; 3. Re4derivation of RNA from transfected cells; and 4. Derivation of infectious particles when the resulting RNA is transfected into permissive Vero cells. Three novel recombinant dengue type 3 (DEN3) virus vac4 cine candidates were generated from a DEN3 virus iso4 lated from a mild outbreak of dengue fever in the Sleman district of central Java in Indonesia in 1978. Antigenic chimeric viruses were prepared by replacing the mem4 brane precursor and envelope (ME) proteins of recombi4 (rDEN4) virus with those from presence (rDEN3/430(ME)) and the ab4 sence (rDEN3/4(ME)) of the 30 mutation, a 304nucleotide deletion in the 3' untranslated region generated via reverse genetics. The Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a rep4 resentative document, appear to be the dominant patents for reverse4genetics technology with regard to manipula4tion of flaviviral genomes. The Palese patent portfolio (see below) that addresses reverse4genetics technologies is likely peripheral or irrelevant; however, it has been in4 cluded in this document for the sake of completeness. The Kinney and Huang group at InViragen have sought a license to the technology in these Lai patents, as stated in the Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases (GSID) Brief: \"InViragen has secured an exclusive license from the CDC for their patent 'Avirulent, immunogenic flavivirus chimeras' (patent no. US7641909), on which Dr. Kinney and Dr. Huang are listed as co4inventors, along with Dr. Duane Gubler and others. InViragen has negotiated a series of low4cost milestone payments based on development pro4 gress, as well as low single4digit royalty payments based on any sales. In addition, InViragen has received a non4 exclusive license for the 'Chimeric and/or growth4restricted flaviviruses' patent of C.J. Lai et al. (patent no. 6184024 belonging to the family represented by US6676936)\". Reverse4genetics technologies might be covered by a se4 ries of patents (Peter Palese et al. Mt. Sinai Hospital, in4 ventors): US Patent 5166057 (Recombinant negative strand RNA virus expression systems): US Patent 5578473 (Recombinant negative strand RNA virus) US Patent 5820871 (Recombinant negative strand RNA virus expression systems and vaccines) US Patent 5854037 (Recombinant negative strand RNA virus expression systems and vaccines) US Patent 6544785 (Helper4free rescue of recombi4 nant negative strand 6649372 of recombi4 nant negative strand RNA virus) MedImmune (Gaithersburg, MD) has acquired the exclu4 sive worldwide rights to certain IP owned by Mount Sinai School of Medicine of New York University for reverse ge4 netics in the production of influenza vaccines. MedIm4 mune now owns or has exclusive licenses to all of the key IP for this technology. In addition, as with other vaccine technologies, the impor4 tant questions surrounding potential IP issues relate to molecular techniques used to generate the chimeric con4 struct, e.g., polymerase chain reaction methods and re4 agents, molecular cloning technologies, and related tech4 nologies. When purchased through legitimate commercial channels, these are typically accompanied by a user's li4 cense that stipulates the terms and limitations of use. Several key technological inputs should not encounter IP issues: Adjuvants are not used with any live attenuated vac4 cine (including traditional live attenuated, chimeric, P\u201449 and reverse genetically engineered) thus, IP issues a re immaterial. NIH uses Vero cell lines (Vero passage 135), certified by WHO, which are in the public domain. NIH uses the 1978 Indonesia dengue strains, which are in the public domain. Regarding downstream production, it is anticipated that production of the vaccine will employ conventional technologies that are not proprietary. Licensing status: Several industrial sponsors in Asia and Brazil have been awarded nonexclusive licenses for the rDen30 formulations. The Butantan Foundation (Sao Paulo, Brazil) has taken a nonexclusive license for the rDen30 candidate vaccine(s) and has also received seed virus from NIAID for vaccine development. It has also been licensed to three other development partners: Bio4 logical E, Hyderabad, India (nonexclusive rights for com4 mercialization), Panacea Biotech, New Delhi, India (non4 exclusive rights for commercialization) and Vabiotech of Hanoi, Vietnam. In the Federal Register, Vol. 69, No. 209, page 63162, it was officially announced on October 29, 2004, that the NIH was contemplating the grant of an exclusive license to practice the invention (US20090258036) \"Dengue Tetrava4 lent Vaccine Containing a Common 30 Nucleotide Deletion in the 3'4UTR of Dengue Types 1, 2, 3, AND 4, or Anti4 genic Chimeric Dengue Viruses 1, 2, 3, AND 5.\" This was anticipated to be a grant to the Butantan Foundation, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The field of use may be limited to live at4 tenuated vaccines against dengue in humans. The li4 censed territory was anticipated to be Brazil. The Butantan Foundation has had a draft licensing agree4 ment for some months that provides exclusivity in Brazil. It also provides exclusivity in the rest of Latin America (note that the NIH does not have patent filings outside Brazil). The license includes statements about the right to \"make, use, and sell\" a material. This control on materials pro4 vides Butantan with a form of exclusivity protecting it from competition by the Indian licensees and vice versa, i.e., the Indian licensees do not have to worry about Butantan selling in Asia (outside China). The NIH has not filed pat4 ent applications in China but it has in India. The Indian licensees have rights for Asia and not Latin America, and Butantan would have rights for Latin America and not Asia. NIH will not grant licenses to any other party. NIH has been approached by a large pharmaceutical company ask4 ing NIH to grant the company \"co4exclusive\" rights with Butantan. NIH will not do this. It is likely that once a final NIH formulation is decided on, it would not be too difficult for another company or organization to create the virus strains for the vaccine and make a copy in a country, e.g., China, where NIH does not have patent protection. The copier could not distribute the vaccine in countries where NIH has obtained patents. In sum, Butantan will get the protection it wants, and it will be the sole supplier of the NIH vaccine to countries in Latin America in the foresee4 able future. Thus, testing in Nicaragua and other Latin American countries and thereby entering the Latin Ameri4 can vaccine scene (governments, regulators, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), buyers, etc.) with the NIH dengue vaccine, is sensible. Finally, it might be important to note that Butantan is using Hansenula yeast cells, not saccharomyces or pichia. This could have a number of implications, too numerous to discuss here. Unanswered questions with regard to licensing status: What is the licensing status of patents to Butantan etc., viz: US6676936, US6676936, US20090263424, US20090258036 and WO2008022196? How are patent applications handled? What specific clauses are included in the licenses? For example, do the licenses grant automatic forward4 going IPRs related to the subject matter being li4 censed? 5.8 US WRAIRRGSK: LIVE ATTENUATED V ACCINE This vaccine was developed by conventional passage te chniques (nonproprietary) via multiple passages through PDK cells with a final passage through fetal rhesus lung (FRhl) cells (freely available in cell collections). With each viral passage, there is a probability of an attenuating point mutation arising in the foreign host cells (e.g., PDK cells). Passage techniques could be proprietary; they were de4 veloped at the University of Hawaii by Halstead. However, no issued US patents related to this technology were iden4 tified. Our research identified four PCT applications that ad4 dressed basic vaccine technologies: Dengue41 4. WO2000057910, Attenuated Dengue44 Virus Vaccine However, only three corresponding US patents were iden4 tified: 1. US6511667, Attenuated Dengue42 US6537557, Attenuated Dengue44 Virus Vaccine Subsequent conversations with WRAIR indicated that the PCT application for Attenuated Dengue41 Virus Vaccine (WO2000057908) as a US application was unsuccessful due to prior art issues. P\u201450 The relationship between WRAIR and GSK is based on a C RADA (nonexclusive license in 2000). This agreement captures all patents and applications related to this project, i.e., Live Attenuated Vaccines. The NIH Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a representative document, is possibly also applicable to this vaccine. Unanswered questions with regard to this vaccine: What is the licensing status? What is the international filing status of the portfolio? 5.9 A NOTE ABOUT THE LAI ET AL. PATENTS It is very important to note that the NIH Lai et al. patent family, of which US6676936 is a representative document, covers fundamental technologies potentially relevant to the current advanced4phase dengue vaccine approaches. In addition, another Lai et al. patent family, of which US5494671 is a representative document, is likely to be relevant to the technologies developed by Hawaii Biotech. Despite the existence of the Lai et al. patents, it was indi4 cated that the expiration date of these patents may pre4 cede the actual commercial distribution of a vaccine. However, this poses a dilemma because even if these pa4 tents expire before the commercialization of the vaccine, the methodologies used in developing the vaccine may still be protected by another active patent. For the Lai et al. patents, therefore, late4stage vaccine developers might consider reviewing the IP management approaches and determine what the potential status of their products are with regard to the various inputs. A range of options are available but discussion of these ex4 ceeds the purpose of this present report and should, in any case, be discussed internally by the various institutions. _ _______________________________________ 16 For further details visit http://tiny.cc/rgcse P\u201451 Acknowledgements T he authors would like to thank many individuals, too nu4 merous to mention, from myriad institutions, for their will4 ingness to share openly information.

This tool draws on US, DE, EP, GB, and WO data. Aureka Themescape is a text mining tool that analyzes text in large sets of documents, creating an overview of the subject matter. The analysis is faster and identifies more subject categories than could reasonably be accomplished by a human reader. In addition, results are condensed into a visual representation of the topics that can be further investigated. Based on the topics in patent documents, Aureka Themescape creates interactive, self4organizing content maps that visually provide an overview of patent portfolios while also representing the conceptual relationships among the documents. The program identifies the rele4 vant key themes (coordinately expressed topics) and then visually portrays them and their relationship to each other on a contour map. The Aureka ThemeScape Map4 Manager function thus transforms a set of patent docu4 ments into a topographical landscape, based on its as4 sessment of a range of categories, themes, and concepts. By showing where patents exist in relation to other pat4 ents, this geographic, big picture view facilitates identifica4 tion of areas of potential overlap and enables the reader to compare the concentration of efforts within the given tech4 nology space. Creation of the Themescape Map is a fourfold process: 1. Harvest Load text from document list to database Apply Stopwords Create Stems and Tokens 2. Analyze Calculate Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) Eliminate Frequent/Infrequent Used Terms Creates Topic List 1 http://www.micropat.com/static/aureka.htm 3.

Bayes' Theorem is a result in probability theory, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, a British mathemati4 cian and minister, who proved a special case of it in the 18th century. In Themescape , the Bayesian Classifier is used in combination with Vector Space Model (VSM) to derive a statistical inference. This inference updates itera4 tively estimates of the probability that classifications of a document are correct, based on relationships of the Topic List of each document to other documents in the set, as well as the knowledge of how likely those relationships are correct. The classifications are also derived from the Top4 ic List. The Bayesian Process: Reads the Topic List for each document. Uses the Bayes' Theorem to estimate the posterior probabilities of all classifications. For each word in the Topic List, a classification with highest posterior probability is chosen as the prediction. Is called na\u00efve because it originally makes the assumption that the classifications are independent of each other. P\u201462 The formal algorithm is: Let P be the Topic List, Let h be a hypothesis of relationship of a document to a word in P Let D be the set of documents. If we know: P(h), the probability of hypothesis h being correct, P(D), the probability of data set D being observed, and P(D/h), the probability of observing D, under the assumption of h being correct, then the Bayesian Theorem provides a method for calcu4 lating P(h / D), denoting the probability of h being correct, given a specific data set D. Using the Prior Probability and Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier Vector Space Modeling (VSM), the document is provisionally plotted in n4space. Next, the 'Likelihood' or Probability of the classification of Document X given Topic A and Topic B are calculated. In Bayesian analysis, the final classification is produced by combining both the Prior Probability and the Likely Probability to form the Posterior Probability.
