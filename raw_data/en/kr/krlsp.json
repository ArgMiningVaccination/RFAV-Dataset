Issue 3 FOREWORD This diverse issue presents details of malaria microscopy quality control, two long -term disease monitoring reports and two annual surveillance reports for South Africa. Light microscopy of blood smears remains the gold standard for diagnosing clinical malaria, and a recent quality assurance assessment of this method shows that malaria parasite microscopy in the Mpumalanga Province malaria control programme performs well, although there is room for skills improvement. A rare form of pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease, affects South Africa, primarily in Western Cape Province. As this disease is transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, ongoing surveil lance and improved investigation of cases is important for cluster identification, particularly during the COVID -19 pandemic when lockdown measures have resulted in closure or restricted use of buildings, thereby increasing the risk for Legionella growth i n water systems. Children and adolescents living with HIV in South Africa remain an especially vulnerable population. A report in this issue shows that major advances in paediatric HIV care, in particular retention in care and treatment adherence, will be required if South Africa is to achieve an end to the AIDS epidemic. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is used as a proxy for polio incidence. The AFP surveillance report for 2019, presented in this issue, shows that countries in the southern Afri can region, including South Africa, need to strengthen their surveillance efforts and increase routine immunization against polio. This issue also contains the GERMS -SA report for 2019. This report contains summaries of national surveillance data for labo ratory- confirmed invasive meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae , pneumococcal, Group A Streptococcal and Group B Streptococcal infections. These data are routinely collected from the enhanced surveillance sites that cover all nine of South Africa's provinc es. We trust that you will find these important reports informative and useful, and thank all contributors for their inputs. Basil Brooke, Editor 150 Volume 18. Issue 3 QUALITY CONTROL OF MALARIA MICROSCOPY SURVEILLANCE, MPUMALANGA PROVINCE MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAMME, SOUTH AFRICA, JANUARY - DECEMBER 2019 Lisa Ming Sun1, John Parasitic Diseases, NICD 2Wits Research Institute for Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg Summary The prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria is the most effective way to prevent a mild case from developing into severe disease and potentially, death. All malaria patients must be treated as soon as possible following microscopy and/ or rapid diagnostic test confirmation of malaria. Light microscopy of Giemsa- stained blood smears remains the gold standard for diagnosing clinical malaria. The South African National Malaria Quality Assurance Guidelines stipulate that microscopy results should be cross- checked for quality assurance purposes. The South African malaria control pr ogramme operates primarily in the three malaria- endemic provinces of Mpumalanga, KwaZulu- Natal and Limpopo. Malaria microscopy quality control (QC) was initiated in 2018 for the Mpumalanga provincial malaria control programme (MCP). On at least a monthly basis, smears were sent to the Parasitology Reference Laboratory (PRL) at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) for QC. Twenty percent of the received smears and any additional positive smears underwent microscopy quality control; this inc received 4 738 smears in 2019 and microscopy quality control was done on 969 of these. The majority (939) were reported as negative by the MCP. The PRL found two false positive results and three false negative results. Mpumalanga Province MCP microscopy had a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 99.8% as compared against PRL microscopy. When microscopy results were compared to PCR results, the majority of smears (94%, 781/834) microscopy and PRL PCR. This quality control exercise shows that malaria parasite microscopy in the Mpumalanga Province MCP performs well. There is however room for microscopy skills improvement within the Mpumalanga province MCP. The PRL/NICD has recommended that all provincial MCP malaria microscopists attend the Malaria Microscopy Refresher Course offered by the PRL. They will also benefit greatly from the implementation of a proper quality management system. 151 Volume 18. Issue 3 Background Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium species, and is usually transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito.1 In South Africa, human malaria is caused by four species of the Plasmodium parasite : Plasmodium falciparum; P. malariae; P. ovale and P. vivax.2 Plasmodium knowlesi is recognised as the fifth human malaria parasite2 but has not yet been reported in South Africa. Malaria is preventable and curable but if not diagnosed and treated early, can be fatal. In 2018, an estimated 228 mi llion cases of malaria occurred worldwide with 405 000 reported deaths.1 The majority of malaria cases (213 million or 93%) and deaths (94%) were in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region.1 Children aged under 5 years are the most vulnerable gr oup affected by malaria, accounting for 67% (272 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide.1 Ten percent of the population in South Africa is estimated to be at risk of contracting malaria.3 In South Africa, malaria is seasonal, occurring mainly between September and May, with cases usually peaking after the Christmas and Easter holidays.4 Over 90% of the reported malaria cases are caused by P. falciparum.4 Malaria has been a notifiable medical condition (NMC) in South Africa since 1956.5 According to South Africa's National Health Act 61 of 2003, all malaria cases should be reported within 24 hours of diagnosis.6 Light microscopy of Giemsa -stained blood smears remains the gold standard for diagnosing clinical malaria.7 Prompt diagnosis an d treatment is the most effective way to prevent a mild case of malaria from developing into severe disease and potentially, death.1 Between 2000 and 2012, South Africa reduced the burden of malaria by ~90% (64 622 vs. 6 846 cases, respectively) and mort ality by ~80% (459 vs. 91 deaths, respectively).7 In 2012, South Africa adopted a malaria elimination strategy.4 The broad objectives of the national malaria elimination strategy include strengthening case surveillance, preventing infections and eliminatin g the parasite reservoir.5 An essential component of a malaria surveillance system is the accurate parasitological diagnosis of malaria cases. The WHO Malaria Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Manual recommends that diagnosis should be made with either quality -assured malaria microscopy or WHO -recommended rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). 8 The WHO Malaria Microscopy Quality Assurance Manual states that: \"Blood film microscopy remains the only inexpensive, easily used test for direct measurement of the presence of parasites, distinguishing the infecting parasite species and providing a means of quantifying parasite load.\" 9 These attributes of malaria microscopy make it an extremely useful tool in any malaria control programme. South Africa has a decentralised malaria control programme (MCP) with activities at the provincial level. 5 The national malaria programme at the National Department of Health (NDOH) defines policies and guidelines and provides technical support to provinces. 5 The provinci al MCPs operate in the three malaria- endemic provinces of KwaZulu- Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. All malaria- positive cases are provided with treatment within 24 hours and treatment is only prescribed when cases are confirmed.5 Since 2000, all suspected malaria cases in South Africa have been confirmed using microscopy and/or RDTs.5 152 Volume 18. Issue 3 There are two broad types of malaria case surveillance activities conducted by the provincial MCPs in South Africa: passive case detection (PCD) and active case detection (ACD ). During the PCD process, patients visit health facilities and, once they are confirmed as having malaria, the health worker notifies the case as per the NMC requirements.5 Therefore PCD is detection of malaria cases among people who approach a health fac ility or a community health worker on their own initiative to seek treatment, usually related to fever.8 On the other hand, ACD locates both symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria cases, who will also be treated according to national malaria treatment guidel ines. 5 The aim of ACD surveillance is to prevent onward malaria transmission by identifying new infections and potential sources of infections. 5 ACD surveillance is further classified into reactive case detection (RACD) and proactive case detection (PACD).8 RACD is usually a response to an index case that may have been notified through the NMC process. RACD will screen for symptoms and test for malaria in the household of the index case and/or people in the community potentially linked to the index case8 (Figure 1). Figure 1. Adapted flow diagram demonstrating the general reactive case investigation and detection plan.5 PACD is triggered by the strong likelihood of malaria transmission in a defined area or among high- risk groups of people.5,8 There is usually limited access to healthcare facilities. PACD is performed regularly at specific times (mainly during the malaria transmis sion season) to confirm active local transmission in target populations and to detect malaria cases early.8 There are dedicated teams of malaria surveillance officers and case investigators working between the health facilities and the communities on a d aily basis. 5 The duties of the malaria surveillance teams include conducting malaria -related health education, taking blood smears, collecting malaria- related data in the field and assisting 153 Volume 18. Issue 3 the team leaders with conducting case investigations.5 The MCPs have malaria microscopists who work independently of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS).10 The South African National Malaria Quality Assurance Guidelines stipulate that microscopy results should be cross- checked as quality control (QC) for quality assurance purposes.11 This is required as South Africa is moving towards malaria elimination, with the target of zero locally -transmitted malaria cases.12 To assist with malaria microscopy surveillance in South Africa, the Parasitology Reference Labor atory (PRL) at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), a specialised institution of the NHLS, has assisted with the required QC for the provincial malaria control programmes. QC was initiated for Mpumalanga Province in 2018, as this MCP's slide procedures were mostly aligned to the processing QC requirements. Methods As per the routine malaria testing procedures described above for active surveillance, case investigator teams from the Mpumalanga Province MCP actively screened people who li ved with or near to a person who had tested positive for malaria. Once these people were located, the case investigators and their team members collected basic demographic information using a registry form. Blood was collected using the finger prick method with a disposable lancet, an RDT was performed (when indicated), and thick and thin blood smears were prepared on site. The forms and smears were sent to one of four testing stations in Mpumalanga Province for staining and/microscopy. The testing stat ions were located in Thulamashe and Cunningmoore in Bushbuckridge District, Masoyi in Mbombela districts and Tonga in Nkomazi District. At the testing stations, the dried blood smears were stained with Giemsa. Thin blood films were first fixed with 100% methanol. MCP microscopists then examined the blood films for Plasmodium spp. using light microscopy. Microscopy results were recorded on the forms and any positive results were communicated to the case investigators for further action. On at least a monthly basis, smears were sent to PRL/NICD with copies of the corresponding Mpumalanga Province MCP forms for microscopy QC. At NICD, smears were checked against the accompanying forms. Any missing smears or forms were noted. Twenty percent (every 5 th slide) of the received smears were then selected for QC. Any additional site positives that were not part of the 20% blinded reads were also selected for QC. Each of the selected smears was read by two microscopists independently. The thick blood smears were scann ed under 100x magnification first, then under 1000x magnification using immersion oil. At least 100 to 150 high power fields (1000x magnification) were looked at before declaring a smear negative for malaria, where possible. A third microscopy read was done if there were discrepant results between the first two microscopy reads or when compared to the microscopy results from the Mpumalanga Province MCP microscopists. All smears received were also assessed for quality macroscopically and microscopically. Qua lity areas looked at were thick smear fixing by methanol or heat, presence of a feathered edge on thin smears, presence of stain precipitate, or washing- off of the blood smears. Following microscopy and checking of any discrepant microscopy results, DNA was extracted from the blood smears and a conventional malaria multiplex PCR, which detects the four common human 154 Volume 18. Issue 3 malaria species in South Africa, was performed.13 Results were collated, analysed and reports sent to the Mpumalanga Province MCP. Results In 2019, 4 738 smears were received. Figure 2 shows the summary of the number of smears that were received by month. Nineteen batches were received (there were a few months where multiple batches were received). Due to occasional delays, smears were not always received in the month after they were completed by the province. Therefore, the number of smears received each month at NICD does not accurately reflect the number of smears done in the previous month from the Mpumalanga Province MCP. Figure 2. Numbers of malaria smears received by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases for quality control from the Mpumalanga Province malaria control programme, 2019. Of all the smears received, the Mpumalanga province MCP reported 32 (0.7%) as positive and 4 665 as negative; there were 41 smears that had missing microscopy results or missing forms. All smears received without paperwork (n=37) were assumed to be negative for the purpose of this comparison and were included in the analysis. Table 1 shows a summary of the results, comparing microscopy between the Mpumalanga Province MCP and NICD for the smears that were quality controlled.

Unfortunately, due to difficulty in interpreting the MCP forms, six smears reported by the Mpumalanga Provincial MCP as positive were accidentally discarded before microscopy QC was done. The results are explained further in Table 2. There were four cases that did have paperwork but had 'RDT positive' recorded as a mic roscopy result. For these four cases, one was confirmed as P. falciparum (1 032 p/\u00b5l) and the other three were found to be negative by microscopy QC. These results were excluded from the analysis. Table 2.

To put this in context of percentage parasitaemia, an average of 50 000 p/\u00b5l is considered 1% parasitaemia.14 Therefore, these three false negatives all had percentage parasitaemias of 0.01% or less. All slides received were also assessed for sm ear quality (Figure 3). The major problems noted were the lack of a feathered edge on the thin blood films, partial washing off of the blood films and partial autofixing of the thick blood films. 156 Volume 18. Issue 3 Figure 3 . Results of the assessment of the Mpumalanga Province malaria control programme blood smear quality, 2019. Molecular testing was initiated from slides received at NICD in March 2019. Seventeen of the 19 batches (851 slides) had PCR results available to be compared to the microscopy results and 118 slides were excluded. The majority of slides (94%, 781/834) had concordant results microscopy were quality -controlled microscopically, but accidently discarded before molecular testing could be performed. The four cases whose microscopy results were recorded as 'RDT Pos', were negative on PCR. Table 3.

Very few false positives and false negatives were detected; nevertheless, there is room for improvement of the mic roscopy skills at the testing stations. Only six of the Mpumalanga province MCP positive smears had quantitation recorded. Quantitation should be determined for all P. falciparum- positive samples. Only asexual stages (trophozoites and schizonts) should be counted, as the asexual stages of the parasite contribute to the clinical symptoms of the disease.

Issue 3 are observed, it is important to record this observation, as gametocytes (sexual stages) contribute to the ongoing transmissi on of malaria. Concerning the quality issues, we note that it is difficult to prepare perfect smears in the field, i.e. from a fingerprick and often without a table. In April 2018, case investigators were provided with slide boards to assist them in the f ield. To prevent autofixing of the thick smears, the field teams were requested to deliver the smears to the testing stations for staining in the quickest time possible. The staff at the testing stations were also trained to take care while rinsing the stain off the slides to prevent the smears from washing off. There were major issues with the completion of forms: some data were illegible, missing or filled in incorrectly. These concerns were reported to the province. They will also benefit greatly from i mplementing a proper quality management system. The NICD has requested that the batches be sent as soon as possible. Ideally, they should be sent in the month after the testing station has processed the smears. This will allow for a quicker feedback response to the province. As a preventive measure, NICD will store smears that have not undergone microscopy QC for at least six months after receipt. It is expected that more samples would be identified as positive by PCR as compared to microscopy, as PCR is generally more sensitive than microscopy at very low parasitaemias. 7 However, there were 10 NICD - confirmed microscopy -positive results that were PCR negative. Low concentration of the Plasmodium spp. DNA, the sample type that the DNA was extracted from (blood smears) or the presence of inhibitors in the sample, are possible reasons for this. It is recommended that all the MCP microscopists be given an opportunity to attend the Malaria Microscopy Refresher Training (MMRT) course offered by PRL, NICD. At the end of the course an evaluation will be conducted to determine if the malaria microscopists qualify to attend the National Competence Assessment in Malaria Microscopy (NCAMM). The NCAMM will be a formal certification of their level of skill in malaria microscopy (based on parasite detection, identification and quantification). A certificate of competence reflecting their grading (highest grade A, lowest grade D) will be awarded at the end of the NCAMM and will be valid for two years. This objective assessment of competence will be done according to the Malaria Microscopy Quality Assurance Manual (version 2) published by the World Health Organization. 9 Acknowledgements Case investigators, microscopists and other staff members of the Mpumalanga Province malaria control programme are thanked for their contribution to this malaria microscopy quality control surveillance work.

Issue 3 NOTIFIED LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE IN SOUTH AFRICA, Gottberg1,2 1 Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, NICD 2 School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa 3 Division for Public Health Surveillanc e and Response, NICD 4 Communicable Disease Control (CDC) Programme, Western Cape Department of Health, Cape Town, South Africa 5 School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Summary Legionnaires' disease is a rare form of severe pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, which is transmitted through the inhalation or aspiration of contaminated water droplets. Cases of laboratory -confirmed Legionellosis notified to the National Institute for Communicable Disease's national notifiable medical conditions (NMC) surveillance system between 1 January 2018 and 30 September 2020 are described here. During this period, 93 cases of Legionellosis were notified, with the majority (72/93, 77.4%) of cases reported from the Western Cape Province . Most cases occurred in individuals aged between 40 and 69 years (65/93, 70.0%), in males (61/93, 65.6%), and in individuals with underlying illness (52/64, 81.3%). The case- fatality ratio was 20% (15/74). Whilst difficult to ascertain the source of infection due to poorly completed case investigation forms, Legionellosis cases were largely sporadic. Ongoing surveillance and improved investigation of Legionnaires' disease cases is important for cluster identification, particularly dur ing the COVID -19 pandemic when lockdown measures have resulted in closure or restricted use of buildings, thereby increasing the risk for Legionella growth in water systems. Introduction Legionnaires' disease is a rare form of severe pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, most commonly Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Individuals typically present with an acute consolidating pneumonia, which can be radiologically and clinically indistinguishable from other aetiological causes of pneumonia. Older age ( 50 years), male gender and underlying illnesses such as chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, cancer or immunosuppression, increase an individual's susceptibility to disease. The disease is associated with severe illness and a high case- fatality ratio of 10- 15%. 1 Although Legionella spp. are ubiquitous in natural water sources, transmission predominantly occurs through the inhalation/aspiration of water droplets from man- made water systems such as industrial heating/cooling systems, plumbing systems, whirlpools and fountains which, i f not adequately managed, allow the bacteria to proliferate to high levels.2,3 Warm water temperatures (25\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C) and poor or no water flow increases the risk of growth and spread of the bacteria. 160 Volume 18. Issue 3 Approximately 20 of the more than 50 identified species have been known to be pathogenic in humans, with Legionella pneumophila identified in 90% of cases in the United States and Europe. 2,4,5 In some countries, such as Australia, Legionella longbeachae (a lso found in compost and potting soil) is predominant. Traditional diagnostic methods include culture and serology and, more recently, the urinary antigen test (only detecting L. pneumophila serogroup 1) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are being commonly used due to their improved speed and sensitivity, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.1,3,6 The prevalence of Legionnaires' disease is underestimated globally due to a lack of clinical index of suspicion and requests for testing by clinicians (who generally treat empirically for community -acquired pneumonia), inadequate diagnostic tests, and limited surveillance programmes. Many of these concerns are more marked in Africa from where data are severely limited. 7 From June 2012 to September 2014, among 1805 patients hospitalised with pneumonia and enrolled in the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) pneumonia surveillance programme, 21 (1.2%) tested positive for Legionella spp. by PCR on nasopharyngeal and/or induced sputum specimens. 8 Disease occurred predominantly in chronically ill adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or tuberculosis infection. The majority of cases were not diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease and were sub- optimally treated. In this report, cases of laboratory -confirmed Legionellosis in South Africa notified to the NMC surveillance system between 1 January 2018 and 30 September 2020 are described. Methods Legionellosis is a category 2 notifiable medical condition in South Africa, which requires notification (either paper -based or electronically) by healthcare workers to the NICD's N MC surveillance system within seven days of diagnosis. Upon notification, basic demographic and clinical information are collected. Healthcare workers are also requested to complete and submit to the NICD a Legionnaires' disease case investigation form (CI F), which collects additional information such as underlying illness and potential sources of contaminated water exposure. Patient outcome data were obtained from the CIF where it was not available in the NMC database or had changed following notification. Results From 1 January 2018 through 30 September 2020, 93 laboratory -confirmed cases of Legionellosis were notified to the NMC surveillance system; 43 (46.2%) in 2018, 25 (26.9%) in 2019 and 25 (26.9%) in 2020 (Table 1 and Figure 1). The highest number of cases were reported in February 2018 (n=7) and March 2020 (n=7). Cases were observed throughout the year, with no specific seasonality identified. The majority of cases were reported from Western Cape Province (72/93, 77.4%), although the number of provi nces reporting cases increased from 3 in 2018 to 5 in 2019 and 6 in 2020 (Figure 1). The majority of cases (81/93, 87.1%) were diagnosed by the urinary antigen test, with nine cases (9.7%) identified by PCR and three (3.2%) by serology. All Legionellosis c ases occurred in adults with the highest number observed in the 50- 59 years age group (25/93, 26.9%), and with 70% (65/93) occurring in individuals aged between 40 and 69 years (Table 1 and 161 Volume 18. Issue 3 Figure 2). The majority of cases were males (61/93, 65.6%). Among patients with known admission status, 98.8% (83/84) were hospitalised. Of 64 cases for whom the CIF was completed, 52 (81.3%) reported having 1 underlying illness and 12 (18.8%) were HIV infected. At the time of notification or completion of the CIF, 20.3 % (15/74) of individuals had died. Table 1.

Legionellosis cases notified to the national Notifiable Medical Conditions (NMC) surveillance system by age and gender, South Africa, January 2018 - 30 September 2020. Discussion During the surveillance period, 93 cases of Legionnaire's disease were notified to the NMC system. The majority of cases were reported from the Western Cape Province , likely due to increased awareness and increased availability of diagnostic testing there. It should also be noted that the drought and resulting restrictions in water use in the province over recent years may also have had an effect. The increased number of provinces notifying cases over time may represent an increased awareness of the requirement to notify cases. As is typical for Legionnaire's disease 1,9, cases occurred in adults with the majority in older adults and males with underlying 012345678 12345678910111212345678910111212345678 2018 2019 2020Number of cases Month and year group (years)Female Male 163 Volume 18. Issue 3 illness. Almost all notified cases were hospitalised individuals, and a high case fatality ratio of 20% was observed. These data are likely an underestimate of the burden of Legionnaires' disease in South Africa, and only represent cases where the disease was clinically suspected, laboratory testing was performed, and where healthcare workers notified cases to the NMC surveillance system. Most laboratories performed diagnostic testing using the urinary antigen test. While rapid and easy to use, this test only detects L. pneumophila serogroup 1 and therefore the prevalence of other Legionella species and other L. pneumophila serogroups that cause Legionellosis in South Africa are largely unknown. In a previous study from South Africa 8, patients with Legionnaires' disease were likely to be HIV -infected, or chronically ill individuals with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. Similarly, in this study >80% of individuals reported having at least one underlying illness. Although Legionnaires' disease is associated with a high mortality rate, the case fatality ratio of 20%, which is on the upper boundary of what is expected, likely represents a bias because indi viduals with severe disease are more likely to be tested for Legionellosis. Due to the poor quality of data captured during completion of the CIF, potential sources of infection could not be adequately assessed. This may be a result of the CIF being completed by healthcare workers, whereas the environmental investigation is conducted by environmental health practitioners. In addition, individuals with Legionnaires' disease are often severely ill and therefore not able to provide exposure information. Although Legionnaire's disease remains relatively rare in South Africa, it is important to diagnose and notify cases in order to identify potential clusters of disease and sources of infection for intervention. This has become increasingly important during th e coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic during which many places of work and large buildings such as hotels, offices, gyms and salons have reopened after being closed for extended periods. Closure or restricted use of buildings or parts of buildings can increase the risk for Legionella growth in water systems 10, and thereby the risk of Legionnaires' disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion (CDC)11 and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Di seases (ESCMID)12 have published guidance for the management of water systems during the COVID -19 epidemic. Individuals with Legionnellosis may present with similar signs and symptoms to COVID -19. In addition, SARS -CoV-2 and Legionella co-infection has been described13 and co- infection among patients with COVID -19 should be considered clinically as both pathogens cause more severe illness in the elderly and in males.14 Conc lusion Ongoing surveillance and improved investigation of Legionnaires' disease cases is important for cluster identification, partic ularly during the COVID -19 pandemic when lockdown measures have resulted in closure or restricted use of buildings, thereby increasing the risk for Legionella growth in water systems.

Among all children and adolescents (0- 19 years of age) with an HIV viral load, 49.7% (130 952) were virally suppressed (<50 RNA copies per millilitre [cps/ml]), <1 000 RNA cps/ml) and had a VL >1 000 RNA cps/ml . Over the past six and half years, improvement in the overall paediatric and adolescent suppression rate (<50 RNA cps/ml) has been modest at only 7.3%, although some sub- populations (<1 years and 15- 19 years) have demonstrated greater improvement than other age groups. Differences in HIV viral load suppression between males and females were apparent among all paediatric and adolescent age groups, with 51.8% of females compared with 46. 8% of males 0- 19 years of age suppressed between July 2019 and June 2020. There are considerable differences in the volume of HIV viral load testing and suppression rates among South Africa's nine provinces. Whereas KwaZulu- Natal Province has the second hi ghest viral suppression rate, it remains the province with the highest number of unsuppressed children and adolescents living with HIV. Introduction In 2014, UNAIDS launched a set of ambitious targets to accelerate the end of the AIDS epidemic, proposing that by 2020 90% of people living with HIV be diagnosed, 90% of those diagnosed be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of those on ART be virally suppressed. 1 Importantly, these goals acknowledge the need to achieve equity across diverse patient populations, including children and adolescents who have traditionally lagged behind with regards to accessing diagnosis and treatment services. Although South Africa has made great strides in reducing the vertical transmission rate to <5%, thanks to a compr ehensive Prevention of Mother -to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme 2 the absolute burden of paediatric and adolescent HIV remains high. Mathematical modelling estimates suggest more than 400 000 children and adolescents are presently living with HIV in S outh Africa. 3 This is on account of an extremely high maternal HIV prevalence, which has remained around 30% for over a decade,4 as well as a high HIV -incidence among adolescent girls and young women, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding periods.5 Hence, monitoring of the paediatric and adolescent HIV programme has been identified as an essential requirement for 166 Volume 18. Issue 3 improving overall HIV care.6 Unless effective measures to reduce the HIV infection rate amongst adolescent girls and young women are rapidly implemented, children and adolescents will remain an important population for targeted intervention in the decades to come. Routine HIV viral load data provides an opportunity to gauge programmatic outcomes, disaggregated by age and sex, whereby progress towards achieving the second and third 90- 90-90 targets can readily be assessed. Here we report on paediatric and adolescent HIV viral load monitoring within the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) between 2014 and mid- 2020. Methods HIV viral lo ad results were evaluated using rolling 12- month periods per calendar quarter, from quarter 4 (31 December) 2014 to quarter 2 (30 June) 2020. Test results were de- duplicated to represent the last viral load result per patient during each 12- month period us ing the NHLS Corporate Data Warehouse probabilistic patient - linking algorithm. The number of patients with a viral load done was used as a proxy for people on ART (viz. the second 90 target), with viral suppression rates calculated at both the <1 000 RNA c ps/ml and <50 RNA cps/ml thresholds. Results For the 12- month period between July 2019 and June 2020, 263 505 children and adolescents (aged 0- 19 years) had evidence of HIV virological monitoring in South Africa. HIV viral load testing coverage was 51% a nd 57% among children and adolescents living with HIV aged <15 years and 15- 19 years, respectively, as suggested by Thembisa Model prevalence estimates. Among all children and adolescents with an HIV viral load (VL) test, 49.7% (130 952) were virally suppr (50-<1 000 cps/ml), and 27.6% (72 774) had a VL >1 000 RNA cps/ml. Figure 1 represents the HIV viral load breakdown per age group for the 12- month period between July 2019 and June 2020, wit h a total of 7 829 infants increasing to 111 469 adolescents aged 15- 19 years having a viral load result. 167 Volume 18. Issue 3 Figure 1. HIV viral load done (VLD) breakdown by result and age group, South Africa, July 2019 -June 2020. Between 2014 and mid- 2020, the total an tiretroviral therapy (ART) programme showed an improvement in the rolling 12- month suppression rate of 8.2% (from 80.4% to 88.6%) at the <1 000 RNA cps/ml threshold and 15.5% (from 56.3% to 71.8%) at the <50 RNA cps/ml threshold. However, improvements among children and adolescents, in comparison to all age groups, was more modest at 7.2% (from 65.2% to 72.4%) and 7.3% (from 42.4% to 49.7%), respectively (Figure 2). An evaluation of viral load suppression rates among different paediatric and adolescent age groups demonstrates that children aged 1- 4 years had the lowest suppression rate (<50 RNA cps/ml) of 36.3%, with an improvement of only 1.5% (from 34.8% to 36.3%) since 2014 (Figure 3). All other paediatric and adolescent age groups converged at an approxi mate 50% viral suppression rate (<50 RNA cps/ml) in mid -2020. Low-level viraemia (50 -<1 RNA cps/ml) ranged from 18.3% in infants to 26.5% in 1- 4 year olds and high viral loads (>1 000 RNA cps/ml) ranged from 24.6% in the 5- 9 year old age group to 37.4% in the 1- 4 year olds with 73% (n=51 948) of high viral loads occurring in those aged 10 years and Group <50cpml 50-<1000 cpml 1000 cpml 168 Volume 18.

Issue 3 Considerable differences in the volume of HIV viral load testing and suppression rates can be seen among the nine provinces , with similar suppression patterns among those aged <15 years and 15- 19 years (Figures 4 and 5). The numbers of children and adolescents aged <15 years with a viral load done between July 2019 and June 2020 per province were as follows: KwaZulu- Natal 296, 12.0%), Mpumalanga Province (17 224, 11.3%) Limpopo Province (14 847, 9.8%), North West Province (8 955, 5.9%), Free State Province (8 659, 5.7%), Western Cape Province (6 979, 4.6%), and Northern Cape Province (2 598, 1.7%). Among adolescents 15- 19 years, the provincial breakdowns were as follows: KwaZulu- Natal (37 283, 33.4%), Gauteng Province (19 712, Mpumalanga Province (12 971, 11.6%), Eastern Cape Province ( 12 830, 11.5%), Limpopo Province (8 582, 7.7%), North West Province (7 005, 6.3%), Free State Province (6 744, 6.1%), Western Cape Province (4 678, 4.2%) and Northern Cape Province (1 664, 1.5%). The province with the highest suppression rate (<50 RNA cps/ ml) was Western Cape, with 57.0% and 62.5% <15 year olds and 15- 19 year olds suppressed, respectively, followed by Kwa -Zulu Natal and Gauteng provinces. Whereas KwaZulu- Natal Province has the second highest paediatric and adolescent suppression rate, it remains the province with the highest number of unsuppressed patients (Figures 4 and 5).

Discussion Although children and adolescents comprise only 5.5% of South Africa's total population living with HIV, they represent a critical group for monitoring and evaluation of the HIV treatment programme. Analysis of routine HIV viral load data, however, suggests that paediatric and adolescent populations are far from achieving the UNAIDS second and third 90 targets. Furthermore, data over the past six years demons trates only marginal improvement towards reaching these goals from when they were initially set. Nearly half of the HIV population aged 0- 19 years have no evidence of viral load monitoring, which equates to approximately 140 000 and 89 000 children and adolescents aged <15 years and 15- 19 years, respectively, who are presently not in care. Furthermore, viral suppression rates among children and adolescents with a viral load done remain extremely low with only 72% of patients having a viral load <1 000 RNA cps/ml and 50% having a viral load <50 RNA cps/ml. Although UNAIDS initially set viral suppression targets at <1 000 RNA cps/ml, subsequent evidence has demonstrated that low -level viraemia (i.e. 50- <1 000 RNA cps/ml) is clinically relevant. 7 Hence, target s aimed at ending the AIDS epidemic will require viral suppression to be redefined as <50 RNA cps/ml, highlighting considerable disparity between progress in the overall ART programme with that of children and adolescents. Disaggregating HIV viral load data has revealed substantial variation in viral load testing coverage and suppression rates within the paediatric and adolescent population living with HIV. Of note is the markedly lower suppression rates among children 1- 4 years of age, as well as reduced suppression rates among Volume 18. Issue 3 compared with females among all age groups - findings which warrant further investigation and analysis. Despite these variations in treatment outcomes within paediatric subpopulations, it is clear that as a whole children and adolescents living with HIV continue to represent a particularly vulnerable group within the overall ART programme. Conclusions Children and adolescents living with HIV in South Africa remain an especially vulnerable population who are far from achieving UNAIDS 90:90:90 targets. Major advances in paediatric HIV care, in particular retention in care and treatment adherence, will be required if South Africa is to achieve an end to the AIDS epidemic within the next 10 years.

For January to December 2019, the South African national non- polio AFP detection rate was 3.5/100 000 children under 15 years, compared to 2.9/100 000 children under 15 years in 2018. The national average non- polio AFP detection rate exceeded the WHO's target of 2.0/100 000 population under 15 but did not reach the country's target of 4.0/100 000. Seven of the 52 districts in South Africa (SA) (13.5%) did not reach 2.0/100 000. Stool adequacy of less than 80% was reported in one of South Africa's nine provinces. Transport time between sample collection and receipt at the laboratory exceeded three days in 58% of samples. Therefore, AFP surveillance in SA has aspects still requiring strengthening. Introduction In 1988, when the Glob al Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was established 1, there was an estimated 350 000 cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) types 1, 2 and 3 in more than 125 endemic countries. Since then, the global incidence has decreased to 175 reported cases of WPV type 1 i n 2019 in the two endemic countries that remain affected. The last case of WPV type 2 was reported in 1999, leading to declaration of eradication of WPV type 2 in 2015. WPV type 3 has not been detected since November 2012 and was declared eradicated in Oct ober 2019. In South Africa, the last wild poliovirus case occurred in 1989. Globally, two types of polio vaccines are used routinely, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to prevent symptomatic polio, and oral polio vaccine (OPV) to prevent both symptomatic polio and polio transmission. IPV is an injectable vaccine consisting of all three poliovirus serotypes. OPV is composed of live attenuated polioviruses be monovalent (mOPV, type specific) or bivalent (bOPV, types 1 and 3). The type 2 Sabin strain wa s globally withdrawn from OPV in April 2016. The polio vaccination schedule for South Africa comprises bivalent 174 Volume 18. Issue 3 OPV at birth and 6 weeks, and IPV as part of a hexavalent vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, followed by a booster at 18 months. Globally it has been shown that in geographic areas with low vaccination coverage, and therefore low herd immunity to polio transmission, Sabin strains can circulate in the environment for prolonged periods, resulting in mutation and circulation of vaccine- derived poliovirus (cVDPV) - posing a challenge to the GPEI. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) serves as the national polio reference laboratory for AFP surveillance in South Africa and other southern African countries, including Angola, Botswana, Les otho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles and Swaziland. The NICD additionally serves as the regional reference centre for the polio laboratory network of the WHO African region, and conducts molecular characterization of poliovirus isolates from the national laboratories of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Niger, Uganda, Cameroon, Central African Republic and Zambia. There were 313 AFP cases caused by cVDPV2 within the WHO African region in 2019. These cases included samples analysed at NICD and reported here. These cVDPV2 cases were from Nigeria, DRC, Niger, Zambia, Chad, Angola, Benin, Ethiopia, Togo, Central African Republic, Burkina Faso and Ghana. Outside of the African region, China had 1 cVDPV2 case in 2019, and Myanmar and Mala ysia reported outbreaks of cVDPV1, where Philippines had cases of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. Somalia also reported 3 cases of cVDPV2 (www.polioeradication.org 1). Methods Nationwide, case- based surveillance for AFP was conducted in South Africa in 2019. Surveillance comprises field and laboratory components. Field Surveillance Cases of AFP from all health facilities were notified to the Provincial and National Departments of Health with samples collected for investigation and case investigation forms forwarded to the NICD. An adequately investigated case requires the collection of two stool specimens from the AFP case within 14 days of onset of paralysis. The stool samples should be collected 24- 48 hours apart , transported on ice and should arrive at the NICD laboratory within 72 hours of collection. Field surveillance, conducted through active case detection by retrospective record review targeting children under 15 years was conducted periodically throughout the year, targeting high priority sites. In 2019, the South African operational non- polio AFP target detection rate was 4.0/100 000, while the WHO target detection rate remained at 2.0/100 000. The National Polio Expert Committee (NPEC) met quarterly to de termine the final classification of all inadequately investigated AFP cases (Table 1). Laboratory methods Viral Isolation was performed by inoculation of clarified faecal material into cell culture, followed by microscopic examination of the cells for cyt opathic effect, which indicates the presence of suspected poliovirus. Intratypic differentiation (ITD) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted on suspected poliovirus isolates. 2 Polioviruses were then sequenced to classify them as either WPV, Sabin or VDPV. Sequencing helps to monitor 175 Volume 18. Issue 3 poliovirus transmission pathways and transmission links. South African polioviruses were sequenced at the VP1 region and 5' untranslated region (UT R). Table 1. Polio case classification system used by South Africa's National Polio Expert Committee (NPEC).

No wild -type strains were detected. Sabin Poliovirus type 1 was detected in two cases, one each in Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces, and Sabin Poliovirus type 3 was detected in two cases from Gauteng. Detection of Sabin virus from stool i s usually a coincidental finding in countries using OPV; no case was classified by the NPEC as vaccine -associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). The 2019 NPEC final classification of 2019 AFP cases is listed in table 2. 176 Volume 18. Issue 3 Table 2.

The 2019 AFP detection rate for South Africa was 3.5/100 000 children under the age of 15 years, compared to the 2018 rate of 2.9/100 000. While the rate was below the country's target of 4.0/100 000, it exceeded the WHO's target of 2.0/100 000. Free State, Limpopo, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga provinces exceeded the 4.0/100 000 country target; Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Kwazulu- Natal, North West and Western Cape provinces reached the WHO target but not the country target; no provinces had a detection rate below 2.0/100 000 and there were no silent districts . The national stool adequacy rate was 88%, above the required target of 80% and an improvement from 59% in 2018. 177 Volume 18. Issue 3 Table 3. South African Acute Flaccid Paralysis ( AFP) surveillance indicators for 2019 by province and health district. 178 Volume 18. Issue 3 Laboratory Indicators On arrival at the laboratory, 1304 of 1328 (98%) of samples were appropriately received on ice and 42% were received within three days of sample collection. Laboratory surveillance indicators showed that 94% of samples were reported within 14 days of receipt, above the target of 80%. The Non- Polio Enterovirus (NPEV) isolation rate was 9%, below the target of 10% as stipulated by the WHO ( https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/68762 2). The NPEV rate may be a useful indicator of laboratory performance, however, the rate can be influenced by a number of factors, including the season of the year, elevation, or population hygienic levels. Southern African countries supported by NICD A total of 3110 stool samples were received from other Southern African countries. Of these, 94% were received in good condition and 89% were processed within 14 days of receipt. The NPEV isolation rate was 17%. No WPV was detected. There were 8 cas es of cVDPV2 detected from Mozambique, 2 cases of cVDPV2 from Malawi, and 129 cases of cVDPV2 from Angola from several outbreaks. The broader African Region A total of 548 samples from cases and contacts of cases in Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopi a, Niger, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zambia, Cameroon and South Sudan were received for molecular characterization. VDPV type 2 was detected in Central African Republic (21 cases), DRC (88 cases), Zambia (3 cases and 2 contacts), Chad (3 cases and 3 contacts), Ethiopia (3 cases and 10 contacts) and Niger (2 cases and 9 contacts). One case from South Sudan was Sabin 1. Sabin 2 was identified in 279 samples, with cases and contacts of cases from Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Niger and DRC. Environmenta l surveillance in South Africa Environmental surveillance, a supplement to AFP surveillance, was initiated in South Africa in July 2019. A total of 32 samples was received from 3 sites in Gauteng Province. The NPEV isolation rate was 87% and Sabin- like vir us was detected at 2 sites - an anticipated finding in a country using live oral polio vaccine. Environmental surveillance for the African region The NICD performed viral isolation on 98 samples from 9 sites in Angola, 76 samples from 4 sites in Mozambique and 253 samples from 10 sites in Zambia. The NPEV isolation rate was 44% in Angola, 41% in Mozambique and 29% in Zambia (Figure 1). Notably, cVDPV2 was detected in 7 of the 9 sites in Angola. Molecular testing was conducted for environmental samples f rom Cameroon, Ethiopia, Cote d'Ivoire, Uganda and Madagascar. cVDPV2 was detected from environmental sites in Cameroon, Ethiopia and Cote d'Ivoire. 179 Volume 18.

Issue 3 Discussion The global effort to eradicate polio is one of the largest health initiatives in history. The AFP surveillance network needs to be highly sensitive, enabling the immediate detection of polioviruses and ensuring that the polio eradication mission is successful. Although the last WPV case in South Africa occurred in 1989, deficiencies in the country's routine immunization coverage and surveillance systems resulted in South Africa's polio- free status being revoked by the African Regional Certification Commission in 2017. In response, a number of measures were put in place to address the identified weaknesses. The Department of Health set the target for South Africa to find four cases of AFP per 100 000 children and investigate them for polio. Following the African Regional Certification Commission's visit to South Africa and resubmission of certification documentation, the country was once again declared polio- free on 17 September 2019. These data show that stool adequacy and AFP reporting rates have improved since 2018. However, the transport time for samples to reach the laboratory remains a challenge. Improvements are needed in terms of transport logistics to ensure samples reach the laboratory within the required timeframe. Continued training of healthcare workers is needed to ensure that the correct samples are collected, the correct test is requested, and samples are being sent to the laboratory without delay. The NICD has supported the African region by molecular characterization of polioviruses of international public health concern. Additionally, the NICD implemented e nvironmental polio surveillance in South Africa which has potential to supplement AFP surveillance as an early warning system, although its extent is limited by the need for labour -intensive viral culture prior to molecular confirmatory assays. The utility of environmental surveillance is demonstrated by detection of cVDPV strains through environmental surveillance for Angola. The Sabin type 2 polioviruses detected in the African region were most likely due to mop- up campaigns using monovalent OPV type 2 to restrict VDPV type 2 circulation in those countries where it had been detected. Updated data is available on the GPEI website: www.polioeradication.org. 1 The GPEI has developed a comprehensive new strategy to stop the spread of cVDPV2 outbreaks current ly affecting mainly countries in Africa. The strategy aims to accelerate the development of a new vaccine- novel OPV2 (nOPV2) as a potential alternative for outbreak response and, ultimately, as a replacement for mOPV2. nOPV2 is a modification of the existi ng Sabin OPV type 2 and is specifically designed to improve the genetic stability of the vaccine. The nOPV2 has been given a WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) recommendation and should be available to address cVDPV2. 3 Conclusion The international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International concern (PHEIC) as demonstrated by the widespread outbreaks of cVDPV2 in the African region. Countries need to strengthen their surveillance efforts and increase routine immunization efforts par ticularly with IPV to give protection against type 2 cVDPV. 181 Volume 18.

Issue 3 GERMS-SA ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REPORT FOR LABORATORY -CONFIRMED INVASIVE MENINGOCOCCAL, HAEMOPHILUS , PNEUMOCOCCAL, GROUP A STREPTOCOCCAL GROUP STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS, SOUTH AFRICA, 2019 Susan Meiring1, Cheryl Cohen2, Linda Health Surveillance and Response, NICD 2Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, NICD Summary The Centre for Respir atory Diseases and Meningitis (CRDM), of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), through the GERMS -SA platform, performs national laboratory -based surveillance on five invasive bacterial diseases The surveillance programme aims to describe the epidemiology of these invasive infections and monitor the impact of preventive measures, such as routine vaccination, over time. Diagnostic microbiology laboratories in South Africa are requested to submit isolates meeting the GERMS -SA surveillance case definition to the CRDM reference laboratory for further phenotypic and genotypic characterisation. Basic demographic data are collected from the patients' laboratory reports for all isolates detected. At select ed enhanced surveillance hospital sites, trained surveillance officers interview the patients and review the medical records for all Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal disease episodes. Invasive meningococcal disease incidence remained low in 2019 with serogroup B causing most disease in young infants, serogroup Y responsible for a peak in adolescents and serogroup W predominating through adulthood. In- hospital case fatality for IMD was 19%, with 20% of survivors suffering seque lae post -hospital discharge. Incidence of invasive Haeomophilus influenzae remained low with non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae causing most disease. Infants had the highest rates of H. influenzae type b and non- typeable (HNT) disease, with HNT incidence increasing into adulthood. In- hospital case fatality was 27% and long- term sequelae following meningitis occurred in 27% of survivors. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence has remained stable over the past 5 years across all age categories. Infant s still have the highest disease incidence, with disease peaking again after age 25 years. Residual IPD in children aged <5 years is largely due to non- vaccine serotypes, and the majority of vaccine- type disease occurs in children who have not received adequate doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Serotypes causing IPD in those aged >5 years remain diverse including both vaccine and non- vaccine serotypes. Infants and the elderly experience the highest incidence of invasive Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infections in South Africa with the 183 Volume 18. Issue 3 majority of isolates being susceptible to first -line antibiotics. In 2020, clinical data will be collected from persons with invasive GAS infections admitted to our enhanced surveillance sites and molecular typing of all the 2019 and 2020 isolates will commence. Incidence of early and late onset invasive Group B Streptococcus (GBS) appears low, however this may be due to low specimen taking practices in many areas of South Africa. Most invasive GBS in infants was caused by serotypes III and Ia, although a range of serotypes was found to be causing invasive GBS in other age groups. This was the first year of active surveillance for invasive GBS and no clinical data were collected. Clinical laboratories are encouraged to send all isolates meeting the GERMS - SA case definition to the NICD so that further characterisation and serotyping can be done. In 2020, enhanced clinical surveillance will begin for both GAS and GBS at selected sites in order to report on risk factors predisposing to invasive infections and outcome following infection. Introduction The Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis (CRDM), of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), through the GERMS -SA platform, performs national laboratory -based surveillance on invasive bacterial surveillance aims to describe the epidemiology of these diseases and monitor the impact of routine pneumococcal and H. influenzae serotype b conjugate vaccines on invasive disease in South Africa. Surveillance has been ongoing since 2003, however this is the first year of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) and Streptococcus agalactaie (Group B Streptococcus) surveillance. This report summarises the findings for all pathogens in 2019. Methods Approximately 220 South African clinical microbiology laboratories participated in the GERMS -SA surveillance programme in 2019, including 31 enhanced surveillance hospital sites (ESS). 1 The Sout h African population under surveillance in 2019 was estimated at 58.8 million, with 954 532 births.2,3 HIV-prevalence in South Africa is 13.5%, with 7.94 million persons living with HIV.2 The standard case definition for all five pathogens included the detection of the organism under surveillance from any normally sterile site. In addition, non- invasive isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes from skin or soft tissue were accepted if the accompanying diagnosis was necrotising fasciitis or septic shock syndrome. Diagnostic microbiology laboratories reported case patients to the NICD using laboratory case report forms and submitted available isolates from case patients on Dorset transport media to the NICD for further phenotypic and genotypic characterisation. Only antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on Streptococcus pyogenes isolates in 2019. Genotypic characterisation of these isolates will be conducted at a later stage. Culture- negative cases with a positive supplementary test e.g. Gram stain and/or antigen detection were also reported, and samples were submitted for molecular detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Neisseria meningitidis . Repeat isolates fr om the same patient were counted as a single case if they occurred within 21 days of the first culture. 184 Volume 18. Issue 3 At ESS surveillance officers completed clinical case report forms using the Mobenzi application on electronic tablets for patients with laboratory -confirmed invasive meningococcal, invasive H. influenzae and invasive pneumococcal disease, by case- patient interview or hospital medical record review, to obtain additional clinical details, including antimicrobial use, vaccination history, HIV status, and patient outcome. Case patients were followed up for the duration of the hospital admission. Data management was centralised at the NICD. Laboratory, clinical and demographic data from case- patients were recorded on a Microsoft Access database. A surveillanc e audit was performed for NHLS laboratories in all provinces using the NHLS Central Data Warehouse (CDW). The audit was designed to obtain basic demographic and laboratory data from additional case -patients with laboratory -confirmed disease not already reported to GERMS -SA by participating laboratories; these cases are included in this report. Incidence was calculated using mid- year population estimates for 2018 and 2019 from Statistics South Africa. 2 Ethics approval for the on- going activities of the surve illance programme was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical), University of Witwatersrand (clearance number M08- 11-17) and from relevant university and provincial ethics committees for other enhanced surveillance sites. Neisseria men ingitidis Results In 2019, 111 cases of laboratory -confirmed invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) were identified through the surveillance system, of which 43 (39%) viable isolates were received and 16 (14%) cases were detected on audit. The overall disease incidence remained low at 0.19 cases per 100 000 population, similar to that in 2018 (0.22/100 000). Incidence was highest in the Western Cape Province (0.56/100 000) followed by Gauteng (0.24/100 000) and Eastern Cape provinces (0.18/100 000) (Table 1). Most cases were s poradic, and disease peaked from winter through spring (May to October), with a further upsurge in December (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid was the most common specimen from which meningococci were identified (70/111, 63%) (Table 2). Ninety -five percent (89/94) of IMD was caused by 3 serogroups 38%), Y (27/94, 29%) and W (25/94, 27%) (Table 3). Incidence of IMD was highest in children <1 year (1.14/100 000) (Figure 2). Although the different serogroups occurred across most age- categories, serogr oup B was most predominant in children aged <5 years, serogroup Y in persons aged 5- 24 years and serogroup W in persons aged > 25 years. (Figure 2) Of those w ith known sex, IMD occurred more frequently in males (59/109, 54%). Of the viable isolates tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, 26% (11/43) were non- susceptible to penicillin with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) between 0.094\u00b5g/ml and 0.25\u00b5g/ml, and all were susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin. 185 Volume 18.

Thirty -eight (34%) IMD patients presented to the enhanced surveillance sites and 31/38 (82%) had additional clinical information avai lable. The median time for admissions was 10 days (interquartile range 7- 13 days). The case -fatality ratio was 19% (6/31); three patients died on the day of admission. Thirty -eight percent of patients with HIV status available were HIV -infected (9/24). For those who survived to discharge from hospital, 5/25 (20%) suffered sequelae following IMD. Two patients developed ongoing seizures, and one each had hearing loss, necrotic skin lesions 187 Volume 18. Issue 3 Discussion Incidence of IMD in South Africa remains low with a variety of serogroups (B, Y and W) causing disease in the different age- categories. Burden is highest in infants, particularly serogroup B disease, whilst serogroup Y disease has been responsible for a peak in 10- 14 year olds. All IMD isolates were susceptible to third generation cephalosporins and an increase in penicillin non- susceptibility of the meningococci was noted. Third generation cephalosporins are frequently used as empiric therapy in patients presenting with meningitis/bacteraemias. Before switching over to high- dose penicillin once IMD is confirmed, clinicians should establish susceptibility of meningococcal isolates to penicillin. Provision of ciprofloxacin as chemoprophylaxis is recommended to all close contacts. Although uncommon, meningococcal disease in South Africa is a devastating illness affecting all age groups. In 2019, in- hospital case fatality was 19%, with 20% of survivors suffering sequelae post discharge from hospital. Haemophilus influenzae Results There were 259 cas es of invasive Haemophilus influenzae (HI) disease identified through the surveillance programme in 2019 - 41% (105) were detected on audit and 58% (149) had either viable isolates (109) or specimens (40) available for ser otyping (Table 4). Eight cases wer e co- infected with invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Incidence of invasive HI disease was 0.44 per 100 000 population. Gauteng Province (88/259, 34%) had the highest number of cases reported, followed by Western Cape Province (78/259, 30%) (Table 4). Twen ty-eight percent of serotype b (Hib) non- typeable (HNT) disease was found in 55% (82/149) (Table 4). Most HI cases were isolated from blood (160/259, 62%), however Hib isolates were more likely than HNT isolates to be found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (17/41, 41% versus 6/82, 7%, p<0.001) (Table 5). Although HI occurs in all ages, invasive disease is highest in infants followed by adults aged 25 -44 years (Figure 3). Hib incidence is still highest in infants even though significant declines have been noted since 2010 (5.2 cases per 100 000 in 2010 to 1.2 cases per 100 000 in 2019 (p<0.001)) (Figure 4 and 5). Hib incidence has remained below 0.2 per 100 000 in 1- 4 year olds since 2013 (Figure 5). HNT incidence is highest in infants (1.2 per 100 000) dropping substantially throughout the rest of childhood before increasing again in adulthood with a moderate peak from ages 25 years and older (Figure 4). Forty -one percent (12/29) of Hib isolates and 8% (MIC>1mg/L). Twenty -five cases of Hib disease occurred in children <15 years of age and vaccine history was available for 32% (8/25). Three infants were <6 weeks and thus too young to receive Hib vaccine. Four children had received at least 3 doses of vaccine and were possible vaccine failures. One 3- month old child had only received one dose of Hib vaccine. 188 Volume 18. Issue 3 Table 4.

Clinical information was available for 85% (110/130) of cases presenting to the ESS. Patients were admitted for a median of 7 days (interquartile range (IQR) 3- 16). Case fatality was 27% (36/110) and median time to death was within one day of admission (IQR 0- 4). There was no statistically significant difference between case fatalities of those with Hib or HNT disease (25% (5/20) vs. 23% (11/47), p=0.5). Amongst known HIV status, 38% (33/86) were HIV -infected. Conditions other than H IV predisposing to HI disease were reported in 53/98 (54%) patients - the most common conditions included chronic lung disease (10), history of smoking (7), malignancy (7) and prematurity (6). Of the 19 patients at ESS with HI on CSF: eight patients died during their hospitalization, and 27% (3/11) of those who survived to discharge suffered sequelae - one developed ongoing seizures and two developed hydrocephalus. Discussion Overall incidence of HI remained low in 2019 and HNT accounted for the majority of cases. The highest rates of disease were seen in infants for both Hib and HNT, with HNT incidence increasing in adults. Many adults with invasive HI infection had an underlying chronic condition, such as chronic lung disease or malignancy. Case- fatality rates are high (27%) and long- term sequelae following meningitis occurred in 27% of survivors. Although many of the children with Hib disease had been fully vaccinated, only a few vaccine histories were obtainable. 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Incidence (cases per 100 000 population) Year of surveillance Hib disease in infants <1 year Hib disease in children 1-4 years Non-typeable disease in infants <1 year Non-typeable disease in children 1-4 years 191 Volume 18. Issue 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae Results Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence for 2019 remained the same as 2018 at 4 per 100 000 population (Table 6). The highest incidence was seen in the Western Cape (9.3 per 100 000 population) followed by Northern Cape (7.1 per 100 000) and Gauteng pro vinces (5.1 per 100 000 population) (Table 6). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced into the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) in 2009, and subsequently replaced by PCV13 in 2011. In 2019, peak IPD incidence occurred in infants (20 per 100 000 population), followed by adults (5- 6 per 100 000 population in the 25 years and older age categories) (Figure 6). Eight patients with IPD were co- infected with invasive Haemophilus influenzae and one with Neisseria meningitidis . The majority of IPD cases were isolated from blood specimens (63%, 1490/2359) (Table 7). Penicillin non- susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >0.06\u00b5g/ml) was detected in 29% (413/1386) of IPD isolates and the highest proportion was in children 1- 4 years o f age (51%, 40/79) (Table 8 and Figure 7). Ceftriaxone non- susceptibility (MIC >0.5\u00b5g/ml) was detected amongst 8% (110/1386) of isolates from all specimens including 8% (29/347) of IPD isolated from CSF. In 2019, serogroups 8, 12F, 19F, 7 and 14 were the m ost predominant serogroups causing 44% (80/180) of IPD in 19A caused (511/1194) disease 8A and 8B). Only 59% (1386/2359) of IPD isolates were sent to NICD, of which 1374 were serotyped (Figure 9). Of those serotyped, 22% (39/180) of isolates from children <5 years, and 30% (357/1194) of IPD isolates from person 5 years and older were PCV13- vaccine serotypes (Table 9 and 10). Table 6.

Patients were admitted for a median hospital stay of 7 days (interquartile range (IQR) 3- 13) and most deat hs occurred within 2 days of admission (IQR 1- 6). Overall case fatality was 33% (246/744). HIV -infection was and 47% (27/58) of maternal HIV -status available were HIV -exposed 196 Volume 18. Issue 3 (10 HIV -infected, 14 HIV -uninfected and 3 HIV -status unknown). Forty -three percent (327/744) of patients had a condition/risk factor (excluding HIV -infection) predisposing them to IPD. The top three factors included: history of smoking (102 patients), diabetes (41 patients) and chr onic lung disease (38 patients). Of 180 patients at ESS with pneumococcus on CSF, 41% (73/180) died during their hospitalization, and 30% (32/107) who survived to discharge suffered at least one sequelae - these included new onset seizures (11), limb weak ness/paralysis (9), hydrocephalus (4), hearing loss (4), visual loss (3) and necrotic skin lesions (1). Eighteen episodes of IPD caused by serotypes present in the PCV13 vaccine occurred in children <10 years - of-age at ESS. Vaccine history was available for 67% (12/18) of these children. Seventeen percent (2/12) were too young to receive vaccine; 25% (3/12) of children eligible to receive vaccine had not received any PCV doses; 25% (3/12) had received all 3 doses of PCV; one child had received two doses; an d 25% (3/12) had only received one dose of PCV at 6 weeks of age. The serotypes responsible for disease in those who had received any PCV13 included serotypes 19F (3 episodes), 6A (2 episodes), 14 and 6B (one each). Discussion IPD incidence has remained stable over the past 5 years across all age categories. Infants still have the highest disease incidence, with disease peaking again after age 25 years. Penicillin and ceftriaxone susceptibility of IPD isolates remained unchanged from 2018. HIV -infection, infant HIV -exposure and history of smoking remained important risk factors for IPD. Pneumococcal disease has a high mortality and high rate of sequelae following infection. Residual disease in children aged <5 years is largely due to non- vaccine serotypes , and the majority of vaccine- type disease occurs in children who have not received adequate doses of PCV13. Serotypes causing IPD in those aged >5 years remain diverse including both vaccine and non- vaccine serotypes. Clinicians should ensure that all chi ldren (and adults with risk factors for IPD) receive adequate PCV doses to protect them from this serious illness. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes ) Results Thirty -four percent (363/1060) of isolates meeting the GERMS -SA case definition for laboratory confirmed invasive Group A Streptococcus (GAS) were sent to the reference laboratory for further characterisation - these cases included isolates from skin and s oft tissue infections thought to be causing systemic illness. Incidence of invasive GAS was highest in infants (6.4 per 100 000) with a second peak in those aged >64 years (3 per 100 000) (Figure 10). Most cases were reported from the Western Cape Province (n=466, 44%), followed by Gauteng (208, 20%), KwaZulu Natal (173, 16%) and Eastern Cape (159, 15%) provinces. More invasive GAS disease occurred in males (551/1041, 52%) than females. Forty -six percent (478/1045) of cases were identified on blood culture, followed by 41% (426/1045) from skin and soft tissue specimens (Table 11). Of those isolates available for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, 97% (338/348) were susceptible to penicillin (MIC<0.06\u00b5g/ml) and 95% (331/348) were susceptible to erythromyci n (MIC<0.25\u00b5g/ml) (Table 12). 197 Volume 18.

Issue 3 Discussion Infants and the elderly experience the highest incidence of invasive GAS infections in South Africa. Of the isolates characterized, the majority were highly susceptible to the first line antimicrobial agents, penicillin and erythromycin. This was the first year of active surveillance for invasive GAS and clinical laboratories are encouraged to send all invasive GAS isolates meeting the case definition t o the NICD so that further phenotypic and genotypic characterisation can be performed. In 2020, clinical data will be collected from persons with invasive GAS infections admitted to our enhanced surveillance sites and molecular typing of all the 2019 and 2020 isolates will commence. Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae ) Results One thousand and thirty -four cases of invasive Group B streptococcal infections (GBS) were reported through the GERMS -SA surveillance network, of which 347 (34%) isolates were received for further characterisation. Incidence for early onset GBS (<7days) was 0.34 per 1000 live births and 0.24 per 1000 live births for late onset (7-90 days) invasive disease (Table 13). Gauteng Province reported the highest incidence of early and late onset GBS (0.65 and 0.47 per 1000 live births), followed by the Western Cape Province (0.46 and 0.36 per 1000 live births) (Table 13). In infants, invasive GBS incidence was 60 per 100 000 population and decreased rapidly by month of age (Figure 11a). Whilst in persons >1 year of age, overall incidence of invasive GBS was 0.74 per 100 000, peaking in those >64 years of age (Figure 11b). In infants, most cases were isolated from blood (472/574, 82%) or cerebrospinal fluid (91/574, 16%) (Table 14). However, in persons >1 year of age blood (168/426, 39%) and soft tissue (162/426, 38%) specimens were most frequent (Table 14). Disease occurred more frequently in females (569/995, 56%) than males. Of the specimens available for serotyping, serotype III was the most predominant (166/321, 52%), followed by serotype Ia (78, 24%) (Table 15). Serotypes III and Ia were the most predominant serotypes causing invasive disease in early and late onset GBS (Figure 12). In persons >90 days of age, invasive GBS was caused by serotypes III, Ia, II and V (Figure 12). Ninety percent (283/316) of invasive GBS isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC<0.12mg/l) and 95% (296/313) were susceptible to gentamycin. Table 13.

Issue 3 Figure 12 . Numbers of cases of laboratory -confirmed, invasive Group B Streptococcal disease by serotype, reported to GERMS -SA, South Africa, 2019, n=1034 (isolates unavailable for 690 cases). Discussion Incidence of early and late onset invasive GBS appears low, however this may be due to decreased case ascertainment in many areas of South Africa. Most invasive GBS in infants was caused by serotypes III and Ia, although a range of serotypes was found to be causing invasive GBS in other age groups. This was the first year of active sur veillance for invasive GBS and no clinical data was collected. Clinical laboratories are encouraged to send all GBS isolates meeting the GERMS case definition to the NICD so that further characterisation and serotyping can be done. In 2020, enhanced clinic al surveillance will begin at selected sites in order to report on risk factors predisposing to invasive GBS and outcome following infection. Conclusions Incidence of invasive meningococcal and Haemophilus influenzae disease remained low for 2019, with rates of invasive pneumococcal disease being stable over the past 5 years. Infants have the highest rates of invasive meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcal, GAS and GBS infections, despite routine vaccinat ion programmes targeting pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b disease prevention in young children. There was a wide diversity of serogroups/serotypes of the different organisms circulating in South Africa, making targeting of residual disease di fficult to achieve through limited vaccination options. Despite the low incidence of disease, in- hospital case- fatality remains high for invasive meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal disease, with high rates of sequelae amongst survivors. This highlights the importance of continued active surveillance of these infections and others such as Group A and B streptococcus in order to understand the disease burden and monitor serotype/serogroup diversity for future vaccine targets. 010203040506070 Ia Ib II III V NTNumbers of cases Age category (years)Early onset (<7 days) Late onset (7-90 days) Older than 90 days 202 Volume 18.
