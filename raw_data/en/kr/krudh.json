Rooted in a blend of ancient wisdom and evolving scientific understanding, this profound approach seeks to harmonize the connections between our minds, bodies, and emotions. At its core, energy work, also known as spiritual healing, revolves around the notion of unseen energy and its profound influence on our well-being. This energy, often referred to as life force or chi, flows through all living beings, and when it is disrupted or imbalanced, it can lead to physical, emotional, and spiritual disharmony. Energy healers employ a range of methods to restore the natural flow and abundance of energy within an individual. Some of the common techniques include: 1. [ Touch-Based Healing](https://www.theclaritycure.com/shop?category=Healing%20Energy%20Sessions): By using their hands or employing massage techniques, healers' channel positive energy directly into the recipient's body, promoting relaxation, reducing tension, and supporting healing. 2.
