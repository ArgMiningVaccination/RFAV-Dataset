This positive opinion covers those who are 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, and inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In May 2022, Dupixent 300 mg weekly was [approved](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3738855-1&h=3741302357&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ffda-approves-dupixentr-dupilumab-first-treatment-adults-and&a=approved) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg. EoE is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE, swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid, a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow, forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases, a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. The positive CHMP opinion is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts - [Part A](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3738855-1&h=4048018567&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fdupixentr-dupilumab-late-breaking-pivotal-data-showing&a=Part+A) and [Part B](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3738855-1&h=1936427726&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Flate-breaking-data-2022-aaaai-annual-meeting-show-dupixentr&a=Part+B) investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly compared to placebo for 24 weeks, and Part C observed patients from Parts A and B, all of whom were on Dupixent, having continued on or switched to Dupixent for an additional 28 weeks. The results demonstrated Dupixent-treated patients experienced improvements in their ability to swallow as early as four weeks, as well as histological disease remission, improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of the esophagus and cellular improvements at 24 weeks compared to placebo, with outcomes maintained up to one year. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included infections. The use of Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved. About Dupixent Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune\u00ae technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, (CRSwNP) and nodularis, as well as investigational diseases such as EoE in the EU. Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally. About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to [envision](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3738855-1&h=3055736020&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fabs%2Fpii%2F0168952585900897&a=envision) making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite\u00ae technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. U.S. INDICATIONS DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used: - to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.
