Subs, by the Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act. 1976, sec. 2, for \"Sovereign Democratic Republic\" (W.E.F. 3.1.1977) 2. Subs, by the Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act. 1976, sec. 2, for \"Unity of is a land of diversity - social, cultural, religious, racial, linguistic and geographical. The main hallmark of this nation is unity which absorbs all the diversities. A common values system helps to create an identity that bonds people together . We have since time immemorial emphasized on traditional values like spirituality , strong family ties, deference to elders, recourse to nature, artistic expression, respecting even the tools of one's trade, joyousness, hospitality and peaceful co-existence epitomised in Vasudev Kutumbakam( a Sanskrit phrase that means that the whole world is one single family) . This is probably what has come to be defined as a 'Global Village' today . Values such as harmony , peace, compassion and humility have for centuries been a part of the discourse of every religion in the world and their need and importance is universally accepted and felt, more so in the current social and political context. Respect for human dignity and human rights, as well as respect for the environment are core values that need to be practiced. Not only are they crucial to achieving peace, harmony and sustainable development, they are also indispensible if the full potential of the child, be it of body, mind or spirit, has to be harnessed. In the emerging contexts related to the work places, being successful would demand not merely possession of technical and professional competences but as much and even more, the possession of soft skills and life skills. Ability to work together in a team to quickly resolve conflict situations, to collaborate and cooperate with others in addition to soft skills creates synergetic alliances leading to higher levels of achievement. The myth, that competition is necessary for success in life, needs to be broken by providing an alternative model of higher achievement through cooperation and collaboration which are integral to Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) . The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) aims to reinforce Values Education. It has committed to make educational process inclusive of Values Education by inculcating attitude and values through Co-Scholastic areas of Life Skills, Sports and Games as well as Co-Curricular activities. Apart from various activities and publications in these areas, this is also evident from the emphasis laid on the holistic assessment of learners under the strengthening of CCE and School Based Assessment in 2009. The Teachers' Manual on Continuous and Comprehension Evaluation brought out by the CBSE in the year 2009 (revised in the year 2010) and the Performance Profiles circulated under CCE also reflect values internalized by the students. It has been widely felt that our existing educational ecosystem needs to be further strengthened to deliver values enshrined in our Constitution. The curricula cutting across all subjects need to (v)articulate values in explicit terms and the assessment schemes, at the same time, must reciprocate by assigning a weightage to value based items. The teachers, Principals, educators and various stakeholders are also expected to lay emphasis on acquiring knowledge, attitude and skills related to appreciation of cultural values, dignity of individuals, inclusion, environmental conservation and protection of heritage and national monuments, etc., through curricular and co-curricular means. The 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' brought out by the NCER T focuses on the environments in which the learners grow, live and also on future work environments by highlighting the interplay of different cultures. The framework intends to prepare students for living in a multi-lingual, multi-cultural and multi-religious country and to appreciate and respect diversity . Continuing with its efforts in the area of Values Education and in light of above framework, the Board has decided to bring out the 'Values Education - A Handbook for Teachers'. This Handbook comes with a Value Education Kit that contains Value Cards and a CD of songs symbolising values of Peace, Solidarity and respect for Nature. Although Values Education would be inculcated in all students in age appropriate ways, the Board has issued specific guidelines to assess students for 3-5 marks in each subject at the Summative Assessment level in Classes IX and X through questions which will be integrated with the content of the subject and analysed on the basis of the values it reflects. This will be effective from the Summative Assessments-II (2012-2013) in classes IX and X and in major subjects in classes XI and XII. I would like to place on record the good work done by teams under the leadership of Dr. Sadhana Parashar , Director (Academics and Training), CBSE and Mrs. Ameeta Mulla Wattal, Principal Springdales, New Delhi. I would also like to appreciate the message and contributions of Fr. T.V. Kunnunkal - former Chairman, CBSE and other stalwarts who have contributed to this kit especially Dr. Kavita Sharma-Director IIC and Former Principal Hindu College, Mr. A. K. Merchant - Head, Baha'i Foundation and Mr. Kishore Thukral. I sincerely hope this kit will provide the basic guidelines to educators to impart Values Education in the right spirit in all schools affiliated to CBSE and will be put to great use by Head, teachers, students and parents. Any further suggestions are always welcome and will be incorporated in future editions.

(vii)India is a pluralistic country segregated on the basis of caste, religion, region and wealth, etc. This can be seen as a source of strength rather than as a source that creates problems. Any effort at nation building would call for replenishing the rapidly diminishing Social Capital. Pursuing common goals and purposes will provide the social glue that would bind groups and communities. This cross-border community building is a goal that can begin to become operational within the classroom and the school climate. This Values Education Kit (VEK) is very timely and an excellent initiative. My congratulations for taking up this project. I am sure this will include not only teachers and principals but also parents, and very importantly , student representatives. They have much to contribute to creating a value culture. Schools should be viewed as providing a fulcrum for personal and societal transformation as well as values building, and not merely as institutions for acquiring subject mastery and other competencies for advancement of personal life and living. This kit will help to design a new way of 'Being School' and give a new role identity and responsibility for teachers and Principals as the key agents who facilitate the rebuilding of the India we want to belong to. The foundations for these are to be anchored in the country's basic culture and ethos. In this process, the young have to be fully involved to see and accept it as current and contextual. This would make the school become a mini workshop to engage in model building of our future society . To be current and contextual, a frame of reference could be to make India really Indian , truly modern and deeply human. I am sure that this new initiative of the CBSE will have far reaching effects in its schools across the country . Fr. T.V. Kunnunk al Former Chairman Central Board of Secondary Education DelhiFr. T.V. Kunnunkal Former Chairman - C.B.S.E. Message (viii) We all know that Values Education is inherent in our civilization, culture and traditions spanning over centuries. If the philosophy and principles as articulated in the 'Indian Intellectual Traditions', the 'National Curriculum Framework (NCF) - 2005' and the 'Position Paper on Education for Peace ' are put into practice, values oriented education will indeed occupy centre stage. As per the 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework ' prepared by the Department of Educational Psychology and Foundations of Education , NCER T every school needs to evolve its own plan of values, create goals and laydown assessment criteria. It is suggested that every school prepares an annual plan highlighting the values concerns, activities/strategies to be adopted and age appropriate mechanisms to be created for each grade and at each level. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has brought out this 'Values Education - A Handbook for Teachers ' as a part of the Values Education Kit (VEK) that can help in bringing education for values in schools. We all know that this is not something new. Teachers everywhere are attempting this in their own way. What is required at this stage is to review all possible strategies which could lead to a comprehensive approach. The 'Values Education Kit' comprises of 'Values Education - A Handbook for Teachers ,' Values Cards and a CD of compilation of songs highlighting contemporary social issues and concerns . Educators and School Administrators have for long expressed the need for a workable programme that will enable schools to provide values education alongside learning that forms part of the regular and prescribed curriculum. This Values Education Kit (VEK) has been developed in response to this need. It will serve as a model for providing Values Education, while at the same time allowing for variations that schools using it may want to adopt. Given the current social milieu, it has become imperative for schools to inculcate in their students not just skills, but also values and attitudes that will help them live in harmony with themselves, with others and with nature. For this reason the Handbook has been divided into various sections, each of them highlighting the need for a reappraisal of the vision of education, purpose of schooling and the concern for quality education with its sometimes over-emphasis on employability , indicators of success and economic progress. Values Education therefore needs to be viewed as a core component of quality education, and schools will have to make a conscious effort to provide such holistic education. The section on 'Concept and Approach to Values Education' calls for Values Education to be recognized as the fundamental need and a valued investment. It discusses the concept and context along with a thematic approach to values education.An Introductory Note (ix)The Handbook also deals with ways to integrate values into the curriculum. One of the major areas of concerns in this section relates to the teaching of different school subjects with a perspective that students not only gain insight into the nature of the subject but also appreciate and imbibe the attitude and values associated with a particular subject. The Handbook also highlights some critical concerns like the need for strengthening home-school and community partnership, concern for parents' involvement in school and education of children. It lays emphasis on staff development/orientation and opportunities to the teachers for capacity building, professional development and networking with each other and other organizations engaged in similar endeavours for mutual learning and enrichment. The following points may be kept in mind while going through the Handbook: Values Education is a complex, multi-dimensional concept. The material included must be read with the spirit of continuous reflection on issues of concern rather than hasty rejection if it does not fit into one's conceptualization or behavioural repertoire. Many a time you may find strategies offered do not work out as described or outcomes are contrary to expectations. We suggest limited and gradual trials of skills and strategies, as these may work differently if tried out without proper insight and understanding. The repeated lack of success with same strategies is an indicator of the need to look back, reflect and review the different steps involved in implementation. The expression, 'Values facilitator' has been used frequently in the Handbook; it does not imply that a Values facilitator is different from others. Integrated approach to education suggests that every teacher is a values facilitator . Reflective strategy to record and review efforts made towards building inner and outer value is discussed in detail in the Handbook. It is a technique which is strongly recommended to achieve success during your journey towards imbibing and imparting values. The CBSE presents this Values Education Kit (VEK) so that it can serve as a broad guideline and facilitators who include teachers or peer educators can customize the values and its implementation to fit into their respective institutions and learners. The activities provided in the Values Cards can be used in many different ways, by substitution teachers, in unstructured ways or even at assembly time, through house systems, counsellors or even by peer educators. Schools function through a larger curriculum and innovative teachers will find myriad ways of realising visualised learning outcomes. School Heads possess the unique ability to balance and connect diverse elements that make the whole school a lively and generative space. Their understanding of the goals, mission and vision of education and schooling provides the foundation on which the institution and indeed the nation progresses. (x)It must also be acknowledged that the role of the School Head is a challenging one in today's world. While on one hand the complexity of nurturing the young is becoming increasingly demanding, on the other the expectations of society and stakeholders have grown manifold. Within the specific context of Values Education in school it is vital that school Principals understand the pivotal role they play to ensure that Values Education does not become an academic exercise. S/he should, in fact, allow people within the school, at an individual and collective level to aspire for values based living. This can only be possible if school Principals undertake some of the exercises for teachers and students - set out in the Values Education Handbook for themselves. This will engage them with the diverse aspects of Values Education in their own institution. Greater clarity and consciousness through self reflection will enable them to take decisions about this momentous undertaking, help in guiding and training staff and students; and anticipate and resolve challenges through building supportive relationships and dialogue. Heads of school have to be intensely involved with upholding values of democracy , secularism, justice, equality , freedom etc., which make up Article 51 A of the Indian Constitution. They need to create sensitivity towards an environment of mutual trust and respect between students, teachers and parents. They need a spirit of readiness to support and resolve issues and concerns within all members within the school system. The success may not reveal itself immediately , but Heads can take great pride in the fact that they ushered in a positive change in lives of their students and fulfilled the most fundamental purpose of education by becoming the harbingers of change.

Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well.\" -Mahatma Gandhi 1.1 Introduction Values are essential for positive human behaviour. Education from time immemorial has focused on values. Values form the core of educational goals and objectives. Almost every education policy document has emphasized the role of education in fostering values. Education Commission (1966) recommended introduction of social, moral and spiritual values in the school curricula. The National Policy of Education (1986) also highlighted the need of education for values in removing intolerance, violence, superstition and upholding social, cultural and scientific principles to make India a secular, democratic and progressive nation taking pride in its cultural heritage. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (2000) brought to focus the erosion of ethical, social and spiritual values and suggested the integration of values in the curriculum. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 strongly advocates values like cooperation, respect for human rights, tolerance, justice, responsible citizenship , diversity, reverence towards democracy and peaceful conflict resolution. It also delineates education for peace as a significant national and global issue. The position paper on Education for Peace has also addressed the issue of equipping students with the values, attitudes and sk ills required to live in harmony as responsible citizens with the goal of education for peace (pg.1). Education for values will further equip students to make sensible choices on situations based on values of equality, integrity, democracy, freedom, and human rights. Education is inherently values oriented and must develop in learners caring, co-operation and respect for others. In addition to equipping them with life skills and attitudes, it must prepare them to lead a full life. 2 As a society, the concern with Values Education is not unique to our times but the erosion of values has forced introspection and reflection in education. Values Education is integral to education of any kind and has been focused upon in many educational committee reports in India. Most recently the National Curriculum Framework and the Framework on Values in Schools has been brought out by NCERT . The idea of imparting Values Education is also closely linked with the educational reforms that have been introduced under the scheme of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) . It is apparent that Values Education is an area that needs to be highlighted as it holds the key to real and meaningful education - that engages students in addressing real world challenges, issues important to humanity, and questions that affect them as individuals. 1.2 Values Seeds Values are like seeds that sprout, become saplings, grow into trees and spread their branches all around. Building up of values system starts with the individual, moves on to the family and community, reorienting systems, structures and institutions, spreading throughout the land and ultimately embracing the planet as a whole. Building values is an integral factor in the process of internalization of values because one can only give what one has within. Building values is somewhat similar to building a house, brick by brick. That is why Values Education is to be recognized as a fundamental need. Values based education for all members of society needs to be seen as a valuable investment. Values enshrined in the Constitution of India point towards the principles of equality and social justice and appreciation of cultural values of each other, dignity of all individuals , etc. Values such as equality, fraternity and justice can promote inclusivity where all members of the society feel included irrespectiv e of their colour, culture, economic or social background, caste, religion, gender or community. The culture of inclusivity is particularly relevant and important in the context of our society, nation and making education a right for all children. The aim of education thus can no longer be solely confined to learning of specific culture and its traditions but that of learning and appreciation of multi -culture. - 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' by NCERT 3 The individual is the first building block of the values architecture; for integration to take place the child's need for secur ity, dignity, identity and well-being h as to be met. For a society to be at peace, its individual members need to be protected against violence, injustice, humiliation and discrimination. A child is not merely a physical entity but a holistic being. His/her physical, emotional, social and spiritual need has to be addressed to ensure harmonious development of all aspects of his/her personality. The second factor in inculcating values is the family which plays a crucial role in fostering values in a child. A child growing in a conflict ridden home is unlikely to be peace oriented. Healthy relationships in a stable family create sound values. Home is the nursery for inculcating values. The community to which a person belongs is the third block. The relationship between the individual and the community is intimate. It plays an important role in the identity formation of an individual, and determines the level of security the child enjoys. Values Education goes a long way to minimize the insecurity of communities and to promote a sense of belonging. The society is the fourth building block of values. The society is an extended family which is characterized by diversities of individuals, and the interests of families and communities. Every society also has certain shared characteristics that its members endorse, adopt and employ, which influence the collective decisions taken by it. There is a reciprocal relationship between an individual and the society of which he or she is a part. Social mores/customs/traditions are internalized during the process of growing up within a society. Individuals, families and communities that comprise a society have the duty to avoid pursuits, advocacies, methods and goals that undermine values. The nation is the paramount building block of values. A country that allows its citizen to be overtaken by hate and negativity lets its energies be wasted. Values are basic to progress and well-being. Nations at peace comprise the building blocks of global values. 4 INDIVIDUAL LEVEL - COMPASSION, TRUST, COURAGE, ACCEPTANCE, JOY, SENSE OF FREEDOM, ABSENCE OF CONFLICTS. INTERPERSONAL LEVEL - LOVE, EMPATHY, COOPERATION, LISTENING, ACCEPTANCE OF DIFFERENCES, APPRECIATION, FRIENDSHIP. COMMUNITY LEVEL - RECONCILIATION, TOLERANCE, MUTUAL RESPECT, HEALTHY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, APPRECIATION AND PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENT. NATIONAL LEVEL - RESPECT FOR CHILD/ HUMAN RIGHTS, CITIZENSHIP, FREEDOM FROM BIAS AND STEREOTYPES, NATIONAL INTEGRATION, SECULARISM, INTERCULTURAL - MULTICULTURAL HARMONY. GLOBAL LEVEL - AWARENESS OF GLOBAL ISSUES, PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, APPRECIATION OF WORLD'S CULTURAL HERITAGE, RESPECT FOR AND SHARING OF COMMON RESOURCES. Levels of Peace In our culturally plural society, education should foster universal and eternal values, oriented towards the unity and integration of our people. Such value education should help eliminate obscurantism, religious fanaticism, violence, superstition and fata lism. Apart from this combative role, value education has a profound positive content, based on our heritage, national goals, universal perceptions. It should lay primary emphasis on this aspect. National Policy on Education, 1986 5 1.3 Development of Values Education 6 1.4 The Concept and Context of Values Education Why do we Need Education for Values? Concern about degeneration of values. Impact of change on children and youth. Dys-functional families, increased crime and violence, effect of media and information overload. The competitive mindset among students, parents, teachers. What Value s Education Aims at: Holistic development of the child while addressing the head and the heart. Revisiting values and making everyone aware of eroding values. Creating balance between child and community. An education that connects the heart, head and hand. Inculcating the understanding of Interdependence between family, society, nation and the world. Bringing in a pro -active social conscience. Improvement of t he quality of education. Harmony and peace with self. Value s Education: Challenges Before Schools Need to prioritize Value s Education in the curriculum . Integrating Value s Education into school activities . Defining focus areas and planning for realizing desired objectives. Meaning of Values Values are defined as everything from eternal ideas and guiding principles that lead to desirable behavio ural and positive patterns . They provide an important basis for individual choices based on connecting thoughts feelings and emotions leading to positive action. 7 The Process of Internalising Values Positioning in a socio -cultural context . Socialization (family, schoo l, friends) and cognitive stage (level of maturity) . Reinforcement through experiences and observation. Value s Concerns at School Stage Developing Universal Human Values. Values derived from the Indian Constitution. Developing problem solving attitude towards contemporary challenges. Holistic development of the individual. Responsible attitude towards self and society. Nurturing an ethical approach, collaborative skills and respect for Human Rights. 1.5 An Approach to Values Education All education al programmes attempt at developing children through the provision and facilitation of certain learning experiences which form the larger curriculum of an institution. A programme begins by identification of goals and learning outcomes characteristics that we expect the children to develop. Thereafter learning exercises that will enable children to achieve the intended learning outcomes can help the children towards holistic development. I will give you a talisman. Whatever you are in doubt or when the se lf becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore hi m to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to Swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions? Then you will find your doubts and yourself melting away. Mahatma Gandhi 8 CBSE - VALUE SYSTEMS (Co - Scholastic Areas PART 2B (Attitudes and Values) in the CCE School Based Assessment Certificate) Values are determining qualities of life. There is a very large body of knowledge and lists of values. Article 51 A of the Indian Constitution - Fundamental Duties - provides the most comprehensive list of values that should be inculcated by every Indian citizen. There are 10 principles that form the values framework and subsequently descriptors are specified for each. The ten principles are: (i) To abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem. (ii) To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired freedom struggle. (iii) To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India. (iv) To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so. (v) To promote harmony and spirit of unit y, brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to remove the practices derogatory to the dignity of women. (vi) To value and preserve the rich heritage of our culture. (vii) To protect and imp rove natural environment. (viii) To develop scientific temper and the spirit of enquiry. (ix) To safeguard public property and to abjure violence. (x) To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity which leads to higher level of performa nce. Inculcating Values and Attitudes 9 In addition, the following ten basic themes may also form a part of Values Education in schools. Think positive is a self-empowering concept that allows the student to have a positive self-image and values himself/herself and life in all forms. Be compassionate and do no harm attempts to inculcate love, kindness and friendliness that are important to respond to intolerance and violence in society. Discover inner peace enables an individual to understand the self at a deeper level of consciousness. It also addresses a person's spiritual needs. Learning to live together seeks to promote the qualities of sharing, cooperation, mutual help, building trust and team work. Working harmoniously in groups with others reduces competition and emphasizes the joy of working as a team. Respect human dignity is based on the concepts of Human Rights and Justice. Its objective is to develop a consciousness that recognizes rights of others along with one's own. Be your true self builds behavioural skills such as time management, honesty and strength of character that are essential for resolving conflicts and for effective social interaction. Developing critical thinking involves the ability to think with logic and reason. It also includes decision-making and is an important component of democratic institutions. Resolve conflict non-violently is a basic component of Values Education. It encompasses skills necessary for conflict resolution, active listening, mediation, creative solution and alternative solution seeking. Build peace in the community provides an opportunity for young learners to be exposed to social realitie s and to understand people's problems as well as their own responsibilities and duties. Caring for the planet is a global educational need for children and adults alike. The health of the planet has a direct and immediate influence on the destiny of humankind. 10 It is important to remember that Values Education is not another subject. It performs two important functions in the curriculum. Firstly, it unifies all other subjects under a holistic vision of values. In the absence of such a holistic view the learning done in subjects tends to be fragmentary and remains superficial. Secondly, Values Education humanizes education. 1.6 Concluding Thoughts In designing a Values Education Programme, a school needs a clear vision and approach to ensure the integrity and consistency of the effort. It helps to organize thinking and effort to achieve a goal. Once an Action Plan has been developed, especially in the curriculum, it can be developed spirally, in depth and width, from grade to grade. Our educational policies and the subsequent curriculum frameworks all along have emphasized the need for Values Education but careful analysis reveals that we value those aspects of education that translates into academic excellence and creates opportunities for employment. Values Education is also perceived as an extra workload or an additional programme or activity. After a lot of discussions and reflections on these issues it is clarified that although Values Education goes on constantly in schools it is also true that in order to be effective, there must be clearly defined and explicit focus, direction and commitment for fostering values in the agenda of the school. How to acquire Values Education: The values can be acquired every moment and every day of our lives but some basic parameters and focus area s are: - during the process of socialization eg: immediate family, friends, school teachers, peer group, neighbourhood etc. - contact w ith the br oader community eg: family net work, mass media, work places etc. - habits imbibed as we grow up eg: prohibitions, commands and identification with family and friends, approval and disapproval of actions, deeds etc. - obligations and norms of the en vironment around us eg; shift from must consciousness to ought consciousness. I must not give way to anger reflect compulsion whereas statements like I ought to respect my elders reflect the sense of obligation rather than fear or compulsion. 11 Values enshrined in the Constitution of India point towards the principles of equality and social justice and appreciation of cultural values, dignity of all individuals etc. The values such as equality, fraternity, justice can promote inclusivity where all members of the society feel included irrespective of their colour, culture, economic social background, caste, religion, gender or community. The culture of inclusivity is particularly relevant and important in the context of our society, nation and making education a right for all children. The exploding world of science and technology has many good and bad unintended consequences. How science and technology is to be used is a question of values. The question of social, moral responsibility and the universal, ethical values occupy the natural position in application of science and technology in a more humane and rational way. The values and attitudes can only make difference to guide individual actions based on the principles of fairness, goodness, constructive and critical attitude and wisdom to discern between the potential and pitfalls of scientific and technological advancements. The inculcation of scientfic temper is important for technological advancement Values should not be treated as ideal concepts but as empowering tools which are helpful in meeting the challenges of the contemporary social world -be it religious fundamentalism, environmental degradation, multicultural conflicts, misuse of science and technology, inequalities, ill effects of mass media, globalization, commercialization and so on. India is a multilingual, multicultural and multi religious country. 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' by NCERT 12 Exercise: Self Reflection The teacher can take up introspection exercises in the class with the students. An example is given below. I. From me to we Q1. Who am I? How would you describe yourself as a person? Q2. What issues are important to you as an individual? Q3. What aspect of yourself would you like to change/ improve? Q4. What is the one change you would like to bring in your environment in school / home? Q5. How can you bring about that change? II. My Future Q1. What would you like to achieve? Q2. What are the skills and attitudes you think you need to develop to achieve you goal? Q3. What problems / difficulties / challenges do you see in realizing your dreams? Q4. What / who do you think can help you to achieve your goal? III. Beyond Myself Q1. The reason for lack of values in today's world is: Wealth Without Work Pleasure Without Conscience Knowledge Without Character Commerce (Business) Without Morality (Ethics) Science Without Humanity Politics Without Principles In pairs, discuss and write an article on one of the topic given. Each group in class can develop a presentation on one of the above as a project. 13 Q2. What are values? How important are they in your life? Q3. What values do you stand by / believe in? Q4. What changes would you like to see in yourself in the next one year? Q5. List some of the changes you would like to see in your country in the next three years? Q6. Do you know any person / people / institutions who are trying to bring about a positive change? Q7. What problems do you foresee in achieving your goal? Q8. How would you like to contribute to the betterment of your nation? While teaching political science the teacher was exploring the problems and the plight of people below poverty line and issues like minimum wages, water scarcity etc. During discussion on water problem as to what are the causes of such a state of affairs a few students said that prime cause is that government is not doing its duty. The teacher asked, Who is government? T he boy first got confused a little and then replied, The Prime Minister and other Ministers. The teacher prompted, Yes, and also the other officials connected with water management and supply. The child now was a little more doubtful as the teacher qui zzed further, How these people should function to check water problems? At this the child said, They should make strict law s and fine people. The teacher asked, Do you think rules and laws are not there! What about your school rules? Do children obey t hem? How do you think people should be made to stop from wasting water? The child could only utter that they should check people and make strict laws. The teacher then asked, Are these people supposed to go to each house to check if anyone is wasting wat er. The child said, No! that is not possible, I think we have to be disciplined ourselves. I think it is our responsibility to use water properly. The teacher added that we need to be responsible in use of other resources and public property like, parks, roads etc. as well, if we want to have them for use in future. (Daya Pant) Professor & Head , NCERT 14 Section 2 INTEGRATING VALUES INTO THE CURRICULUM It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning . - Jiddu Krishnamurti 2.1 Introduction Values Education in schools is possible only when each individual stakeholder in the school - student, teacher, parent, management and support staff realizes its inherent worth for the well-being of the learners. This requires adoption and structuring of the curriculum in such a manner that optimizes the transmission and assimilation of values within and outside the classroom. Every lesson, routine activity and environment becomes value-centric and the entire gamut of relationships and processes in the school is thereby strengthened and empowered. 2.2 Curriculum Onion Various layers ' of school practice which can influence the relationship can be represented as the Curriculum Onion '. 15 External Factors : These are the factors to which the Values Education must be related, e.g., school 's surroundings, parental background of students and priorities of each society, and a framework within which the curriculum or the action-plan must be fitted. Hidden Curriculum: All the other things that are learnt during schooling in addition to official curriculum will also involve a host of values, such as performing botany practicals, setting up a garden and thereby learning dignity of labour. Teachers' hidden curriculum could well be students' informal ' curriculum. Through Subject Areas: Values can be imbibed consciously by linking ethics to curricular areas. For example through: Languages- story and dramatisation on social evils. Science-values behind scientific research. History-facing historical issues and reacting to them. Social Science, Geography - How different living conditions affect cultures, value systems and behaviours. Physical Education - Competition versus co-operation in sports, sporting/team spirit. The Lessons Taught: Values can be explored through regularly taught lessons. These need to be carefully planned while implementing the programme. Descriptor based assessment and evaluation is an integral part of Values Education programme and a specified time ought to be fixed for this. When we understand someone else's feelings, needs or ideas, we step up on the ladder of respect. 16 2.3 Values Education and Subjects Values can never be taught in isolation. They cannot be transacted independently from the learning that takes place in the classroom and within the school. 2.4 Inculcating of Values through Continuous and Comprehensive Activities After the identification of appropriate values for Primary, Middle and Secondary; the various Scholastic and Co-scholastic activities are required to be given proper orientation to become an instrument of inculcation of such values. In fact, the values are suggested to be woven in every activity of the school and also in every subject being taught. School environment and academic climate must be so modified that it should give rich experience to the children. The text book material should be correlated with the learning of values by identifying areas in which the desired values may be promoted. Through all curricular programmes, the following are important for inculcation of values by suitably introducing the element of values in every step:- 1. Knowing - The learner must be made aware of the inherent values or ethical issues while going through a particular topic. 2. Making judgments - The learner must be provided with conflicting situations while teaching/ learning to enable him/ her to evaluate the implications of the related values. 3. Believing - Emphasis should be given to relevant points helpful in development of faith in these related values. 4. Action - The learner may be encouraged to practice these values in actual life situations as a result of change in his/her behaviour brought about by relevant and meaningful experiences. Clarifying some fundamental terms: Values - Values are defined as everything from eternal ideas and guiding principles that lead to desirable behavioural patterns and are positive. They involve both the cognitive and affective dimensions and provide an important basis for individual choices based o n connecting thoughts and feelings and emotions leading to positive action. Attitudes - are individual responses to other people or situations or even events that are shaped by their personal values. While positive human values - compassion, and caring, respect and tolerance for others are desirable, they will find reflection in the attitude of nurturing, or destroying the environment; being kind or cruel towards animals, etc. 17 5. Internalization - Through constant emphasis on such relevant ideas, thoughts and actions, the learner should be led to a stage where the practice of acquired values may be spontaneous and immediate leading to acquired positive behavioural patterns and outcomes. It should be noted that Values cannot be t aught like a subject, i.e., like Languages, History, Science or Mathematics. They can only be inculcated through the situations deliberately planned while teaching various school subjects. It is therefore imperative that Values Education be woven into the teaching of subjects. All Languages contribute to the development of skills like listening, speaking, reading and articulation of ideas. The very nature of Social Science (Geography, History, Political Science and Economics) is to understand the human and social environment for developing a humane and values based perspective. Mathematics and the Sciences need to be oriented towards their role and responsibility in fostering values rather than being seen in isolation. Similarly, Sports and Fine Arts (performing and visual) also offer the opportunities to initiate and develop values among students. There are some values that are present in every lesson. They may be articulated directly or indirectly in the form of stories, processes or biographical references. The task of the teacher is to identify the apparent or hidden references to values and use them as reference points to initiate a discussion on values within the subject specific domain. A values centered approach in the classroom will add meaning to each class. Moreover as students engage creatively in the classroom, lesson objectives will be realized effectively. Anything that helps us to behave appropriately towar ds others adds to values of respect and courtesy. Anything that takes us out of ourselves, and inspires us to sacrifice for the good of others or for a great cause is of spiritual value. 18 2.4.1 In the Classroom It is necessary that the teacher plans each lesson keeping in mind the following: 1. Identifying the values of each lesson keeping the lesson objectives and learning outcomes in mind. 2. Develop a strategy to communicate, identifying concepts and the processes and modes of dissemination of values. 3. Device creative mechanisms to communicate these to the students. 4. Reflect and discuss the efficacy of efforts by reviewing impact on affective behaviour keeping in mind the components of Values Education. The teachers must, however bear in mind the stage appropriateness, the time available and the objectives and learning outcomes of the lesson while transacting values. 2.4.2 Teaching Methods Teaching methods for Values Education will involve a variety of ways that blend the formal and the informal instructional processes. The success of Values Education and development in students substantially depends on the vision, motivation, skills, attitudes, values and behaviour of the teacher. 19 Teaching Methods: Discussion starters Drawing distinctions/thinking critically about distinctions Comparisons Good practices Finding examples Thinking about consequences Comparing perceptions Different Perspectives Meaning Analysis arguments Expressing or exploring agreeme nt and disagreement Exploring possibilities Finding criteria Values judgement A student ce ntered approach requires focus on creating - 1. A friendly classroom environment that is engaging and motivating. One of the basic principles is creating a classroom environment, free from excessive competition, threat, or ridicule to allow for unhampered creative expression. It is neither an environment dominated by an authoritarian teacher nor is it an entirely unstructured environment. Rather, it aims at creating an emotional climate for students to experience a sense or feeling of personal worth, trust, dignity and self-confidence, leading to self-discipline . This implies that the students feel welcome into the classroom space and have a sense of ownership about its physical space and human component. They are able to form teams according to task assigned and work in cooperation with one another. This eliminates selfish or self-centeredness among students as individuals. Students ' motivation and initiative is an important indicator of a healthy classroom environment. 20 A few simple activities like beginning the day with sharing the news, greeting one - another on birthdays and festivals or associating a positive value with a child would help in creating conducive classroom environments. 2. Provide opportunities for students to express themselves. It involves allowing children to ask questions that help them to relate to what they are learning in school and relate them to what is happening outside; the trick lies in children answering in their own words, and from their own experiences, rather than simply memorizing and getting answers right in just one way. This will contribute greatly to the building of the student 's self -confidence and self-worth. Children have their own thoughts, views, opinion, ideas, perception arising from their everyday experiences with parents and friends, exposure to the media, etc., but they are not equipped to express it in ways that a teacher might appreciate. Open debates and discussions will allow students to have a clearer understanding about their own beliefs and assumptions, question and modify them. It will engage them in reflection and allow for their character development. Eminent personalities, monuments, events and processes can be highlighted and studied for the engagement of students. 3. Rewarding Creative Approaches The role of the teacher as a facilitator of learning, rather than a repository of knowledge ensures that divergent thinking is encouraged. A spirit of enquiry and freedom to experiment and voice ideas and experiences may prove useful in awakening student's interest and participation. The idea of tolerance and dignity may be thus advocated through songs, symposia, dance, theatre or poetry to name a few approaches. It will assist in the internalization of values and content of lessons as well. Dancing their way to joyful learning 21 The various facets of ethics taken up in Schools 4. The Ethical Paradigm Students must be able to relate values concepts to subject domains as well as to their life ahead. School education is in its broader interpretation preparing students for their adult life so that they become balanced individuals, responsible citizens and are employed; this would be incomplete without Values Education. Fostering values like honesty, discipline, dignity of labour, respect for others, punctuality, commitment and dedication can prove critical to social transformation and dealing with the malaise of corruption and violent conflicts stemming from gender, religion or racial divides. 5. The perspective of the lesson. Personal perspective is your basic attitude to life, the way you tend to look at the world, unconsciously and consistently. It influences your thoughts, opinions , choices, actions and ability to make changes. ' The core focus of the lesson is not merely its content but context too. Good teaching of a subject implies teaching it in such a way that the students gain insight into the nature of the subject, its logical structure, its methods and also imbibe the attitudes and values associated with that particular subject. Presenting the lesson from a humanistic and positive perspective is important. The lesson which inspires, awakens positive feelings and experiences, creates self-awareness, encourages openness and spirit of inquiry in raising questions, explor es, discovers and constructs understanding of values by providing opportunit ies to put knowledge of values into practice is meaningful. 22 A lesson about the freedom struggle of India, e.g., would be incomplete without reference of Satyagraha ' and Ahimsa ' as a form of struggle that allowed for the participation of the masses in the freedom struggle. This will also enable the development of peaceful and rational approaches to understanding contemporary issues and challenges. As the young envision the future armed with knowledge, a capacity for critical thinking, problem solving and decision making, they will be in a position to make informed choices for themselves and the society as its leaders and decision makers. It is essential therefore that the students are encouraged to take the lead rather than follow instructions. 2.5 Teaching Values through Core Subjects Exemplars SOCIAL SCIENCE While asking students to write a paragraph or composition, teachers can give them topics like Teachers, how they treat me'; Class discipline '. Instructions in Social Science should promote values and the ideas of secularism, socialism and democracy. These should help students develop positive attitudes and acquire knowledge necessary for achievement of universal values, e.g., non-violence, increasing economic and social welfare and ecological stability. History has a record of the struggle of mankind- the ir achievements and failures. It focuses on decisions which changed the course of progress of mankind. Geography presents the concept of `one world-unity in diversity' . It teaches interdependence. While learning Economics, stress should be given on values like thrift and saving which results in capital formation, leading to the prosperity of the nation. Civic sense can be promoted by cultivating a sense of belongingness, protecting public property and obeying the rules and regulations in right earnest. Duty is one of the fundamental values. The atomic bomb can kill millions of people' is a statement of fact whereas Use of atomic bomb is wrong' is a judgement of value. ' 23 i) History While teaching values through History it is important that events / happenings are presented holistically rather than in isolation. This would help students to understand the importance of interdependence , i.e.; The view that one person's act can affect the lives of an entire nation can be developed through examples of rulers or governments that have been huge success or failures, whereby creating a sense of individual responsibility that connects with a collective goal. The practical examples in history of oppressions, exploitation, greed and aggression can be juxtapos ed against those of patriotism, compassion, bravery, cooperation, loyalty, justice, perseverance, and responsible decision making by bringing out the events within the date lines of countries and the lives of people who have contributed to world heritage. All this can be done through activities some of which have been designed in the Value Cards and comprise of discussion, debates, drama and role plays which will reinforce the positive values and make learning History lively and interesting. ii) Political Science Discussing socio -political events can be interesting too. 24 This subject has great potential to help develop the understanding of constitutional values like duties democracy, citizenship, human rights, child rights, social justice, patriotism and unity in diversity. The Constitution of India is an extremely important document in which are enshrined all the values essential for nation building. The teacher can use this as a tool for teaching students the values mentioned above. With the growing importance of global citizenship values lessons can be learnt through the study of governance and a variety of political systems that can be seen across the world. Values can also be inculcated through exhibitions, project work, visits, community surveys, discussions on social issues, presentations, etc. This will help in reinforcing the importance of character building which will finally affect change in attitudes at school level. iii) Geography The teaching of Geography as a subject must emphasise the values of oneness, interdependence of countries, unity in diversity, responsibility towards environmental conservation, urgency of preserving natural habitats, respect and love for the flora and fauna., i.e.; While teaching rivers system and weather, teachers can find opportunities to illustrate the values we learn from different things in Nature. How everything is interrelated, originates and merges back into its source. Water is evaporated by the Sun and gathers into clouds and then falls as rain. Another example is how the Earth's structure is formed through tremendous fluctuations of extreme heat and cold. 25 In Geography, we learn about different countries and their borders. It can be explained that there are no distinct borders, i.e.; If we travel by air or sea, we cannot distinguish one country from another. This illustrates that Earth is one unit and we should see things beyond national and international boundaries . Environmental conservation can be brought into focus while discussing how we can contribute in small ways by being conscious of using natural resources and living a simple life. Discovery games, map drawing, environmental games, quiz, role play, brainstorming, etc., can be used to convey important values through Geography. History, Political Science, Geography are all different aspects of Social Science which help in; Developing values that bring out the relationship between cause and effect. Thematic evolutionary approach. Holistic approaches towards looking at people and cultures. Understanding conflict between individual and the society. Appreciation of views and moderation. Development of perspectives and their validation. LANGUAGES Of all the academic subjects, languages are the best means of communication. The students grasp the language easily and the teacher can integrate human values through curriculum . Inculcation of values through language teaching is a great challenge for a language teacher. Generally, people learn a language for communication. They learn a second language especially English for social mobility, to become a global citizen and for better socio-economic opportunities. The second language, which is an additional accomplishment, is related with their mind, intellect and understanding and also their spirit, heart and feelings. It is a language, which 26 connects one person with the other and helps him to know more about others' views, ideas and outlook. Thus, it broadens one's mind, alleviates prejudices, widens outlook and brings people closer. Our values and heritage are preserved through language. The textbooks in languages at the Secondary and Senior Secondary stages are prescribed by the Board. For lower classes the textbooks in languages may be so selected or designed by the school as to contribute to the inculcation of right attitudes and the basic human values-like respect, courtesy, compassion, honesty, tolerance, truthfulness, integrity, national consciousness, a sense of discrimination and spirit of enquiry. Language teachers can successfully inculcate various values through their sessions. Language teaching has an infinite capacity for assimilating Values Education. Language cannot be taught in isolation, away from social situation, nor can values be imbibed sans practice. Using good meaningful values-based text with language learning can invariably make the learners sensitive human beings and conscientious citizens. Language textbooks for all classes should contain stories combined with moral values and the accepted universal values. To help the students inculcate these, the teacher may- i. Ask probing questions, which lead to focus on to desired values. ii. Illustrate with examples- the use of this will help the teacher to present generalizations with the help of relevant and interesting examples. iii. While setting assignments, the language teacher can ask the students to identify good qualities in their favourite heroes, great men and women . iv. The language teacher should create interest in the language through singing, chanting slokas , telling stories and creating situations providing real enjoyment and satisfaction. (a) Values Inculcation through Poetry Recitation One way of inculcating values in students is through Recitation' of good poems. Poems entertain the readers, refine their feelings, and develop their sensitivity, which ultimately make them better human beings. While reading the poems of- 27 William Wordsworth ', the readers should feel union with the spirit of Nature, which kindled the spirit of the poet, and he became one with Nature. Wordsworth has written- And I have felt a presence, That disturbs me with the joy, Of elevated thoughts and a sense sublime. ****** My heart with pleasure fills, And dances with daffodils. ' The sweet and melodious voice of the bird nightingale, which made the poet Keats ' forget the weariness, the fever and the fret of this mundane world, can be appreciated by the learners also when they are properly motivated and inspired. The learners can also learn from the sweet-voiced bird Skylark: - Type of the wise who soar but never roam, True to the kindred point of heaven and home. The learners can realize with Keats ': - Beauty is truth, truth beauty, That is all ye know on earth, And all ye need to know . These feelings refine the hearts, elevate sensitivity and develop love for one and all. Thus over-flowing love, sympathy and kindness replace hatred, jealousy, animosity and violence. These lines of Robert Frost motivate the learners to work incessantly \u2014 The woods are lovely dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. 28 With proper recitation, the poems of Tennyson and Browning can create appropriate atmosphere and motivate the learners to be active and optimistic \u2014 How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnished not to shine in use. (Tennyson ) ****** I was ever a fighter so one fight more --- (Browning ) In the same way, these lines of a famous poet can evoke the feelings of patriotism \u2014 Breathes there a man with soul so dead; Who never to himself hath said; This is my own, my native land! Whereas these beautiful lines of Tagores poem inspire a person to come out of narrow boundaries- Where the world has not been Broken into domestic walls; The poet again prays to God \u2014 Where the mind is led forward by Thee Into ever widening horizons; (b) Values Inculcation through Stories Language is also a great treasure house of good stories. These stories often provide good moral values. Through these delightful, entertaining and purposeful stories, great moral values can be inculcated. Stories of Hitopdesa ' and Panchtantra' always provide some values. Stories like Midas Touch ' make the learner think that money or gol d is not everything in life. The story The Background ' presents a tragic story of a commercial traveller, Henry Deplis who ultimately becomes insane as he is treated as a mobile painting because of a marvelous painting tattooed on his back. This tragic story inspires the reader to consider human life as the most precious on this earth. A famous story The Drought ' by Sharat Chandra Bose unravels the inequitable social order where the poor and underprivileged are mercilessly trampled upon without any hope o f social upliftment. This heart-rending story makes us sympathetic and kind to the 29 plight of the poor and unfortunate who suffer much in our social system. His other heart- rending story Abhagir Swarga ' presents the same theme. A very interesting story 'Maternity ' presents the moral that human feelings transcend all boundaries .In this beautiful story Mikali's famished infant brother is saved due to the kindness of a Chinese woman when Mikali was driven by his own countrymen. Learners can easily perceive that noble qualities like kindness, caring and sharing know no caste, creed or race. In Hindi literature there are highly Atta' besides presenting a realistic picture of our country also evoke feelings of sympathy and compassion for the poor and down-trodden. Even Jai Shankar Pr asads story Chhota Jadugar ' presents a child's innocent joy and his love for his mother , whereas his Aakashdeep ' presents supreme values of love and sacrifice. In pre- independence period, Indian writers succeeded in evoking values of nationalism and patriotism through their inspiring writings. In of millions through their socially relevant works. Stories in language books are an effective tool in inculcating desirable values. Students can also be asked to elicit values from the story by themselves. They can be given opportunity to think and discuss and make up analogies, etc. Literature of all languages presents glorious examples of universal values. Sanskrit language is replete with such values that can guide a person to live life in a proper way. Wonderful epigrams poems like Haldighati, Jhansi Ki Rani, Kamayani, Panchwati which can entertain a person as well as refine his heart making him a better human -being. 'Woh chadhane path jate veer anek- ' these inspiring and ennobling lines can help a teacher to imbibe the sentiments of nationalism and self-sacrifice. Jai Shankar Prasads Kamayani ' presents struggle of against all odds. Rashtra Kavi Maithali Sharan Gupta inculcated sentiments of true nationalism his poetry. Poems of Nirala , Sumitranandan Pant, Sohan Lal Diwedi and Dinkar are highly inspiring. (c) Values Inculcation through examples of Great and Noble Persons Autobiographies, biographies and experiences of great and noble persons also impart ennobling and inspiring values to the learners. Spirit of self-respect of Shri Jagdish Chandra Bose , who refused to accept less salary than the British employees for the same kind of work, can inspire our young generation. The indomitable spirit and patriotic fervour of hockey wizard Major Dhyan Chand who refused to be a coach of a foreign team in spite of financial hardships, may instill the values of love for our nation. His words, If I become a coach of a foreign team and that team defeats India then how will I show my face to others, had inspired all Indians. These examples of courage and fearlessness remind us of the famous lines by Rabindranath Tagore, ' Where the mind is without fear; And the head is held high '. A lesson on Mahatma Gandhi presents his vow to always speak the truth and to serve his parents. Pandit Jawaharl al Nehrus wish to have his ashes scatter ed in the fields of his beloved country after his death may give birth to the same nationalistic feelings. Dr. Abdul Kalams advice to the young generation to Dream always ' may inspire children to be dreamers as well as doers to realize their dreams. Our youngsters can learn from the life experiences of these great and noble people who achieved heights of greatness through sheer hard work, devotion, perseverance and determination. Lives of all great men remind us that we can also make our lives sublime. Abraham Lincolns letter to the teacher of his son may make a person learn the values of self-respect. He writes \u2014 Teach him to sell his brawn and mind to the highest bidders but never to put a price on his heart and soul. 31 (d) Values Inculcation through different Characters Through language, learners get a glimpse of the innermost depths of the complex human heart. William Shakespeares Hamlet ' and 'Othello' ; Charles Dickens David Copperfield ' and Thomas Hardys Henchard ' and Tess' present the timeless and universal characteristics of human nature. Proper understanding of these complex characters can make a person more kind, sympathetic and tolerant. In India Ashapurna Titali ' present a wide range of characters which make the readers aware of the subtleties and inner depths of human hearts and influence the readers to be more humane. A teacher who is the immediate and most important role model must use recitation, storytelling, role-play and dramatization to instill these values in the students. S/he can also use techniques of discussion, questioning and analysis and brainstorming to inculcate these values. A good teacher can go even beyond classroom and include community to instill fine values through practical examples, and demonstrations. S/he can use extracts of good literary works and by using different techniques make them appreciate and imbibe these values. A situation can be created wherein the students role play and are made to experience those values in a simulated situation. Poetry, songs and drama may be used to promote values like friendship, harmony, kindness and peace, etc. Today it has become important to develop a dialogical approach both at the place of work and during day-to-day social interactions . The skill of negotiation and advocacy will help in learning to live together, understanding emotions with the ability to listen and appreciate. All this can be brought out through creative writing, composing value based songs, co-operative story making, cross-word puzzles, activities, word building games, debates and discussions. 32 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE Environmental Science (EVS) books of primary stage are full of opportunities for conveying values of equality, justice, human dignity, rights and caring attitudes towards nature, etc. Many of the textbooks used by schools have exercises built around these themes. The CBSE has also brought out Teachers Manuals which are stage specific and carry age appropriate activities. Under the theme food, sub themes like cooking, eating with the family, and avoiding wastage of edibles can be discussed. The values of cleanliness, good eating habits, an understanding of the under privileged, variety of foods from different cultures, etc ., can be taken up too. Family, relationships and responsibility are also integral to learning EVS. The Life Skills Manual of the CBSE has many examples on Family and Friends ' with sections on Work and Play '. These sections provide ample opportunities for teachers to highlight and promote values of work and the other qualities they appreciate in their family members and relatives. Most of the lessons also ha ve content which enables students to explore intergenerational differences (between old and young), understanding differently abled people which will help to sensitize them towards attitudes of empathy, love, compassion, caring towards themselves and others. 'Life is not about finding yourself, it is about creating yourself'. Edgar Allan Poe. Go GREEN' is the value of the week 33 SCIENCE Science is often equated with facts, knowledge and experiments. The subject matter of Science enables one to develop critical thinking skills, decision making and problem solving skills. While teaching Science, developing scientific attitude is the main aim but a variety of human values can also be developed. While speaking about the qualities of a good spring balance, qualities like sensitivity, stability and consistency can be pointed out. Further it promotes curiosity to learn more and develop scientific attitudes and emphasize how human kind needs to stop exploit ing nature to his advantage. Life Sciences promote values of reverence for nature and the creator. Teaching of Science also promotes values through activities of Eco Clubs, Nature Clubs, Adventure Clubs, Health and Wellness Clubs etc. For instance in the Science textbooks there is a topic on, Refraction of Light, and students observe an illusion that a straight glass rod appears bent when placed in a glass tumbler. The understanding of processes of refraction and bending of lights conveys that sometimes what we are seeing with our own eyes may not be true, just as the glass rod half dipped in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bent but it is only an illusion. As we learn more about properties of light, we know why rod appears bent. Use examples of this kind to illustrate the phenomenon of cultural biases toward others. Similarly the topic of parasitic plants which thrive on each other can be used to explicate how nature supports interdependence. There is mutual support and sharing contributing to collaboration and survival even in plants. Human beings who are at the highest level of evolution must realize this value of survival based on interdependence and collaboration. Observation, comparison and analysis are all skills developed during teaching of Science. These skills can be translated into Values ' that can help students to connect with each other and the community. 34 Wondrous World beneath the microscope MATHEMATICS Mathematics is often considered a subject that is taught in isolation. Mathematics teachers of primary stage can point out the values of attention, precision and aesthetics while teaching shapes, by pointing out how order and harmony results if shapes such as a triangle, circle and star are drawn with attention and precision. But if these are drawn without accuracy, the triangle will not look like a triangle or a circle and star will become something else. The middle school children are taught profit and loss and calculating wages of employees, it is important that teachers relate these to real life situations and question them about the kind of money they get to spend in their families and compare it to the wages some of the poor get. Teachers may also point out the importance of equal wages for men and women thereby highlight ing gender-equality, child labour issues, etc. Similarly while teachin g Senior Secondary students, Differential Calculus, it can be highlighted that even small infinitesimal changes that are measured under this branch of 35 Mathematics is crucial for success or failure of such huge projects like rocket radar operations /launching, etc. Therefore values of precision, accuracy, truthfulness and paying attention to one's responsibilities has important connections with people and society centered to life and living. FINE ARTS (PERFORMING AND VISUAL) There is perhaps no medium greater than the Arts-both Visual and Performing that can help in developing Values. Be it lilting melodies that soothe the mind or powerful lyrics that inspire, mass movements, or even a painting that speaks a thousand words, none of them are confined by boundaries. The Arts offer us tremendous hope, they typify all that man is capable and worthy of intellectually, physically and spiritually. They personify the goodness of the human race. I value my art! A teacher can use this method to encourage critical engagement across the classroom in developing values. Today more than ever before, we need to invoke the Arts and rediscover their healing potential. 36 Through art and culture, we can challenge stereotypes present in the classroom, analyse critical thinking, inspire children towards participating and vision building. Art can also become a political act, a conscious effort to facilitate and participate in social change. Respect, love and beauty, values that humanize us are all present in F ine Arts. Artistic and cultural activities in the larger curriculum of schools 37 SAMPLE PLANS: A few sample plans, subject-wise are given as under for guidance of teachers.

Almost all activities, other than academic programmes, come under the ambit of co-curricular activities. They contribute immensely towards development of students. These activities, often voluntary, are taken up with involved participation and are therefore highly refreshing and creative. The informality and openness generated by these activities help the child to come in close contact with the teachers and their peer group several times, and it is just the right natural environment for values learning. Defining the aim of E ducation in Learning to be ' the most significant document of UNESCO, on Education, the Education Commission states \"the physical, intellectual, emotional and ethical integration of the individual into a complete man is a broad definition of the fundamental aim of Education . A well designed and organized programme of co-curricular activities with its wide range and potential can definitely help the schools to achieve such an aim of Education. The sweep of co-curricular activities in educational process is such that it is possible through them to effectively achieve that the physical, intellectual, emotional and ethical integration. The very significant title of UNESCO d ocument Learning to be ' in itself indicates that education has to be formative in character and not merely informative; that it has to be essentially values oriented; leading to development of an integrated holistic person and that the schools must bring in all such forces, programmes and resources into play which help achieve the very fundamental aim of Education. Co-curricular activities being activity - centered, provide greater participatory feeling among students. The atmosphere being informal and free helps in spontaneous learning and creative experience. Co-curricular activities on the basis of their organizational convenience can be placed in various settings, e.g. , within the classroom, in the school as well as outward-bound activities. Classroom is a mini institution within the larger institution of the school. It carries its own identity, homogeneity and a wide range of talent with immense potential to help its members to grow. With effective utilization of class as organizational structure, as 48 home-away from home, as platform of opportunities, a lot of value learning can take place. Personal rapport and charisma of a Class Teacher can effectively insulate the class from many negative influences. The structure of a class can be used for leadership training and for training in cooperation. A class usually has a set of monitors. The class can be further divided in groups with each group having its leader and carrying out all the given responsibilities for the group, mutually helping each other. By changing the group leaders and even monitors periodically, the training in leadership opportunity can be given to others too. A class can further enhance its structural potential by forming committees for different activities and providing opportunities for training its students. A class should have a class wall magazine board ' which could be used for creative expressions and effective communication besides a lot of information dissemination. A class as a home away from home should be cultivated with great care and the emotional bonding of its members should be further nourished and used for mutual benefit by peer group learning. Education and values go 'hand -in-hand' 49 Education through Health and Physical activities: It is a conviction that Health and Physical Activities can be instrumental in bringing about many of those values that are essential for human beings. A few such values are cooperation, integrity tolerance, trust, community spirit, respect for rules and regulations, organizing capabilities, net-working, human rights, mental and physical health and the possibility of each individual's act ive influence and participation. This is not to say that health and physical activities are unconditionally positive and rewarding to the students. However when used appropriately with a sense of fairness and justice there is a great potential in them to act as a tool for teaching values. Games and sports, N.C.C., Scouts and Guides, Road safety, Red Cross, N.S.S. have specific objectives and a set of values to be inculcated in students while on training. An experience through these activities goes a long way in shaping the commitment and personality of children. Olympics is not merely an event but a sporting culture 50 The Five Educational Olympic Values In November 2005, an IOC Education Expert Workshop reached a consensus on the objectives of Olympic Values Education Programme (OVEP) , its constraints, deliverables and possible implementation strategies. During this think tank ' event, it was agreed that the five educational values of the toolkit would be the pedagogical cornerstone s and a basis of the teaching resource: Joy of effort - Young people develop and practice physical, behavio ural and intellectual skills by challenging themselves and each other in physical activities, movement, games and sport. Fair play - It is a sports concept, but it is applied worldwide today in many different ways. Learning fair play behavio ur in sport s can lead to the development and reinforcement of fair play behavio ur in the community and in life. Respect for others - When young people who live in a multicultural world learn to accept and respect diversity and practice personal peaceful behavio ur, they promote peace and international understanding. Pursuit of excellence - A focus on excellence can help young people to make positive, healthy choices, and strive to become the best that they can be in whatever they do. Balance between body, will and mi nd - Learning takes place in the whole body, not just in the mind. Physical literacy and learning through movement contributes to the development of both moral and intellectual learning. - Olympic Values Education Programme (OVEP) Progress Report: 2005 -2010 51 2.7 Other Activities Other kinds of practical activities with general/specific objective could be further categorized as under: A.

Abdul Kalam 3.1 Introduction: Values cannot be taught in isolation. Values Education needs to be integrated at several levels through the various disciplines and the manner and focus of the content. Values in each lesson need to be identified and communicated to the students so as to lead them towards self-development in a creative manner and awaken in them humane and peaceful perspectives. 3.2 Whole School Approach for Values Education: In the whole school approach, Values Education is woven into the entire programme which comprises of: Interactive practices Interpersonal relationships School activities Rules and regulations by which school is run. The manner in which events are celebrated. The procedure for sharing good practices and assessment Staff development Systemic planning Integration of individual concerned with society The harmony within self and others around 62 Spaces for experiential learning where students explore, think, reflect and internalize positive values. To incorporate values in the classroom a school can follow different methods and practices at various levels. This section provides an insight into such practices. TREE FOR LIFE 63 3.2.1 A Framework for Conducting an Activity The framework for inculcating values in classroom can follow certain basic procedures . 1. Introduce a conflict situation Students should be provided with background materials so as to find out the agreeable and disagreeable arguments. As Galileo said, \"You cannot teach students anything. You can only help them find it for themselves\" . 2. Identifying the challenges Once the argument is put forth, many ideas leading to questions are generated in the minds of students which need to be satisfied. In this process the students connect their questions to answers by identifying the underlying themes and concepts, thus beginning a discussion. Every argument will have its own speciality and if well organised can boost in making the discussion effective. 3. Propose suggestions Once the discussion starts students will have their own perceptions and will respon d to the questions put forth. This will generate agreements, disagreements, confusions in order to find likely potential answers. At this stage students will try to understand various arguments and will not conclude anything. This will make students seek and respect diverse views as well as work collaboratively in a classroom environment. 4. Use reasoning for analysing arguments To make the concepts clear the students should use logical reasoning rather than jumping straight to a conclusion. The students should explore concepts by examining it deeply by categorising, classifying and developing definitions in order to comprehend the argument or subject matter. 5. Conclusion and Evaluation Evaluation is needed to come to a better conclusion as both of these terms are inter-related. It is indeed important to evaluate an argument with the help of a focussed approach by the teacher. But this does not mean that the conclusion is a unanimous agreement or consensus. It means that through evaluation the students should have a better understanding of the argument and its future repercussions. 64 3.2.2 Preparing Guidelines for School Disciplines The school will have standardized guidelines for students. There would be a detailed document highlighting the code of conduct for various specific scenarios in a school environment. The guidelines can be prepared by involving teachers, student council and PTA's. Past experiences can also provide examples of disciplinary action. The document should include recommendations and suggestions for such specific scenarios. The roles and responsibilities of class teachers, co-curricular staff, school leadership, parents and community should be clearly outlined in this document: For example: Students should be given clear guidelines on what to do. A few are enlisted below: a) Morning Assembly - Walk in straight lines and in their respective class rows. Observe silence while the assembly is in progress and at the time of dispersal. b) Respect school property like, library, computer lab, music and art rooms, etc. c) Observe discipline in the corridors while going for extracurricular activities. d) While in a playground - Play games in the spirit of the game, winning and losing are all part of the game. e) During lunch break - Rude and rough behaviour should be avoided at all times. - Help a fellow student who is hurt. - Share tiffin with classmates. - Apologize if someone has been affected by your behaviour. - Observe discipline in the school building and play in the playgrou nds. f) Behaviour during events in the auditorium - During an event in the school premises, be patient and listen to the speaker. - Observe discipline while entering and leaving the auditorium. - Clap when the event is over. 65 Such suggestions can be displayed within the school and placed around the school on display boards, activity rooms, auditorium, school foyer, etc. They will serve as a constant reminder to the students to be mindful of their actions. The whole school staff should be aware of these guidelines to reinforce them. 3.2.3 Developing a Confident Personality Values education focuses on holistic development of a child. For this it is very essential for schools to implement various strategies of developing a student's self confidence. Recognition and encouragement will help in promoting self esteem as children are sensitive to Praise ' and Blame '. Various methods may be adopted to recognize and award values based behaviour i) Values star of the week to be displayed on the Values Display Board. ii) Experience sharing by the star child in the morning assembly. iii) Awarding badges, bands, values certificates, etc., to encourage such behaviour. 3.2.4 Values Based Activities for Developing High Conduct Teachers can design and develop various activities that can be used to: i) Create an engaging learning environment in the classroom. ii) Modelling the values and behaviour that a teacher would want the students to learn. iii) Promote creative thinking and decision making skills to involve students in group activities for co-operative and collaborative learning. iv) Provide equal opportunity to each student of the class. v) Improvise inter and intra communication skills for better relationships. vi) Promote community service to sensitize students towards the underprivileged in the neighbourhood. 66 3.2.5 Values Inspiration for the Day The day should begin by introducing values in the class by the teacher or the student. This could be: i) A talk v) News ii) Poem vi) Instances from biographies iii) Story vii) Quotations iv) Personal Experience 3.2.6 Display Boards in Classrooms / Schools Display Boards can be very meaningful in promoting values in the school. They provide a creative canvas for writing stories, poems, articles, views, etc. Every display board can be either given a Values Theme ' or a value s display board could be made with a separate editorial team. For example values for the week may be:- Integrity, Honesty, Peace, Love, Non-violence and Right Conduct , Compassion, Respect etc. 3.2.7 Values Based Events Schools can orient the events towards values to sensitize students and parents about the significance and importance of values in our lives. They can be in the form of: i) Lectures, Discussions ii) Debates iii) Exhibitions iv) Art and Music concerts v) Display Board competitions A story session in progress 67 vi) Discussions based on motivational and inspirational movies vii) Book readings and book weeks based on a theme viii) Community outreach connect programmes 3.2.8 Identifying Peer Facilitators Peer learning may be useful in values acquisition process. Students can be selected to represent a value for a week or fortnight as peer facilitators . Identify peer facilitators in the classrooms to promote qualities like empathy, patience, co-operation and respect for others. This will help ease and resolve the inter-personal conflicts. The peer will act as a mentor and facilitator for a small group of students. As it would be done on rotation basis, every student will get an opportunity. Teachers should guide and counsel them in resolving the classroom conflicts effectively. 3.2.9 . School Assembly The Morning assembly can be used as a positive beginning to set the tone for a fruitful day. Every assembly can focus on any of the core values like team work, co- operation, persistence, self-discipline, love, peace, non-violence, right conduct, honesty, etc. A 'peer facilitator' is also a 'helping hand'. 68 Each school will identify values required to be nurtured keeping in view their own priority of value concerns which will be appropriate to their cultural conditions and settings. Each school can develop a clear vision and charter of values to be included in their own mission statements. List of ideas for morning assembly: i) Quotation for the day on a particular value by the student. ii) Insight of an incident focussing on any famous personality from around the globe, e.g., Sports Person, Leaders, Statesmen, Businessmen, Media, etc. iii) Group songs on the theme from the school choir. iv) Skits or role plays on the theme. v) Meditation sessions. vi) The value for the day should be reiterated during the day in lessons as well. School Assembly in progress Be Positive: It is important to appreciate the positive features of others. This will help you create a positive environment around you. 69 3.2.10 Connecting Schools with Values Programmes Schools in one area or nearby vicinity can create a value hub in order to promote values amongst students, parents, teachers and community. Inter-school, Inter -club and Inter-class events can be conducted periodically. On the roll themes: - i) Health v) Cultural sensitivity ii) Environment vi) Literacy iii) Gender - role conflicts iv) Safety, e.g., road safety, fire safety, disaster mitigation 3.3 Teachers as Values Facilitators The role of the teacher / educator is pivotal in the dissemination of values in the school system. They are the media which can serve as an effective channel through which learners acquire and act upon values. The staff needs to be aware of this critical role and to take it upon themselves in the right spirit. Teacher training would need to centre around the areas of self-awareness , team building among the staff members, familiarizing them with techniques for the same and how to review the efficacy of their approach. This would enable meaningful interventions to be made by the teachers in the classroom. The pedagogy for values, on the other hand, is grounded on the philosophy that children construct their own theories of how the world works. Teaching for values is Delhi Schools came together for National Literacy Week. 70 not like teaching any other school subject. It is about teaching the learner how to think about something, to reflect, critically evaluate, appreciate one's own values and those of others, develop better communication, better decision-making so that the concepts ultimately find their ways into behaviours and actions. It is not confined to the cognitive level but covers the affective and behavioural levels. For example, understanding of any concept like cooperation is not enough. Ultimately, the task is to ensure that cooperation becomes one's internal disposition. Attitudes, Values and Skills cannot be developed by forcing students to memorise words, and also not by impositions. Experiences and opportunities must be created to internalize such attitudes and values, which can be sustained in the long run. The learner can then take a decision of practicing values, consciously and responsibly. For example, there can be many ways to instil the understanding of compassion. It can be instil led by studying the lives of people who are famous for their compassion. It can be imbibed by experience, the environment of love and kindness at home and school. It can be nurtured by exposing students to the sufferings of others and by encouraging them to serve the needy and disadvantaged. The pedagogical demand for such kind of learning is thus to move away from the traditional banking model to an experiential or participatory model. This model assumes that it is not what you teach but how you teach, that is important, and that is the essence of education for values. In the absence of this, Values Education could become just another duty, prescribed to be done by schools, whereas it has to be the adoption of different ways of interacting, relating and being with students; and using ways of teaching and learning to provide concrete learning experiences. 3.3.1 Teaching Competencies 1. Ability to discern and create learning environment: There are many areas in the curriculum which the school can use to teach required values. Through staff meetings and discussions the values considered appropriate and necessary should be woven into the lesson plans. The teachers should note that the teaching of right attitudes and values is as important as the teaching of concepts. We cannot differentiate values from knowledge nor can we teach values without a relevant context. 71 2. Ability to use instructional strategies: Once the content for teaching values has been finalised the teacher should be able to use instructional techniques or strategies as appropriate to the student's age and abilities. The teaching of values is a two-pronged affair. The teacher teaches values inherent in the concepts being taught and also teaches general values of social behaviour and humanity in the way the class is conducted. It is important that teachers are given training in techniques like pair work, group work, group learning etc. The output from group work, projects and school activities should be given appropriate credit. 3. Sensitivity to the conflict of values that may occur: The teacher should understand that in a pluralistic society where changes are taking place rapidly, there is bound to be conflict of values. The ability to deal with such issues sensitively and in a non-judgemental and open-minded manner should be developed through workshops, brainstorming sessions and role-plays. Teachers can use these techniques in class for a meaningful exploration of such issues as they come up. 4. Exhibit intellectual integrity: One of the most important values students should absorb, to be effective participants in a civilised and modern society is intellectual integrity. Without this, quality or excellence cannot be achieved. Hence, teachers training should develop this value in all their interactions with students. During pre-service and in-service training a deep commitment to excellence should be emphasised. The internationalization of values is not just about teaching meanings, content, terms A teachers training session by CBSE 72 and definitions but the entire gamut of relationships, processes and strategies which are designed to enhance learning. The teacher should not only verbally define and communicate the values in the classroom but also model them in his/her conduct. 5. Show sympathy and consideration: Tolerance for other's viewpoints, an ability to look at issues without prejudice and with clarity are attitudes all our students should develop. They would be better able to do it better if teachers themselves displayed such attitudes in class. Teachers can develop these values through wide-ranging projects, debates and exposure to different points of view. Conducting seminars and courses for the personal and intellectual growth of teachers is an effective way of renewing commitment to these values. 6. Ability to draw out shy or quiet students: Teachers should attempt to involve all students in class discussions or activities. Through group work all students can be encouraged to participate. The more confident and articulate ones should be taught to listen to and consider the opinions of the quieter or shy ones. 7. Ability to monitor and evaluate: As in any other learning programmes, it is important to assess and monitor the progress of the students. However, as far as values education is concerned the evaluation cannot be through examination at the end of the year. At the most, subject exam could include a few questions that test the values e.g. in Science, questions on the scientific process, need for conservation, attitudes towards pollution etc., in Social Science questions on equality by professional counsellors which will give teachers a feedback on their students. Feedback could be provided to parents when necessary. From the above it can be seen that the teacher can inculcate values in two ways a) by being a good role model and b) by being a skilled teacher who can create relevant learning situations in class and use the appropriate strategies or techniques. Students absorb what they see much more readily than what they are 73 told. The teacher should be aware that her/his attitude, behaviour-pattern and actions can strongly influence her/his students. Ways of motivating the teacher a) Inspirational lectures Inviting inspiring people to talk to and interact with the staff and student is one such way. The school could organise a regular guest speaker programme where speakers address the staff every month if possible. b) Workshops and orientation programmes Refresher programmes and peer discussions can serve as constant reminders to what needs to be done and provide the inputs and required skills. Techniques such as brainstorming sessions and role play can help develop the competencies needed. 3.3.2 Teacher as a Mentor Teachers conduct the symphony of education. The success of the initiative for values development in students substantially depends on the vision, motivation, skills, attitudes, values and behaviour of teachers themselves. It is for this reason that a teacher is compared to a gardener who is a facilitator nurturing young minds and planting seeds of knowledge and values in students, watering them with care and kindness. It is his/her attitudes, values and relationships that determine the nature of the classroom climate. This is particularly true in the Indian context where teachers have always been respected. The educators' role is therefore : (1) to facilitate the learners awareness, (2) to help them examine their choices and preferences, (3) to enable them to have dialogue on values issues, (4) to expand their ways of looking at things, understanding situations and events, and (5) to act according to their well thought and responsible decisions. By humility we acknowledge the dignity of all people, acknowledge the virtues of others and learn a bit more about ourselves in the process. 74 3.3.3 Student Expectations 1) Attention and encouragement i) Encourage every good attempt of the student. ii) Listen to the student with warmth and patience. 2) Building positive self-image i) Help him/her identify strengths and weaknesses. ii) Pointing out the errors and weaknesses of the student should not be done in front of the whole class. 3) Feeling of Trust and Dignity i) The teacher should know all the students personally. ii) All teachers ought to be objective and avoid favouritism. Read the case study given about a teacher who made a resolution after learning what her class thought about her. Discuss the case in group . Mrs. Jain rushed from the staff - room to the corridor towards her class. She had been preparing an assignment for her students and had been delayed by over five minutes. The thought of the pandemonium in the class made her step even brisker. There was a strange quiet as she neared the class. \"The lit tle devils seem to be well behaved,\" she thought to herself. Her disciplinarian ways seemed to be working their magic. Just as she was about to enter she stopped in her tracks. From inside she heard student voices imitating her. \"Stand up,\" said one. \"Don t fidget,\" screamed another. \"Why is your work never complete?\" \"What you need is sound thrashing\"...It went on with every child participating in the mimicry. Mrs. Jain was angry. \"The little rascals \" she thought to herself - \"today I am going to teach them a lesson.\" She turned the doorknob and pushed the door open. Just as she entered a voice as if her own echoed \"You little rascals. Today I am going to teach you a lesson .\" Her eyes welled with tears and she felt a lump in her throat. The class fell silent expecting the worst remonstration, but none came. No one spoke and the bell rang. As she walked out of class Mrs. Jain made a resolution. Can you guess what it was? Be Polite: Nobody likes arrogant people. Humility and simplicity are values that never fail to generate respect. 75 3.3.4 Methodologies for Values Education A society educates its young so that they become responsible for their well-being and contribute to the progress of the society, while maintaining its inherent character. This necessarily means inculcating in the young, the values cherished by the society. In a given society, one has to take into account the varying cultural, regional and religious sentiments before deciding the values that are to be emphasised. The methodologies employed to instil these values also need to be sensitive to individual sentiments and needs. There are many influences through which a child forms its attitudes and values. The school is certainly one of the most important of these influences and it is worthwhile to find out the ways in which a school can most effectively carry out this duty. As pointed out above, Attitudes and Values are best imbibed through experiential and participatory modes of learning. Some experiential and reflective strategies which can be used and appropriately integrated with curricular areas and activities in schools are discussed here. Some are more suitable for elementary stage and others are for secondary and senior secondary stages. In view of the complexity of the process of values development and the broad range of values to be nurtured, appropriate strategies for different stage/s need to be identified by schools. A Three - Tier Approach A school has to impart many kinds of learning to its students like the learning of concepts, rules and principles, aesthetic discrimination etc; through problem solving and other skills. Inherent to the acquisition of these kinds of learning is the development of the right attitudes and values. Before going into the methodologies of imparting values to students it is important to realise that values cannot be entirely taught as a subject in school and the inculcation of values cannot be left only to the moral science or values education teacher. Every teacher has to be made equally responsible for this undertaking inside and outside the classroom, for values education truly permeates the entire learning process. At the same time, we must keep in mind that we cannot draw up a list of values that will be enough and true for all people. It is imperative that we also allow the students to decide the values and resolve the conflicts of values that they may face. The point being emphasised is that education cannot be separated from values education . 76 Every learning programme has an explicit and an implicit curriculum. Indeed it is very difficult to create a direct or explicit curriculum for values education for it tends to become rather rigid and insensitive to the immediate needs of the students. Hence, the learning environment or situations for developing desirable attitudes and values can be seen in the entire curriculum; in the teaching strategies adopted in the class; as well as in the subject matter which can be used to illustrate certain values. In both the content and the process of education, promoting values is the hidden or implicit part of the curriculum. Certain strategies are suggested below. A. Silent Sitting Silent Sitting has been considered an important strategy which helps in the habit of reflection, strengthening the inner being or self, consolidating information received and retaining what is essential. It helps in concentration and assimilation, clear thinking, memory, health, vigour and also helps one to be in tune with the self. Some experiments have shown that silent sitting helps in improving self-confidence, ability to get along with others while reducing negative emotions and experiencing calm. This can be used in all classes or subjects. Before starting the actual teaching, two minutes could be spared before beginning of the lesson in every subject. It serves as a warm-up exercise especially for younger children. Teacher should ask the students to follow these instructions during the sitting: Sit straight and close your eyes. Back straight and hand on your thighs. Focus on your breathing. Be aware of all the sounds in the surroundings; ignore all irritations of the body. After a few minutes rub your hands and place them on your eyes. Now open your eyes. The biggest mistake we often make is to think that others or situation or circumstan ces led to the wrong decisions in our lives. 77 B. Visual Experiences Teachers can use symbols, drawings, posters, charts, cartoons, graphs, photographs and pictures and auditory and kinesthetic experiences which are as compared to verbal mode, less abstract and more powerful for communicating of attitudes and values; and forming imagery in the early primary years of schooling. The Art is a strong visual experience C. Story Telling Stories provide a wonderful way of engaging learners with ideas and situations at all levels. They allow for exploring and expressing thoughts and feelings through their characters, plot or messages. Whether it is Panchatantra or Jataka tales from the Indian tradition or Aesop's Fables or The Thousand and One Nights from other parts of the world, stories and their narration have been integral to human heritage. At the primary stage, stories awaken interest and awareness among learners with respect to their environment and their natural curiosity can be guided towards 78 inculcating values with respect to the school and family. Themes like respect towards elders, social interdependence and honesty can be woven within stories and children can be asked to draw meaning or a moral message from the same. Similarly, leaving the story open-ended or asking a student to be a given character from within the story is an effective technique for communication of ideas, thoughts and beliefs of others. At the upper primary and middle school level students can be asked to create their own stories based on given values that they consider to be important - Patience, Honesty, Discipline. They can also be asked to share anecdotes from real life situations that convey social prejudice or co-existence and ways to deal with social issues. For senior students, the teacher or any student can begin with a story and each student can contribute towards its completion. Example: - This morning while coming to school, I saw a poor child begging for food... The water in the river began to dry up, so... D. Enacting Acting is a way of presenting ideas through performing them out for an audience. This allows the students to engage closely with the content and context of a story or given situation. A focus on the message or its value as represented by the characters can be kept in mind as students involve themselves in writing the script, organize the performance and rehearse their parts. Acting opens a world of expressions 79 So also, role-play by students as their parents can be used to open a discussion on gender roles; those as a worker or peasant can be used to sensitize them towards the values of effort. As students assume the character of an individual from a given lesson, their learning will be more enriching and meaningful. It will also help improve their communication skills. The entire class can be involved in the discussion that follows. E. Group Singing Group Singing is important as values in the lyrics of the song remain in the consciousness for a long time. Group signifies the unity, towards a common purpose or goal, co-operation, discipline, self-restraint and the spirit to accommodate. Selection of a song is important and could be chosen to reflect any one or a group of values. Example: (a) Love of nature, motherland (b) Respect for one's heritage and other's culture. The Values Education Kit ' also comprises a CD which consists of the songs based on themes of Peace, Values and respect for Nature. F. Group Activities Group activities provide opportunities for learning of many values concurrently. Development of fundamental values of love, tolerance, cooperation, peaceful co-existence and respect for others is important. By working in groups, students learn the value of each other's sincere efforts, joy of doing one's best for the good of the whole group. The various group activities are: (i) Games (ii) Group discussions (iii) Group projects, etc. A group activity can create wonders 80 The group activities could be used in teaching of subjects as well. The manner in which such activities are organised is important. G. Role Plays This is another technique where students work in pairs or in small groups of threes or fours. Here students are given a situation which involves finding out the solution to a problem. Each one of them is then asked to take on the role of any one person in the situation under consideration, put himself or herself in their place and act out their role. This gives the student an opportunity to get into the skin of another person and explore the situation from that point of view. Role plays can be used as a methodology for inculcating values where the emphasis is not on the acting capabilities but on the projection of ideas/values and analysis of the same. The analysis brings out why a person should or should not accept the values in question and act on all occasions upholding the same. The process of acting out helps in better understanding and reinforcing the importance of values. Role plays can be conducted according to the age group involving the processes of seeing, judging, acting, and internalizing. The presentation of the role play is just one part. The real and crucial part is reflection through which attitudes change and growth in values takes places in reflecting. The art of conducting role Learning through Role -play 81 plays and using them particularly for younger students requires orientation and practice. The whole process of teaching through role plays revolves around: (i) Acting out the story a. Moral stories b. Panchatantra stories c. Reflection upon any recent incident and the value it communicated. (ii) Miming of various behaviours so that the student understands difference between acceptable and unacceptable behaviou r. a. Give the same scenario to 2 groups and ask one of them to mimic the acceptable one and the other to mimic the unacceptable behaviour and then ask the class which one they prefer. Role play in groups or pairs - Students are divided into pairs or small groups. Each group is asked to choose one problem and work out the solution to that problem through role play. In each group one student is asked to take the role of the adult while the others act like children or young people. The student who takes the role of the adult is asked to look at the problem from the adult's perspective. After the role play, group discussions, the whole class is brought to discuss the effects and results of their role play. H. Discussion The idea of Discussion is not unfamiliar. There is no subject in the curriculum in which discussion among students either across the whole class or in smaller groups cannot be initiated. Discussion can serve as a means for other students to deliberate on certain social, political and moral issues where values, as such, are not the focus of discussion in their own right but are underlying the topic. For example, dilemmas and issues related to; (a) Social justice (b) Human rights and freedom 82 (c) Environment, ecology, population control (d) Peace and disarmament, etc. These can be used for discussion in teaching Social Science. Not only this, all occasions and episodes in daily life related to adolescent issues (a) Why /when children rebel , (b) Show wild impulses, get vexed, (c) Become sulky, and depressed . These can be discussed to enable the children to arrive at informed directions and conclusion. I. Values Clarification: Values Clarification is used for problematic situation, with conflicting alternatives or equally competing values. This strategy allows one to choose one out of the two, reflect on what is chosen and what is valued by the person. It aims at helping students look closely at their ideas, behaviour, attitudes thereby accepting what they really value. Imposing one's own ideas or moralizing what the teacher thinks is right or wrong should be deliberately avoided, for example: (a) Asking students what they value most and why? (b) Who is their role model at home, school, in general and why? (c) Discuss any current accident or incident relevant to them and seek their opinion. (d) Ask them what they would do if they were President, Prime Minister, Chief Minister or their parents in a specific context or scenario. J. Reflective Practice A key component for Values Education is allowing time for self reflection. If students are given time and space for thinking back on their experiences, they can then begin to see what is important to them, where mistakes are being made, where things can be improved and so on. The significant point to remember is that any kind of activity must be followed by reflection on a 83 particular experience. Reflection is not enough on its own. What matters is the effect it will have on self. The real benefit of reflection is to be able to see things in a new light. The ability to effect change in one's attitude is perhaps the greatest strength of reflective practice. Reflect, Connect, Act... Journal writing is a powerful strategy for internalization. It can take different formats. Story-writing on imaginative and life-related themes and characters would provide both affective and cognitive experiences. This kind of personal story- writing linked to one's own life and contexts, as the characters play out their life by gaining or losing values, becomes a powerful tool for personal reflection, values internalization and decision making. (a) Writing a diary for daily learnings and activities (b) Creating timelines for self improvement (c) Drawing your achievements chart/graph 84 K. Literary Skills Students can be encouraged to create poems, stories and drawings on a given topic. This provides them with freedom of expression. 1. Hold art, poetry and creative writing competitions with values as the theme. 2. Publish selected entries in the school newsletters and magazines. L. Brainstorming In this technique the teacher expects the students to express their ideas on the topic under discussion. These ideas are the collated and used for further activities on the subject. For example : Teaching objective : Sensitising students to the need for tolerance and consideration. Teaching Strategy : Brainstorming - The teacher asks the students to give their ideas on the problem they face with adults in their lives. All the points are summarized and then finally discussed. Drawing is a window for expressions. Creative thinking is not a talent, it is a skill that can be learnt. It empowers people by adding strength to their natural abilities which improves teamwork, productivity and wher e appropriate, profits. Edward de Bono 85 3.4 Mentorship Programmes Schools can organize trainings for teachers in-house or by external experts in Values in Education. Teachers who attend programm es on the same subject outside the school should disseminate their learning' s to the fellow staff members. A yearly calendar can be maintained and trainings be assigned on a rotational basis giving every staff member a sense of ownership, an opportunity to learn and share with colleagues. An in - house teachers' interaction Learning is fun for ALL - even the educators 86 3.4.1 Empowering Teachers It will be necessary for the staff to meet in groups to identify the curricular areas where values can be emphasised and decide the classroom activities and strategies to be used. Empowering teachers to decide what they should teach and how they should teach always makes any programme much more effective. Even if initially teachers seem to be unable to agree or decide they will, with time and experience, be able to plan their programme. As teachers implement the benefits of their programme they will gain confidence and interest. An exchange of experiences and ideas with each other will ensure the continuation of the programme. However, follow up and continued motivation by the head of the school will be necessary. 3.4.2 Leadership Club The school can create a committee of teachers who can coordinate the programmes for promoting values in the school. They should be provided support and encouragement by the management in creating a Modal Value School '. The leadership club may design and develop various activities in order to promote Values Education such as:- i) Creating a values policy for the school and the staff, parents, students and leadership. ii) Develop ing a resource bank on values. iii) Conducting seminars, lectures in values aided learning in all subject areas. iv) Organizing field trips related to values, e.g., visit to old age homes and orphanages. Responsibility is recognizing that we are our own masters in life and that we are solely answerable to our own selves for every act, every choice and every decision we make or execute in our lives. It requires thought, effort, knowledge and care. Most importantly, it req uires our own accountability. 87 3.5 Learning Approaches The basic approach adopted in child-centered education is the experiential learning method. For this the teacher has to select suitable activities relevant to the subject content. Through these activities children discover knowledge for themselves. Experiential learning is effective in learning concepts, values and attitudes. Peace Education uses this approach as a basic method. It is useful here to discuss how to present and conduct learning activities in a class. A learning activity here means a learning experience provided to students to discover certain concepts, generalizations, values and attitudes relevant to the lesson concerned. A good learning activity has the following characteristics. - It is game - based or an interesting activity - It is well structured - It provides a meaningful learning experience - It is appropriate to the level of the learners - It is challenging - It inspires self -development Making learning 'fact'ful 88 Some of the modes of delivery or interactive discussions and illustrative activities are as follows: (i) Debate Debate is an activity that develops the ability to present logical arguments for and against a given topic, which can arise from social issues or contemporary concerns, e.g., 'The Role of Women in Society Development is negligible '; 'Spare the rod and Spoil the Child '; 'Media Censorship is a Necessary Evil '; 'Indian Democracy - Success or Failure ', The Reducing Ratio of Female : Male a Concern '; 'Issues of Migration '; 'Non Violence '; 'Food and War ' and so on . Debating allows a two way approach to understanding an issue. The skills of public speaking, critical thinking, confidence building, listening, presenting counter arguments and questioning an idea are developed. Debates need not be always formally organized. In the classroom context, students can be divided into two groups and select a topic that concerns them, e.g. - Television v/s Books. The two groups discuss the issue for and against and choose a leader as their speaker. The speakers of both the teams can be given three minutes and the group can arrive at a judgment depending upon the arguments put forward. This method also identifies group leaders and enables students to think collectively and individually. A verbattle form of debate can also be introduced: Verbattle is the acronym of Verbal Battle. It is a platform for debate and dialogue which fosters leadership development and promotes civil tolerance in society and is expressed in the form of events, programs and competitions with Verbattle Debate being the biggest. It has a subtle purpose to attempt to awaken the superior human spirit in the youth. 89 A verbattle in progress These debates are not about the participants sticking to their point of view and arguing the same. It is unique in that it makes the participants see the other side of the argument and try and understand the opponent's point of view. It believes that if people try to see the other side of the argument, understand the other person's point of view and if possible, step into the opponent's shoes to understand the reason for his or her view, most misunderstandings can be sorted out and most conflicts resolved. In that way a debate is not just about talking but also about listening and particularly, listening in order to know and to understand. It aims at making children and youth more civilized, sociable, democratic and tolerant. Verbattle debate competition is manifold in its purpose which is to identify the best team among those participating in a particular Verbattle event based on the following: Whether The team practices desirable democratic values and systems. The team has conducted itself well throughout the event. The team members can think on their own even though they have enough opportunities to seek help and gather information. The team has appealed to the intellectual and emotional instincts of the audience. The team members respect each other's capabili ty, knowledge and opportunity and use the time and space accordingly to put forth a well- balanced and convincing argument. The team is good at even talking against a point of view they are strongly in favour of. 90 They can talk continuously even extempore but not lose track and fill even such a talk with necessary facts, figures and arguments. They can comfortable slip into their opponent's shoes and see their side of the argument. It helps to realise that people who don't necessarily agree with one another can have a peaceful coexistence. (ii) Colloquy A colloquy is a formal discussion. At the very onset it requires a moderator, who needs to have expertise in the following; a) Knowledge and familiarity/ understanding of the topic selected. b) Ability to steer a discussion by giving a chance to all participants. c) Issues related to national and international policy matters. d) There should be a one year gap after XII for community work. The discussants should have already researched and prepared the topic. Speak for two minutes each by turn. It can be done in a round table setting. They also listen to others' view point . At the end of the discussion the rest of the students sitting and observing in the class can question and express their views. Fish Bowl The fish bowl is an extension of the colloquy. A small group is selected informally to sit in a circle for discussion while the listeners form a larger concentric circle outside to critically analyze and listen to the topic of discussion, the views and arguments that are put forward. The group in the center is considered to be the fish bowl. (iii) Balloon Debate Objective: To help students to think about issues and form opinions on them. The issues and the opinions formed are then discussed in a group. 91 Material Needed: A virtual balloon can be created using chairs, etc. Instructions: The facilitator creates a list of people with very different backgrounds. These may be famous individuals, characters or types of people from the present day or historical figures. Each student chooses or is given a person to be. Each student is given time to think about his or her character and identify some reasons why this person is important to society. The facilitator explains that the group is in a make - believe hot air balloon which is losing height. To stay in the air, a person must leave the balloon. Taking turns, each person explains why their character should be allowed to stay in the balloon. Once everyone has spoken, the group must decide who should be evicted from the balloon. This can be done by taking a vote and the person with the most votes leaves the balloon. The process then starts again, as the hot air balloon is still losing height so that another person must be removed until there is only one person left. Each time the student should think of a different reason why he or she should stay. At the end of the debate, students can discuss why the people left the balloon in the order they did, and were the characteristics or skills an d attributes of the people who seemed to be the most and least valuable to society. It is important that even when their character is no longer in the balloon the students listen to the debate so that they can participate fully in the discussion at the end. Suggested Topics: 1. Lavish weddings - wastage of food and money. 2. Age of driving licence. 92 3. Euthanasia. 4. A school with no uniform. (iv) Balloon Prayers Objective: To help students develop empathy and write short prayers on behalf of others (Prayers here simply means the students expressing their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations in relation to the selected topic). Material Needed: Balloons, paper, pens or pencils Instructions: A topic is chosen in relation to the project being taken. Each student is given 2 - 3 minutes to think about this topic and what it means to them. Each student has a pen and a small piece of paper. On the piece of paper each student writes down a short prayer in relation to the chosen topic. Once the prayer is written it is folded up and placed in an un-inflated balloon. Each balloon is then blown up with a separate prayer inside. The blown up balloons are then used in a game or batted around the circle. At the end of the class or once the balloons are mixed up the students can burst the balloon and read the prayers out loud. The sentiments expressed by the students will be a measure of their understanding of the topic and their empathy towards the people involved. Alternatives: Students can be asked to write and read their own prayers or work together and develop their own prayers on a topic related to their project. (v) Just a Minute Objective: To help students to share views and opinions on a subject and organise their thoughts. Material Needed: Paper (or cards) and pens 93 Instructions: Topics concerning different values are written on cards. Each student in the group is given a card and some preparation time. Each person then takes turns to speak for just one minute about the topic. Once everyone has spoken there can be a discussion on the views expressed by the students on the different aspects of the subject. Alternatives: Topics could be given to a team to prepare with one person nominated to speak. The students could take turns to speak to their team rather than the whole group. Suggested Topics: 1) Honesty 4) Patriotism 2) Environment 5) Discipline 3) Empathy 3.6 Evaluation It is important that every school prepares an annual plan for implementation. We realize that there will be variety of ways for planning and implementing values education in schools. Some of the basic assumptions and broad steps involved in initiating the process of planning and focusing on the values within the existing curriculum by a team of teachers and principal are highlighted here. Some of the broad questions that should be kept in mind while preparing and evaluating the school plan are: 1. What the school proposes to achieve in terms of Values Education? 2. What educational experiences would be provided? 3. How could these be meaningfully integrated with the entire curriculum? 4. How the school ensures that these are being achieved? 94 3.7 Innovative Approaches The context of values and the ways of communicating them to children are dynamic, and engaging methods need to be constantly explored. 3.7.1 Diverse Pathways: Heritage Walks \"Heritage showcasing for young school children really implies stretching the borders of learning to an experiential level and can cover social, political and economic issues.\" - Dr. Navina Jafa Visits to cultural and historical sites are a means for educators and students to examine roots, and acknowledge differences and recognize commonalities. Educators would be required to select a particular value that could then be encased in the title and create a frame within which the presentation of a dynamic cultural-scape could be choreographed. Walking past the historical lane Preserve your heritage 95 The need for educators to build on and communicate the commonalities rather than differences that exist between communities (who perceive themselves as opposing groups of people) must be emphasized. Teachers/educators must make children aware of these commonalities between diverse communities. They must bring to their notice, through discussion, the differences between the communities, as also notions of diversity and richness in and between cultures. 3.7.2 Personal Identity The idea of multiple identities that an individual possesses and how these get stuck in stereotypes or an unreasoned categorizing of individuals and groups needs to be talked about. Discussion on the notion of multiple identities - religious, caste, and gender among others ought to highlight bot h commonalities and diversities that exist as parallel realities in order to educate the young and enable them to broaden thei r understanding of the other . 96 Values enshrined in the Constitution of India include the principles of equality and social justice and appreciation of cultural values of each other, dignity of all individuals, etc. The values such as equality, fraternity, justice can promote inclusivity where all members of society feel included irrespective of their colour, culture, economic or social background, caste, religion, gender or community. The culture of inclusivity is particularly relevant and important in the context of our society and nation, and making education a right for all children. The exploding world of science and technology has many good and unintended bad consequences. How science and technology is to be used is a question of values. The question of social, moral responsibility and the universal, ethical values occupy the natural position in application of science and technology Universal Values go hand - in - hand In the age of increasing intermingling of communities and cultures, it is important that diversity within the Indian society is appreciated based on un iversal principles. Universality and diversity may seem to be incompatible but both have to co -exist in a democratic and diverse society like ours, where values of democracy prevail while at the same time differences are also fully recognized and respected . Similarly, India is a country where different religious faiths adds to its diversity. It is at the core of the identity of majority of our people, an important force influencing their attitudes and values. - Education for Values in Schools - A Framework by NCERT 97 Technology enhances learning capabilities 3.7.3 Technology and Media Two of the most visible changes the 21st Century is witnessing are in the realm of technological advancement and the expanding presence of the media. It is also an undeniable fact that these have a powerful bearing on young and impressionable minds. We need to find ways to use them to enrich the teaching-learning spaces and open new vistas and opportunities. While the use of technology for its sake alone needs to be safeguarded against powerpoints, film clips, virtual tours of heritage sites can be used to initiate a dialogue on values. Similarly, media can play a significant role in education but it is overwhelmed by the symbols of the market. Media literacy is one of the most important aspects of 21st century learning and its potential needs to be tapped to generate awareness and sensitivity on a wide range of social issues. There is, however, a space that lies above hardware, cyber or virtual reality, where a sense of learning resides, which we can access. We need to create more such spaces to enter into a rapidly transforming world, where the future depends on our ability to access knowledge through values. Using clips from popular Hindi or local language films, the importance of cinema in making and breaking stereotypes can be examined. For example, a collage of film clips that revolve around the religious and communal issues can be used to initiate a discussion on identity and diversity. 98 Mass Media could be used creatively by educators to address socio-political issues within the classroom, as often intentionally or unintentionally cinema does provide avenues for challenging rigid beliefs and exploring solutions for intractable conflicts. Often cinema constructs and perpetuates stereotypes that circulate in society. However, it can also be used to initiate public discussion and questioning of these very stereotypes. Values Education can be achieved through media literacy by reflecting on advertisements or programmes and the value messages that they convey. Learning will lead to practices within the classroom and outside. Prejudice reduction, constant reflection and adoption of an inter-disciplinary approach would be central to this exercise.

It can take different formats. Story - writing on imaginative and life-related themes and characters would provide both affective and cognitive experiences. This kind of personal story- writing linked to one's own life and contexts, as the characters play out their life by gaining or losing values, becomes a powerful tool for personal reflection, value internalization and decision making. \"Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become character. Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.\" - Buddha Reflection Reflection is a process of learning; it reviews our actions and intentions. An exemplar of JOURNAL WRITING from Shiv Khera can be a suggestive tool for students at home and in class. If a journal is maintained for a month, it becomes a HABIT. Habits are a form of conditioning, because a greater part of our behaviour is habitual. If we have positive habits, we are a positive character. The two methods widely used for conditioning the mind are: 1. Autosuggestions - Autosuggestions are positive statements of the kind of person we want to be and they are made in the present tense. 2. Visualization - Visualization is the process of forming a mental picture of the kind of person we want to be and they are also made in the present tense. Examples of positive autosuggestions are: a. I am improving at Maths. 102 b. I am good at sports. c. I feel energetic and strong. Whenever we do something positive in life, even if no one is watching, we rise a little bit in our own eyes, our self-esteem goes up, our attitude becomes positive, we become more productive everywhere and our relationships become stronger. A PLEDGE: A step by step easy to use action plan to developing values is to take a pledge. A pledge that reiterates commitment towards positive autosuggestions. Autosuggestions: I am honest and trustworthy. I am relaxed, cool, calm and collected. I am hard working. I am a caring person. I am a good listener. I am courageous. I practice healthy habits. I am a responsible person. I will always give more than what I get, to my family, my friends, my school, my society and my nation. By practising the above principles diligently, I shall be moving towards understanding of values. I pledge to practice 3 actions everyday that will remind me of each autosuggestion to help me become the person I want to be. ______________________________ ________________________ Name Signature ________________________ Place and date 103 Students are required to go through the process of learning in schools by wh ich they are empowered to decode the negative messages that the mass media propagates purely from a commercial and money making point of view. Centred thinking, reflection, social responsibility, questioning, discerning truth and facts, freedom from biases are all important values and skills to be developed in young learners. While we promote national integration, we must also cultivate values required to live in harmony with global society. We should make them proud to be Indians as well as proud to be glo bal citizens. - 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' by NCERT 104 Section 4 SCHOOL SPACES AND REACHING OUT 4.1 Introduction: Classrooms today are porous and in many ways effective learning spaces along with the environment outside the school. The wealth of knowledge that exists in the world has to be contextualized for the learner. For schools this necessitates strong bonds with the parent community, a dialogue with the community and learning from the vast resource of traditional and contemporary wisdom. 4.2 Values and the School Environment: \"The destiny of the nation is being shaped in the classrooms of today. \" - Indian Education Commission - 1964 What transpires in these rooms is thus critical for the individual and also the world that the learner inhabits. The classroom is the crucible and microcosm of children's developmental world; its lessons have a long term impact on the community in the areas of social and gender justice. The classroom setting teachers, time table, tests, recognition/ reward, report cards, peer relations, syllabi, textbooks impacts children, and forms the subtext of their world. Yet, as they grapple with the formal ' elements of the classroom the essence of education, the joy of learning ' and the wherewithal to acquire life skills ' is lost. At the individual level, fostering values in school students therefore needs to be seen as an investment in building the foundation for lifelong learning and promoting human excellence. The capacity to listen , patience, endurance, cooperation, team work, positive attitude towards study, work and life are the hallmarks of a good student or a person. So values, in fact, promote both academic as well as human excellence. In this sense education for values humanizes education. - 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' by NCERT 105 As pedagogical techniques remain largely traditional, and schools and schooling non- inclusive and hierarchical, the interaction between the different social strata also becomes limited and distorted. The potential and actual space for values, peace and harmony in the classrooms for children remains unutilized. This alone can help the child to discover his /her true potential which is multi faceted. In discovering different talents of pup ils the classroom provides an environment that is enabling and empowering. 4.2.1 SCHOOL ETHOS: Transforming Monologues into Multi-logues The school is not merely a laboratory of academics. It is more importantly a space that harmonizes and promotes individual and societal development. Nurturing awareness and sustainability are intrinsic to the transaction within the classroom. How can the school accomplish beyond the parameters of curriculum and syllabi? A school vision and mission that is inclusive, secular and sensitive towards the community, with an approach that is progressive and innovative, and promotes concern about what is happening at the local, national and global level, will serve to orient its students along similar lines. School Houses with names that inspire thoughts and acts communicate these approaches to the students. Clubs allow for the participation of students in an array of activities. Outlining the purpose and objectives of the clubs is useful before engaging the students. Assemblies that focus on values and related issues and other observances in the school calendar - International Women's Day, International Day of Non -violence, International Day of Peace, Martyrs ' Day, UN Day or Hiroshima Day are likely to have a lasting impact. Recreation facilities allowing for a creative use of time, i.e., through a reading corner, painting or play, act as stress busters and orient the students towards values. 106 4.2.2 School Image: The Aesthetics of Space and a Sense of Ownership External beauty of the universe has promoted man to establish the concept of GOD whose very existence could explain the working of natural phenomena and unfold the secrets of many mysteries. It could also keep man within the bounds of his design, and in such bewilderment man could turn into a philosopher, seeker, a scientist, a spiritualist and a moralist who brought civilization to its present shape. External and internal surroundings of a school exercise a powerful influence over the child suggesting his overall personality development. A good school has to have certain basic ingredients for quality education to ensure overall personality development of the child. a) Infrastructure b) Humane environment c) Norms for self-conduct A practical approach to learning 107 a. INFRASTRUCTURE i. Well-equipped laboratories, library and reading room ii. Residential quarters for the entire staff iii. Modern teaching aids and facilities iv. Abundant playfields with facilities for all major games and sports including a gymnasium and a place for meditation and YOGA v. Adequate facilities for a variety of co-scholastic activities inclu ding of an auditorium vi. Facilities for the children to acquire and develop hobbies vii. Recreational facilities viii. Proper medical care for the students and staff ix. Well established and efficient administrative back- up x. Proper arrangements of water and electricity, clean and separate toilets for boys and girls xi. An activity cum-classroom fitted with TV, DVD/VCD player, audio-system, projector and material required for performing an activity to introduce a concept xii. Airy classrooms with adequate capacity. Children performing YOGA which builds up trust, co -ordination, poise, stamina, physical and mental health. 108 b. HUMANE ENVIRONMENT A good school can provide humane environment for the children if it strives to fulfill the following conditions:- i. Nature in the Midst: garden with beautiful flowers and trees all around the campus, a fountain with water flowing towards the garden giving the semblance of a river, an artificial mountain giving an impression of the Himalayas and a telescope to watch the sky at night. It is the solemn duty of a language teacher to involve the learners in such a way that they can feel joy, solace and tranquility while reading about multi-coloured rainbow, calm and quiet river, dancing daffodils and moon clouded in mystery. All these beautiful, lovely and natural objects will heal the spirit of the young generation, elevate their sensitivity, refine their hearts and develop their love for the whole universe. ii. The school ethos reflected through the liveliness, openness, the challenges of providing innovative learning experiences through posters, pictures, charts, bulletin boards, quotations of renowned personalities. iii. A place of prayer having signs of all religions in the symbolic form and celebration of festivals from all religions that could orient the young minds to appreciate the positive features of the rich composite culture of our country. Even simple topics like celebration of festivals such as Id, Diwali, Christmas and Baishakhi can be used by a language teacher to illustrate how social customs and celebrations bring delight and fun in our lives and make us more tolerant, humane and broad-minded. iv. The Head of school should provide a pleasant, non-threatening atmosphere and leadership in programme designing. v. The teachers of the school should be experienced, motivated and dedicated, and also present an atmosphere of cooperation with colleagues and free-discussion with the students on all topics pertaining to the development of a child. vi. Proper etiquette should be shown by all the members of the school community on all occasions. 109 c. NORMS FOR SELF CONDUCT A good school student should: i. Always aim high and make positive and ceaseless efforts to attain overall high standards of proficiency. ii. Be capable of planning and organizing things, his or her day- to-day activities and should be able to solve the problems. iii. Have neat and orderly way of life. iv. Carry out duties allotted to him or her with pride and a sense of responsibility. v. Have variety and depth of knowledge. vi. Have various interests and latent skills. vii. Be sociable by nature and a loving soul. viii. Be cooperative with peers and considerate and helpful towards juniors. ix. Have a deep respect for rules and regulations. x. Have moral courage to admit lapses and should not resort to cover them up with lies. xi. Have dynamic qualities like courage, confidence, stamina and tenacity. The first impression of the school, as in all others, comes from appearance. In th is context the school should provide a peaceful ambience. This means that all those who enter it not only feel welcome, but are also motivated and involved. This is only possible if there is a sense of partnership and the understanding that the school is not merely a place of work but the building block of the future. This will find reflection in the following: Display Charts and wall magazines providing information on various topics and happenings. They develop the creative and writing skills of the students and also involve them through participation as contributors and editors. These can be used to communicate values by focusing on people, agencies and initiatives in the community, nation or world. 110 Motifs The presence of quotations on core values and symbols help the students to familiarize and internalize these for life. Students can be asked to contribute their favorite symbols and quotes. The best contributor can be awarded within the class on a daily, weekly or monthly basis with a seal or a certificate. The contributors and workers can also be recognized in the morning assemblies. Display boards enhance creative and writing skills 111 Entry point Cleanliness and hygiene in the school can be a significant factor in creating a positive energy flow. The involvement of students in maintaining the standard needs to be viewed as a step towards fostering respect for others, environment and the planet. Nature spots A potted plant or a bunch of flowers in the classroom gives it a warmth and cheer that only nature can provide. These can more importantly be used to discuss the willful destruction of nature by man and why respect for nature should not be everybody's concern. Presence of Volunteers The various parameters cited above would be soul-less without a human face. The presence of student volunteers, councils, clubs and groups that allow for the assumption of responsibilities not only provide a medium for creative expression and confidence, but also provide the first training in democracy. A bunch of flowers add beauty and fragrance 112 Value Symbols Visual representations serve a powerful role by encouraging students to think along values focusing their attention on making correct choices. Students can be introduced to some symbols of values, such as peace and encouraged to research about others. 4.2.3 Respecting Individual and Common Spaces Truth is not only to question but also to know what not to question . Situations of conflict often arise as individuals transgress the unwritten rules of personal and public domains. Appreciating and being sensitive to the needs and limitations/ handicaps of others is a fundamental aspect in the building up of circles of confidence within the classroom though it can easily apply to any life situation. 113 The day is not over: Schools need to reconsider the organization of time and the connotations of the beginning and end of each working day. Right from the moment we step into the school and till we step out of it, is a profound link, for our lives are not compartmentalized but knitted into a continuum. This applies to each day, each week and year spent at school and the lives that we lead. Linear time is limiting in each aspect of school. Circular time on the other hand bridges the gap that exists in the spaces between knowing, feeling and action. Things to do: - Identify the values enshrined in the school mission and vision and how these are reflected in the curricular and co curricular activities of the school. Share these with your colleagues. - Identify the values integrated in the curriculum of your subject and share it wi th your colleagues. - Make a list of values which you would like to inculcate amongst your students through different co -curricular activities so that they can have a clearer sense of whats most important in life. They can become responsible citizens. - Make a list of co curricular activities which you would like to organize in your school so as to inculcate the values mentioned in article 51 A of the Indian Constitution amongst your students. Beliefs of people who do not accept reality: * There's no way I'll be able to do it. * Nobody can help me. I'm a failure. * There isn't much hope. Why bother. * 114 4.3 Collaborative/Co-operative Classrooms Learning to live together A collaborative/co -operative classroom is one that works together as a team. Learning to live together is the essence of collaborative classroom. Today, a classroom is fragmented with economic disparity , linguistic differences and gender inequality. The ability to live together is integral to creating an equitable, non violent and a just society. For achieving this end of building harmony and solidarity in a divided world, we need to underscore the social nature of human existence, and tap the many opportunities of communication and travel that bring the world closer. Objectives 1. Development of processes within the group. 2. Development of group resource sharing skills. 3. Cooperation rather than competition. 4. Acceptance of the self and the other. 5. Development of decision making skills, learning to accept group decisions and rules and responsibility. 115 Focus Values Respect for diversity Appreciation and acceptance of differences Creating trust Sense of ownership within the group Content Concept Working in groups Characteristics of effective groups Individual roles in the group Why we need to learn Co-operation Classroom practices for collaborative learning A values building culture Group Dynamics Human beings by nature are social and spend a large part of their life in groups. This helps in humanizing and empowering people not only individually but also collectively. In order to create effective groups, many factors are involved collaboration, development of morale and self esteem, equity and respect of the other. When all these factors come together, a workable grouping takes plac e. Forming a group When groups come together an individual often feels threatened by the other because there is certain discomfort connected with the identification of roles. This phase can be looked upon as a period of churning. Once structures, roles, tasks, procedure, etc., are set, the churning subsides and the group comes together for a common goal. Essentially the glue that binds individuals together is a common task. 116 The process of creating groups includes dialogues, communication, role play, makin g decisions and organizing. The group is challenged with the work in hand. One of the most powerful tools of getting work done is assigning a task to a group. a. Groups are characterised by: A clearly defined goal that is identified and achievable by all students. Clarity among students about their individual roles and tasks. The students share a sense of equality and ownership and take decisions collectively. Openness and sharing among the members and leaders. A friendly environment that is conducive for an exchange of ideas. Observance of a code of discipline and conduct that members have decided collectively and democratically. b. Individual roles in the group: The individuals within the group have their own personality traits and can contribute towards the group as a whole by undertaking the following: Organizing and delineating tasks to others as leaders. Setting time frames for work assigned to be achieved. Reviewing tasks and offer ing constructive criticism. Providing opportunities to relax and enjoying humour in each other's company. Working in a group may sometimes lead to tension and conflict; an arbitrator and counsellor with the group can help iron out differences that arise within the group. Why do we need to learn Cooperation/Collaboration? Cooperation has become extremely significant with the emergence of globalization. In schools across the world, educators are aware of the divisive forces that have entered the classrooms bringing in fear, selfishness, bullying. 117 1. It has created a paradox which has strengthened virtual connections, and weakened and destroyed real life relationships. The act of a student not connecting in the classroom or thinking only about himself/herself has brought in extreme individual behaviour. 2. The world has become fragmented culturally, economically, socially and politically bringing in interdependence and insecurity. In a classroom which is a microcosm of this world, the societal influences can be seen where the strong and the weak, minority and majority, rich and poor feel equally threatened by the other. Hence in these circumstances, the need for learning cooperation has become critical. 3. A teacher has the responsibility of encouraging dialogue and a culture of working together. Today's classroom need s partnerships and collaboration for the future of children. Cooperative classrooms encourage students to move from confrontation to co- existence, alienation to collaboration thereby bringing in mutual empowerment. Schools have become centers of salvation, not only in the minds of parents and children, but also that of the community. Teachers have to create a common humanity in our school system which will help to overcome the ' exclusivity' , and help create an inclusive learning space. A teacher is integral to building classroom communities on the basis of shared values. This would be the highest achievement of the group. A classroom that thinks and works together towards a common goal will automatically evolve into a learning community. This consciousness of strengthening commonalities and preserving and reconciling our differences within one broader community is a constant challenge that the teacher will face in his / her classroom. Today, unhealthy competition has become central to success whereby one 's selfworth/ esteem is only enhanced by defeating the other. This is a potential source of tension. Encouraging healthy competition with oneself, coming to term with one's own skills, abilities and constraints, and being able to work with them through difficult circumstances is possible through positive cooperation. 118 A Value Building Culture The following activit ies might be instrumental in building values in the school: 1. Creat ing democratic spaces in the entire school system, from the basic auxiliary staff right up to the management, which will be an example for students to emulate. 2. Creating mock parliaments where children can put forth their ideas and difficulties. 3. Creating a School Council whose representatives can be on the school management. This will help in understanding the needs and concerns of the student community, thereby creating a democratic system. 4. Encouraging staff to cooperate with each other for teaching, learning of best practices. 5. Bringing in students into the organizational spaces for all the activities of the school - Sports Day, Independence Day, Book Eeek, Human Rights Day, etc ., enhance their 21st century skills - entrepreneurial, planning, organizational and communicative. Classroom Practices Create Reciprocity Discourage Exclusivity Praise Group Achievement Build Team Spirit For a Collaborative classroom approach Value Team Work Sensitive groups towards d uties and responsibilities Be fair: always be fair in your dealings. This will create a faithful, positive environment to generate respect. A mock parliament School Council meet 119 4.4 Home School Community Partnerships 120 Every support extended by the home to the school allows learning to be more meaningful and contextual. School, parents, and the community at large are responsible for satisfying the social and emotional needs of the young. Unless everybody comes together with the challenge of creating balanced individuals, the modern day youth can turn rebellious or even violent. Home School partnerships in education for values allow the children to acquire values that help in personality formation beginning from an early age; developing a shared spirituality born of a critical and rational approach towards beliefs; respecting the historical heritage of values relating to culture and tradition; understanding the concepts of Human Rights and Democracy; adapting their lifestyle to resolve global challenges such as caring for nature and sustainable development, social justice, terrorism, drug and alcohol abuse, etc. Learning does not begin with the school; it starts much earlier at home and continues there even after the child is introduced to formal education. Parental participation is a must in the processes of education. Parent teacher partnerships are crucial to holistic education and both need to be convinced that their alliance is in the best interests of the child. In the context of Values Education, the values and problem solving methods taught in classrooms have to be sustained and reaffirmed at home if they are to be internalized by the students. This alone can reinstate the role of parents in education, help in improving parent teacher partnership, and better the quality of life and relations at home as well. When you throw a baby in the air, she laughs because she knows you will catch her.... THAT's TRUST . Be Trusting: By putting our trust in someone we put our faith in that person, another way of displaying respect. 121 4.4.1 The Home school Partnerships - Ethics and Values While the rhetoric for imparting ethics and values among students is often heard, a clear understanding of the terms or the means of inculcating them among the young is not quite clear. This is partly due to the dynamic nature of the theme that needs to adapt and reinvent itself in a given context and partly due to the ambiguity that has come to be associated with Values Education programmes. Why is it so important to nurture those ethics and values that inspire students? What are the advantages that accrue to the individual and society that make Values Education not only desirable but an urgent necessity as well? A. Parents Involvement Parents' involvement in Values Education begins long before the schooling of the child and hence the home becomes one of the main agencies to be involved when planning any Values Education programme at school. The parents' involvement is what a school 'values ' No human being is born with set values. Values are learned. Initially values are transmitted by the parents, grandparents and other close relatives whom the child would interact with. These values are usually such that prepare a child to be accepted in society. Learning to put things in an orderly manner, greet ing the elders, respect ing time by following the time schedule, restrain ing from simple acts of violence 122 (like throwing objects, destroying property) are perhaps some of the very initial beginnings of Values Education. Most of the values are those which have been imbibed by the family from the society. During mid or late adolescence, the individual begins to question these values. As s/ he participates in life's experiences, old values are judged and reshaped to form new values. Certain values are discarded and others become integrated into the self. As the child grows s/he begins to prioriti se the values gained in early childhood. Values are also measured in terms of a changing society and individuals need the skills to ascertain what exactly their own values are. They need to clarify their values. The stages of values development could be roughly divided as follows. VALUE REFERENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT STAGES: Adapted from Kohlberg, The Child as a Moral Philosopher, 2(4) 1968 PP. 24-30 1. Pre-Conventional Stage (0-7) : I do so.............. Because my parents say so Because doing so will get me appreciation/gift, etc. 2. Conventional Stage (7- 10): I do so..... Because you will like me better as related to peers, parents, teachers. Because it is the law and I have to do it. 3. Post- Conventional Stage (18+) : I do so...... Because justice requires it Because it is good for humanity The child nurtured in a home with sound values and educated in a school that reinforces these values would, therefore, move along these steps. S/he would.................... review the alternatives available thoughtfully consider the consequences of the alternatives choose from the alternatives freely 123 publicly confirm beliefs/ values act on one's beliefs prize and cherish beliefs and individual behaviour act with a pattern, consistency and repetition indicating the value profile In order to become an adult who is able to stand for a particular value, know and act on that value, the individual requires to explore, think and try out those values in a real life situation. Thinking, feeling, imagi ning and clarifying aloud what is prized and wanted, takes time. It is a difficult process but it is rewarding because it improves the quality of life. Values are standards for action, but they cannot be absolute for all situations, people or cultures. The basis of all life is change. We must know how to change and revaluate our values. This perhaps is far more important than having a fixed, even clarified values system. Parents involvement in Values Development It is absolutely necessary that schools work with parents to reinforce the values identified as important. Here are some suggestions that could be incorporated keeping in mind the nature of the school population. A. Work ethics This would imply the co-related values of commitment, punctuality, fairness, sincerity, sharing, helping, independence, responsibility, humility and pride. Parents could be asked to help by seeing that work assigned to the student is completed on time work assigned is done as far as possible independently the child develops his own responsibility for completing the work a sense of pride is created by laying emphasis on neatness, handwriting and innovativeness in the work done the child is encouraged to share his knowledge with others 124 the child is taught to see that actions do have consequences and that they have to be forborne, however painful they may be while offering help, the child is still given independence to choose or reject the help. This helps the child to understand that the parent is there and yet s/he has the right to control the situation and make an important decision about his/ her own deeds children understand the importance of commitments and obligations as this affects others as well as themselves B. Parent -Teacher Association: Apart from regularly attending the Parent-Teacher Meetings the parents need to have discussions with the teachers. Their presence as audience and observers at various school programmes or as professionals judging competitions, delivering lectures, etc., are significant markers of the rapport they share with the school. If parents willingly substitute for teachers on leave, contribute to the community welfare projects of the school such as the blood donation camps, and volunteer for activities such as sports days and trips and excursions, then the bonds of trust and confidence are well in place. The mother's participation in a sports event 125 The father's race to compete This symbiotic relationship is not only mutually beneficial but also allows the school to undertake initiatives in the community which it otherwise could never have achieved. This then allows the school to serve as an instrument of social change. The school can then launch itself into community projects like adopting a neighbourhood community, opening vocational centers and run workshops in the community, organizing health check- ups and literacy projects (each one teach one) for adults. Dr. Abdul Kalam, Former President of India amidst students 126 These projects provide the children with the rare opportunity to interface with people who are not like them, underst and their problems and realities, and empathize with them. An attitude of caring and sharing is the cornerstone of peaceful societies. The home and school should not only provide an environment that is a microcosm of the larger social milieu, but should also be able to spark change in the society. 4.5 Values through Partnerships In order to counter this, there is a need to propagate values in ways that could be best understood by the learners. Values and ethics can never be taught in isolation, but must be an intrinsic part of the school's ideology, activities and practices. The Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes that are part of the process of Values Education must be viewed as skills rather than being dogmatically imposed upon the students at any juncture. This has been amply clarified in the values framework brought out by the CBSE in the CCE T eacher's Manuals. While it is not possible to measure their impact quantitatively, the following partnerships may be kept in mind while planning and implementing Values Education programmes/ activities. INDIVIDUAL CLASSROOM SCHOOL COMMUNITY 127 4.5.1 Individual Values Focus Self respect Tolerance Truthfulness Respect for human dignity and differences Openness to new ideas and change Reconciliation Compassion Ability to access and utilize relevant information Caring and empathy Social responsibility and accountability Sensitivity to disadvantaged (economic and social background ), disabilities, etc. Control over thoughts and actions Gender and caste sensitivity Environmental awareness Communication skills Critical thinking and problem solving approach Positive outlook Leadership and decision making qualities Individual participation enhances learning capabilities 128 Save the environment awareness parade 4.5.2 Classroom Values Focus No discrimination Cooperative group work Respecting each other Peaceful resolution of conflict Recognition of diversity Respect for rules and regulations 4.5.3 School Values Focus School mission Varied and interesting teaching pedagogies Adults as role models Secure and non threatening climate Activities to promote international understanding, environment and sustainable development Staff development programmes Parent-teacher partnership Caring and provision for counseling Activities that focus on impact of conflicts and wars, and nuclear disarmament Working together is a good value 129 4.5.4 Community Outreach programmes through Sahodaya School Complex es Taking leadership initiatives Exchanges with other institutions Partnerships with other schools/ organizations Problem solving attitudes 4.6 Concluding Thoughts The nature and scope of home-school-community partnerships are fundamental to the functioning of a school as an institution that not only imparts learning within the classroom but also extends itself beyond its boundaries as a social entity. The fact that teachers and parents are the people who have the greatest impact on the child's life is an undisputed reality. Parents do not abandon their ward to the school. They remain deeply involved with the process of their ward's development and maturity through the years and in fact forge ties with the school that endure a lifetime. Interaction with diverse groups is a learning exercise 130 Direction for Social Work At the societal level, education for values aims at promoting social cohesion and national integration for transforming societies, nations and creating a better world. It can contribute to create the aspiration for transformation of the culture of war, violence and greed into a culture of peace; where people learn and understand more about each other s uniqueness, human rig hts and fundamental freedom; where people learn to care and share to live together in a just, peaceful and compassionate society both in their immediate contexts and in the world at large. - 'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' by NCERT 131 132Holistic De velopment MIDDLE CHILDHOODUnderstanding Tolerance and InclusionCare & Compassion Integrity ResponsibilityFreedomRespectResponsibilityUnderstanding Tolerance & Inclusion Doing Your Best Respect Care & CompassionIntegrityRespectCare & Compassion Doing Your Best Responsibility Understanding Tolerance and InclusionEARL Y YEARSADOLESCENCE 133 Minimum Programme of Action In the present social environment, it has become necessary for all schools to plan a 'Minimum Programme of Action ' for Value s Education in order to create a humane and caring society. The school is a good place too start as the teacher is a friend, guide and philosopher and can play a crucial role to in preparing the students for leading a life of dignity and self-respect as well as making a positive contribution to their nation and society. Some suggestions are offered in the following pages: Minimum Programme of Action (NUR -II) Values Inside the school Outside the school Good manners 1. Personal hygiene & keeping the school neat & clean by not littering the school premises. 2. Settlement of disputes through discussion and interaction . 3. Identify need and discuss values connected with each lesson. 4. Role-play/ dramatization, story telling of incidents. 5. Greeting teachers, seniors and fellow students . 6. Obeying the schools & assembly rules. 7. Emphasis on pleasant and polite manner of speech and ettiquette. 1. Greeting relatives, neighbours, elders , etc. 2. Saying thank you, please and sorry wherever applicable. 3.

The attitudes and values of hard work, discipline, cooperation, communication skills , etc., enable them to develop healthy i nterpersonal relationships at home and in school which in turn facilitate their better adjustment on the job. The employers too look for these qualities in their prospective employees. It is a common observation that the advancement in a career depends not only on the intellectual abilities but also the ability to sustain hard work, assume responsibility and ability to work in teams and cooperate with others. While educational qualification helps to enter a job, efficiency to deliver in a job is often depen dent on qualities of perseverance, cooperation, genuineness, hard work, communication and relationship skills. -'Education for Values in Schools - A Framework' by NCERT 155 Activity with solution ENTER EXIT 160 181 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 215 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 163 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 148 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 128 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 156 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 116 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 121 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 187 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 172 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 226 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 368 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 175 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 84 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 274 4 2 8 7 2 - 4 4 2 8 3 - 6 4 2 2 - 6 3 8 We are solely responsible for the choices we make in our lives, for our freedom to choose and decide for ourselves. 156 4.9 Learning f rom People, Events and Stories 4.9.1 Doing Your Best An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer contractor of his plans to leave the house building business to live a more leisurely life with his wife and enjoy his extended family. He would miss the pay cheque each week, but he wanted to retire and was sure that they could get by. The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favour. The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career. When the carpenter finished his work, the employer came to inspect the house. Then he handed the key to the front door to the carpenter and said \"This is your house.... my gift to you .\" The carpenter was shocked. What a shame! If only he had known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently. But so it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house that we have built. If we could do it over, we would do it much differently. But you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Someone once said, Life is a do- it-yourself project . Your attitude and the choices you make today help build the house you will live in tomorrow, therefore build it wisely. REFLECT: Why had the carpenter done a sub standard job? 157 4.9.2 Self Esteem - Key to Success In the month of May, 1893, Gandhi reached Durban. Accompanied by Dada Abdulla, one of the richest Indian traders in Natal, who also happened to be his employer, he went to visit the Durban Court. The European magistrate at the court instructed Gandhi to remove his turban. He not only disobeyed the commands of the magistrate but issued a protest letter to the press. This was, however, just the lull before the storm. The final provocation took place during his journey to Pretoria from Durban. It shook the consciousness of the young lawyer to such an extent that he assumed a staunch position against racial prejudice. This incident played a major role in carving out the future course of Gandhi's life. Gandhi was travell ing to Pretoria on a first class ticket, bought by his client. When his train drew into Pietermaritzburg, a white man entered his compartment and sought the help of an officer to move Gandhi to the third class compartment. This was only because Gandhi was a ' colou red' person, of Asian origin. When Gandhi refused to oblige the white man, a constable turned him out of the compartment to suffer in the bitter cold at the waiting room. Humiliated and insulted, Gandhi reflected on his next action. It was at this moment that a steadfast determination took hold of him. He resolved that under no circumstance would he allow racial discriminations to get an upper hand. The larger cause of human respect and the honor of the Indian community became critical to him. After a few weeks in Pretoria, Gandhi called a meeting and 158 addressed the Indian community, where he upheld before them the dismal conditions under which they lived. To represent Indian interests, Gandhi and other Indians, decided to form a permanent body. This organization was named the Natal Indian Congress and Gandhi assumed its leadership. At the same time Gandhi worked assiduously for the lawsuit that brought him to South Africa. As Gandhi was preparing to return to India after the completion of his lawsuit, the news of a proposed bill, to be introduced by the Natal Government, reached him. This bill would lead to disenfranchising of the Indians in South Africa. Pleaded by his fellow Indians Gandhi remained back and took up the issue. Although the bill was passed in spite of Gandhi's attempts, his crusade continued for twenty long years. REFLECT: How do you think the incident affected Gandhiji? Self Esteem Why would you want to be someone else? When you could be better by being yourself. Why pretend to be someone you are not ? When you have something they haven t got. Cheating yourself of the life you have to live, Deprives others of that only which you can give. You have much more to offer by being just you, Than walking around in someone elses shoes. Trying to live the life of another is a mistake, It is a masquerade; nothing more than a fake. Be yourself and let your qualities show through, Others will love you more for being just you. Remember that God loves you just as you are, To Him you are already a bright shining star. Family and friends will love you more too, If you spent time practicing just being you. Ellen Bailey 159 BE COMPASSIONATE Hatred cannot be conquered by hatred. Hatred can only be conquered by compassion. -Lord Buddha. Once a man went to the Buddhist sangha. He did not believe in the teachings of Buddha and was cynical of his following. He found the smile on the Buddhas lips and his expression of bliss annoying. In the palm of his closed hand he carried an insect. He approached the Buddha and asked him, in a mocking tone, \"Can you tell me with your great powers of perception whether what I have in my hand is dead or alive?\" He was prepared to expose the Sakyamuni, for if the Buddha replied that it was alive, he would crush it and if the Buddha said it was dead he would release it to freedom. The Buddha smiled his enigmatic smile and gently replied, \"It all depends on you, my friend.\" Filled with shame and remorse he fell to the feet of the Buddha and asked his forgiveness. REFLECT: What does the story tell us about attitude? 160 TOGETHER WE CAN In a sense all life is inter-related. All persons are caught in an inescapable network of spirituality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. - Martin Luther King Jr. There was a farmer who grew award-winning corn. Each year his produce fetched him a good price at the local fair. One day a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors. \"How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year?\" the reporter asked. \"Why sir,\" said the farmer, \"didn't you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn.\" He is very much aware of the connectedness of life. His corn cannot improve unless his neighbor's corn also improves. So it is in other dimensions. Those who choose to be at peace must help their neighbors to be at peace. Those who choose to live well must help others to live well, for the values of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who choose to be happy must help others to find happiness for the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all. The lesson for each of us is this: if we are to grow good corn, we must help our neighbors grow good corn.\" REFLECT: How did the farmer see his own welfare? 161 THINK POSITIVE The Victor If you think you are beaten, you are. If you think you dare not, you don't. If you like to win but think you can't, It's almost a cinch you won't. If you think you'll lose, you're lost. For out in the world we find Success begins with a fellow's wil l. It's all in the state of mind. If you think you are out classed, you are. You've got to think high to rise. You've got to be sure of your-self before You can ever win the prize. Life's battles don't always go To the stronger or faster man. But sooner or later, the man who wins Is the man who thinks he can. - by C. W. Longenecker 162 HONESTY In ancient Greece, Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem. One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said, \"Do you know what I just heard about your friend?\" \"Hold on a minute,\" Socrates replied. \"Before telling me anything Id like you to pass a little test. Its called the Triple Filter Test.\" \"Triple filter?\" \"Thats right,\" Socrates continued. \"Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good ide a to take a moment and filter what youre going to say. Thats why I call it the triple filter test. The first filter is Truth . Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?\" \"No,\" the man said, \"Actually I just heard about it and ...\" \"All right,\" said Socrates. \"So you dont really know if its true or not. Now lets try the second filter, the filter of Goodness . Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?\" \"No, on the contrary...\" \"So,\" Socrates continued, \"you want to tell me something bad about him, but youre not certain its true. You may still pass the test though, because theres one filter left: the filter of Usefulness . Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?\" \"No, not really ...\" \"Well,\" concluded Socrates, \"if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?\" REFLECT: How can applying the triple filter in our interactions help us? Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. Tony Robbins. 163 CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THE CHIPKO ANDOLAN In the 1970s, an organized resistance to the destruction of forests spread throughout India and came to be known as the Chipko movement. The name of the movement comes from the word ' embrace ', as the villagers hugged the trees, and prevented the contractors from felling them. The Chipko movement of 1973 was one of the most famous among these. The first Chipko action took place spontaneously in April 1973 in the village of Mandal in the upper Alakananda valley and over the next five years spread to many districts of the Himalayas in Uttar Pradesh. It was sparked off by the government's decision to allot a plot of forest area in the Alaknanda valley to a sports goods company. This angered the villagers because their similar demand to use wood for making agricultural tools had been earlier denied. With encouragement from a local NGO (non- governmental organization), DGSS (Dasoli Gram Swarajya Sangh), the women of the area, under the leadership of an activist, Chandi Prasad Bhatt, went into the forest and formed a circle around the trees preventing the men from cutting them down. The success achieved by this protest led to similar protests in other parts of the country. From their origins as a spontaneous protest against logging abuses in Uttar Pradesh in the Himalayas, supporters of the Chipko movement, mainly village women, have successfully banned the felling of trees in a number of regions and influenced natural resource policy in India. Dhoom 164 Singh Negi, Bachni Devi and many other village women, were the first to save trees by hugging them. They coined the slogan: 'What do the forests bear? Soil, water and pure air '. The success of the Chipko movement in the hills saved thousands of trees from being felled. Some other persons have also been involved in this movement and have given it proper direction. Mr. Sunderlal Bahuguna, a Gandhian activist and philosopher, whose appeal to Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, resulted in the green-felling ban. Mr. Bahuguna coined the Ghanasyam Raturi, the Chipko poet, wrote a poem describing the method of embracing the trees to save them from falling: 'Embrace the trees and Save them from being felled; The property of our hills, Save them from being looted.' REFLECT: Are we doing enough for our environment? It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities. Josiah Charles Stamp. 165 PRAYERS AND SONGS IN VALUES EDUCATION In our common pursuit of framing scientific and concrete projects, programmes, curricular and co-curricular activities to promote humaneness in man and prevent deterioration, the famous quote of Tennyson \"Many things are wrought by prayers than the world dreams of \" is significant. A colourful melody The importance of prayers and songs as a teaching device to project values cannot be underestimated. A child is like a seed which can sprout into a full and healthy plant if it is given a nurturing environment. Mahatma Gandhi, Vinoba Bhave firmly believed and advocated the role of prayer because it could elevate the mind, illumine the intellect, sublimate the senses, purify the heart, awaken the soul and help in establishing a rapport with ourselves. The practice of morning assembly which consists of meaningful songs, speeches and prayers which have a great impact on the mind of a child over a period of time followed by several pace - setting institutions have a subtle impact. Start the day with Prayer and finish it the same way. Then the day is bound to be good even if it brings tough experiences. Prayers introduced in the routine of a school help in sooth ing troubled minds, consolidate ones daily inputs and can serve as an important tool to defuse greed, tension, strife, conflict and restlessness. The schools may design a schedule of prayers select ed from a variety of readings and abstracts depending upon the beliefs, policies and 166 ethos followed by them. They may feel free to select from whatever they feel can be integrated into their philosophy. The purpose here is only to strengthen the belief in the Creator. Prayer, we know is:- Prayer is talking to God Prayer is listening to God Prayer is being quiet with God Prayer is learning to think the thoughts of God Prayer is learning to seek the words of God Prayer is understanding the power and wisdom of God in nature Prayer is understanding the love and mercy of God in human experience Prayer is believing in God Prayer is trusting in God Prayer is resting on the promises of God Prayer is becoming identified with God Prayer is being committed with God Prayer is working with God Prayer is waiting for God Prayer is conquering with God Prayer is praise and thanksgiving Prayer is joy and assurance Prayer is being at peace with God Some think of prayer as something to do - a rite, a routine, a spiritual chor e. Actually, prayer is a way of life. 167School anthems or songs play a very important role in inculcating values within the consciousness of children. Schooling engages children in a fourteen year dialogue and these songs are heard every day in the assemblies and programmes. The constant reiteration of values that comes across through listening and singing of these songs reaffirms the value system that a child can grow up with. Schools can collate through their Sahodaya Clusters a variety of such lyrics or compose their own. This will help in the dissemination and assimilation of values. The CD with this Values Education Kit is a collection of songs which students have sung collectively on issues that affect sustainable development, environment, gender , nature, integrity and went walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me that endless skyway I saw below me that golden valley This land was made for you and me Songs ukn & Loje~ Lyrics & Music - Monica Brown There is a world An ancient world It bears a vast and rugged face It spirit's free Haunting and free It calls to you, it calls me come find your soul One P eople One W orldwithin my doubts come wake up me your homeland true Chorus........ this is our world we are its people a nation that's free to realize it's dream A dream that's for all with hand in each hand to live as one people one people, one world there is a people an ancient people their spirits rest deep in this world their dream time is living and giving Make this world a sacred place they seek a world a true embrace life that concerns all that we are Chorus........

Cases can be fact-driven and deductive where there is a correct answer, or they can be context driven where multiple solutions are possible. Various disciplines have employed case studies including humanities, social sciences, sciences, engineering, law, business, medicine etc. Good cases generally have the following features: they tell a good story, are recent, includes dialogue, create empathy with the main characters, are relevant to the readers, serves teaching function and have generality. Cases come in many formats, from a simple \"What would you do in this situation?\" question to a detailed description of a situation with accompa nying data to analyze. Whether to use a simple scenario -type case or a complex detailed one depends on the course objectives. Let us read a short story and analyse it as a case study for teaching aid. Once upon a time, a king was rambling in the garden with a heavy heart, as news from the war front was not good. He saw a little boy and a little girl playing there. The king went to them and found that they were playing Rama -Sita and looking for someone t o play the role of a Rakshas (monster). The king in -order to get out of his mental stress, readily agreed to play the role of a monster. The monster had to die several times in the hands of Rama that particular morning. Returning to his palace, the king en quired about the children from his Chief Minister and came to know that the boy Kaushik was the son of a poor Brahmin and the girl Ruchira was the daughter of the Chief Minister. On the kings order, Kaushik was sent to the best institution of the kingdom much to the displeasure of the pundit (teacher) and the students who were the children of ministers and higher officials of the kingdom. The king told the minister that he wanted Ruchira to get married with Kaushik. The Chief Minister kept silent, as he did not like the idea. The pundit of the institute did not like Case studies present realistic situations, allowing students to balance theory with practice. 176 Kaushik. Though he was a good student, learning lessons only through books was not his priority. Kaushik believed that there were more to learn from his natural surroundings like trees, birds, rivers, hills, animals, the stars, the moon and everything that he could lay his eyes on. The pundit called Kaushik one day to ask why he was not interested in his study; Kaushik replied that he had as much interest in books as he had in fellow human beings and the surrounding nature. The teacher told him to concentrate only on his books to which Kaushik replied that if done so he would lose interest in his lessons too. As time passed away one day the king summoned the pundit and asked him about his best student to which the teacher replied Ruchira. The king again asked regarding his opinion about Kaushik. The teacher replied that he has not learnt much. The king called the minister and concluded that the marriage between Ruchira and Kaushik should not be delayed any longer. The minister humbly submitted that Ruchira does not want to get married to Kaushik. The king asked Doesn't she consid er Kaushik worthy of her? . The king then proposed Let both of them prove their superiority in front of me and this marriage will take place if Kaushik emerges as the winner . The minister accepted the challenge, as he was sure of his daughters win. The pundit (teacher) brought Ruchira along with him. Kaushik went to his guru and touched his feet and greeted Ruchira with folded hands. Ruchira ignored his greetings. Kaushik had never taken part in any debate in the institute with Ruchira; the other students also never invited him to take part in any academic debate out of sheer disrespect for him because of his economic status. As a result, Ruchira was not mentally prepared for his sharp and prudent arguments. That made Ruchira perplexed and she was out of her wits. Kaushik left her at the brim of defeat. As per the challenge the king ordered the minister to fix up a date for the marriage. At this point Kaushik stood up and humbly submitted before the king with folded hands that he did not want this marriage to take place. The king was surprised and asked for the reason. Kaushik replied Let the joy and satisfaction of winning be mine and the reward for others . The pundit requested the king to allow Ruchira to compete with Kaushik once again after a year. The king granted his request. Kaushik left the institute and he was seen rambling through the hills, the forest and the paddy fields. The pundit engaged all his time and effort 177 to prepare Ruchira for the challenge. But Ruchira had lost control over her mind and heart. One day the king asked his Chief Minister to send Ruchira to him. She came and stood silently before the king with her head bowed. The king said \"If you agree then I wish to see you play the game Rama's banishment to the forest once again\". Ruchira looked at the king with delight. The king said \"But this time your pundit has to play the role of the monster\". Rabindranath Tagore had written this story more than hundred years ago. We still are carrying on with an education system that is not blended with nature; neither did we nor do our children enjoy the learning. Nature teaches us to be humble and modest and to be magnanimous and firm. Kaushik had been courteous enough to touch his gurus feet and asked for his blessings; on the contrary, Ruchira was extremely self-conceited and arrogant. She, in the opinion of the pundit , was the best student (in terms of securing marks in the examination) but unfortunately, the lesson one learns at the academic institution does not impart the knowledge one needs to become a good human being. The purpose of education should not be lost under the burden of books. It should also make the student modest and not meek, confident and not conceited. Kaushik derived all these qualities from Mother Nature, animals and his surroundings. Hence, Kaushik did not forget to show respect to his guru and give honour to Ruchira. The greatest pundit of the kingdom forgot to give Kaushik his blessing and Ruchira also did not have the courtesy to accept the honour, let alone to reciprocate it. Even after hundred years, social status is bestowed on a person according to his financial strength, just as Kaushik had been looked down upon for being the son of a poor brahmin. Still, in our educational institutes, more emphasis is given to learning lessons from books than to acquiring knowledge in various aspects of life and to develop the child into a proper human being. Let us give a glance to the messages that we get from this story: (a) Any human being should be judged on the basis of his qualities and not on the basis of his social status. (b) The education system does not have all the ingredients for all-round development of a student. (c) We learn, as Kaushik did, through our five senses as well and not only through intellect. 178 (d) Kaushik enjoyed study because he enjoyed many other things in life. He acquired more knowledge than his classmates because he never confined himself within the textbooks and boundary of the classrooms. (e) A teacher should have the ability to mingle with the students, so that the students feel free to ask any question, any number of questions. Thus the learning becomes a joyful experience for the students. (f) A teacher is responsible not only to the extent of imparting education from books; he is also responsible to teach the students the basic values and ethics in life. Most importantly, he himself should be above all meanness unlike the pundit in the story. The pundit himself could not accept Kaushik as one of his students because of his social status. * Reproduced from the book entitled Values Education in Indian Schools: Experiences and Strategies of Implementation, NCERT, New Delhi, 2003. Short Story There was a teacher who wanted to teach the value of honesty to her students. She gave two seeds to each of them and asked them to germinate them. After two days all of them brought germinated seeds ex cept Anil. All the students were standing in queue to show the germinated seeds to their teacher but Anil was standing in the corner of the class. The teacher looked at all the seeds and called A nil in front of the whole class. She praised Anil for his honesty. All the students were surprised. The teacher further clarified that the seeds given by her to the students were boiled means that they were not able to germinate. All the students except An il replaced the boiled seeds with the fresh ones and so they were able to get germinated seeds. So Anil was not able to show germinated seeds like others but was able to display honesty through his act. Queries - 1) You have found a ten rupee note on the f loor of your classroom. What will you do with that note? 2) Your mother has given you some money to go to the market and buy vegetables. After buying vegetables, you are left with some balance amount.

Assessment: The process of documenting, usually in measurable terms, knowledge, skills, attitudes and beliefs. Brainstorming: An organized approach for producing ideas by letting the mind think without interruption. The term was coined by Alex Osborn . Brainstorming can be done either individually or in a group; in group brainstorming sessions, the participants are encouraged, and often expected to share their ideas with one another as soon as they are generated. The key to brainstorming is not to interrupt the thought process. As ideas come to the mind, they are captured and stimulate the development of better ideas. Brainstorming is used for enhancing creativity in order to generate a broad selection of ideas in leading to a unique and improved concept. Cognitive Stag e: The mental process of acquiring information, building a knowledge base, and learning increasingly advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills from infancy through adulthood. Collaborative Learning: An umbrella term for a variety of approaches in education that involve joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers. Groups of students work together in searching for understanding, meaning or solutions or in creating a product. The approach is closely related to cooperative learning, but is considered to be more radical because of its reliance on youth voice. Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing, group projects, and othe r activities. Comprehensive: Comprehensive means to cover both the Scholastic and the Co- Scholastic aspects of students growth and development . Constructivism: A set of assumptions about the nature of human learning that guide constructivist learning theories and teaching methods. Constructivism values develop mentally appropriate, teacher-supported learning that is initiated and directed by the student. Continuous: Continuous means t he evaluation of identified aspects growth and development of students in a continuous process. Cooperative learning: Proposed in response to traditional curriculum-driven education. In cooperative learning environments, students interact in purposely structured heterogeneous group to support the learning of one self and others in the same group. Co-Scholastic: Co-Scholastic aspects include Life Skills, Co-curricular areas and Attitudes & Values. Creativity: A human mental phenomenon based around the deployment of mental skills and/or conceptual tools, which, in turn, originate and develop innovation, inspiration or insight. Critical Pedagogy: A teaching approach which attempts to help students question and challenge domination and the beliefs and practices that dominate. In other words, it is a theory and practice of helping students achieve critical consciousness. In this tradition the teacher works to lead students to question ideologies and practices considered oppressive (including those at school) Critical Thinking: Consists of a mental process of analyzing or evaluating information, particularly statements or propositions that people have offered as true. It forms a process of reflecting upon the meaning of statements, examining the offered evidence and reasoning and forming judgments about the facts. Critical thinkers can gather such information from observation, experience, reasoning, and/or communication. Critical thinking has its basis in intellectual values that go beyond subject-matter divisions and which include: clarity, accuracy, precision, evidence, thoroughness and fairness. Curriculum- (plural curricula) the set of courses and their contents offered by an institution such as a school or a university. In some cases, a curriculum may be partially or entirely determined by an external body. Curriculum Framework: A stepping stone between national standards and local curriculum which encompasses what must be taught to meet state and national standards. 180 Decision Making: It can be regarded as the mental processes ( cognitive process ) resulting in the selection of a course of action among several alternative scenarios.

Students make discoveries and experiment with knowledge themselves instead of hearing or reading about the experiences of others. Students also reflect on their experiences, thus developing new skills, new attitudes, and new theories or ways of thinking. Experiential education is related to the constructivist learning theory. Facilitator: A non-directive, non-judgmental teacher/leader who creates an environment for learning, records student progress, and motivates students to exercise self-direction in determining and achieving educational goals. Formative Assessments : FAs part of the instructional process. When incorporated into classroom practice, it provides the information needed to adjust teaching and learning while they are happening. In this sense, Formative Assessment informs both teachers and students about student understanding at a point when timely adjustments can be made. These adjustments help to ensure students achieve targeted standards-based learning goals within a set time frame. Although Formative Assessment strategies appear in a variety of formats, there are some distinct ways to distinguish them from Summative Assessments. Holistic Assessment: Assessment includes both Scholastic and Co-Scholastic aspects. Holistic Education: Education involving the whole person --body, soul, and spirit. It integrates all subjects and infuses all learning with a pantheistic, monistic spirituality. Inclusion: Assigning all students to regular classrooms, including those with severe disabilities, thus turning each class into a special education class. Infusion: A strategy that hides or blends politically correct social philosophies and matching activities into the basic content of the curriculum. Journal: A daily record in which students express and deal with their feelings and emotions. Unlike traditional journals which recorded facts (travel, business, etc.), these journals contain expressions of feelings and attitudes that lay emphasis on emotional responses, encourage the child to focus on feelings rather than facts and become revealing indicators of progress towards new values or resistance to change. Kinesthetic Learning: A teaching and learning style in which learning takes place by the student actually carrying out a physical activity, rather than listening to a lecture or merely watching a demonstration. Building dioramas, physical models or participating in role-playing or historical re-enactment are some examples. Language Education: The teaching and learning of a language or languages, usually as foreign languages. Learning Outcome: The term may refer to course aims (intended learning outcomes) or may be roughly synonymous with educational objectives (observed learning outcomes). Usage varies between organizations. Lesson Plan: A teacher's detailed description of the course of instruction for an individual lesson. While there is no one way to construct a correct lesson plan, most lesson plans contain similar elements. 181 Life Skills: Preparation for all life roles. The total development of the child --body, mind, and spirit -- as a learner, worker, consumer, family member and citizen. What the student must believe, think and do to meet the exit outcomes. Methodology: Strictly speaking is the study and knowledge of methods; but the term is frequently used pretentiously to indicate a method or a set of methods. In other words, it is the study of techniques for problem-solving and seeking answers, as opposed to the techniques themselves. Parental Involvement: Holds parents responsible for making sure the child attends school, completes prescribed homework and learns whatever else schools will decide once the system is implemented. The Parents Teachers Association (PTA) is a way of involving parents in the consensus process, where they, too become part of Schools decision making process. The Parent Teacher Meeting (PTM) is an interactive forum where the parents meet their wards teachers and share their concerns. Peace Education: The process of acquiring the knowledge and developing the attitudes, skills and behaviour to live in harmony with oneself and with others. Peace education is based on a philosophy that teaches non violence, love, compassion, trust, fairness, cooperation, respect and a reverence for the human family and all life on our planet. It is a social practice with shared values to which anyone can make a significant contribution. Pedagogy: The art or science of teaching. The word comes from the ancient Greek paidagogos. The word \" paidia\" refers to children, which is why some like to make the distinction between pedagogy (teaching children) and andragogy (teaching adults). The Latin word for pedagogy, education, is much more widely used, and often the two are used interchangeably. Peer Facilitator: Peer learning involves a new role for the students who facilitate the learning of other students. The role of the peer facilitator, which is focused on learning through supporting other students, would appear to be more social than the traditional role of learner, which is focused on self-learning. Problem Solving: Problem solving is cognitive process directed at transforming a problem from the given state to the goal state when the problem solver is not immediately aware of a solution method. Project: A task given over a period of time and generally involves collection and analysis of data. It is useful in theme-based learning. Quiz: A form of game or puzzle in which the players (as individuals or in teams), attempt to answer questions correctly. A quiz usually is a form of student assessment, but often has fewer questions of lesser difficulty and requires less time for completion than a test. Remediation: A teacher comment that helps students reach a more accurate or higher-level response. Self-esteem: (or self-worth) Includes a person's subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative to some degree. Staff Development: Various, usually formal, training or activities, funded by schools to enhance the attitudes, knowledge and skills of current employees. Student Centered Learning: An approach to education focusing on the needs of the students, rather than those of others involved in the educational process, such as teachers and administrators. This approach has many implications for the design of curriculum, course content and interactivity of courses. Summative Assessments (SA): The assessments are given periodically to determine at a particular point in time what students know and do not know. Many associate Summative Assessments only with standardized tests or written examinations, but they are also used at and are an important part of classroom programs. Summative Assessment at the classroom level is an accountability measure that is generally used as part of the grading process. Universal Values: Honesty, integrity, tolerance, and other values believed to be common to all the world's cultures. A serious look at history counters that presumption. Values Clarification: A strategy for changing a student's values. It prods students to understand traditional values, then choose \" their own \" values based on personal opinions and group consensus. 182 Bibliography National Council of Educational Research and Training, Education for Values in Schools - A Framework.
