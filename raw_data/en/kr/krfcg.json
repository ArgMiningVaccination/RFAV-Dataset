With their veneer-white smiles and bump-less skin, these men and women claim that the bright green juice is a miracle in a Mason jar, with the ability to help you boost your metabolism and lose weight fast \u2014 some even claim that it cures cancer. But where does the truth end and the lies begin? We reached out to Angela Maicki, owner of City Press Juice & Bottle, an organic cold-pressed juice shop, and Lori Welstead, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at the University of Chicago, to help shed some light on the celery claims. Maicki's introduction to juicing began when her husband, Anthony, got hepatitis A while the couple were traveling. She watched as he suffered from liver failure, high fevers, inability to walk and inability to work. He was in and out of emergency rooms, and he took medication every day, but she realized that he wasn't getting enough nutrition. So she turned to juicing. \"It was amazing because he could take in pounds and pounds of produce very easily, and within weeks, he started to have more vitality and started to heal and feel different,\" Angela Maicki said. \"We came out of the whole experience very inspired and very excited to share what we had learned with the community.\" City Press Juice, which opened in May 2014, specializes in organic cold-pressed juices and other health products. Celery juice is in all of the bar's green juices. But the vegetable was not as popular then as it is now, Maicki said, and they had to defend it to customers who considered it a filler ingredient. Although Maicki said she's excited that more people are on board with celery juice, she wants people at home to make sure the celery they're using is organic and pesticide- and GMO-free, in addition to being raw when consumed. At City Press, 3 pounds of celery is cold pressed into a 16-ounce juice, which means the stalks are put through a masticating juicer (it squeezes the juice rather than blends it) and pressed with 14 tons of pressure, which removes the pulp and fiber. In a post published on its website, the juicery claims that celery juice heals the gut, aids in detox and is anti-inflammatory, a cancer fighter and a metabolism booster. \"We highly believe that foods heal, but it takes time, and not one ingredient and not one juice is going to be a miracle overnight,\" Maicki said. \"I like to compare diet and health to a marathon. It takes time. Your body will start to see changes, but it will take time, and that's OK.\" Maicki also added that while you may not necessarily want fiber in your juice, you should be getting it by consuming whole raw vegetables, fruits and foods. The juice should not be replacing a healthy diet, but can complement one, she said. \"I think the beauty of juicing celery is you can juice pounds and pounds of celery into a very accessible amount,\" Maicki said. \"It's hard to chew pounds and pounds of celery in the morning or for lunch.\" While there are certainly benefits to drinking celery juice, Welstead cautions against putting too much faith in the green liquid. Many of the claims are still unsupported by science and need further research and clinical trails to fully understand which benefits are real and which are just fairy tales. Celery is low-calorie, low in sugar, contains a number of minerals like potassium (a diuretic) and is 95 percent water, Welstead said, which makes it hydrating and helpful for de-bloating. People who are on blood thinners should avoid it, she said, as it can counteract the medication because of its vitamin K content. Claims of celery revving up your metabolism and balancing pH are not supported by science, said Welstead, who noted that some of these unsubstantiated beliefs were put out by Andrew William, who goes by the name \"Medical Medium\" and, according to his website (medicalmedium.com), \"was born with the unique ability to converse with the Spirit of Compassion,\" who gives him \"health information that's often far ahead of its time.\" William was a contributor to Gweneth Paltrow's Goop and claims to have started the \"Global Celery Juice Movement.\" There are only a few clinical studies that have supported some of the claims around celery juice, Welstead said, but for the most part, there's not enough evidence in clinical studies to prove all of its purported benefits yet. In 1991, the University of Chicago published a study that said celery contains the chemical 3-n-butylphthalide, which increased blood vessel diameter and helped lower blood pressure and increase circulation. This helps people feel they have more energy. In the study, a man who was diagnosed with hypertension ate four stalks of celery a day for a week, and within a week, his blood pressure had fallen dramatically. Instead of having celery juice, people should consider just eating a few stalks of celery, Welstead said. This way, they can reap the benefits of the high-fiber content in the plant, which will also help them feel full and satisfied. While juice may be beneficial, fiber is what helps change gut bacteria, Welstead said. A three-day juice-cleanse study conducted in 2017 concluded that juice cleanses that included fiber have the ability to help change gut bacteria that are associated with weight loss. However, the study noted that further studies are required to confirm that the change in the intestinal microbiome is directly linked to weight loss. \"If people want to start their day with celery juice, it won't be harmful, but they also need to focus on their whole diet and what they're eating throughout the day,\" Welstead said. \"Overall, it's a thumbs-up, but be "}
