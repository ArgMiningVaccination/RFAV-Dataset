However, the roots of educational excellence at Northwestern trace back to 1941 with the founding of Nort hwestern College of Chiropractic. The College was founded in response to a need in the Midwestern states for an educational institution offering a broad program in clinical and chiropractic sciences. Our founder and first president was John B. Wolfe, DC. S tarting with three students on the first day, a postwar influx of veterans raised the total enrollment to 280 by 1949. Rigorous academic goals, excellent faculty and quality students all helped Northwestern to grow and prosper. Northwestern reorganized as a non- profit organization in June of 1949. Northwestern was established in a Minneapolis store- front space with three rooms. Growing enrollment led to a move to a new campus on Park Avenue in Minneapolis in 1964, then in 1974 to a larger campus on Mississ ippi River Boulevard in St. Paul. In 1983 Northwestern moved to its current location on a beautiful 25- acre campus in Bloomington, Minnesota. In addition to classrooms, lecture halls and labs, our campus includes a library, auditorium, cafeteria, gymnasium , fitness center, indoor swimming pool, the Foot Levelers Bookstore, and the Center for Diagnostic Imaging digital radiology lab/classroom. The beautiful grounds include a pond, a labyrinth, and a serene outdoor gathering space, the Standard Process Healin g Garden. The College became a University in 1999 when it merged with the Minnesota Institute of Acupuncture and Herbal Studies. The following year the School of Massage Therapy was established, making Northwestern the first academic institution to offer multiple natural health care programs. In 1965 Northwestern introduced a new two- year pre- professional requirement for all incoming students, and adopted objectives that would ensure the development of a quality education program designed to meet the needs of the profession. Northwestern pioneered the six -year chiropractic academic program, which several years later became a requirement of all chiropractic programs by the Council on Chiropractic Education. Northwestern pioneered and is a leader in community -based clinical education, and established the final trimester preceptorship for chiropractic interns, partnering with practitioners and clinics across the United States and in several other countries. Pre sently Northwestern owns and operates a public clinic on the Bloomington campus. As we approach our 75 th anniversary in 2016, the University is poised for growth in new programs and clinical services. The sixth President took office in July 2014. Faculty and Staff are dedicated to providing an engaging and supportive learning environment. Enrollment has grown to nearly 1,000 students. We offer certificate programs, an Associate of Applied Sciences degree, a Bachelor of Science degree, two Master's degrees, a Master of Health Science in Applied Clinical Nutrition, and a doctor of chiropractic degree. Starting with our initial three student class to today's alumni community of more than 7,500, Northwestern has a ri ch history and exciting future. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 11 Explore Northwestern A Vibrant Student Life STUDENT LIFE Orientation New Student O rientation is designed to acquaint students with each other, as well as with the campus.

OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK College of Chiropractic The United States Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook for 2014 states that \" Employment of chiropractors is projected to grow 15 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than the average for all occupations. People across all age groups are increasingly becoming interested in chiropractic care, because chiropractors use nonsurgical methods of treatment and do not prescribe drugs .\" Doctors of Chiropractic have many different practice opportunities, from solo practice to group offices, from integrative health care clinics to employment in medical clinics. With licensure opportunities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and many foreign countries, chiropractic is a maturing, growing and widely accepted profession. Insurance coverage is broadly avai lable. Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Graduates face a marketplace where these professions are enjoying widening acceptance. Currently, most practitioners have private practices, while an increasing number are employed or collaborate with community service institutions, major health care agenc ies and health maintenance organizations. Regulation of acupuncturists and Oriental medicine practitioners varies widely: from licensure, to regulation, to being unregulated. Insurance coverage for acupuncture services is gradual ly increasing. There is a growing interest in integrative health care nationwide. In Minnesota, Hennepin County Medical Center has long offered Oriental medicine treatment by licensed acupuncturists and has built a national name in addiction treatment and research. Acupuncture is wi dely seen as a profession on the rise and is emerging as an important health care profession that stands on its own and can integrates well with conventional health care services. Massage Therapy Massage therapy is a profession that is rapidly maturing. E ducational programs have proliferated in recent years across the nation, and with national program accreditation recognition by the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation, an important step for stabilizing and standardizing massage therapy education and practices has been taken. Graduates have many opportunities for private solo practice, working with other health care professionals (doctors of chiropractic are the single largest health care profession that employ massage therapists), or working in health care institutions such as clinics and hospitals. Insurance coverage for some conditions and types of injuries is available in certain states and increasing, especially in alliance with medical referrals. The United States Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook for 2014 notes \" Employment of massage therapists is projected to grow 23 percent from 2012 to 2022, much faster than the average for all occupations. Continued growth in the demand for massage services will lead to new openings for mass age therapists .\" 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 22 Explore Northwestern FINANCIAL AND ACADEMIC POLICIES Northwestern Health Sciences University is a private, non- profit institution that derives its financial resources from alumni gifts, private foundation grant s, clinic fees, student tuition and the benevolence of the University's alumni and friends.

WITHDRAWAL POLICY The University recognizes that a decision to withdraw for any reason, financ ial or personal, is a difficult one. It is advisable for a student to share thoughts about potential withdrawal with their program office and the Office of Stude nt Affairs as early as possible so that the University may offer counsel on different alternatives and the student may derive maximum benefit under the University's refund policy. Students may official ly withdraw from the University by completing the withdrawal process which includes submitting an official withdrawal form which can be obtained from the Office of Student Financial Services and Registrar. The date of withdrawal will be noted as the date on which the student officially begins the withdrawal process, not the date the student stopped attending classes. If, at the time of withdrawal, the student's payments for the trimester exceed the amount of liability, he or she will be entitled to a refund of the excess; if the student's payments are less than the liability, the balance will be due and payable immediately . 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 23 Students withdrawing f rom the University will be considered in good st anding, unless they have failed to clear up any probation notati on on their record or failed to pay a tuition and fees liability. Students in good standing may reenter the University upon application for readmission. Students not in good academic standing may be required to complete conditions im posed by the Academic S tandards Committee. Students not in good financial standing are required to clear th eir financial obligations prior to readmission. COURSE ADD/DROP/WITHDRAW Students must meet with the Academic Success and Advising Coordinator and complete an add/drop form. For drops and or withdrawals the official drop/withdrawal date is determined by the date the add/drop form is received by the Registrar's office during regular office hours. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY Students may withdraw from Northwestern Health Sciences University (that is, withdraw from all classes) at any time by completing an official withdrawal notice. Forms are available in the Office of Student Financial Services and Registrar. The official date of withdrawal is the date the student begins the withdrawal process, not the date the student ceased attending classes. Students who withdraw from all classes must return any items that belong to the un iversity. Tuition refunds, if any, are established by the tuition refund schedule posted later in the section. Financial aid recipients who withdraw from Northwestern Health Sciences University should be aware that they may need to return part or all of the funds they were awarded. Before officially withdrawing from classes, we recommend that you contact the Student Affairs Office. Students are also encouraged to be aware of the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. (See Satisfactory Academic Progress section.) CONDITIONS FOR DETERMINING TUITION REFUNDS Students are responsible for all tuition and f ees incurred by registration in a course. Failing to attend or ceasing to attend a course does not constitute a withdrawal from the course. Only the official date of withdrawal determined by Student Affairs Office or the by the Registrar's reception of a C hange in Registration form will determine whether a full refund, a partial refund, or no refund will be available based on the date of withdrawal. Tuition refunds (if any) for dropped courses are determined by the standard refund calendar available 100 per cent of tuition charges will be refunded if the student withdraws on or before the first day of classes. 90 percent of tuition charges will be refunded if the student withdraws after the first day of class but before 10 percent (in time) of the enrollment period. 50 percent of tuition charges will be refunded if the student withdraws during the time between 10 percent (in time) and 25 percent (in time) of the enrollment period. 25 percent of tuition charges will be refunded if the student withdraws during t he time between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) and the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the enrollment period. No refund will be granted, if withdrawal is made after 50 percent of the enrollment period has passed. All percentages will be rounded. RETURN OF TITLE IV ( FEDERAL) AID If the students withdrawals from Northwestern Health Sciences University during a trimester, a calculation of \"earned\" versus \"unearned\" federal aid must be determined. This federal policy assumes the student earned aid based on how much time has elapsed in the term. If the student received federal financial aid, that aid may be reduced as a result of the withdrawal. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 24 There are three steps that Northwestern Health Sciences University must complete to comply wi th the federal policy: 1. Determine the withdrawal date and/or last date of attendance or academic activity. The financial aid office must first verify with the student's instructor(s) that s/he attended or participated in academic activities related to their class(es) for the term. 2. Determine the amount of earned federal aid. 3. Return unearned federal funds to the appropriate program(s). The student must withdraw officially by contacting the Office of Student Affairs. The withdrawal date is the date the student began the withdrawal process. If the student failed to withdraw officially, the withdrawal date will become the midpoint of the term, unless the university can document a later date. In cases where an earlier date of last attendance or academic activity i s determined, this date will be used in the calculation of \"earned\" federal aid. If the student withdrew or last attended before completing 60 percent of the term, s/he \"earned\" federal funds in direct proportion to the length of time s/he was enrolled. The percentage of earned aid is determined by dividing the total number of calendar days in the term enrolled by the total number of calendar days in the term. If the student completed 60 percent of the term, s /he earned all of their federal financial aid for the term. The responsibility to repay unearned aid is shared by the institution and the student. The institution's share is the lesser of unearned aid or unearned institutional charges. The institution's share must be repaid to the federal aid programs in the following order, before the student's share is considered: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan 2. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan 3. Federal Perkins Loan 4. Federal Direct GRADPLUS/Parent PLUS Loan 5. Federal Pell Grant 6. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant ( SEOG) 7. Other Title IV Aid If a student is required to repay a portion of the loan through the student's share calculation, the student is not expected to return those funds immediately, but rather begin repayment according to the terms and conditions of the promis sory note. If a portion of the unearned Federal Loan funds m ust be returned by the school, the student is responsible for repaying the money back to Northwestern Health Sciences University. If this causes undue hardship, a satisfactory payment arrangement can be made with the Accounting Office. RETURN OF MN STATE F INANCIAL AID PR OGRAM FUNDS Recipients of MN State Financial Aid program funds may also have their awards recalculated upon withdrawal. MN State Financial Aid Program funds may need to be returned based on the result of the MN State Programs Refund Calculation.

Supportive services are available at Northwestern Health Sciences University to help ensure academic success. Information about these services is available in the Student Affairs Office. Satisfactory Academic Progress will be monitored at the end of each grading period to establish the student's eligibility to continue receiving financial aid. Students may continue to receive f inancial aid by meeting all of the following criteria which have been established as the minimum standards for making SAP at Northwestern Health Sciences University. This policy replaces all previous SAP policies. 1. Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average Requirement: A student must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) to retain financial aid eligibility. A minimum CGPA must be earned in the following colleges : College of Chiropractic 2.0 College of Health and Wellness 2.0 2. Minimum Cumulative Pace Requirement: A student must successfully complete at least 67% of cumulative attempted hours by the end of each trimester. The completed percentage is determined by dividing credits earned by the number of credits attempted. Note: While grades of W, WP, and WF may have no impact in the academic GPA calculations, these grades are included as attempted credits, as required by Federal regulations. 3. Maximum Time Frame Requirement The maximum number of credit hours allowable to complete a degree is 150% of the credit hours normally required to complete the degree program. Financial Aid Warning Status A student who fails the SAP evaluation at Northwestern Health Sciences University may be placed on Financial Aid Warning status. Financial Aid Warning lasts for one trimester and does not require action (such as an appeal) by the student. This option is permitted at Northwestern Health Sciences University since SAP is reviewed at every payment period/trimester. A student on Financial Aid Warning is notified of the status at the beginning of the trimester. There is no limit to the number of Financial Aid Warnings a student can receive during his or her enrollment and it is possible that a student could receive more than one Financial Aid Warning period, but not in consecutive trimesters. - For example, if a student is not making SAP after the fall trimester, the student may be placed on Financial Aid Warning. The student could make SAP during the spring and then fail to make SAP during the subsequent fall. The student could again be placed on Financial Aid Warning after the subsequent fall. The student could not have successive trimesters in Financial Aid Warning status. Financial Aid Probation Status After a Financial Aid Warning, a student who continues to fail SAP must successfully appeal to be placed on Financial Aid Probation and be permitted to receive financial aid. Financial Aid Probation status is not granted automatically at Northwestern Health Scienc es University. At the end of one trimester on Financial Aid Probation, the student must make SAP or must be meeting the requirements of the academic plan set in the appeal for probation. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 27 - Generally speaking, a student granted Financial Aid Probation status should be given two academic requirements during the probation trimester, in addition to fulfilling the academic plan: \u00b0 Complete all coursework with passing grades (e.g., no W or F grades) \u00b0 Achieve a trimester GPA of 2.0 or higher. After trimester on Financ ial Aid Probation, a student that is still not making SAP cannot be automatically placed on another trimester of Financial Aid Probation. The student would have to successfully appeal to be eligible for financial aid. Appeals submitted for students who continue to fail SAP after a probation period must contain information about why the student failed to make SAP at the end of the Financial Aid Probation period, including what had changed that caused the student to not make SAP during the probationary period and why the student will be able to meet SAP on the terms of the academic plan. If the Academic Program determines, based on the appeal, that the student will require more than one payment period to meet SAP, it may recommend the student remain on probati on and develop an academic plan for the student. The Financial Aid Office is required to review his/her progress at the end of probation period, to determine if the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan. If the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan, the student is eligible to receive Title IV aid as long as the student continues to meet those requirements and is reviewed according to the requirements specified in the plan. SAP APPEAL When a student becomes ineligible f or financial aid due to failure to meet SAP standards, an opportunity is given to appeal for further financial aid consideration. A student may file a SAP Appeal with the Office of Financial Aid on the basis of: Death of a relative Injury or illness of the student Other special circumstances (such as difficult transition to NWHSU, family issues, legal troubles, work or budget problems, etc.) Completed SAP appeals will be re viewed within 15 business days. The student will be notified by campus email if the appeal is accepted or denied. If the email is returned undeliverable, a letter will be mailed to the student's current residing address as listed on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). ADDITONAL SAP INFORM ATION Dual Degree Programs/Changed Majors Students who are enrolled in a dual degree program or who have changed majors* may file a sap appeal to request an extension of the maximum time frame provision of the sap policy. Such requests will be evaluated on an individual basis. *Human biology is the only undergraduate major offered at this time. Second Degrees Students seeking second degrees are monitored like any other students under this policy. Students who exceed the maximum time fra me allowed by their respective program may file a sap appeal to request an extension. Appeals will be evaluated on an individual basis. Transfer/Audit Credits Transfer and consortium credits accepted by the university will be included when calculating your credit completion ratio and maximum time frame, but not your GPA. This includes credits earned from non- northwestern health sciences university programs. Audit credits are not considered either attempted or earned. Credit hours earned at a foreign instit ution are included in the sap evaluation if the university accepts the credit hours. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 28 Repeated Coursework Repeated courses will count toward enrollment status, attempted hours and maximum time frame. Summer Sessions Courses All hours attempted and completed in the summer sessions are treated as any other trimester credit hours in determining sap. FEDERAL STUDENT AID AT A GLANCE Federal Student Financial Aid (SFA), http://www.studentaid.ed.gov, is assistance for students enrolled at least half-time in participating schools. It helps to cover school expenses, including tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and transportation. Most aid is need- based and the three types of aid are grants, loans and work -study. GRANTS A grant is a type of gift aid that does not require repayment. Each grant has different requirements for eligibility. Eligibility for need- based grants is determined using federal and/or state formulas and the information the student provided on the FAFSA . Completion of the FAFSA is the only application required to be considered for the specif ic grant programs listed below. FEDERAL PELL/SEOG ( Massage Therapy/Undergraduate Programs ) The Federal Pell and SEOG grants are federally funded grants tha t are credited to a student 's account after the Financial Aid Office verifies the student's information with the federal processor. Beginning in Fall 2012, students are now limited to 12 semesters (or 600%) of Pell Grant eligibi lity. This change affects all students regardless of when or where they received their first Pell Grant. Students that have received the Pell Grant in the academic year 2011- 2012 and have already used 600% of their Pell Grant eligibility will no longer be eligible to receive a Pell Grant starting Fall 2012. Students may view their percentage of Pell Grant used by logging into www.nslds.ed.gov. 'Lifetime Eligibility Used' percentage will be dis played in the 'Grants' section. Visit the Federal Student Aid website for more information. MINNESOTA STATE GRANT PROGRAM (Massage Therapy/ Undergraduate Programs ) The Minnesota State Grant Program provides under - graduate students with assistance in meeting the cost of attendance at eligible Minnesota public and private post -secondary institutions of their choice. In order to receive an award, the student must demonstrate financial need, be a Minnesota resident attending an eligible Minnesota institution, be making satisfactory academic progress, and meet any federal and state requirements. SCHOLARSHIPS Northwestern Health Sciences University offers a wide variety of institutional aid including scholarships and endowments. Northwestern Health Sciences University scholarships are awarded based on financial resources, academic performance, service/leadership involvement, trimester level, scholarship history and facult y/clinic recommendation. Funds from outside agencies may also be available. Institutional scholarships and grants are intended to encourage geographical, cultural and socioeconomic diversity at Northwestern Health Sciences Universi ty. Please note that the avail ability of funds is based on contributions, interest bearing accounts and institutional funding. Actual amounts may vary. Students may contact the Financial Aid Office for more information about scholarships. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 29 FEDERAL DIRECT SUBSI DIZED AND UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS Federal Direct Loans are long- term, low -interest loans designed to provide additional funds for post -secondary education.

Under this Act, interest rates will be determined each spring for new loans being made for the upcoming award year , which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan will have a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. For current rates visit: www.studentloans.gov . LOAN FEES Most federal student loans have loan fees that are a percentage of the total loan amount. The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement received . 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 30 LOAN REPAYMENT Repayment begins six months (grace period) after the month in which you cease attending school at least half time. The standard repayment period is 10 years and an extended plan up to 25 years is available to students. During repayment a variety of plans will be available to assist borrowers in meeting repayment obligations, including: Income Based Repayment (IBR), graduated repayment, and standard plan. PARENT PLUS LOAN A Parent may borrow a PLUS Loan up to the student's cost of education minus other financial aid for the loan period. The parent must specify the amount he/she wants to borrow. A PLUS loan may not be made for more than the parent requests. To borrow a PLUS loan, the parent must not have adverse credit. GRADUATE PLUS LOAN For graduate and professional students only, students may borrow under GRAD PLUS program eligibility criteria and other federal guidelines. To borrow a GRADUATE PLUS loan, the borrower must not have adverse credit. Adverse Credit is defined as: Having one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that are 90 or more days delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or that have been placed in collection or charged off (written off) during the two years preceding the date of the credit report; or If, during the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the borrower has been subject to a - default determination, - discharge of debts in bankruptcy, - foreclosure, - repossession, - tax lien, - wage garnishment, or - write -off of a federal student aid debt.

ACADEMIC POLICIES The following provides a summary of our Academic Policies. The official policies are found in the University Student Handbook, which is available online at http://www.nwhealth.edu. The University Student Handbook is updated more frequently than the University catalog. In all cases, the Ac ademic Policies as stated in the current University Student Handbook will be followed. Trimester Credits The academic calendar includes fall, winter and summer trimesters of 15 weeks each. In general, one credit represents one lecture hour, two laborator y hours or three clinical hours per week. Attendance Policy Students are required to fulfill all course responsibilities, including class attendance, which are described by faculty in the course syllabus. Academic Evaluation and Grades Academic evaluation provides incentives to students, rewards achievement and identifies students who are having difficulty. Final grades in each subject are issued at the end of each trimester and reflect a student's performance in some combination of the following: comprehensive final examinations; announced tests, quizzes, assignments, classroom and laboratory work; participation in and contribution to class discussions; and attendance. Class grades summarize student achievement levels relative to objectives explained by t he instructor. Students who complete all the work assigned in a course are graded as follows: A, B, C, or D (excellent, above average, average or minimal achievement, respectively). Students who fail to achieve minimal competency are graded with F for failure. An incomplete (I) indicates that the full work of the course has not been completed because of illness or some cause beyond the student's control. Students in some classes may be assigned either an S for Satisfactory or a U for Unsatisfactory. The grades of S/U are not included in determining grade point average (GPA). The final grade of U (unsatisfactory) is considered to be a grade of failure in the course. The criteria for assignment of grades are contained in each course syllabus. Academic Standing Students must be in good academic standing to serve as Student Senate officers or as officers of approved student organizations. Students are considered in good academic standing when their cumulative grade point average is greater than 2.0 at the en d of any trimester. Students are placed on academic probation when their grade point average is less than 2.0 at end of any trimester . The University Student Handbook provides details pertaining to probation, dismissal, and review procedures. Program Chan ges Northwestern Health Sciences University reserves the right to change or discontinue academic programs at the University's discretion. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 36 Undergraduate Health Sciences UNDERGRADUATE COURSE LIST: Course Hours Number Title Credits Contact Lecture Lab Clinic ANAT1001 Anatomy and Physiology 1 4 75 45 30 0 ANAT1002 Anatomy and Physiology 2 4 75 45 30 0 BIOC3110 Biochemistry 4 75 45 30 0 UGE3730 Bioethics 3 45 45 0 0 BIOL2020 Biology Today 2 30 30 0 0 CAP4900 Capstone Project 2 30 30 0 0 BIOL3010 Cell Biology 4 75 45 30 0 UGE3710 Communication Skills for Health Professionals 3 45 45 0 0 UGE3720 Critical Thinking for Health Professionals 3 45 45 0 0 ANTH1001 Cultural Anthropology 4 60 60 0 0 ANTH1005 Culture and Health 4 60 60 0 0 ENGL1001 English Composition 3 45 45 0 0 PHIL3010 Episte mology of Health 4 60 60 0 0 ETHC1001 Ethics 3 45 45 0 0 MATH1005 Foundations of Math 3 45 45 0 0 CHEM2048 General Chemistry 1 4 75 45 30 0 CHEM2049 General Chemistry 2 4 75 45 30 0 PHYS2040 General Physics 1: Fundamentals of Physics 4 75 45 30 0 PHYS2041 General Physics 2 : Electricity and Magnetism 4 75 45 30 0 PSYC1001 General Psychology 3 45 45 0 0 BIOL4410 Genetics 4 75 45 30 0 PSYC1002 Health Psychology 4 60 60 0 0 HIST3110 History of Health Care 3 45 45 0 0 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 37 Course Hours Number Title Credits Contact Lecture Lab Clinic ENGL1002 Human Communication 3 45 45 0 0 ANTH2005 Human Origins 4 60 60 0 0 BIOL2010 Introduction to Biology 4 75 45 30 0 MAND3310 Mandarin for Health Professionals 3 45 45 0 0 MEDT1001 Medical Terminology 1 15 15 0 0 BIOL4010 Microbiology 4 75 45 30 0 CHEM2058 Organic Chemistry 1 4 75 45 30 0 CHEM2059 Organic Chemistry 2 4 75 45 30 0 PSYC3210 Psychology of Addiction 3 45 45 0 0 SOC1006 Sex and Gender 3 45 45 0 0 SOC1001 Sociology 3 45 45 0 0 SPAN1001 Spanish for Health Professionals 3 45 45 0 0 CHEM1001 Survey of Biological Chemistry 1.5 22.5 22.5 0 0 UGE3740 Understanding and Using Research 3 45 45 0 0 HIST1003 World History since 1400 4 60 60 0 0 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 38 COURSE DESCRIPTIONS ANAT1001 Anatomy and Physiology 1 4 credits (75 hours): 45 lecture hours; 30 laboratory hours Prerequisite: None The first in a two-part sequence of courses introduces students to the organization of the body on a chemical, cellular, tissue and system level.

We prepare health care and wellness professionals to be able to assess and offer nutritional advice as allowed within your discipline's scope of practice by providing evidence -based knowledge and skills. Graduates of our program will ground their work in scientific knowledge, applied clinical proficiency, and the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior. PROGRAM LEARNING OUT COMES FOR MASTER OF HEALTH SCI ENCES IN APPLIED CLINICAL NUTRITION : Within their discipline's scope of practice, health care and wellness professionals who successfully complete the Master of Health Science in Appl ied Clinical Nutrition program will be able to: 1. Perform a competent nutritional assessment and create a patient -centered nutrition care plan based on sound nutrition principles, scientific evidence, and biomedical reasoning. 2. Critically appraise nutrition -related literature and apply this information to the practice of clinical nutrition and evaluate the reliability and validity of patient directed materials and create effective patient nutrition materials based on current, accurate and scientifically -supported evidence. 3. Provide competent and reliable nutritional consultations and demonstrate professional written and oral communication skills as appropriate to the practice of applied clinical nutrition. 4. Understand the value of a personal professional development and the role of life- long learning in a professional career, as well as their role in lifelong contribution to the body of knowledge in their field, including but not limited to the ability to produce scholarship worthy of publication in peer -reviewed journals. ROLE OF APPLIED CLINICAL NUT RITION IN MAINTAINING HEALTH AND WELL -BEING Whether you are preparing to enter a health career or if you are already a health care or wellness professional, you are aware of the significant role that nutrition plays in maintaining health and in the prevention, management and treatment of chronic disease. According to the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committ ee Executive Summary [http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015- scientific -report/02- executive- summary.asp ] their work was guided by two fundamental realities . First, about half of all American adults \u2014117 million individuals \u2014have one or more preventable, chronic diseases, and about two- thirds of U.S. adults \u2014nearly 155 million individuals \u2014are overweight or obese. These conditions have been highly preval ent for more than two decades. Poor dietary patterns, overconsumption of calories, and physical inactivity directly contribute to these disorders. Hence, healthcare professionals outside of the field of nutrition and dietetics also need to be prepared to h elp address these nutritional needs and concerns within their d iscipline's scope of practice. To help address this need, our Applied Clinical Nutrition Program is designed to provide sound, evidence- based nutrition information and skills for you, as curren t/future health care and wellness professionals, to apply within your current or future scope of practice. As another example, nutrition plays an important role in the prevention of chronic disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control , diseases and conditions that are more chronic in nature such as arthritis, cancer, stroke, heart disease, diabetes and obesity are very common, costly as well as the most preventable of all health problems. Adequate vs. inadequate nutrition plays a role in the prevention, treatment, management and/or causation of the majority of these common chronic diseases and conditions. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 55 Moreover, dietary risk factors have been associated with death and disabili ty as shown by a 2010 report from the U.S. Burden of Disease Collaborators . This report identified dietary risk factors as responsible for 26% of deaths and 14% of disability -adjusted life- years (estimated as the sum of years lived with disability and life lost to premature mortality). The report goes on to say that the identified dietary ri sk factors included diets low in fruits, low in nuts and seeds, high in sodium, high in processed meats, low in vegetables, and high in trans fats - which is generally a typical American diet. Given the significant role that diet and good nutrition play in maintaining health, our Applied Clinical Nutrition Program is designed to provide sound, evidence- based nutrition information for you to incorporate within your current or future scope of practice to ultimately enhance patient care and optimize individual health and well - being. CLASS SIZE AND ATTEN DANCE The University believes that small class sizes are essential to effective learning. Therefore, the teacher -to-student ratio will typically not exceed 1:50. Course attendance is a demonstration of seriousness about the program of study, a demonstration of respect for the faculty and your colleagues, and a necessity for course success. ADMISSION INFORMATIO N Northwestern admits as students, women and men of good character and health who are qualified by prev ious education and experience to meet its academic challenges.

Applications are available online at http:// www.nwhealth.edu or from the Office of Admissions. The application must include: 1. A properly completed application for admission; 2. An application processing fee of $50 (US dollars). This fee is non- refundable; 3. Official transcripts from all colleges attended sent directly to the Office of Admissi ons at Northwestern Health Sciences University from those colleges. High school transcripts or a General Educational Development diploma (GED) are required only if the student has less than 60 semester credits or does not have prior college work. NOTE: Indicate on your application if your transcripts will be arriving under another name. Selection of Candidates The Admissions Committee seeks to matriculate students who best suit the philosophies and goals of the University. Northwestern seeks to select students who have strong academic records. The University employs a rolling admissions process. Therefore, early application could increase the applicant's probability for acceptance. The University encourages campus visits for all applicants and reserves the right to require an interview. Tuition Deposit Policy Applicants will be notified in writing of the Admission Committee's decision regarding their application following receipt of all application materials and committee review. Upon notification of ac ceptance, a candidate must remit a tuition deposit of $100 (US dollars) to reserve a position in the entering class. This tuition deposit is non- refundable but is applied toward the first trimester tuition. If the student has a loan in progress for the fir st trimester at Northwestern, then the first trimester tuition will be credited against this loan. It is important to note that because of the limited space available in each class, scheduling priorities and the cost of education, the institutional refund policy does not apply to the $100 tuition deposit. Transfer Students and Transfer Policy Requests for transfer credit will be considered based on the following criteria: 1. An official transcript must accompany any request for transfer credit; 2. The institution where the coursework was completed must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education; 3. The course(s) completed at the other institution must have similar objectives and be of similar content and length as the course(s) being substituted. A course catalog and/or syllabus may be required to demonstrate course content; 4. Students must have earned a C or better in any course being considered for transfer; 5. Any coursework submitted for transfer mus t have been completed within five years of the date that a transfer application is submitted to the University; 6. A maximum of 8 credits will be transferred per student in the certificate program and 15 credits per student in the Master's Degree program; 7. Requests for transfer credit will only be considered prior to matriculation into the program; 8. The final decision regarding transfer credit rests with the Dean of the College of Health and Wellness. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 57 Payment All tuition and fees owed are due and payable by the end of the third week of class each academic term. After the completion of the third week of class, if tuition has not been paid or if arrangements for payment have not been made with the Student Records and Financial Services Office, a $100 (US dollars) late fee will be assessed and registration for that academic term will be canceled. In order to be reinstated, the affected student must pay tuition in full or make payment arrangements with the Student Records and Financial Services Office. All tuition and fees owed by a student must be paid in full before registration begins for the subsequent academic term or s/he will not be allowed to register. Any student with a balance due at the time of graduation will not receive a diploma and copies of official transcripts will be withheld until the balance is paid in full. When you receive financial aid, you are subject to the 150 percent rule. This rule means that if you attempt more than 150 percent of the credit hours needed to graduate from the program, you will not be eligible to continue to receive financial aid. (For example, the number of credit hours needed to complete the certificate program is 16 and 150 percent of 16 credits is 24 credits.) The Institutional Refund Policy applies to stude nts who withdraw and students who are dismissed and in the case of cancellation of the program in which the student is enrolled. Readmission A student who has withdrawn or been dismissed from the program may petition in writing for readmission to the program. Petitions for readmission must be submitted to the Dean. The following procedure applies: 1. A committee composed of faculty convenes to review the student's written request; 2. The committee, chaired by the Dean, either: requests additional inform ation; or writes a report recommending or not recommending readmission based on review of the request; 3. A recommendation for reinstatement shall include: specific provisions for readmission (e.g., retaking a course or courses); date for readmission (e.g. , immediately or the following academic term). 4. The Dean makes the final decision regarding readmission and communicates the decision in writing to the student. The decision of the Dean may be appealed to the Provost; 5. The Dean monitors the progress surrounding the stipulated provisions (if any) of any readmitted learner student and reports to the Dean if the learner has or has not satisfied the stipulated provisions (if any) for readmission; 6. The Dean communicates in writing to the student that all provisions (if any) for readmission have been met, or that provisions have not been satisfied and the student is dismissed. Non-Program Students Students not currently admitted to a program may enroll in a course for credit, if they meet the prerequisites, space is available and approval for attendance in the course has been granted by the course instructor and the Dean. Students that are granted approval to enroll in a course should contact the Office of Admissions for a special application and registration instructions. ACADEMIC POLICY The University Student Handbook, which is available online at http://www.nwhealth.edu , contains general policies and procedures that apply to all students of the University. Academic Policy Credits The academic calendar includes fall, winter and summer academic terms of 15 weeks each. In general, one credit in the Applied Clinical Nutrit ion program represents 15 lecture hours. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 58 Grading Policy The Applied Clinical Nutrition program uses a grade point system to evaluat e the overall quality of course work. Courses are graded A, B, C, or F. The number of grade points earned in a given course is the number of credits for that course multiplied by the grade point corresponding to the grade recorded in that course, as indicated here: Grade Grade Points Suggested Achievement Level A 4 90 - 100 percent of points; B 3 80 - 89.999 percent of points; C 2 70 - 79.999 percent of points; F 0 Less than 70 percent of points; S N/A Satisfactory (C or better); competency successfully demonstrated U N/A Unsatisfactory (D/F); competency not successfully demonstrated I N/A Incomplete W N/A Withdrawal T N/A Transfer; used to indicate courses for which the learner received advanced standing or transfer credit Notes on Grading: 1. Instructors assign letter grades as appropriate according to the student's achievement level. The assignment of and changes to course grades are the sole responsibility of the instructor of record. A grade may be changed only if there was an error in calculation. If you believe there has been an error in the calcula tion of a grade, contact the instructor for an explanation of the grade within the first week of classes the following term. If a grade is determined to be in error, a grade change report will be issued to the Department of Student Records. 2. Students enrolled in the Applied Clinical Nutrition Program must maintain a 2.0 (C) cumulative grade point average (GPA) or better unless otherwise stipulated. 3. Pluses and minuses are not part of the official grading system and are not figured into a student's grade point average (GPA); 4. The Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grade option is intended for course work where a letter grade cannot be appropriately assigned. Credits under this option are counted toward the total number of credits required for graduation but are not used in determining a student's grade point average; 5. A student must earn a grade of A, B, C, or S in order to fulfill course requirements. Use of the Grade I The grade of I (incomplete) indicates that work was not completed prior to the last day of the term or learning contract and is intended to reflect circumstances beyond the student's or instructor's control. It is the responsibility of the student to consult with the instructor to determine the work still remaining to be completed. Incomplete work must be satisfactorily completed during the first four weeks of the next academic term. After that time, a grade of I will automatically become a grade of F. Students experiencing extenuating circumstances may seek a waiver of the time limit from the program administrator, who may choose to grant the waiver, refuse the waiver or refer the request to the Academic Standards Committee. The University reserves the right to require the Student to provide evidence of extenuating circumstances to the sat isfaction of the University. Under no circumstances will a waiver be awarded that extends beyond the conclusion of the student's next academic term. Academic Standing Students are considered in good academic standing unless they are dismissed or on academ ic probation. Students must be in good academic standing to serve as Student Senate officers or as officers of approved student organizations. Students in good academic standing may progress toward degree completion. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 59 Course Attendance and Punctuality Course attendance and punctuality represent a demonstration of seriousness about the program of study, a demonstration of respect for the faculty and your colleagues, and a necessity for course success. Each instructor will list course attendance requirement s and tardiness policies, including consequence for violation of these policies, on the course syllabus. With respect to courses taught entirely online, completion of all assigned materials including examinations, must be met as outlined in course syllabus. GRADUATION Graduation Requirements The Master of Health Science as well as Graduate Certificates in Applied Clinical Nutrition are granted to those candidates who have: 1. Satisfactory completion of a bachelor's degree (can be completed concurrently); 2. Completed the required curriculum for their specific program of study; 2. Earned a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or better; 3. Fulfilled all financia l obligations to the University . Graduation Rate Please refer to our webs ite for the most recent graduation rate statistics, if applicable. Neither the College of Health and Wellness nor the Applied Clinical Nutrition Program guarantees employment or licensure or certification of students upon completion of the program. PROFESSIONAL LICENSURE, REGISTRATION, OR CERTIFICATION Neither of the Graduate Certificates in Applied Clinical Nutrition nor the Master of Health Science in Applied Clinical Nutrition awards licensure or certification as a dietitian and/or nutritionist. In addition, these academic programs do not provide any supervised practice hours to meet the requirement for a dietetic internship or other licensure or certification. Statewide standards for licensure or certification as a nutritionist have been establi shed in the majority of states and the District of Columbia. Each state has established slightly differing standards for professional eligibility. Since professional licensure requirements vary by jurisdiction, students should not rely upon staff descripti ons or statements regarding licensure requirements but rather should consult directly with the licensure board for the profession and in the state or province in which they intend to practice. Hence, contact your state or province as to the academic and pr ofessional requirements necessary for that type of licensure or certification. The University makes no guarantees that an individual student will satisfy the licensure, registration or certification requirements of any particular state or other jurisdictio n. It is the responsibility of an individual student to confirm the regulatory requirements that may apply in any jurisdiction in which that student intends to practice. STUDY TIME The time required outside of scheduled class time for homework and studying can vary considerably based on the individual student. However, as a general rule, students should plan on a minimum of two to three hours of homework and studying outside of class for every one hour of lecture time. CURRICULUM OVERVIEW Master of Health Science (MHS) in Applied Clinical Nutrition Graduate Certificates in Applied Clinical Nutrition Our program in applied clinical nutrition offers, in addition to a Master of Health Science (MHS) in Applied Clinical Nutrition, the opportunity to earn two separate graduate certificates in lieu of the entire MHS degree.

Northwestern seeks to select students who have strong academic records and who demonstrate the motivational and personal characteristics suitable for a career in acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Willing ness to provide service and a caring attitude are important characteristics of a successful pract itioner. The University employs a rolling admissions process. Therefore, early application could increase the applicant's probability for acceptance. Students are strongly encouraged to apply at least nine to 12 months prior to the first day of their first academic term. Students interested in seeking transfer credit should apply as far in advance as possible, in order to assure that any required additional information may be obtained or challenge examinations completed prior to the first day of class. The University encourages campus visits for all applicants and reserves the right to require an interview. Tuition Deposit Policy Applicants will be notified in writing of the Admissions Committee's decision regarding their application following receipt and review of all information and materials. Upon notification of acceptance, a non- refundable tuition deposit of $300 ( US dollars) is required to secure a place in the program. The tuition deposit will be applied to the first trimester tuition. The tuition deposit should be submitted as soon as possible after notification of acceptance since processing of financ ial aid is initiated only after rec eipt of the deposit. First trimester students who have been accepted and paid their $300 tuiti on deposit must pay the balance of their first trimester tui tion by the end of the third week of classes. If the student has been awarded financial aid for the first trimester at Northwestern, then those funds will be credited against the student's Northwestern account. It is important to note that because of the limited space available in eac h class, scheduli ng priorities and the cost of education, the institutional refund policy does not apply to the $300 tuition deposit. Transfer Students A student wishing to transfer from another acupuncture or Oriental medicine program must: 1. Follow the same applicati on procedures as a new student (see Admission Information above); 2. Forward all official transcript s from any other acupuncture or Oriental medicine program(s) you have attended; 3. Submit two letters of recommendation written by faculty members from the acupuncture or Oriental medicine program (s) you attended; 4. Provide a letter from the registrar at that acupuncture or Oriental medicine program indicating you are in good academic standing and would be allowed to continue studies at that institution. Transfer Policy Courses may transfer to Northwestern if you have received grades of C or better. Transfer courses must have similar course content, name, length or objective, and correspond to courses within our acupuncture and Oriental medicine curriculum. The Program Director will determine comparability. All courses submitted to transfer must be applied for and posted to your Northwestern academic record no later than one year from matriculation. A transfer student must complete at least the last three trimesters (one academic year) in order to graduate from Northwestern. Excessive student loan debt may be a factor in the student's ability to transfer. The Student Records and Financial Services Office will set upper limits of previous indebtedness. Transfer policies are subject to change. Contact the Office of Admissions for current information. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 70 Transfer Credit At the discretion of the Program Director, credit may be granted for equivalent courses taken and passed in another program. Considerations may include the institution offering the courses, the course description and/or syllabus for each course, the length of t ime since completing the course, and life experience. The student may be required to pass a challenge exam. Student s have four options to complete graduation requirements without taking every required course: Tr ansfer Credit for equivalent courses, Transfer Credit for life experience, Waivers of Requirement, and/or CLEP Credits. Transfer credit will only be granted for the maximum number of hours available from Northwestern- equivalent courses. For example, a 180- hour course in anatomy and physiology from another program will only be worth 135 hours at Northwestern, if the equivalent Northwestern course is 135 hours. For Equivalent Courses To be considered for transfer credits, courses must be equivalent to those offered at Northwestern based on an evaluation of the student's official transcript by the program's academic administration. A syllabus or other detailed cours e description and a copy of the catalog from the original institution may be required. Normally, the course must be an academic course from an accredited i nstitution at the bachelor's degree level or better and passed within the past five years (occasionally, a course may need to have been passed within a shorter time frame) with a grade of C or better. A grade of C - is not acceptable if the awarding college states that the numerical equ ivalent is less than 2.0 (when A is 4.0). Ac creditation must be from an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. A transfer student from another acupuncture program must complete at least the last three full -time trimesters of resident study in the Northwestern program prior to graduat ion. Equivalent Course/Life Experience Transfer credit ma y be given to a student who has taken an equivalent course (which meets the above referenced standards) prior to the past five years , if life work or experi ence has enabled the student to use the ski lls learned in that course within the past five years . For example, current licensed health care providers would typically receive credit for most Western biomedicine courses taken more than five years ago, based on their life experience within the past fi ve years. Waivers of Requirement Occasionally, a waiver of requirement may be granted in lieu of a required course or course sequence. Credit will be giv en according to the above noted guidelines for maximum credit/hours allowed. Normally, a wa iver of requirement is based on educational or professional experience that may not be able to be documented to the extent required for transfer credit . A challenge exam may be required of the student t o demonstrate competency in the subject involved. CLEP Cre dits (College Level Examination Program) A maximum of 30 semester CLEP credits can be transferred into the program. These credits must first be transferred to another undergraduate degree- granting institution and appear on the student's respective transcri pt before these CLEP credits can be considered for transfer into the program. Non-Program Students Non- program students are welcome to apply to take certain courses and typically must meet both the course and admissions requirements, and must have complet ed the prerequisites for the courses for which they are applying. Those persons interested in applying should contact the Office of Admissions for further details. A plan of study, including purpose and rationale, may be required as part of the application process. A pproval may be granted by the Admissions Committee and/or at the discretion of the Dean, subject to space availability.

ACADEMIC POL ICY The following information provides a sum mary of our Academic Policies. The official policies are found in the University Student Handbook , which is available online at http://www.nwhealth.edu. The University Student Handbook is updated more frequently than t he University catalog. In all cases , the Academic Policies as stated in the current University Student Handbook will be followed. Trimester Credits The Academic cal endar includes fall, winter and summer trimester s of 15 weeks each. In general, one credit represents one lect ure hour, two laboratory hours or two clinical hours per week. Attendance Policy Students are required to fulfill all course responsibilities, including class attendance, which are described by faculty in the course syllabi . Students are referred to the Clinic Handbook for Internship and Observation attendance policies. Academic Evaluation and Grades Final grades in each subject are issued at the end of each trimester and reflect a student's performance in some combination of the following: comprehensive final examinations; announced tests, quizzes, assignments , classroom and laboratory work; participation in and contribution to class discussions; and attendance. Grading criteria are specified in each course syllabus. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 72 The majority of c ourses , with a few exceptions, are assigned letter grades of either A, B, C, D, or F . The exceptions are assigned either an S for Satisfactory or a U for Unsatisfactory. The criteria for assignment of grades are contain ed in each course syllabus. The grades of S/U are not included in determining grade point average ( GPA ). The final grade of U (U nsatisfactory) is considered to be a grade of failure in t he course. Students who complete all the work assigned in a course are graded as follows: A, B, C, or D (ex cellent, above average, average or minimal achievement, respectively). Honor grade points (for calculating grade point averages) are awarded on the scale starting with four points for an A and one point for a D. Students who fai l to achieve minimal competency are graded with F for failure. An incomplete (I) indicates that the full work of the course has not been completed because of illness or some c ause beyond the student's control. In all didactic classes, the following percentages will be used to determine grades A - F: A = 100 -92 percent B = 91 -84 percent C = 83 -76 percent D = 75-68 percent F = below 68 percent Clinic performance is evaluated each trimester and is graded as S for Satisfactory or U for Unsatisfactory. Specific details are listed in the Clinic Handbook. In general, students must receive a score of three or higher (on a five -point scale) for each clinical criteria in order to receive clinic credit for that trimester. Students with criteria scores less than three will need to complete a remediation process in order to receive credit. Failure to meet the clinical internship/observation attendance requirements, as stated in the Clinic Handbook, will result in a grade of U (Unsatisfactory). Students must pass clinical competency exams prior t o beginning supervised clinical practice and prior to graduation. Other competency exams may be administered at various stages throughout clinic. Academic Honors Students receiving a grade point average ( GPA ) of 3.50 or better are placed on the Dean's List . Academic honors are determined according to the following grade point levels: Honor GPA Range Cum laude 3.50 - 3.69 Magna cum laude 3.70 - 3.89 Summa cum laude 3.90 - 4.00 Academic Standing Students are considered in good academic standing unless they are currently on academic pr obation, or dismissed from the U niversity. Students must be in good academic standing to serve as Student Senate officers or as officers of approved s tudent organizat ions. Students in good academic standing may progress toward degree completion. Regulations Concerning Probationary Status Probation is indicat ive of substandard achievement. Students are placed on prob ation when: Their cumulative grade point average (GPA) falls below 2.0; They fail one course. The University Student Handbook provides details pertaining to probation, dismissal, and review procedures. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 73 GRADUATION Graduation Requirements The Master of Acupuncture or Master of Oriental Medicine degree is granted to those candidates who have: 1.

CERTIFICATION A ND LICENSURE Graduates of Northwestern's master's degree programs exceed the eligibility requirements for the comprehensive national certification programs offered by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ( NCCAOM). Graduates of the Master of Acupuncture program are eligible to take the acupuncture certification program exam modules which include Foundations of Oriental Medici ne, Acupuncture with Point Location, and Biomedicine. Graduates of the Master of Oriental Medicine program are eligible to take the Oriental Medicine certification program exa m modules which include the three listed above plus Chinese Herbology. S tudents agree to provide Northwestern with copies of their NCCAOM examination results for use in program assessment. Professional licensur e requirements for the practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine vary by jurisdiction. Students should not rely upon staff descriptions or statements regarding licensure requirements and need to consult directl y with the licensure board for the profession in the state or location in which they intend to practice. In Minnesota, eligibility for acupuncture licensure is based upon active certification by the NCCAOM in acupuncture. A dditional information about Minnesota acupuncture licensure may be obtained from the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice, University Park Plaza, 2829 University Ave. SE, Suite 400, Minneapolis, MN 55414- 3246. Receipt of a degree from Northwestern Health Sciences University does not guara ntee a license or certification to practice. States vary in the specific courses of study required and/or state- based testing for certification or licensing. Students are responsible for confirming with the appropriate board(s) to determine the specific requirements for the state(s) in which they intend to practice and/or seek employment. THE PROGRAMS Master of Oriental Medicine The curriculum for the professional Master of Oriental Medicine program provides comprehensive education and training in the follo wing areas: Cultural and philosophical foundations of traditional Chinese medicine; Traditional Chinese medical concepts (physiology, pathology, diagnostics, point location and point energetics); Acupuncture treatment principles and practical skills; Tui Na; Traditional Chinese herbal medicine and dietary therapy; Related studies, including introductory Chinese language skills, ethics and practice management; Qi Development; Nutrition; Biomedical clinical sciences to a level required for competence in contemporary practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Clinical internship; Clinical herbal internship. Clinical requir ements include a minimum of 150 hours of observation/assistantship and 720 hours of supervised clinical practice. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 74 Master of Acupuncture The c urriculum for the professional Master of A cupuncture program is similar to that of the Oriental Medicine program but does not include herbal studies . Clinical requirements include a minimum of 150 hours of observation/assistantship and 525 hours of supervised clinical practice. Herbal Medicine Certificate The curriculum for the Herbal Medicine Certificate program provides comprehensive herbal education and training in the same areas listed under the Master of Oriental Medicine. Clinical r equirements include 240 clinic internship hours, which consists of both herbal medicine and acupuncture internship hours. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE Northwestern students b egin clinical training in their first trimester with Clinical Observation/ Assistantship. Clinical internship begins in the fifth trimester and takes place in one of the University's on -campus clinics. Subsequent supervised intern- ships may incl ude assignment in other clinics ( e.g. public servi ce organizations, hospitals, specialty clinics and/ or medical facilities) which have established relationships with Northwestern. Clinic interns perform all aspects of patient care relevant to their degree program. Interns are closely supervised and evaluated by clinical faculty members and are progressively given more responsi bility as their competence increases. The low intern- to-supervi sor ratio ensures a high degree of personal attention in both acupuncture and/or Oriental medicine. By the end of their internship, students are ready to enter private practice.

We prepare massage therapists who are committed to service and lifelong learning, and who are qualified to practice both independently and as members of integrated health care teams. Graduates of the Massage Therapy programs will ground their work in scientific knowl edge, clinical proficiency, and the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES Therapists who successfully complete either certificate program of study offered by the College will be able to: 1. Communicate effectively wit h clients and the general public. 2. Effectively and accurately assess the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, the presenting condition of a client, and create and implement a therapeutic plan relevant to the client's needs and pr eferences. 3. Demonstrate ethical standards of practice by respecting professional boundaries, honoring confidentiality and valuing diversity. 4. Direct clients, when appropriate, to a spectrum of other resources. 5. Acquire, appraise, and apply current and relevant scientific information to practice in an evidence informed manner. 6. Actively manage and maintain one's own health and wellness, including the use of effective biomechanical practices. 7. Demonstrate an appreciation to maintain the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior by actively setting clear lifelong learning goals, pursue them, and apply the knowledge gained. In addition to the above objectives, students who successfully complete the Associate in Applied Science degree (AAS) will b e able to: 8. Demonstrate the writing, critical thinking, reasoning and oral communication skills expected of a graduate of an associate- level degree program. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 93 MASSAGE THERAPY AS A HEALTH CARE PROFESSI ON The program of study offered by the College of Health and Wellness are based upon two assumptions about massage therapy: that massage therapy is a type of health care and that massage therapy is a profession. Massage Therapy as Health Care The first assu mption is that massage therapy is a type of health care. While we are respectful of the diversity of approaches to massage practice, the intention of the College of Health and Wellness is to prepare therapists to work with other natural and medical health care providers. While we offer thorough training in basic relaxation- oriented massage, we do so as preparation for more specific therapeutic work. Massage therapy practiced in health care environments tends to be more problem -based and more strongly focused on soft -tissue rehabilitative techniques. The majority of our technique training focuses on this type of work. As a natural health sciences university, Northwestern believes that natural health care practitioners should be trained together and will, in many instances, practice together. The University and the College view massage therapy as an integral part of natural health care. Massage Therapy as a Profession The second assumption is that massage therapy is a profession, as opposed to simply a career or a trade. As professionals, massage th erapists should be expected to conduct themselves in the same profess ional manner as doctors, nurses and other health care professionals in t erms of their interactions with patients, clients, other providers and the general public. Professionals are generally held to higher and more specific ethic al and behavioral expectations. The curriculum provi des specific preparation in the areas of communication skills, lifelong learning, ethical decision -maki ng, legal and regul atory issues, and professional practice development. APPROACH TO LEARNING The College of Health and Wellness believes that the students and faculty should be continuously learning. Students learn from faculty, from each other, from their clients and from sources of professional information. Faculty members continue to learn in order to remain current on relevant information. The experiences of students and faculty result in the program evolving and growing. As in most professional programs, students in the College frequently learn by doing. The College takes the holistic perspective of student as future practitioner rather than focusing solely on course- based demonstrations of performance, such as tests. As a result, students receive and respond to frequent objective and subjective performanc e feedback from faculty, peers and clients. This mirrors the experience of m ost therapists in practice, who must be dynamicall y responsive to client feedback in order to be clinical ly effective and professionally succe ssful. CLASS SIZE AND ATTEN DANCE The College believes that small class sizes are essential to effective learning of massage therapy techniques. Therefore, the teacher -to-student ratio will typically not exceed 1:50 in lecture classes and 1:13 in lab classes. Because the College teaches technique through reciprocal application, the learning of every student can be impacted by the attendance patterns of other students. Course attendance is a demonstration of seriousness about the program of study, a demonstration of respect for the faculty and your colleagues, and a necessity for course success. ADMISSION INFORMATIO N Admission to the Massage Therapy programs Northwestern admits as students , women and men of good character and health who are qualified by previous education and experience to meet its academic challenges and to become a practic ing massage therapist. Applications for admission, as well as current tuition and fees, are available online at h ttp://www.nwhealth.edu or they ma y be obtained by contacting the Office of Admissions. The application for admission must be accompanied by a non- refundable application processing fee of $50 (US dollars) and a criminal background check fee of $20 ( US dollars). It is the responsibility of the applicant to read this catalog and comply with all provisions and instructions. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 94 New students are admitted at the beginning of three trimesters of the academic year January, May and September. Perso ns who have been convicted of a misdemeanor of a violent or sexual nature or any felony will be prohibited from professional health care practice in many jurisdictions. Northwestern Health Sciences University will deny admission to applicants with such convictions. The University therefore reserves the right to conduct a criminal background check on all applica nts and enrolled students. Entrance Requirements Applicants must meet the following requirements: 1. Students must have an earned a high school diploma, its foreign equivalent or a General Educational Development diploma (GED) . Succ essful completion of at least 60 semester credit hours in a college or university accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education will be recognized as equivalent to a high school diploma. 2. Applicants must have achieved a cumulati ve grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or better in prerequisite coursework; 3. All students must pass a criminal background check; 4. Students must demonstrate sufficient maturity to undertake a health care profession, including the capacity to ethically and responsibly manage professional boundaries. Admission to the Massage Therapy programs is competitive. The University expects all students will exceed the minimum admission requirements. Qualifications A student must posses s the following abilities, with or without reasonable accommodation, for completion of the professional certificate program s in massage therapy: 1. Ability to apply massage and adjunctive techniques over the full range of a client's body, including positio ning clients, palpating, feeling with hands and fingers, pushing, pulling, knead ing, grasping, twisting wrists and lifting up to 10 pounds, for periods of up to 90 minutes standing without interruption; 2. Ability to determine depth and intensity of manual pressure and force, as applied in the performance of common massage and adjunctive procedures and techniques; 3. Ability to see and hear, with or without reasonable accommodation, sufficient that the student can rece ive and record client histories, docum ent treatment plans, provide instructions to clients and provide routine client safety services; 4. Ability to perform in all laboratory and clinical settings without posing a threat to herself/himself, to the safety and well-being of fellow students or cl ients; 5. Ability and willingness to receive massage and adjunctive treatment. Much of the technical instruction in the programs requires reciprocal application of the techniques of massage therapy, including trigger point therapy and cross fiber friction. In reciprocal laboratory experiences, receiving techniques is necessary in order to learn proper procedures and to receive and provide learning feedback. R eciprocal application of technique is also useful for developing sensitivity to client needs. The College may temporarily excuse a student from receiving massage therapy provided that there is a specific medical contraindication, as determined in writing by a licensed health care professional. All students, with or without reasonable accommodation, mus t carry out laboratory and clinical assignments, including providing massage therapy services to clients. Qualified persons with disabilities, with or without reasonable accommodation, must be able to pass oral, wri tten and practical examinations and meet all of the clinical requirements of the University. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 95 It is in the best interests of both the student and the University to assess the degree of limitation caused by disability. However, the University will make the final determination of whether or not an individual meets all qualifications for study at the University. The University accommodations process is found under \"Student Life.\" A dditionally, questions regarding qualifications or accommodations should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs. Responsibility of Applicant It is the responsibility of the applicant to be aware of the entrance requi rements and to ensure that they are met prior to enrollment. If the College determines at any time that requirements are not met in full, the student w ill not be allo wed to enroll or to continue at Northwestern. The Office of Admi ssions personnel are available to help prospective students plan their pre- massage therapy curricula.

The number of grade points earned in a given course is the number of credits for that course multiplied by the grade point corresponding to the grade recorded in that course, as indicated here: Grade Grade Points Suggested Achievement Level A 4 90 - 100 percent of points; outstanding B 3 80 - 89 percent of points; superior C 2 70 - 79 percent of points; satisfactory D 1 60 - 69 percent of points; minimally satisfactory F 0 59 percent of points or fewer; unsatisfactory S N/A Satisfactory (C or better); competency successfully demonstrated U N/A Unsatisfactory (D/F); competency not successfully demonstrated I N/A Incomplete W N/A Withdrawal T N/A Transfer; used to indicate courses for which the learner received advanced standing or transfer credit 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 98 Notes on Grading: 1. Instructors assign letter grades as appropriate according to the student's achievement level; 2. Students enrolled in the Massage Therapy programs must maintain a 2.0 (C) cumulative grade point average (GPA) or better unless otherwise stipulated. Students may receive grades lower than C and remain in good standing if they maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point. However, students must satisfactorily complete all courses in order to graduate from the Massage Therapy programs; 3. Pluses and minus es are not part of the official grading system and are not figured into a student's grade point average (GPA) ; 4. The Satisfactory /Unsatisfactory grade option is intended for course work where a letter grade cannot be appropriately assigned. Credits under this option are counted toward the total number of credits required for graduation but are not used in determining a student's grade point average; 5. A student must earn a grade of A, B, C, D, or S in order to fulfill course requirements. Use of the Grade I The grade of I (incomplete) indicates that work was not completed prior to the last day of the term or learning contract and is intended to reflect circum stances beyond the stud ent's or instructor's control. I t is the responsibility of the student to consult with the instructor to det ermine the work still remaining t o be completed. Incomplete work must be satisfactorily completed dur ing the first four weeks of the next academic ter m. After that time, a grade of I will automatically become a grade of F . Students experi encing extenuating circumstances may seek a waiver of the time limit from the program administrator, who may choose to grant the waiver, refuse the waiver or refer the request to th e Academic Standards Committee. The Universit y reserves the right to require the Student to provide evidence of extenuating circumstances to the satisfaction of the University. Under no circums tances will a waiver be awarded that extends beyond the conclusion of the student's next academic term. Academic Standing Students are consi dered in good academic standing unless they are dismissed or on academic probation. Students must be in good academ ic standing to serve as Student Senate officers or as officers of approved student organizat ions. Students in good academic standing may progress toward degree completion. Course Attendance and Punctuality Course attendance and punctuality represent a dem onstration of seriousness about the program of study, a demonstration of respect for the faculty and your colleagues, and a necessity for course success. Each instructor will list course attendance requirements and tardiness policies, including consequence for violation of these policies, on the course syllabus.

The College of Health and Wellness makes no guarantee of employment of students upon completion of the program. PROFESSIONAL LICENSURE, REGISTRATION, OR CERTIFICATI ON As of 2015, statewide standards for massage therapy practice have been established in 44 states and the District of Columbia. Each state has established slightly differing standards for professional eligibility . At this time, no statewide standard for professional licensure, registration or certification exists for massage therapis ts in Minnesota. Many cities in Minnesota have estab lished ordinances that regulate the practice of massage therapy and some cities requi re practitioner registration. Professional licensure requirements vary by jurisdiction. Students should not rely upon staff descriptions or statements regar ding licensure requirements and need to consult direct ly with the licensure board for the profession and in the state or province in which they intend to practice. The Univers ity makes no guarantees that an individual student will satisfy the licensure, registration or certification requirem ents of any particular state or other jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of an individual student to confirm the regulatory requi rements t hat may apply in any jurisdiction in which that student intends to practice. Receipt of a certificate or degree from Northwestern Health Sciences University does not guarantee a license or certification to practice. States vary in the specific courses of study required and/or state- based testing for certification or licensing. Students are responsible for confirming with the appropriate board(s) to determine the specific requirements for the state(s) in whi ch they intend to practice and/or seek employment. STUDY TIME The time required out side of scheduled class time for homework and studying can vary consi derably based on the individual student. However, as a general rule, students should pl an on a minimum of two to three hours of homework and studying outside of class for every one hour of lectur e time. This brings the minimum combined classroom and study time commitment to more than 1,000 hours . CURRICULUM OVERVIEW Academically rigorous cl assroom, lab and clinical learning, built on the following four pillars: Anatomy, physiology, pathology, kinesiology and nutrition courses provide students with a thorough overview of the human body and how it works. Hands -on clinical experience in the U niversity's public clinics an d other community sites prepare the students for practice.

One meaning of phil osophy is the love or pursuit of wisdom. Philosophy is not something that is taught or learned in any one particular course, lecture or laboratory. Rather, it is a process that evolves in unique ways for each individual. We will provide a stimulating envir onment for thought, observation and experiences through which you will develop your philosophy of health care based upon strong chiropractic principles. A fundamental principle embodied in the philosophy of chiropractic is the influence of the nervous syst em on the innate ability of the human body to be self -regulating and self -healing. This is reflected in the emphasis we place on the neuromusculoskeletal system and attention to the subluxation complex through the use of manual adjustment and manipulative and ancillary procedures. We recognize the interconnections between body, mind, and spirit and the reality that the care we provide must be patient -centered and focuses on the whole person. Our model of healthcare also embraces a responsibility to respond to both the patient's clinical problems and the promotion of optimal health. As you pur sue your professional education you will experience our philosophy that is the Doctors of Chiropractic: Are primary care healthcare providers - with a responsibility to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the patient Are primary contact providers that patients can see without the need for a referral Are neuromusculoskeletal specialists who employ hands -on clinical case management Participate in collaborative, coordinate d and integrative care with other health care professionals for optimal patient care Consider the whole person through the use of clinical approaches that focus on prevention of disease and maintaining a state of wellness Respect the historical foundations of the profession while embracing new knowledge and evidence informed practice As a student, you will experience another philosophical principle that guides much of what we do. Simply stated, it's the value we place on critical thinking and an openness to different ways of viewing health and disease - and the practice of chiropractic. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 115 ADMISSION INFORMATIO N Admission to the College Northwestern admits as students, men and women of good character, who are qualified by previous education and experience to meet its rigorous academic challenges and to become practicing doctors of c hiropractic.

These additional science courses are strongly recommended for a student's successful progress: General Chemistry 2 (with lab) - Principles of Ch emistry, Inorganic Chemistry or Introductory Chemistry Organic Chemistry 2 (with lab) Biology 2 (with lab) - Animal, Vertebrate, or General Biology, Zoology, Anatomy, Physiology or Microbiology Physics 1 (with lab) and/or Physics 2 (with lab) Biochemistry (with lab) Other science courses may qualify, including Human Anatomy, Cell Biology, Cell Physiology, Immunology and Genetics. Students may check with one of our admissions representatives to revi ew science prerequisites. The importance of basic science courses: We want you to be successful in the doctor of chiropractic program at Northwestern Health Sciences Universit y. Basic science courses, including Biology, Physics, Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, are the foundation for the understanding of chiropractic science and the application of chiropractic methods. To successfully progress through our rigorous chiropractic curriculum, it is very important for you to have a solid foundation in the basic sciences. In our experience, we have found that students who enroll in the College of Chiropractic having taken the proper sequence of basic sciences courses as prerequisites are more likely to do well in their coursework. The graduate- level basic sciences courses you will be taking in your first and second trimesters are very demanding. The stronger your undergraduate background in the basic sciences, the more confident and capable you will be in meeting these challenges. Recommended general education courses: English, Speech or Communications, and Psychology are recommended. For prospective chiropractic students who are interested in completing their undergraduate science prerequisites: Northwestern offers courses through the College of Undergraduate Health Sciences. Several of the courses are offered in an accelerated format which allows students to complete a full -year of courses in only one trimester (15 weeks). Priority for enrolling in these courses is given to students who have already applied to Northwestern Health Sciences University. Qualifications A student must possess the following abilities, with or without reasonable accommodation, for completion of the Doctor of Chiropractic degree program: 1. Ability to us e both upper extremities in the performance of common chiropractic procedures and techniques, including but not limited to: positioning patients, palpating, feeling with hands, pushing, pulling, thrusting with hands and wrists, grasping, and lifting up to 10 pounds; 2. Ability to perform in all laboratory and clinical settings without posing a threat to herself/himself, to the safety and well -being of fellow students or patients; 3. Ability to determine depth and intensity of manual pressure and force, as applied in the perfor mance of common chiropractic and adjunctive procedures and techniques; 4. Ability to see and hear, with or without reasonable accommodation, sufficient that the student can identify histologic, cytologic, microbiologic and pathologic structures through a microscope; receive and record patient histories; provide instructions to patients; provide routine patient safety services; perform stethoscopic and other auscultatory examinations; and read and interpret all forms of diagnostic imaging; 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 117 5. Ability and willingness to receive chiropractic and adjunctive treatment. Much of the technical instruction in the programs requires reciprocal application of chiropractic and adjunctive techniques. In reciprocal laboratory experiences, receiving techniques is necessary in order to learn proper procedures, and to receive and provide learning feedback. Reciprocal application of technique is also useful for developing sensitivity to client needs. The C ollege may temporarily excuse a student from receiving chiropractic treatment provided that there is a specific medical contraindication, as determined in writing by a licensed health care professional. All students, wit h or without reasonable accommodati on, must carry out laboratory assignments, including microscopic work and X -ray interpretation. Qualified persons with disabilities, with or without reasonable accommodation, must be able to pass oral, written and practical examinations, and meet all of the clinical requirements of the University. It is in the best interests of both the student and the University to assess the degree of limitation caused by disability. However, the University will make the final determination of whether or not an individual meets all qualifications for study at the University. The University accommodations process is found under \"Student Life.\" Additionally, questions regarding qualifications or accommodations should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs. Responsibi lity of Applicant It is the responsibility of the applicant to be aware of the entrance requirements and to ensure that they are met prior to enrollment. If the College determines at any time that requirements are not met in full, the student will not be allowed to enroll or to continue at Northwestern.

Northwestern seeks to select students who have strong academic records and who demonstrate the motivational and personal characteristics suitable for a career in chiropract ic. Willingness to provide service and a caring attitude are important characteristics of the future doctor of chiropractic. The University employs a rolling admissions process. Therefore, early application could increase the applicant's probability for ac ceptance. Students are strongly encouraged to apply at least nine to 12 months prior to the first day of their first academic term. The University encourages campus visits for all applicants and reserves the right to require an interview. Tuition Deposit Policy Applicants will be notified in writing of the Admission Committee's decision regarding their application following receipt of all application materials and committee review. Upon notification of acceptance, a candidate must remit a tuition deposit of $300 (US dollars) to reserve a position in the entering class. This tuition deposit is non-refundable but is applied toward the first trimester tuition. The tuition deposit should be submitted shortly after notification of acceptance since processing of financial aid is initiated only after receipt of the tuition deposit. First trimester students who have been accepted and paid their $300 tuition deposit must pay the balance of their first trimester tuition on the first day of class. If the student has a Direct Student Loan in progress for the first trimester at Northwestern, then the first trimester tuition will be credited against this loan. It is important to note that because of the limited space available in each class, scheduling priorities and the cost of education, the institutional refund policy does not appl y to the $300 tuition deposit.

In addition to the thorough grounding in the biological sciences offered by courses taken in the first three trimesters of the Doctor of Chiropractic program, the BS in Human Biology degree completion program offers these benefits: Professionally, you will develop your oral and written communication skills and your understanding of the philosophical foundations for the scientific method. Having a bachelor's degree will generally increase your credibility if you serve as an expert witness, should yo u be called to testify in court. An increasing number of states require a bachelor's degree for chiropractic licensure, and some managed care organizations show a preference for chiropractors with a bachelor's degree when making network inclusion decisions . In general, a bachelor's degree increases your professional credentials and provides you the opportunity to excel in your chiropractic practice. This BS in Human Biology will help with meeting licensure procedures in states that require a bachelor's degree prior to obtaining a license to practice. Some state licensing boards may require additional education upon beginning a chiropractic program.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE A diverse array of clinical opportunities is available for Northwestern chiropractic interns. Students participate in these clinical experiences starting in Trimester 6 and extending through graduation. These educational programs demonstrate the University's commitment t o clinical excellence and preparedness for professional success. University Health Service s In Trimester 6, students complete a s tructured laboratory experience in which they refine their sk ills by interviewing, examining, diagnosing, preparing treatment plans, giving a Report of Findings and provi ding chiropractic care to early trimester students. During this initial phase, students r eview, practice and discuss all elements of the clinical process in laboratory, lecture and small group discussion settings. Trimester 7 through 9 student interns provide care to Northwestern students, employees and their families in University Health Services , which is located in the J. Lamoine De Rusha Learning Center. Northwestern's Clinics and Community Based Internship In Trimesters 7 through 9, students intern under the supervision of a faculty clinician at the University Health Services, fee- for-service Clinic s of the Community Based Internship (CBI) program. Northwestern's internships provide students with rich clini cal experiences, contact with diverse patient populations and opportunities to build business skills. In each setting, a small student -to-faculty ratio results in a close relationship between the clinical mentor and the intern. The Northwestern Clinics ar e located in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The Northwestern Health Clinic s are located on the University campus . The Northwestern Clinic s feature a variety of patient services, including chiropractic, massage therapy, acupuncture, and Oriental medicine . The Community Based Internship program, a Northwestern innovation, is another opportunity available to students in T rimesters 7 through 9. Students who serve their internship in the CBI program are placed in the private practice of a doctor of chi ropractic who participates with the University in clinical education. Approximately 125 doctors in the Metro area meet the rigorous intern ship standards to mentor chiropractic students from Northwestern during their internship experience. Clinical Rotatio ns The promotion of integrated and collaborative natural and conventional medical care is a unique objective of Northwestern. As a complement to their primary clinical experience, students observe the clinical pract ices of chiropractors and other health care professionals such as neurologis ts, orthopedic surgeons, dentists, radiologists , massage therapists and Oriental medicine practitioners. Through participation in this program, students c ome to better understand the rationale f or different approaches to care, are exposed to a wi der range of patient conditions, understand the means for patient management through consultations and referrals, and have the opportunit y to network with specialists. Additionally, Northwestern has established clinics at St. Agnes Schools in Saint Paul, Pillsbury House in South Minneapolis and downtown at the Salvation Army's Minneapolis Harbor Light Center. Students, under faculty supervision, provide free care to diverse patients in these communities. Preceptorship Program In Trimester 10, students who have completed all the academic and clinical requirements of the University and the Council on Chiropr actic Education have the option of completing their training with doctors of chiropractic practicing in most states and many fore ign countries. These students may also complete their training in any of the University or CBI program clinics. This program provides an opportunity for final -term students to begin the transition to private practice. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 124 ACADEMIC POLICY The following provides a summary of our Academic Policies.

Some jurisdictions may impose requirements for licensure in addition to a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. Professional licensure requirements vary by jurisdiction. Students should not rely upon staff descriptions or statements regarding licensure requirements and need to consult directly with the licensure board for the profession and in the state or province in which they intend to practice. Information regarding licensure policies and requirements may be found in the Office of Alumni, Development and Career Services or in the Greenawalt Library. Receipt of a degree from Northwestern Health Sciences University does not guarantee a license or certification to practice. States vary in the specific courses of study required and/or state- based testing for certification or licensing. Students are responsible for confirming with the appropriate board(s) to determine the specific requirements for the state(s) in which they intend to practice and/or seek employment. COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC Curriculum Overview The Doctor of Chiropractic program consists of seven 15 week and three 17 week trimesters, typically completed in three and a half years. The earliest trimesters consist of a strong foundation of basic sciences integrated with introductory chiropractic and clinical courses. These courses lay the groundwork for further s tudy in the clinical sciences , as well as clinical experiences. A 12- month public clinic internsh ip and preceptorship constitute the last three trimesters. Northwestern offers three trimesters: fall, winter and s ummer. Students begin learning \"hands -on\" chiropractic techniques beginning in their first trimester , and progress to supervised in- class adjusting in Trimester 3. Chiropractic therapies that are taught are broad- based, but stress those adjusting and manipulative procedures that have been proven mos t effective and which are consi stent with biomechanical and physiological principles. These adjusting skills complemented by related therapeutics such as physiological therapeutics , nutrition counseling, exercise tr aining, rehabilitation, and mobilizat ion procedures. Students learn to educate patients regarding healthy living practices, encouraging a holistic view of both mental and physical well -being. Graduates of Northw estern are prepared to practice as first -contact, primary care chiropractic physic ians, able to take responsibility for the health of patients. The diagnostic acumen and therapeutic skill sets required for primary care clinicians requires a strong background in the basic sciences , as well as current and relevant studies in the clinical sciences. Critical thinking and clinical decision- making skills must be developed in order to make the most appropriate patient -centered health care decisions. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 126 Northwestern students are trained to work in cooperation with other health care providers in interdisciplinary practices. Opportunities are also available for interns to spend time as observers in a variety of clinical settings, including local medical practices. Course Load The breadth, depth and rigor of courses and resulting study load in each term of the curriculum at Northwestern is similar to that in other health care professional schools. As a result, students should expect substantially heavier loads at Northwest ern than at colleges where they completed their pre- chiropractic studies. Those entering or continuing students who wish to modify their course load may benefit from split -schedule registration. A student may request split -schedule information from the Office of the Registrar. Use of a split schedule of courses may add some tim e and expense to the completion of the academic program. Due to the nature of the chiropractic program of study, all students are expected to maintain continuous enrollment. However, in the event that a student requires a term off due to unforeseen circumstances, they may request a leave of absence. Course Sequence The Doctor of Chiropractic program consists of seven 15 week and three 17 week trimesters, typically completed in three and a half years. The curriculum is designed to develop evidence informed, portal -of-entry chiropractic physicians who are prepared to practice in collaboration with other health care providers and in various practice environments. Trimesters 1 and 2 emphasize the basic sciences , and introduce students to chiropractic principles and methods, radio logy, and business foundations. Beginning in the first trimester , students will partici pate in clinical observations. In Trimesters 3, 4, and 5 students will complete the basic science sequence and progress into the clinical sciences, including diagnosis and care options. At the same time, students will progress through a clerkship experience in trimesters 4 through 6 in the De Rusha Clinical Education Center. In Trimesters 7 through 10 students will participate as an intern in university clinics or a private practice affiliated with the College of Chiropractic . Curriculum Organization The doctor of chiropractic curriculum is comprised of 84 course off erings, organized in seven academic and clinical departments. The sequence provides a strong basic science basis upon which the chiropractic and clinical sciences are built. As clinical subjects are introduced, students make the transition to becoming doctors of chiropractic. In the classroom, l aboratory and clinics, students learn to take patient health histories and conduct examinations (including clinical, orthopedic, neurologic, laboratory and imaging examinations) and interpret findings in forming clinical decisions, leading to a diagnosis. Students learn that proper diagnosis is fundamental in determining appropriate treatment and in measuring the patient's response to chiropractic care. Department of Basic Sciences (15 courses, 55.75 credits) Chair: Mary Tuchscherer, MS, PhD, DC Courses inc lude biochemistry, anatomy (including a focused course on the spine and pelvis), embryology, histology, immunology and microbiology, neuroscience, pathology, and physiology. These courses provide a firm foundation for the development and acquisition of clinical skills and knowledge. These sciences are essential to the development of an understanding of the complexities of the structur al basis of health and disease, as well as the nature of the functioning of the human body in health and disease. 2015 - 2016 NWHSU University Catalog 127 Depar tment of Chiropractic Studies (16 courses, 28.25 credits) Chair: Donald Eggebrecht, BA, DC, DABCO Courses in chiropractic principles and philosophy provide students with the history of the chiropractic profession, as well as the nature of the chiropractic health care model and its principal tenets. Chiropractic m ethods courses, including lectures and experiential learning, set the stage for the life- long journey to becoming a master in the art of chiropractic adjustment and manipulation. Students will take classes cover ing physiological therapeutics, exercise and rehabilitation, as well as three years of methods curricula. Department of Diag nostic and Clinical Sciences (15 courses, 42.5 credits) Chair: Katie BurnsRyan, BS, DC The process of arriving at a diagnosis involves cognitive, behavioral and affective skills that are acquired over a period of time and sharpened with clinical experiences. These courses are delivered over a six -trimester period and inc lude a variety of learning experiences, such as lecture, small -group, experiential laboratories, self -directed study and online learning. The courses include Clinical Skills 1 and 2 (which prepare students to obtain a medical history and perform a physical examination) , clinical pathology, an d a num ber of specialized system -based courses which cover the diagnosis and chiropractic role in the management of a variety of health problems. Department of Health Promotion and Wellness (11 courses, 23.45 credits) Chair: Tolu Oyelowo, MS, DC The health promotion and wellness course sequence is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to apply chiropractic care to special populations and includes courses covering the unique aspects of diagnosis and treatment of pregnant patients, infants and c hildren, women, and the elderly . Courses in this department also cover the topics of public health, health promotion, and wellness, especially as these apply to the practice of chiropractic. Department of Diagnostic Imaging (7 course s, 15.5 credits) Chair: Anita L. Manne, BS, DC, DACBR The diagnostic imaging sequence provides the student w ith the skills and knowledge to use imagin g appropriately in chiropractic practice.
