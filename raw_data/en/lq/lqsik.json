Artichoke is also effective against hypercholesterolemia.(1) Thanks to the antioxidant effects of the flavonoids, Artichoke, a bit like Milk Thistle, has very interesting hepatoprotective properties.(2) This effect was demonstrated against an industrial solvent, carbon tetrachloride.(3) Traditionally, Artichoke is used as an aperitive, a depurative and a diuretic. The German Commission E acknowledges its benefits in cases of: dyspeptic problems. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinalis): Dandelion is a very herb for the digestive system. Its root has cholagogue and depurative properties for the liver. The bitter constituents, collectively called taraxacins (sometimes eudesmanolides), have a beneficial effect on slow digestion. Dandelion leaf is one of the best herbal diuretics. It is also a very good source of carotenes and potassium. The whole herb is used for loss of appetite, dyspepsia, flatulence and feelings of fullness after meals. The German Commission E acknowledges its benefits in cases of: disturbances in bile flow, edema, loss of appetite, and dyspepsia. Boldo (Peumus boldus): Boldo is a South American herb used to relieve intestinal cramps, bile flow problems and cystitis.

The German Commission E acknowledges its benefits in cases of: mild spastic complaints of the gastrointestinal tract and dyspepsia. Peppermint (Mentha piperita): In addition to its good taste, peppermint acts as a spasmolytic and carminative (anti-flatulent) and stimulates the liver functions. It is rich in azulene, a substance known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer effects. Its other components are flavonoids and a volatile oil rich in menthol. Peppermint is often used to relieve dyspepsia and digestive cramps. Peppermint is \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) in the USA, which means that it is safe at amounts found in food. The German Commission E acknowledges its benefits in cases of: flatulence; spastic complaints of the gastrointestinal tract, the gallbladder and bile ducts. Fat digestion has always been a source of problems. Thermal cures, clysters (enemas) and all those treatments answered the need of many engorged livers. Today, the innumerable food additives, trans fatty acids and fried foods, not to mention pollutants and stress, compromise liver function. Medicinal herbs like Artichoke, Boldo, Milk Thistle and Dandelion are a safe and effective response to this age-old problem. Cynara scolymus (Globe Artichoke) is probably best known for its edible 'heart' - the mass of immature florets in the centre of the bud that is called the choke or beard. Cynara can still be found in the wild in some parts of the world such as North Africa. From around the 9th Century cynara was cultivated in Naples and can now be found in many other parts of the world. In the 16th Century, the Dutch introduced cynara to the English who gave it the name artichoke. Nowadays the cultivation of cynara is concentrated mainly in countries round the Mediterranean. As well as being an enjoyable food, cynara can also by made into a tea or a herbal tincture. The Italians took it one step further and use it as the primary flavour of a tasty liqueur!
