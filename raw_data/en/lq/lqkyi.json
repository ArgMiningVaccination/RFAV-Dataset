Ritual is a subscription-based supplement company that offers a variety of multivitamins, protein powders, and other dietary supplements made from simple, high-quality ingredients. Founded in 2016, Ritual has become one of the most popular brands for nutritional supplements, thanks to its transparency and traceable ingredients. However, Ritual products are more expensive than many similar supplements. This may lead you to wonder whether they're really worth the hype. To help you decide whether Ritual is right for you, we tried a variety of the brand's products, including multivitamins, protein powders, and the Synbiotic+. This article also takes a closer look at how Ritual works, what it offers, and how it compares with similar services. Ritual is a supplement company that offers a selection of multivitamins, protein powders, and other dietary supplements for all ages and stages of life, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Some of the key ways that Ritual stands out against competitors include: Transparency: Ritual provides detailed information on how and where every ingredient in its products is sourced, along with the science behind each formulation. Quality testing: According to the company, all Ritual products are tested for heavy metals, contaminants, and accuracy of the label by an independent lab, and several are certified by third-party organizations including United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and Informed Sport. Delayed-release capsules: The company's multivitamins are made using delayed-release capsules, which are designed to dissolve in your small intestine rather than your stomach. According to Ritual, this is gentler on your stomach, meaning you don't have to pair your multivitamin with meals ( ). 1 Beadlet-in-oil design: Each capsule combines both oily and dry ingredients, making it easy to get a variety of nutrients your body needs in a single dose. Here's a closer look at a few of the pros and cons of Ritual: Ritual provides information on the sourcing of each ingredient, as well as details on the company's specific suppliers. All products are vegan and free of: gluten sugar GMOs major allergens (except for the HyaCera skin supplement, which contains wheat) artificial sweeteners synthetic flavors, fillers, and colors Ritual supplements are tested by independent labs, including Eurofins and IEH Laboratories, to verify that each batch meets high standards for purity and potency. To ensure safety, the products are also tested for heavy metals, impurities, major allergens, and microbes. Several of Ritual's supplements are also certified by third-party organizations. For instance, all of the brand's protein powders are certified by Informed Sport, which means they have been tested to ensure that they are free of substances banned by athletics organizations. Additionally, the Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+ is verified by USP, an organization that evaluates the strength and purity of supplements. Ritual offers a variety of products, including multivitamins for every stage of life, including: Note: click on the links below to read more about the products found in each category. Here's a closer look at the supplements the company offers. Multivitamins for adults Dose: 2 capsules per day Certifications: USP verified, non-GMO verified, Made Traceable *Price is accurate as of the date of publication. Healthline's review Unlike many other Ritual supplements, the Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+ includes iron. Women of childbearing age need more iron because of increased losses during menstruation ( 2). The supplement is also third-party certified by USP. Just keep in mind that because the supplement is designed to fill common gaps in the diet, Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+ isn't as comprehensive as many other women's multivitamins. What our tester says \"I've tried several multivitamin supplements, and I was overall impressed by Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+. The pills were easy to swallow and were surprisingly pretty to look at thanks to the beadlet-in-oil technology. \"As someone who doesn't eat fish on a regular basis, I also appreciated having a multivitamin that contains omega-3 DHA. Plus, while some online reviewers complain about a fishy burps, I found that the minty-fresh flavor masked any fishiness.\" \u2014 Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, Nutrition Editor II \"I've tried several multivitamin supplements, and I was overall impressed by Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+.

Healthline's review The Essential for Women Multivitamin 50+ contains several essential micronutrients to support healthy aging after menopause, including vitamin D3, which is necessary for maintaining strong bones and increasing calcium absorption ( 3). However, it's worth noting that the supplement isn't formulated to manage common menopause symptoms. It's also not as comprehensive as many other options for women over 50.

Healthline's review Ritual provides two multivitamins designed specifically for men, including this option for men over 18 years of age and a formulation for men 50 years and older. Both multivitamins contain omega-3 fatty acids sourced from microalgae, which may help support heart health, reduce inflammation, and enhance brain function ( 4). Each supplement also provides a hearty dose of zinc, which is important for immunity, wound healing, protein synthesis, and more ( 5). The Essential for Men Multivitamin 18+ currently costs $33 a bottle, while the Essential for Men Multivitamin 50+ costs $39 for a one-month supply. Pros & cons includes vitamins and minerals specifically for men vegan-friendly and free of gluten and other common allergens third-party tested for purity and potency some people may prefer a more comprehensive supplement containing nutrients such as calcium, vitamin C, and selenium includes vitamins and minerals specifically for men vegan-friendly and free of gluten and other common allergens third-party tested for purity and potency some people may prefer a more comprehensive supplement containing nutrients such as calcium, vitamin C, and selenium Product details Number of servings: 30 per bottle Active ingredient(s) (serving strength): (22% DV), boron 0.7 mg, omega-3 DHA 330 mg, vitamin K2 90 mcg DHA per serving: 330 mg Number of servings: 30 per bottle Active ingredient(s) (serving strength): (22% DV), boron 0.7 mg, omega-3 DHA 330 mg, vitamin K2 90 mcg DHA per serving: 330 mg Prenatal and postnatal vitamins Dose: 2 capsules per day Certifications: third-party tested for purity and potency, Non-GMO Project Verified, Made Traceable *Price is accurate as of the date of publication. Healthline's review The Essential for Women Prenatal Multivitamin from Ritual is designed to provide an array of essential nutrients both before and during pregnancy. For instance, it includes folate, which can protect against neural tube development issues, and choline, a micronutrient that can improve pregnancy outcomes ( 9, 10). One mom who tested the product found that she had much more energy while taking the Ritual prenatal during her third pregnancy than she'd had while taking a generic prenatal during her first two pregnancies. Just keep in mind that this supplement provides only 10% of the daily value (DV) for choline during pregnancy. Therefore, it's important to include choline-rich foods, such as eggs, in your diet. In case you're not getting enough choline from your diet, Ritual makes a protein powder for pregnancy and the postpartum period that contains additional choline. What our tester says \"I've found Ritual's Essential for Women Prenatal to be a great prenatal vitamin option. I appreciate the convenience of the subscription model and find the ingredients to be of higher quality compared to many other more mainstream brands. \"On a few occasions, I've experienced the infamous 'fishy burps' that can come with taking a DHA supplement, but I've been happy that I've been able to avoid them most of the time. \"Additionally, while it's marketed as having a lemon essence, I've found the taste and smell to be quite neutral and not overpowering. \"Overall, I'd recommend this supplement to anyone looking for a prenatal with traceable ingredients and who doesn't want to worry about remembering to purchase their vitamins each month.\" \u2014 Catherine Conelly, Healthline Editor II \"I've found Ritual's Essential for Women Prenatal to be a great prenatal vitamin option.

Healthline's review Ritual's Essential for Women Postnatal Multivitamin is formulated specifically for people who have given birth within the last 6 months and those who are nursing. The mint-scented postnatal vitamin provides several vitamins and minerals that postpartum persons are often lacking, including vitamin D, iron, and folate ( 11). It also contains other nutrients that are required in higher amounts while nursing, such as iodine and biotin ( 12, 13).

Healthline's review The Kids Multivitamin 4+ comes in gummy form and is formulated for kids ages 4-12 years. It's made without any added sugar or sugar alcohols, and is naturally flavored. As with the multivitamins for teens, this kid-friendly formulation provides several nutrients that regulate immune function, including zinc and vitamins A and D ( 14, 15, 16). All three supplements also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are thought to promote brain health throughout the life span ( 17). The Kids Multivitamin 4+ also contains a blend of fiber and prebiotics, both of which can support the health of the gut microbiome ( 18, 19).

Healthline's review With 20 grams (g) of plant-based protein in each serving, Ritual's protein shakes can help you squeeze more protein into your diet. They also contain several essential nutrients, including choline, calcium, and iron, making them a good complement to Ritual's multivitamins. The company offers two daily varieties that are formulated based on age, including: Both are free of sugar, stevia, soy, gluten, or GMOs. They are also naturally flavored with vanilla and sweetened with fermented sugarcane and monk fruit. Plus, the shakes are Informed Sport Certified, meaning competitive athletes can rest assured that the powders are free from substances banned in sport. Finally, it's worth noting that the Daily Shake 50+ contains calcium beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a compound that may help increase muscle mass and improve strength and physical function in older adults ( 20, 21). What our tester says \"I've tried countless protein powders over the years and am pretty picky about the taste and texture. Ritual Essential Protein Daily Shake 18+ had a thicker consistency than many other powders that I've tried, and I appreciate that it's Informed Sport Certified. \"However, the texture was a bit gritty and took a long time to smooth out using a shaker bottle. I also found the vanilla flavor to taste artificial, though it didn't leave a bad aftertaste. \"While it's not my favorite protein powder, nutritionally, I think it's a solid option for people looking to add a boost of protein and essential nutrients to their morning smoothie.\" \u2014 Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, Nutrition Editor II \"I've tried countless protein powders over the years and am pretty picky about the taste and texture.

What our tester says \"I found the Essential Protein Daily Shake Pregnancy & Prenatal to be a super helpful part of my daily routine during my pregnancy. \"I try to eat a mostly plant-based diet, so I chose this powder because it still provides a complete amino acid profile with that extra boost of choline for pregnancy. \"It blends well into a simple smoothie with fruit, and I feel reassured that the ingredients are traceable and high quality. \"My only complaint is that I wish it came in a tub or jar type of container instead of a bag.

Healthline's review Designed to support gut health, enhance immune function, and relieve digestive issues like gas and bloating, Ritual's Synbiotic+ is a 3-in-1 supplement that features prebiotics, probiotics, and a postbiotic. Each capsule provides 11 billion colony-forming units with two strains of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12), both of which have been studied for their ability to boost immune function and digestive health ( 22, 23). It also contains PreforPro, a blend of prebiotics, and Tributyrin, a type of postbiotic. In addition to probiotics, both prebiotics and postbiotics can help support the health of the gut microbiome ( 18, 24). Plus, this product is shelf-stable and made with a delayed-release capsule to optimize absorption. What our tester says \"As someone who struggled with digestive health for years and still experiences digestive issues occasionally, I was excited to try Synbiotic+ as a possible replacement for the expensive pre- and probiotic supplements that I was taking. \"While I've only been taking it for less than 1 month, I've already noticed success with Synbiotic+. \"The capsule has a peppermint taste that's much better than other supplements I've tried, and I appreciate the company's transparency around its ingredient sourcing and quality measures.

Healthline's review Ritual's HyaCera supplement is formulated to promote skin hydration and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. Each once-daily, vanilla-essenced capsule contains two ingredients, including wheat oil extract and sodium hyaluronate, the sodium salt form of hyaluronic acid. One 12-week study showed that applying a hyaluronic acid cream significantly reduced wrinkles and improved skin condition in adults compared to a placebo ( 25). An animal study found that wheat oil extract could also improve skin barrier function and prevent ultraviolet-induced skin damage, though these results haven't been confirmed in humans ( 26). Note that this product is not suitable for those with an allergy to wheat. However, it is considered gluten-free because of the processing methods used.

Taste Ritual's multivitamins and postnatal vitamins contain a mint tab, which adds a fresh flavor to each dose, and the prenatal multivitamin is available with a lemon-flavored tab for a citrusy zing. Still, although the vitamins contain microalgae rather than fish, many reviewers note that the capsules have a distinct fish-like flavor due to their content of omega-3 fatty acids. Some people may have a hard time getting past this. Additionally, the company's protein powders are available only in a vanilla flavor and are free of sugar, stevia, and sugar alcohols. Though many online reviewers report that the powders blend well, others note that they find the taste and texture unpalatable, especially when consuming the powder on its own. Blending the protein powder with other nutrient-dense ingredients, like fresh fruit or nut butter, may help improve the flavor if you're not a fan. Nausea Ritual multivitamins are formulated to prevent nausea and stomach irritation thanks to the design of its capsules, which are formulated to dissolve in the small intestine rather than the stomach ( ). 1 According to Ritual, this can help prevent digestive side effects such as nausea, which are commonly associated with multivitamins ( ). 27 The brand's prenatal vitamins are also available with a citrus-flavored tab, which is believed to be beneficial for reducing morning sickness and nausea during pregnancy ( ). 28 Subscription Ritual is a subscription-based service, meaning you need to set up a monthly subscription to purchase products. You can also choose from discounted bundles or create your own monthly bundle by mixing and matching your favorite products. Monthly subscriptions include free shipping and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can easily change your delivery date or cancel your subscription at any time directly on the company's website. Dosage All Ritual products \u2014 both the multivitamins and the protein powders \u2014 are intended to be taken once per day. The dosage for most of the multivitamins is two capsules per day, which can be taken without meals. However, the dosage for the multivitamin for kids is three gummies per day, and the dosage for the Synbiotic+ and HyaCera supplements is one capsule per day. Ritual's protein powders should be combined with 8-12 ounces (237-355 milliliters) of any liquid and enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. Ritual is accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB). While the company currently has a 1.81-star rating from 16 customer reviews on the BBB, Ritual currently holds an A+ rating, which is based on factors like the company's complaint history and business practices. On Trustpilot, Ritual has an average rating of 1.9 out of 5 stars, which is based on 27 customer reviews. Online reviewers generally appreciate the simple list of ingredients in Ritual products, as well as the transparency regarding sourcing and suppliers. Many like that each capsule contains an array of important nutrients, eliminating the need to take several supplements each day or purchase multiple products. However, because the capsules contain omega-3 fatty acids, many reviewers note that the taste is unpleasant and report experiencing side effects like \"fishy burps\" after taking their multivitamin. Some dislike the flavor of the protein powders, saying that the powders should be blended with other ingredients to mask the taste. A few reviewers also report experiencing issues with deliveries, recurring monthly subscriptions, and the responsiveness of customer service. While Ritual has many positive aspects, there are a few potential downsides to consider: Price: Ritual products can be more expensive than some similar supplements, which may not make them a great choice for cost-conscious consumers or people on a tight budget. Subscription: Ritual supplements require a monthly subscription, which might not be suitable for people who prefer having more flexibility to purchase products only as needed. Personalization: Though Ritual offers products for men and women in a wide age range, the company doesn't offer personalized bundles or supplements. Nutritional needs: Some Ritual supplements don't contain certain nutrients that some people might want or need, such as iron, calcium, or vitamin C. Additionally, Ritual's prenatal vitamin is low in choline, so people who are pregnant should make sure they're consuming enough choline-rich foods. If a healthcare professional has recommended that you take a multivitamin or supplement with specific nutrients, you should discuss with them whether a Ritual product contains the right ingredients and amounts for you before purchasing. Ritual vitamins may be worth purchasing if you're looking for a convenient and easy way to fill any gaps in your diet. The company provides detailed information on the sourcing of each ingredient, and all products undergo thorough testing by an independent lab, which might be an important consideration for some people. Because they are made using delayed-release capsules, Ritual products may be a good option if you often experience digestive issues with other multivitamins. However, if you have specific nutrient needs or preferences, you may want to choose a service that offers more options for customization, more add-ons, or more comprehensive multivitamins. Additionally, if cost is a concern, several more budget-friendly options are available that can provide the same set of nutrients at a lower price. Are Ritual vitamins FDA-approved? Unlike foods and medications, supplements are not regulated or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
