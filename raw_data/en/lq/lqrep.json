A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications. It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences. The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security requirements. Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk. This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation. The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national security and homeland defense. The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk. The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project will produce breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. The Beyond Scaling programs in this project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. The Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in Projects ES-01 and CCS-02 in this same Program Element. The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems. The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in computing and the computing-reliant subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce. The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Human Social Systems Description: The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. One focus area of the Human Social Systems thrust is to develop and validate new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems. Another focus area is to identify methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress. This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at city scale. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop new capabilities for experimentally testing and validating multiple models of human social systems and behaviors. - Demonstrate the applicability of newly developed representation and modeling tools for understanding potential social behavioral outcomes. - Test newly developed representation and modeling tools to determine applicability for understanding social behavioral outcomes. - Begin to leverage inherent bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects expansion into testing and modeling phases of understanding human social systems. Title: Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) Description: The Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program is developing data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models. Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits. In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models. The SD2 program is developing tools to enable robust design despite the lack of complete scientific models. This involves collecting raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, developing computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and creating data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design. SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop baseline scientific discovery algorithms that detect why experiments fail and enhance reproducibility of sensor and circuit design experiments. - Establish automated design tools for biological circuit and protein design to accelerate design of molecular sensors. - Develop experimental planning tools to optimize cost trade-offs for biological circuit and protein design experiments. - Generate cross laboratory datasets and evaluate the extent to which scientific discovery and design tools accelerate the design of biological circuits and proteins. FY 2019 Plans: - Extend scientific discovery algorithms to identify root causes for experimental surprises.13.000 21.000 23.000 Volume 1 - 5UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 43 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects continued development and refinement of techniques and software tools to enable scientific discovery and design in domains that lack robust models. Title: Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation Description: The Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust will develop foundational mathematical and computational theories, approaches and tools to better represent, quantify and model complex DoD systems from multimodal data analysis through part/system design and fabrication. One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets. Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities. Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available. Outcomes from this thrust will improve the speed and accuracy of modeling and simulation, as well as enable management of complexity across DoD devices, parts and systems.

Title: World Modelers Description: The World Modelers program is creating explanatory models for natural and human-mediated systems at regional and global scales. The world is highly interdependent, and disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems can have severe consequences. The World Modelers capability is focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings of impending catastrophe. Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts. The World Modelers program is developing techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs. One critical issue involves determining when correlations are strictly statistical versus when they result from causal relationships; in the latter case, models can reveal effective interventions. Advances in machine reading and learning, semantic technologies, big data analysis, geo-spatial and economic modeling, and environmental simulation bring this strategic capability within reach. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop an initial capability to model perturbations having the potential to impact theater security. - Implement automated machine reading and learning techniques for updating large-scale models using public literature and government and commercial data. - Expand large-scale data sets, and initiate evaluations of quantitative models of food security and human migration. - Analyze models of regional and global phenomena, and formulate theory to understand the limits of model accuracy.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 - Award Director's Fellowships for top FY 2017 participants to refine technology further and align to DoD needs. Title: Communicating With Computers (CWC) Description: The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program is advancing human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context. Human language is inherently ambiguous, so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and context to communicate. CWC will provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure, and link language to this perceptual encoding. To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding, which are essential for human communication. CWC will also extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts such as virtual constructs in the cyber domain. CWC advances will impact military application areas such as robotics and command and control. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop human-machine communication techniques for a problem solving task in which humans and machines collaborate to explain physical effects. - Develop techniques for learning communication principles and evaluate through at least one use case. - Demonstrate that increased cognitive bandwidth of communication enables machines to collaborate more effectively with humans in solving problems. FY 2019 Plans: - Enhance techniques to minimize breakdowns in communication in order to maintain natural pacing. - Develop capability for communication that produces content that is interesting and engaging. - Demonstrate integrated capability for one machine or system to seamlessly address multiple use cases. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects continued development of human-computer interaction technologies and expanded work to integrate and demonstrate human-machine communication capabilities.14.356 15.000 16.800 Title: Complex Hybrid Systems Description: This research thrust is focused on exploring fundamental science, mathematics, and computational approaches to collectives, complex hybrid (e.g., human-machine) systems and systems of systems across a variety of DoD-relevant domains.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects expansion of design tools and testing environments for human-machine systems. Title: Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) Description: The Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment. Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment. The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive.

Title: Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) Description: The Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program will research and develop fundamentally new machine learning mechanisms, enabling machines that learn continuously as they operate. Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed. To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge. Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.

Title: Machine Common Sense (MCS) Description: The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program will explore approaches to commonsense reasoning by machines. Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in exciting new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and two-person strategy games (Chess, Go). But in all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized; broad, commonsense reasoning by machines remains elusive. The program will create more human-like knowledge representations, for example, perceptually-grounded representations, to enable commonsense reasoning by machines about the physical world and spatio-temporal phenomena. Equipping AI systems with more human-like reasoning capabilities will make it possible for humans to teach/correct a machine as they interact and cooperate on tasks, enabling more equal collaboration and ultimately symbiotic partnerships between humans and machines. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop approaches for machine reasoning about imprecise and uncertain information derived from text, pictures, video, speech, and sensor data. - Design methods to enable machines to identify knowledge gaps and reason about their state of knowledge. - Formulate perceptually-grounded representations to enable commonsense reasoning by machines about the physical world and spatio-temporal phenomena.

Title: Big Mechanism Description: The Big Mechanism program is creating new approaches to automated computational intelligence applicable to diverse domains such as biology, cyber, economics, social science, and intelligence. Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract, causal models from massive volumes of diverse data. Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models will soon exceed the capacity for human comprehension. Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases; reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations; and knowledge synthesis techniques to create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data. Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies. The program has focused on cancer modeling due to the availability of experimental data. The complexity of this problem is representative of challenges facing the DoD in areas such as cyber attribution and open-source intelligence. FY 2018 Plans: - Apply information extraction techniques developed for the Ras cancer pathway model to other cancer classes, and extend techniques to additional problem domains.

This capability increases the number of people who can effectively contribute, makes experts more productive, and enables the creation of new tactical applications that are inconceivable given today's tools. The key enabling technology is a radically new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that enables developers to quickly build generative models of phenomena and queries of interest which a compiler then converts into efficient applications.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Transparent Computing Description: The Transparent Computing program is developing technologies to enable the implementation of more effective security policies across distributed systems. The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscure linkages between security-related events, making it hard to discover attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). The Transparent Computing program will create the capability to propagate security-relevant information, track complete knowledge of event provenance, and ensure component interactions are consistent with established behavior profiles and policies. Transparent Computing technologies are particularly important for large integrated systems with diverse components such as distributed surveillance systems, autonomous systems, and enterprise information systems.

Title: SafeWare Description: The SafeWare program is developing new code obfuscation techniques for protecting software from reverse engineering. At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which could include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, and proprietary algorithms. Today's state-of-the-art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.) that is not resilient against automated tools. Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970s. In its present form, cryptographic obfuscation incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical. The SafeWare program will take this very early-stage obfuscation theory and increase its practicality and efficiency. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop demonstrations of obfuscation protocols with provable security properties and quantifiable security levels for more complex computational or algorithmic processes. - Create modular approaches that restrict obfuscation to the most sensitive parts of computational or algorithmic processes. - Reformulate classic cryptographic protocols using obfuscation as a basic resource for computational security. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate obfuscation of sensitive information and algorithms in pattern matching applications in support of cybersecurity and target recognition. - Scale obfuscation methods and demonstrate interoperability of obfuscated software.

Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks. Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks, so cyber adversaries are now finding new ways of compromising software. Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as a new generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of software algorithms rather than implementation flaws. The STAC program seeks to develop analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these new attacks in the software which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.16.360 14.573 3.600 Volume 1 - 17UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 43 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CYS-01 / B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. Within this project, Beyond Scaling programs will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Beyond Scaling programs move to Project ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) Description: The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications, sensing, and radar systems. HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements. Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries. However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance. Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.

Title: Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to identify, investigate, and demonstrate inertial sensor technologies for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas. By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation- Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms. By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.

Title: Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) Description: The Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) program will investigate advanced analog components to process radio frequency (RF) signals for communications, radar, and electronic warfare applications. Today, electronic components are limited in their ability to distinguish between two or more signals operating at the same frequency when one signal is strong enough to jam the others. The jamming signal, in this case, saturates the receiver electronics much like loud music drowns out a quiet conversation. By using advancements in new semiconductor materials, processing, and novel signal interaction mechanisms, SPAR components will be able to pick out friendly RF signals from both intentional and unintentional jamming signals, even when those signals sit on top of one another in frequency. This capability would enable a range of new applications including communications in contested battlefield RF environments, jamming the RF spectrum while maintaining communication, and full- duplex radio communication. Other potential applications include equipping mobile radios with SPAR-enabled front ends for simultaneous jam-resistant two-way communication and electronic warfare. FY 2018 Plans: - Perform measurement of SPAR RF signal processing components meeting Phase 1 performance. - Design Phase 2 RF signal processing components with commercial communications grade performance capable of rejecting uncooperative in-band jamming by 30x and cooperative self-interference by 100,000x.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 reflects minor Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW). Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry. This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function. Reducing the Size, Weight, And Power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals. For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems. The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems. FY 2018 Plans: - Characterize properties of magnetic films deposited on semiconductor substrates. - Design and fabricate prototype integrated magnetic components such as circulators and isolators. - Demonstrate prototype modeling codes with improved accuracy and efficiency. - Demonstrate miniaturized and optimized non-linear magnetic components.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Description: The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications. For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal. This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide. Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF. This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size. AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system. This new capability would enable a range of applications including hard-to-jam wireless communications for use over very long distances and short- range underground and underwater RF links. Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop physics-based models of the electromagnetic field generation and propagation at targeted distances. - Develop high performance electret and ferroelectric materials able to support high charge density with low charge leakage rates. - Develop ferrofluids with improved magnetization and particle conglomeration properties. - Design and develop electromechanical systems and architectures to realize large scale, high-precision mechanical actuation of magnets and electrically polarized materials.

Title: Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) Description: The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will investigate high-performance photonic components for a compact, robust, and highly-accurate optical frequency synthesizer suited to various mission-critical DoD applications. Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities. Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers. DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers. The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance. Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop and implement techniques to improve the laser frequency tuning speed and tuning accuracy using co-integrated electronic and photonic components. - Design components and develop processes for fabrication of high efficiency integrated frequency doublers to reduce the power consumption of the DODOS frequency synthesizer.

Title: Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARNet) Description: The Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARNet) program was a government-industry partnership designed to enable the performance requirements of future sensing, communication, computing, and memory applications. The program sponsored academic research teams focused on technology areas, determined by government and industry experts that impact long-range DoD needs. The sponsored academic research base included approximately 46 universities, 188 faculty researchers, 628 students, and more than 112 industry associate personnel. Industry provided 60% of program funding, while DARPA provided the remaining 40% of funding. STARNet research was divided into three centers that focused on system issues (design architecture and system design) and three centers that focused on device and materials issues (high-performance and low power devices). As the projects in the device and materials centers matured, they were expected to be utilized by the system centers to enhance improvements in system design and fabrication.18.000 - - Title: Near Zero Energy RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) Description: The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will investigate the innovative technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years. Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus. However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months. N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger. This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events. In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability. To enable this possibility, N-ZERO's basic research component will consider highly innovative sensors and sensor architectures as well as signal processing and digitization technologies with near-zero power consumption. In particular, the program will explore and develop a fundamental understanding of the trade space between power consumption, the minimum detectable signal, and the probability of falsely detecting a trigger.

Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors. However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.

Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components. As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization. This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits. Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems. Further research would also develop tools to create exact representations of physical hardware. Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in Projects ES-01 and CCS-02 in this same Program Element. B.

Title: Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma Description: The Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma program will exploit recent advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to develop approaches to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). Critical to success will be the ability to detect and quantify functional and/or structural changes that occur in the human brain during the formation of distinct new memories, and to correlate those changes with subsequent recall of those memories during performance of behavioral tasks. This program will also develop neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population. The ultimate goal is identification of efficacious therapeutic approaches that can bypass and/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.

Title: Enhanced Monitoring of Health and Disease Description: The Enhanced Monitoring of Health and Disease program will improve military health and force readiness by leveraging advanced data collection methods and prognostic capabilities to predict changes in health and spread of infectious disease from the individual to the population scale. While new technology platforms have enhanced our ability to respond to illness and disease, there is a need for predictive and pre-emptive technologies that enable us to correctly prepare a response prior to its obvious need, such as in a barracks or in a confined environment (e.g., submarine). Research in this program will investigate new methods for the collection and detection of multiplexed biological markers as well as the analysis, correlation, and ultimate integration of vast personalized data into the clinical care information technology infrastructure. Additionally, this program will develop new approaches to integrate multi-source data streams to create effective predictive models of disease outbreak and spread. Technologies developed in this program will enable clinically actionable information, even when an individual has no awareness of symptoms, and extend infectious disease forecasting into a real-time, accurate capability for decision support. FY 2018 Plans: - Select a minimal set of biomarkers that accurately predict contagiousness. - Develop a prognostic assay that predicts contagiousness using the minimal set of biomarkers. - Evaluate models and prognostic tests for accuracy prospectively.

Title: Tactical Biomedical Technologies Description: The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust developed new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield. Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield. While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method, other than surgical intervention, can effectively treat intracavity bleeding. A focus in this thrust was the co-development of a materials- based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of hemostasis and wound control for non-compressible hemorrhage in the abdominal space, regardless of wound geometry or location within that space. This thrust also investigated non-invasive techniques and equipment to use laser energy to treat intracranial hemorrhage through the skull and tissues in a pre-surgical environment. Finally, in order to address logistical delays associated with delivering necessary therapeutics to the battlefield, this thrust developed a pharmacy on demand that will provide a rapid response capability to enable far-forward medical providers the ability to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics.3.913 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 95.801 109.360 101.300 D.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Information and Communications Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies. The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the core computing and networking technologies required to protect DoD's information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems. The technologies will provide cost-effective security and survivability solutions that enable DoD information systems to operate correctly and continuously while under attack, and to be rapidly recovered/reconstituted in the aftermath of an attack. The Language Understanding and Symbiotic Automation project develops technologies to enable computing systems to understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events; and to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as partners to human operators. Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to operate safely with high degrees of autonomy.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems. Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations. Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) Description: The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program seeks to catalyze the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each other's operating characteristics. SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access. Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack. First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized. Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack. SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time. In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies. SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years. The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum. FY 2018 Plans: - Hold preliminary competition, to take place on the custom-built competition testbed. - Hold second set of qualifying events to select additional Open Track participants.14.750 18.000 23.885 Volume 1 - 61UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-02 / HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH- PERFORMANCE RESPONSIVE ARCHITECTURES B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects preparation for final competition. Title: RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) Description: The RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) program will address the performance limitations of conventional radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, or communications. Currently, the capabilities of these systems are fixed at the time of design and limited by their designer's vision. Conversely, a generic RFMLS system would learn how to reconfigure its circuits and processing to meet the requirements of a desired application in a specific environment. The relevant RF features are hand crafted and human specified today, and would instead be learned through machine learning algorithms applied within the RF system itself. The RFMLS system would later learn to adapt to changing conditions and requirements, making a much more robust RF system solution. This flexibility should reduce the time and cost of continually re-designing and upgrading new systems and extend RF system performance beyond the limits of human designers. RMFLS exploits recent advancements in machine learning that have not previously been applied to RF systems. FY 2018 Plans: - Create datasets and infrastructure for use in training and evaluating RFML Systems. - Begin development of machine learning algorithms and architectures applied to four different challenge problems. - Evaluate integratability of machine learning algorithms and architectures with candidate RF hardware systems. - Identify existing DoD RF systems to upgrade with RFMLS machine learning. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete development of machine learning algorithms and architectures for two of four challenge problems. - Test preliminary performance of solutions for all four challenge problems and complete final testing for two challenge problem solutions. - Begin development of an RF hardware system to host field testing and demonstrations.

Title: Adversarial AI for RF Description: The Adversarial AI for RF program aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with applications for national security, particularly in areas such as electronic warfare. Given that U.S. and potential adversaries are developing AI technology with potentially revolutionary capabilities, DoD must prepare for conflicts that include offensive and defensive AI actors. Adversarial AI will develop methodologies for protecting AI-enabled DoD systems from adversary attempts to elicit an erroneous response (spoofing) and for significantly increasing AI system reliability and safety. The resulting AI algorithms should also ensure that AI-enabled DoD devices offer human-understandable explanations for their suggested course of action, to the maximum extent possible. To enable this future, the Adversarial AI program will leverage and advance newly formed links between machine learning and security and look to extend these emerging techniques to military specific domains that are emerging such as cognitive Electronic Warfare (EW) systems. Finally, the program may inform the correct mechanism to train AI systems for use in adversarial situations. FY 2019 Plans: - Specify and bound problem domains, selecting those where the program will have the greatest impact. - Develop new theoretical and algorithmic foundations of lifelong learning cryptographic and waveform attacks and defense. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects program initiation.- - 9.000 Title: Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Description: The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program will pursue new hardware architectures and algorithms for rapidly integrating information from a variety of sources, increasing battlefield situational awareness. To develop operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today watch live battlefield feeds to detect items of interest, fusing together and interpreting information from multiple sensors and sources. The amount of information gathered, however, is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret. To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data. The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter. Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlefield in real time.

Title: Electronic Globalization Description: The Electronic Globalization effort aims to develop advanced capabilities for validating the function of digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC) given limited design specifications. These ICs are critical to nearly all military systems. Globalization and rapid growth in the commercial electronics industry have limited DoD's ability to influence and regulate IC fabrication. DoD today accounts for a relatively small portion of the overall IC market and the vast majority of IC manufacturing capacity lies overseas. As a result, parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet the stated specifications for performance and reliability. Electronic Globalization will pursue the technologies required to address this and other risks to DoD IC's, such as reverse engineering, counterfeiting, and the theft of U.S. intellectual property. The effort will support the development of key risk- reduction techniques including advanced imaging and computational methods for identifying an IC's functional elements. FY 2018 Plans: - Continue to study high stress effects on conventionally-fabricated commercial off the shelf (COTS) and government off the shelf (GOTS) electronic components. - Finalize and test models of high stress effects on conventionally-fabricated parts to verify accuracy and tolerances of models.

The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems. RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing. RADICS technology development is coordinated with and will transition to U.S. government elements responsible for defense of critical infrastructure.

Title: Dispersed Computing Description: The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources. At present, enterprises and Internet-based Information Technology (IT) service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers, which brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing. The Dispersed Computing program will develop a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources. A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements. These dual-purposed network-compute elements will be used to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints, and mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data given network conditions and available network-compute elements. With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so.

Title: Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) Description: The Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) program is developing new computer networking architectures that deter, detect, and overcome Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks include both high- volume flooding attacks and more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while exhausting server processing and memory. These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls; attackers will assimilate poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets. XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks.

Title: Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) Description: The Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program, building on technology developed in the Enhanced Attribution program, will develop technologies to automatically identify, disrupt and investigate social engineering attacks via bot-mediated communications. Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system. At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls entirely to users. ASED aims to prevent social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications, and auto-identify attackers. If successful, ASED will greatly reduce the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems.

Title: Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) Description: The Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) program will develop data-driven tools for real-time cyber threat detection, characterization, and protection within enterprise-scale networks. U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present no tools exist to efficiently extract the right data from the right device at the right time to analyze these attacks for DoD- scale information networks. For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from millions of devices. CHASE will develop novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and disseminate protective measures that automatically bolster the collective cyber defense posture. FY 2018 Plans: - Devise algorithms to process raw packet capture (PCAP), host system log, and netflow data, and construct feature sets for indicators of adversary activity. - Formulate mathematical approaches for managing network sensor data collection, transmission and retention policies to optimize cyber threat detection and characterization, and enhance enterprise-scale cyber situational awareness. - Initiate development of foundational protective measures. - Establish a test and evaluation environment to allow assessment of cyber threat detection and characterization techniques using real-world data. - Develop cyber security techniques for enterprise IT infrastructure.

Title: Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) Description: The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program will develop the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow system engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other nonfunctional properties when designing complex embedded computing systems. The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering. The CASE technical approach will be to formulate cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering. CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber physical systems.

Authenticating parts or detecting counterfeit components by current means has proven expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness. An alternative solution, maintaining complete control of the global supply chain using administrative controls, can also incur substantial costs. SHIELD instead seeks to incorporate a small, inexpensive silicon chip (\"dielet\") into the packaging of genuine components. The dielet would provide unique and encrypted component identification, enabling authentication from very close proximity. Since counterfeit electronic components pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of both commercial and DoD systems, SHIELD would fulfill a large, pressing, and evolving need for anti-counterfeit technologies. FY 2018 Plans: - Continue functional and performance testing of manufactured SHIELD dielets. - Demonstrate the SHIELD concept of operation in an actual or environmental facsimile of an integrated circuit supply chain.16.000 5.000 - Volume 1 - 79UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 22 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-03 / INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Title: Vetting Commodity Computing Systems for the DoD (VET) Description: The Vetting Commodity Computing Systems for the DoD (VET) program developed tools and methods to uncover backdoors and other hidden malicious functionality in the software and firmware on commodity IT devices. The international supply chain that produces the computer workstations, routers, printers, and mobile devices on which DoD depends provides many opportunities for our adversaries to insert hidden malicious functionality. VET technologies detect hidden malicious functionality and also the software and firmware defects and vulnerabilities that can facilitate adversary cyber attack.12.350 - - Title: High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) Description: The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program developed and demonstrated technologies to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems. The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, and other communication devices. This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance. This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with limited size, weight, and power. Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints. Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain- specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices are within reach at reasonable costs. The program developed, matured, and integrated these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications. Additionally, the program explored the use of formal methods to bring high levels of inherent assurance to Internet-enabled applications, in particular, applications involving remote update, access, management, authorization, and control.10.300 - - Title: Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) Description: The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) program created automated defenses that identified and responded to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Language Understanding and Symbiotic Automation project develops technologies to enable computing systems to understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events; and to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as partners to human operators. Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to perform critical missions safely and with high degrees of autonomy. The technologies developed in this project will lay the foundation for a new generation of human-machine systems for the U.S. military. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to produce a rationale to explain the conclusions they reach. If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust. Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user. XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users. XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous and decision-support systems. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop and demonstrate an initial prototype using modified deep learning techniques to produce deep neural nets that are more interpretable than current techniques. - Develop and demonstrate an initial prototype using structured, causal, machine learning techniques that are inherently more interpretable.11.090 18.446 22.000 Volume 1 - 82UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 25 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-04 / LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMBIOTIC AUTOMATION B.

FY 2019 Plans: - Formulate second-generation explainable machine learning methods and modified deep learning techniques, and integrate these into prototypes. - Define a set of common test problems in data analytics and autonomous systems for evaluating explanation effectiveness. - Deliver a computational model of the theory of explanation in artificial intelligence, and demonstrate the ability of the computational model to predict the performance of explanations generated by the systems. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects continued development of explainable machine learning techniques and integration for testing on problems in data analytics and autonomous systems. Title: Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) Description: The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources for use in environments where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data. At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, resulting in only one interpretation with alternatives being eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from multiple sources into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends. If successful, AIDA will provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly. FY 2018 Plans: - Define an initial common semantic representation language for diverse sources. - Adapt multimedia-analysis algorithms to produce information suitable for use in a common semantic representation. - Develop semantic techniques that automatically generate, update, rank, and prune alternative interpretations given new data. - Develop techniques to assess the possibility that an interpretation is based on semantically consistent adversarial misinformation. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop techniques to integrate diverse information from multiple sources into the common semantic representation. - Develop techniques to extend known ontologies using information from diverse sources. - Develop techniques to estimate the confidence of the generated interpretations.5.500 17.300 21.100 Volume 1 - 83UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 26 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-04 / LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMBIOTIC AUTOMATION B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects continued development of techniques for generating multiple alternative interpretations from multimedia data and conducting adversarial evaluations of techniques on synthetic data. Title: Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Description: The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages. The U.S. military operates globally and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists. Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets. As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand. LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources. These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response. FY 2018 Plans: - Extend development of techniques to determine strength of opinions and beliefs in low-resource language speech as well as text. - Integrate multiple new algorithms with a graphical user interface, and evaluate with end users. - Construct an integrated system employing multiple algorithms for low-resource language analysis. - Evaluate performance on the Uyghur language baseline and on additional low-resource languages. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop techniques to establish situational awareness from text and speech of low-resource languages. - Extend development of techniques to determine strength of opinions and beliefs to understand urgency and completion status of emerging situations. - Evaluate performance on additional languages, and measure progress on the languages evaluated in the previous year. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 decrease is the result of development work concluding and the focus shifting to testing on a diverse collection of low- resource languages.25.636 28.662 13.880 Title: Assured - 84UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-04 / LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMBIOTIC AUTOMATION B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Description: The Assured Autonomy program, an outgrowth from the Explainable Artificial Intelligence program, will develop rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to guarantee safety properties in uncertain environments. Currently, the state of art for test, evaluation, verification and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments. As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance. Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, machine learning, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems. The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop initial algorithms for formal representation and online evaluation of assurance cases, safety-aware learning, and enforcement of safety constraints. - Develop and design verification tools that predict properties and prove correctness of systems with learning-enabled components. - Produce assurance challenge problems for different learning-enabled autonomous systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop techniques and tools that construct formal semantics of assurance cases, provide dynamic interpretation of assurance cases, and modularize and automatically generate assurance cases from system design descriptions. - Develop algorithms that integrate and enforce safety constraints in learning-enabled algorithms. - Apply technologies to several learning-enabled autonomous platforms, and assess their reliability and sensitivity to modeling assumptions. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase is the result of the development work accelerating and technologies being tested on several learning- enabled autonomous platforms. Title: Human-Machine Symbiosis (HMS) Description: The Human-Machine Symbiosis (HMS) program will develop technologies to enable machines to collaborate with humans as colleagues, partners, and teammates. The world is moving faster than humans can assimilate, understand, and act.

Title: Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) Description: The Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) program is developing language technology to enable automated extraction, processing, and inference of information from text in operationally relevant application domains. A key DEFT emphasis is to determine explicit and implicit meaning in text through probabilistic inference, anomaly detection, and other techniques. To accomplish this, DEFT will develop and apply formal representations for basic facts, spatial, temporal, and associative relationships, causal and process knowledge, textually entailed information, and derived relationships and correlated actions/ events. DEFT inputs may be in English or in specific foreign languages, and sources may be reports, messages, or other documents. DEFT technologies will extract knowledge at scale for open source intelligence and threat analysis. Transition partners include the intelligence community and operational commands. FY 2018 Plans: - Design and implement an open evaluation with thousands of documents in multiple languages as input, and a single aggregate language-independent knowledge base that includes entities, events, relations, and sentiment as output.

Title: Lobster Description: The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations. Fiber optic cables, military seabed infrastructure, mines, submarines, unmanned vehicles and oil and gas infrastructure are all within this potentially contested environment. Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion. The Lobster program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art. These robotic systems would be able to execute inspection, characterization, repair, manipulation, recharging, data exfiltration, re-tasking and other high value services without the need for continuous human control and high risk surface ship launch and recovery. Key Lobster technical challenges include scene recognition through visual and acoustic modalities, autonomous behaviors, environmental robustness, vehicle endurance, universality for all unmanned underwater systems, energy storage and interaction with the maritime domain.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Squad X Description: The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries in certain regimes; however, this level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level. The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch. The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales. Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities. The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit.

Title: Mobile Force Protection (MFP) Description: The goal of the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided small unmanned aircraft (sUAS) attacking a high value convoy on the move. By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program will emphasize low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems. Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage. The program seeks to develop solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats. The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.

Title: Precision Kinetic Light Strike* Description: *Formerly Precision Light Strike Munition (PLSM) The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program will seek to develop a small, lightweight, guided kinetic weapon for lightweight maneuver forces. Current short-range weapons are used against a variety of target sets using different munitions without the benefit of active guidance. Current long-range weapons are highly effective against a specific target set at range, but are too large or heavy to employ in needed numbers, have a high cost per shot/procurement cost, and often require burdensome logistics or dedicated specialized systems to use. The program goal is to improve on the existing, lightweight unguided munition systems by increasing range, accuracy, and lethality, while reducing cost. These improvements will leverage advances in miniaturization, precision guidance and warheads. Precision Kinetic Light Strike seeks also to take advantage of commercial technologies whenever possible to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability. The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program could significantly increase the combat power of small units with reduced burden, while significantly reducing cost relative to near-peer and peer adversaries. FY 2018 Plans: - Model system performance against multiple target sets. - Complete trade studies, evaluate concepts and performance metrics, and complete simulations for the most promising concept(s). - Initiate development efforts for high-risk and high-impact component technologies. - Initiate system-level design and development efforts.

Title: PDUE: Autonomous Building Search Persistent Deterrence in Urban Environments* Description: *Formerly part of Urban Operations The goal of the PDUE: Autonomous Building Search Persistent Deterrence in Urban Environments program is to generate capabilities which would allow distributed forces to operate effectively in dense urban areas (e.g. megacities). Military operations in dense urban environments require massive investments in materiel and manpower to clear and hold terrain. Past urban operations indicate the pressing need to maintain security of cleared areas to prevent the enemy from reoccupying or moving freely through these areas. This program seeks to allow the ability to gain, hold, and control areas of the dense urban combat zone over extended periods without the physical presence of warfighters. Just as police units perform presence patrols in neighborhoods to create a pervasive presence that ultimately deters crime within an area, this program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms that monitor an area overtly to deter enemy operations in a designated area. Extending this analogy, police and military follow strict rules of engagement that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior; this program will demonstrate the capability to escalate in force to allow future operations in the presence of civilians as well as the enemy. This mission will require the integration and maturation of novel sensors, urban air vehicles with lethal and non-lethal capabilities, and potentially ground platforms capable of navigating and maneuvering through urban environments. Enabling capabilities would focus on enhanced tactical situational awareness, precise control of destructive and non-destructive effects, cyber- and electronic warfare robustness, and predictive capabilities to analyze avenues of approach and freedom of movement. FY 2018 Plans: - Identify critical operational needs, tactical and environmental issues and key measures of effectiveness. - Conduct trade space analysis regarding sensing range, battery life, and optimal placement as well as aerial vehicle mobility and develop overall system architecture. - Develop adversarial path planning and asset allocation models that select routes to fly and locations to observe based on likely enemy actions.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible. The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter. Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. The Electronic Technology project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems. Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that phenomenal advancements in electronics will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, presenting a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include leveraging materials, architectures, and designs that are designed to suit a specific need. Programs within the Beyond Scaling Technology project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware. They will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting chip-scale heterogeneous integration of differing material technologies, using \"sticky logic\" devices that combine computation and memory functions, and vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in PEs/Projects 0602716E/ELT-01 and 0602303E/IT-02 and IT-03.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) Description: The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems. HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements. Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries. However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance. Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors. Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the13.000 18.000 11.803 Volume 1 - 139UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 execution of the early phases of the program.

Title: Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas. By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms. By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations. Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.

Title: Wafer-scale Infrared Detectors (WIRED) Description: The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands. These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle- mounted threat warning systems. WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time. Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in the Long-Wave Infrared Thermal (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available. However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands. WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR. The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art. FY 2018 Plans: - Demonstrate improved imaging from MWIR detectors that are integrated directly onto readout integrated circuits (ROICs) and evaluate detector performance/characteristics at temperatures of 250 K. - Demonstrate improved imaging from small pixel SWIR detectors that are integrated directly onto ROICs and evaluate detector performance/characteristics. - Update cost models based on detector performance. - Demonstrate performance of a LWIR device at temperatures of 298 K.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The decrease in FY 2019 reflects minor program repricing. Title: Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) Description: The Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program aims to greatly improve the cost, size, weight, and performance of free-space optical systems. These systems enable applications such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging. Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices. These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems. MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components. These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems. FY 2018 Plans: - Demonstrate beam steering using photonic phase shifters and wavelength tuning in low-loss waveguide gratings. - Demonstrate a scalable unit cell with integrated amplification. - Complete preliminary LIDAR system designs.

Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled. By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations. ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies10.589 21.000 18.000 Volume 1 - 142UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments. Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability. FY 2018 Plans: - Perform laboratory demonstration of functioning ACES clock meeting Phase 1 metrics of power consumption, retrace, and instability. - Design an integrated physics package meeting Phase 2 size, weight, and power (SWaP) objectives. - Initiate fabrication and testing of an integrated physics package meeting the ACES Phase 2 SWaP, retrace, aging, and instability.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The decrease in FY 2019 reflects ACES completing fabrication and conducting final testing for transition to the Service Labs for further development. Title: Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) Description: The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C). The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems. Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP- C reductions at lower performance. LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur. These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets. FY 2018 Plans: - Build LWIR cameras using LOTS microbolometer designs and demonstrate 2x improvement over state of the art using the microbolometer figure of merit.9.000 9.000 9.000 Volume 1 - 143UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 - Test cameras for radiometric performance and sensitivity and deliver camera hardware. FY 2019 Plans: - Build LWIR cameras with refined sensors to meet final program specifications. - Validate test camera sensitivity and response time in a relevant application environment. Title: Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) Description: The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will integrate diverse electronic and photonic components to create a compact, robust, and highly-accurate optical frequency synthesizer for various mission-critical DoD applications. Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities. Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers. DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers. The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance. Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop DODOS photonics packaging architectures and deliver prototypes with integrated photonic chips compatible with large- scale batch manufacturing. - Improve the long-term stability of the miniaturized DODOS prototypes and demonstrate synthesizer performance meeting the Phase 2 program goals. FY 2019 Plans: - Successful field demonstration of co-integrated optical frequency synthesizer and control electronics on the DODOS prototype. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The decrease in FY 2019 the DODOS prototype.10.000 13.000 6.000 Title: Atomic Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) Description: The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis. Practical application, however, has been limited. Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded- 12.000 13.000 Volume 1 - 144UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 research facilities. The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources. The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal. This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications. In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and Ultralow Frequency (ULF) communications. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop preliminary architectures for direct gradient sensing of magnetic fields. - Develop and test quantitative models of gradient sensor physics. - Perform laboratory validation of proof-of-principle gradient sensor physics performance. FY 2019 Plans: - Fabricate and test preliminary architectures for direct gradient sensing of magnetic fields. - Refine quantitative models of gradient sensor physics. - Perform laboratory testing of proof-of-principle gradient sensor physics package meeting AMBIIENT Phase 1 size weight and power, accuracy, and sensitivity goals. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects minor program repricing. Title: Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) Description: The Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program aims to develop intrinsically linear (ideal) radio frequency (RF) transistors with improved power efficiency and extremely high dynamic range. Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems. Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference. DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs. The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power. FY 2018 Plans: - Explore novel device structures and emerging materials that will result in high power, high linearity and high power efficiency RF transistors.- 14.000 18.000 Volume 1 - 145UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 - Develop high power and linear power transistor prototype that provides three times more power density and linearity than the state of the art. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop initial low noise and lower power linear transistor prototype that provides 10 times improvement of linearity figure of merit than the state of the art. - Develop fabrication processes for initial advanced transistor architectures and complete early characterization of RF transistor prototypes with two times improvement in output power over the state of the art. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects the need to fund a more diverse portfolio to facilitate alignment with DoD mission needs and support an increased number of RF transistor prototype deliverables for characterization by the government. Title: Wireless Autonomous Vehicle Power Transfer (WAVPT) Description: The Wireless Autonomous Vehicle Power Transfer (WAVPT) program will develop small footprint, efficient receivers to enable power beaming from a ground-based transmitter to a remote unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAVs are currently powered by large, heavy chemical batteries or an engine, with associated liquid fuel. This consumes a large percentage of the UAV's weight budget and places strict limitations on its range. Wireless power transfer represents a paradigm-changing solution to power distribution by alleviating the need to carry all energy sources on-board, drastically reducing UAV weight, and increasing aircraft endurance. Additional power can also be made available for the UAV's payload, allowing use of higher-functionality sensing and computing systems and enabling better data exploitation and threat response. Previous wireless power transfer experiments have demonstrated delivery of over 30 kilowatts of power over a distance of one kilometer but have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitively large, meter-sized receivers required. WAVPT will leverage recent advances in directed energy sources and beam-forming capabilities and develop new receiver architectures to demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer in a small form-factor. Advanced semiconductor materials and processing techniques will be used to develop low-cost, centimeter- sized receivers with high efficiency and energy densities, enabling integration within a small platform. The program will culminate with a demonstration of hundreds of watts of power being transferred from a ground-based transmitter to a UAV at least one kilometer away. The technology that is developed within this program can break the inherent tradeoff between mission duration and weight for unmanned vehicles and transform next-generation military systems. FY 2018 Plans: - Devise a detailed Concept of Operations (CONOPs) for wireless power beaming, including selected UAV, dwell time needed for charging, payload power requirements, and platform integration. - Identify link budget for wireless power transfer over one kilometer.- 9.000 9.500 Volume 1 - 146UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 - Demonstrate a proof of concept flight demo using commercial components. FY 2019 Plans: - Design a custom high-power, high-efficiency, receiver architecture for mission-required beam transmission. - Complete designs and begin component development for a custom integrated wireless power system integrated with a Group 2/3 UAV. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects program Title: Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) Description: The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop standardized, fully digital phased array system components to enable rapid upgrades to DoD communications, electronic warfare, and radar systems. Phased arrays, which control and steer radio signals, have helped the DoD maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict. However, current phased array components are based on custom analog electronics, making them expensive to develop, difficult to upgrade, and time-consuming to deploy. ACT will address this challenge by leveraging programmable, commercial-off-the- shelf, digital components that can undergo yearly technology refreshes in response to a continually changing threat environment. This approach can dramatically reduce the time and cost required to develop and update DoD phased arrays. Further, the ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements typical in the commercial sector could enable the DoD to place phased arrays on inexpensive platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles where they have previously proven prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain. FY 2018 Plans: - Demonstrate arbitrary control of the surface current in a 16 element antenna array. - Continue development of the ACT common module using an advanced 14 nm process node and demonstrate performance improvement compared to the common module developed using a 32 nm node in Phase 1.

ART technologies provided capabilities for next- generation communications, sensing, and electronic warfare, including reconfigurable radios and efficient and compact signal identification capabilities. Goals of the ART program included (1) developing a technology base enabling future radios to survey and adapt to the electromagnetic environment; (2) enabling the rapid deployment of radios in response to changing operational5.000 - - Volume 1 - 147UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 requirements; and (3) significantly reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of such radios. ART enabled the use of a single design pathway for multiple, unique radio frequency (RF) systems, thus dramatically reducing military procurement and sustainment costs. ART also advanced the hardware and software used in radio frequency (RF) systems by developing a flexible, reconfigurable architecture that can adapt to various RF waveforms. Title: Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) Description: The Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program developed the design and manufacturing capabilities required to seamlessly integrate various semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems, photonic (light- manipulating) devices, and thermal management structures into true systems-on-a-chip (SOC). This capability enabled dramatic size, weight, and volume reductions and higher performance for DoD electronic warfare, communications, and radar systems. Historically, chip designers had to decide between the availability, development, and low cost of silicon circuits or the high performance of compound semiconductor (CS) materials. DAHI, however, built on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone. DAHI's applied research program focused on developing and demonstrating high-performance SOC for DoD-specific applications. The program also enhanced the manufacturing yield and reliability of heterogeneous integration capabilities and demonstrated innovative, advanced microsystems that leveraged heterogeneous integration. Relevant manufacturing processes were made available to a wide variety of designers from the DoD laboratories, federally funded research and development centers, academia, and industry. This program had advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.7.000 - - Title: Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) Description: The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program created microelectronic and mechanical systems capable of physically vanishing in a controlled, triggerable manner. This advance helped avoid problems associated with unrecovered devices, including their potential use by unauthorized individuals and the compromise of intellectual property. The resulting technologies enabled a range of applications including vanishing sensors for monitoring large areas of the environment and transient airborne vehicles for emergency resupply without requiring pack out of the air delivery vehicle. To support this new class of electronics and mechanical structures, VAPR developed and established an initial set of transient materials and components along with the required manufacturing processes. The resulting systems performed comparably to commercial-off- the-shelf systems while demonstrating system transience that can be programmed, adjusted, triggered, or made to respond to the deployment environment. VAPR technologies were demonstrated through two final test platforms. A vanishing air delivery vehicle capable of precise, gentle drops of small payloads (~3 lbs.) demonstrated the feasibility of transient structural materials. A sensor with a wireless link demonstrated the manufacturability of transient electronics. Both demonstrations were intended to9.000 - - Volume 1 - 148UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 fully function on their own and to serve as a leading indicator of the potential systems and concepts-of-operation that VAPR could enable. Title: Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) Description: The Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program aims to develop the design tools and integration standards required to better leverage leading-edge commercial sector technologies in DoD systems. The program aims to realize modular Integrated Circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers and silicon technologies. CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets. The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers. FY 2018 Plans: - Finalize selection of standards for high-bandwidth interfaces of digital chiplet-based interconnections. - Complete design activities of heterogeneous circuit demonstrations to verify interface standards for chiplet-based integration of digital IP blocks, including commercial and DoD blocks. - Initiate fabrication of heterogeneous circuit demonstrations to verify interface standards for chiplet-based integration of digital IP blocks, including commercial and DoD blocks. - Continue the study of the system level impact of IP re-use for the optimal use of digital functional blocks. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The decrease in FY 2019 reflects the program moving to Project ELT-02.28.500 28.000 - Title: Near Zero Energy RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) Description: The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years. Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus. However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months. N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger. This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events. In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability. N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical15.000 20.000 - Volume 1 - 149UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise. A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01. FY 2018 Plans: - Design, fabricate and evaluate microsystems enabling passive or near zero energy collection, processing and detection of RF communications and physical sensor signatures at reduced (100x lower than the original specifications) signal strength. - Identify and engage potential users in the national security space to develop N-ZERO transition opportunities. - Initiate development of a near zero power wake-up circuit designed for a specific DoD application. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The decrease in FY 2019 reflects the program moving to Project ELT-02. Title: Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) Description: The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics. CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months. The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics. To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies. These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs. CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes. Finally, CRAFT will develop and validate various techniques for obscuring sensitive information during the IC manufacturing process, allowing DoD to leverage more of the available onshore semiconductor market. These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge. FY 2018 Plans: - Complete initial testing of at least one full object oriented design flow. - Complete third Fin Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) multi-project wafer shuttle run. - Complete FinFET design fabrication on multiple technology nodes at multiple foundries. - Evaluate designs from the second and third multi-project wafer shuttle runs. - Utilize design flow and intellectual property (IP) from the CRAFT repository to complete a DoD reference design.26.000 25.947 - Volume 1 - 150UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 15 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 - Mature new and existing IP obfuscation techniques, evaluate them on DoD-relevant chips, and develop the technologies and techniques required to deploy them for DoD needs.

Title: Beyond Scaling - Materials Description: The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will demonstrate the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components. Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors. However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur. This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels. Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, \"sticky logic\" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies. The program aims to demonstrate the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system. Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach. Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that phenomenal advancements in electronics will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, presenting a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include leveraging materials, architectures, and designs that are designed to suit a specific need. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware. They will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting chip-scale heterogeneous integration of differing material technologies, using \"sticky logic\" devices that combine computation and memory functions, and vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices. This Project is not a new start. It aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in PEs/Projects 0602716E/ELT-01 and 0602303E/IT-02 and IT-03. B.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Description: The Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program aims to develop the design tools and integration standards required to better leverage leading-edge commercial sector technologies in DoD systems. The program aims to realize modular Integrated Circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers and silicon technologies. CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets. The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete module design activities to determine performance and program benefits of new processes enabled by the program. - Initiate fabrication of approved modules to determine performance and program benefits of new processes enabled by the program. - Continue the study of the system level impact of IP re-use for the optimal use of digital and analog functional blocks. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects the program moving from Project ELT-01. Title: System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) Description: The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies. Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture. To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification. Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law. The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks. Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage. Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Implement new hardware architectures on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) demonstration platforms that demonstrate scalable, flexible, and robust protection against external attacks on hardware. - Utilize simulation and hardware emulation to confirm the expected improvement in protection of the new hardware architectures relative to current software only protection.- - 22.790 Volume 1 - 155UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-02 / BEYOND B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects the program moving from PE 0602303E, Project IT-03. Title: Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Description: The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program will pursue new hardware architectures and algorithms for rapidly integrating information from a variety of sources, increasing battlefield situational awareness. To develop operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today watch live battlefield feeds to detect items of interest, fusing together and interpreting information from multiple sensors and sources. The amount of information gathered, however, is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret. To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data. The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter. Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlefield in real time. FY 2019 Plans: - Improve the toolsets based on information gathered from previous testing and deliver a beta version of the software. - Finalize the chip design and deliver the final design to the chip fabrication facility.

CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months. The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics. To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies. These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs. CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes. Finally, CRAFT will develop and- - 7.000 Volume 1 - 156UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 21 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-02 / BEYOND B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 validate various techniques for obscuring sensitive information during the IC manufacturing process, allowing DoD to leverage more of the available onshore semiconductor market. These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete the fourth multi-project wafer shuttle run with the final CRAFT design flow. - Finalize the IP repository design and setup to allow access to a design flow and related IP for DoD use. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in FY 2019 reflects the program moving from Project ELT-01. Title: Near Zero Energy RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) Description: The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years. Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus. However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months. N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger. This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events. In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability. N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise. A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01. FY 2019 Plans: - Design, implement and test signal processing to improve the detection and classification capabilities of N-ZERO sensor systems in the presence of significant background interference. - Facilitate transition opportunities for microsystems enabling passive or near zero energy collection, processing and detection of RF communications and physical sensor signatures at reduced (100x lower than the original specifications) signal strength. - Continue the development of a near zero power wake-up circuit designed for a specific DoD application.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Description: The Ensured Communication Link for Identification Friend or Foe (ECLIFF) program aims to provide communication links for Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capabilities with a reduced radio frequency (RF) signature, improved performance against jamming and interference, and a compact form factor. ECLIFF will address the challenge of identifying friendly assets and personnel in congested electromagnetic environments and in environments where there is a strong penalty for stray radio emissions. The current IFF system operates with a limited instantaneous RF bandwidth (IBW), which makes hiding signals from adversaries difficult and leaves the system vulnerable to jamming and interference. ECLIFF will explore alternative technologies to enable ~25 times greater IBW. These technologies should also enable IFF systems to use alternate channels at higher frequency bands. The resulting ECLIFF system could employ DARPA-developed technologies such as high-speed data converters, heterogeneous integration, and envelope-tracking transmitter technology. The novel combination of these technologies in the final ECLIFF system will be critical for dramatic size, weight, power, and cost reduction and performance improvements. The miniaturization realized with the ECLIFF platform should make the capability useful for both large platforms and portable applications such as unmanned air vehicle, man-portable, and even hand-held devices. The ECLIFF program will culminate with a demonstration of the technology in a relevant environment, lowering the risk for transition to a fielded system. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete system trade study for IFF solution. - Begin initial design of integrated circuit hardware to implement ECLIFF solution. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The increase in develop a large-scale, interactive, emulated radiofrequency (RF) environment, providing DoD with the much needed capability to cost-effectively evaluate adaptive, intelligent, and spatially distributed next-generation RF systems. Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems. Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap. Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data. To overcome these limitations, DRBE will leverage advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems. DRBE will pursue three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling. The resulting test environment should allow plug-and-play connections- - 8.000 Volume 1 - 158UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-02 / BEYOND B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test. Multi-system exercises could then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations, with RF systems employing war reserve modes forbidden during open-air testing. DRBE should therefore serve to develop CONOPS, inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Conduct architecture scaling analysis to define a solution supporting hundreds of RF systems. - Demonstrate basic physical building blocks that will be able to handle the immense throughput expected.

Title: Aircraft and Vehicle IntegrAted Team (AVIATE) Description: The Aircraft and Vehicle IntegrAted Team (AVIATE) program will design, develop and demonstrate an advanced capability Unmanned Air System (UAS) that is an organic extension of tactical ground vehicles. Current fielded UAS systems require significant infrastructure and manpower to launch and recover, exposing friendly troops to threats while stationary. As a result, small units suffer degraded situational awareness with no overhead capability or delays in air support. A UAS that is an integrated subsystem of a ground vehicle with features to autonomously land, attach, stow, detach, and take-off from its parent ground vehicle while it is on the move would enable on-demand capabilities and drastically improved protection. Ground vehicles could perform traditional UAS missions such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and fires support, as well as unique missions such as electronic attack, sensor emplacement, infrastructure attack, and active protection without having to rely on brigade and theater level assets. This effort will explore design interfaces between the air and ground vehicle, attributes to allow for launch and recovery on the move, and design considerations to enable operations in contested environments. The Army, Navy and Marines are all seeking UAS designs to meet their expeditionary needs and provide runway independence.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets. Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities. Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; unique manufacturing or assembly processes, and precision control of multi-payload systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY Title: Precise Robust for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical- grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems. Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion. This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts Project 183UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 11 R-1 Line #55Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B.

FY 2019 Plans: - Complete development and characterization of MEMS-based, navigation-grade, integrated IMU meeting program-defined SWaP and performance metrics, excluding environmental requirements and shock survival. - Deliver two MEMS-based, navigation-grade, integrated IMU prototypes for government evaluation. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 decrease reflects a transition from development to completion and characterization of IMU prototypes. Title: Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) Description: The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates. These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame. Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements. Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame. The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs. Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information. The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band. By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs should enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army. FY 2018 Plans: - Complete mapping multi-function processing algorithms to the ROIC layer using custom software tools. - Begin development of the 2nd generation (Gen-2) designs. - Complete 3-D integration of the ReImagine Gen-1 ROIC.15.790 22.173 24.000 Volume 1 - 184UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 11 R-1 Line #55Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects minor program repricing. Title: Rapid Array Development (RAD) Description: The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program seeks to leverage recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for electromagnetic (EM) arrays. EM arrays, which enable communications, radar and electronic warfare (EW), are currently high performance but slow and costly to create. In contrast, they must evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. However, the available design and test infrastructure is not flexible enough to support testing and fielding new EM array algorithms across a wide variety of military platforms. Furthermore, EM software and hardware are often developed in separate silos; as a result, implementing new EM applications in hardware tends to require a lengthy and expensive development process with extended cycles of iteration between the two areas. RAD will therefore focus on three core areas: (1) making ultra-flexible testbeds for existing and future EM arrays accessible to the DoD community; (2) reducing the complexity of phased array hardware through high level abstraction; and (3) speeding up EM system development time through hardware/ software co-design. In light of changing requirements, the resulting technologies would also enable DoD greater reuse of its available hardware resources while minimizing the need to modify specialized EM systems, leading to improved and simplified upgrade cycles. Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the services through a series of demonstrations proving the radically shorter time scale of development. FY 2018 Plans: - Initiate development of a compute engine to optimize the implementation of EM algorithms on a system of heterogeneous processors. - Initiate development of cloud-based applications to facilitate rapid re-configuration of an array platform without having to modify existing hardware.- 12.000 17.799 Volume 1 - 185UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 11 R-1 Line #55Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B.

FY 2019 Plans: - Develop a flexible array testbed that will be the common hardware platform for an applications development environment. - Develop a processing platform capable of executing EM algorithms, array configuration, data flow and end-user interactions. - Continue development of cloud-based applications to facilitate rapid re-configuration of an array platform without having to modify existing hardware. - Initiate plans for a testbed installation at a military base or radar test range. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects the shift from exploring and initiating development to developing RAD software and the testbed environment. Title: Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) Collaborative Unmanned (RF CLOUDS) The Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) program will develop a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming. Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor. We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35. One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile. This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery and when transmitting, multiple beams can be used to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously. This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages. To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block. The program will be executed in two primary technical areas. First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems. Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system. FY 2018 Plans: - Begin preliminary design review.- 10.000 - Volume 1 - 186UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 11 R-1 Line #55Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 - Begin development of a low-power, 16-element, element-level digital phased array at millimeter wave frequencies advanced CMOS. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The decrease in FY 2019 reflects the program moving to Project MT-16. Title: Ultra-Compact Laser-Integrated Diodes (EUCLID) program aims to significantly reduce the size of laser diode pump modules (DPMs) while increasing their electrical-to-optical efficiency. DPMs are a critical component of fiber-laser array weapons systems, which combine light from many lower-power lasers to engage targets at tactically-relevant distances. Commercial DPMs, which cater to the laser manufacturing industry, feature large cooling systems and are too cumbersome for integration into many small DoD platforms. EUCLID plans to leverage advances in thermal management components to design, build, test, and demonstrate densely packageable, prototype DPMs that are less than half the size of their commercial counterparts. The program will also pursue improved optical components that can more efficiently focus light from individual laser diodes. The resulting EUCLID DPMs are intended to be available for procurement and integration into ultra-low size, weight, and power fiber-laser array weapons systems, enabling integration into a variety of Air Force, Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency platforms. FY 2018 Plans: - Complete critical design of a >650 Watt, >60% efficiency DPM with less than 0.31 cm3/Watt and 0.31 grams/Watt, including integrated thermal management and improved optical designs. - Model and simulate thermal management systems to demonstrate laser diode operation at a designated temperature, given appropriate coolant temperature, flow rate, and pressure drop values. - Model optical designs to demonstrate that coupling efficiency from the laser diode bars to the delivery fiber is within the overall system's electrical-to-optical efficiency budget. FY 2019 Plans: - Build and test prototype DPMs which produce >4 kW of optical power and >58% efficiency and are suitable for powering a coherently combinable fiber laser amplifier assembly. - Generate detailed designs of a compact, packaged 4 kW diode pump assembly based on the prototype DPMs.- 5.000 5.000 Title: Endurance Description: The Endurance program aims to develop laser technology to protect airborne platforms from emerging and legacy electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) guided surface-to-air missiles. Endurance is planned to have an open architecture, granting the flexibility to integrate different subsystems with varying capabilities. Endurance is an early application of technology developed16.000 10.000 - Volume 1 - 187UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 11 R-1 Line #55Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 through DARPA's Excalibur program and is planned to transition to the Services. The advanced technology component of the program will focus on developing and field testing various subsystems for laser beam generation, command and control, threat missile warning, target acquisition and tracking, beam control, energy storage and delivery, and thermal management. It will also develop subsystem interfaces and integrate the components into a packaged system for field testing. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Services. FY 2018 Plans: - Assess brassboard system performance in live-fire testing. - Perform environmental testing to assess performance under stressing vibrational and temperature conditions. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 decrease reflects program completion and planned transition to the Services. Title: FLASH - Scaling Fiber Arrays at Near Perfect Beam Quality Description: The FLASH program demonstrated an ultra-low-size, weight, and power (SWaP) high energy laser system suitable for integration onto a range of military platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 4th and 5th generation aircraft. With its modular, scalable architecture, future systems could be built with output power levels in the hundreds of kilowatts, enabling a broad set of offensive mission capabilities, many of which are not possible with current technology. To accomplish its program goals, FLASH pursued two major thrusts. First, FLASH greatly reduced the size and weight of high-power fiber laser amplifiers, increased their power efficiency and improve their resistance to shock, vibration and acoustic stresses found on military platforms. Second, FLASH fabricated an array of these amplifiers and integrated them into a transportable system with advanced battery power, thermal management and coherent-beam combination sub-systems. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy, Army and Missile Defense Agency.3.500 - - Title: Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) Description: The Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program developed the design and manufacturing capabilities required to seamlessly integrate various semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems, photonic (light- manipulating) devices and thermal management structures into true systems-on-a-chip (SOC). This capability enabled dramatic size, weight and volume reductions and higher performance for DoD electronic warfare, communications and radar systems. Historically, chip designers have had to decide between the availability, development and low cost of silicon circuits or the high performance of compound semiconductor (CS) materials. DAHI, however, built on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone. DAHI's advanced technology development effort focused on establishing a technologically mature manufacturing path for integrating a wide array of materials and devices, including CS, on a common substrate.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies Project is a continuation of DARPA's basic and applied research in this area and will support activities in large scale co-development with leading industry players to enable and accelerate transformative computing interactions with industry. Additionally, funding under this project is intended to secure the design and capture of advanced intellectual property (IP) and architectures, IP sharing and re-use, and limited access to state-of-the-art (SOTA) and state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries for microelectronics fabrication Programs in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Beyond Scaling - Access Description: The Beyond Scaling - Access program will demonstrate the design and fabrication of advanced electronics through collaborations with leading industry players. Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. In some cases, the inability to place orders in volume has created a lack of access to advanced technology nodes entirely. To address this, the DoD must participate in more industry partnerships that not only leverage investments in the commercial industry but also provide access to SOTA facilities in the U.S. This program will build on existing relationships and forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include securing advanced IP and electronics architectures, IP sharing and re-use, and limited access to SOTA and SOTP foundries for microelectronics fabrication runs. FY 2019 Plans: - Identify and secure access to SOTA commercial IP for use in DoD designs. - Demonstrate IP sharing and reuse of IP across various DoD and commercial designs. - Establish SOTA and SOTP microelectronics fabrication runs for DoD designs at leading-edge commercial foundries.

Title: Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) Description: Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters/features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations. The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating. Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission. There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network. The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales. Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability. The Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments. The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2018 Plans: - Continue development and integrate initial instantiation of real-time optimization algorithms in radio hardware. - Continue development and integration of mission-based network architecture control and information delivery mechanisms. - Conduct hardware-in-the-loop test of integrated system with instantiations of inter-network coordination, mission-based control, PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Title: Spectrum Efficiency and Access Description: The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications. The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked data/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate. The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor/radar bands. The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint. The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity. The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity. Technology from this program will be made available to the Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA). FY 2018 Plans: - Develop advanced radio frequency (RF) waveform and associated signal processing technology. - Implement transition plans with identified Navy, Army, and MDA stakeholders. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate spectrum maneuver command and control concepts. - Commence design of a system capable of dynamically controlling radio frequency signatures while maintaining high accuracy target tracking.

Title: 100 Gb/s RF Backbone Description: The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms. The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/ s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces. DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system has broken the 10 Gb/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb/s capacity. Furthermore, the hybrid optical/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms. Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency, but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers. This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current ORCA system. The 100 Gb/s RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services. FY 2018 Plans: - Integrate prototype onto test aircraft and conduct air-to-ground testing. - Complete air-to-ground testing and conduct flight demonstration to Services. - Make technologies from the 100 Gb/s RF Backbone system available for transition to the Services, and specifically to the Air Force Common Data Link project. - Develop applications of advanced modulation and spatial multiplexing to make data links more resilient to threats in addition to providing high data rate. FY 2019 Plans: - Conduct joint flight demonstrations with Services. - Engage in targeted design activity for specific applications.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 a global scale requires the development of technologies and systems that provide common access points to commercial data, computational power to preprocess data and make it exploitable by analytical tools, and new models supporting sensing and analytics as services including sharing of tools and results between individuals and consortiums. GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains, building upon the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) coalition warfighter information sharing program, also in this Program Element. By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray-zone activities. It will do so by augmenting commercial capabilities with defense assets, not vice versa, and thereby improve speed, agility, and scalability. Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies to meet their needs for global situational awareness. FY 2018 Plans: - Analyze and evaluate potential platforms and algorithms. - Design, prototype, and experiment with software infrastructure to use as a tool to exploit multiple sources and modalities. FY 2019 Plans: - Analyze computational architectures and frameworks for GCA analytics services at global scale. - Demonstrate the ability of the software infrastructure to support global scale analytics on relevant problem sets. - Demonstrate gray-zone indicators and warnings for high-impact global events such as droughts, crop failures, and illegal fishing. - Experiment with approaches for offering analytics services for use by DoD users and others. FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects scale up and demonstration of the GCA infrastructure and analytics. Title: Network Universal Persistence (Network UP) Description: Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link. This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades. In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established. During these network outages, data transmission is not possible. Building on technologies explored in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this PE, the Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments. Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost. The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links. The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless- - 11.495 Volume 1 - 199UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Protected Forward Communications (PFC) Description: The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons. These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command. The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries. This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links. The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication system to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation. PFC builds on technology developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this Program Element. PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC). The PFC program will transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Initiate PFC conceptual development. - Start algorithm design for implementation and control of all three communication techniques. - Begin concept validation through modeling and simulation. - Establish readiness of constituent link technologies for all three communication techniques. - Conduct simulation and modeling of systems in representative operating environments to assess resistance to geolocation and jamming.

Title: Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) Description: The Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program will seek to address communications problems anticipated in networked airborne systems in the mid-21st century. Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems will strain the size of networks that our current communications technology can support in the contested environment. As adversary capabilities advance, the DoD will need new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability. As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addresses these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, to develop heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems. Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols will be developed. Second, to create a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that draws from commercial communication architectures. The defense contractor community can build specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture. Finally, C2E will create a government controlled development environment to allow rapid refresh of communications technology and allow third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies. Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services. FY 2018 Plans: - Complete integration and testing of the Ruggedized Flight System radio. - Demonstrate airborne tactical network waveform interoperability on the C2E Ruggedized Flight System to FY 2019 Statement: The FY 1.159 - Title: Advanced RF Mapping Description: One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the radio frequency (RF) environment, enabling reliable and assured communications, as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their situational awareness, understanding, or response. Current approaches are emitter- based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter. As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action. To address these Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) challenges, the Advanced RF Mapping program developed and demonstrated new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection. This approach took advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the7.218 - - Volume 1 - 201UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 battlefield. To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program developed new algorithms that map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices. The Advanced RF Mapping program also developed approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks. The Advanced RF Mapping program enabled both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments. Advanced RF Mapping technology transitioned to the Services. Title: Wireless Network Defense Description: A highly networked and enabled force increases efficiency, effectiveness, and safety by making relevant information available when it is needed and at the appropriate location (person/platform/system). Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict. As part of the Advanced Networks technologies effort, the Wireless Network Defense program increased wireless network capacity and reliability for tactical users, with the ultimate vision of making high quality data services pervasive throughout the DoD. The primary focus was mitigation of advanced threats particular to the security of wireless networks. The program leveraged the capabilities of the dynamic network to identify sources of misinformation, whether malicious or due to poor configuration, across the functional components of the complex system, and mitigated the corresponding effects. Technologies developed under this program transitioned to the Services.3.000 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 62.677 55.928 106.316 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) Description: The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments. Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to properly leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities. The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact. In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems. The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture. These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration. Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.

Title: Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) Description: Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment. To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through20.350 17.772 15.475 Volume 1 - 208UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 18 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / NET-01 / B. Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 increased utilization and exploitation of synergies. The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification, as well as tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) techniques. During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent. The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes. The RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy. FY 2018 Plans: - Develop a fully integrated software system prototype to demonstrate a distributed concept of operations. - Conduct a series of capability and system-level assessments in conjunction with potential transition partners in preparation for 2019 Air Force experimentation. - Refine models of ISR and counter-ISR capabilities based on Navy guidance following Pacific Fleet (USPACFLT) experiments. - Refine decision aid algorithms and prototype implementations based on Navy guidance following USPACFLT experiments and guidance from Navy transition program of record. - Develop use cases, concepts of operations, and requirements for extension of RSPACE algorithms to the multi-domain (air, space, and cyber) and system of systems command and control problem. - Extend distributed air warfare planning tools to provide land warfighters with targeting, situation awareness, and terrain knowledge. FY 2019 Plans: - Conduct one or more live-virtual, simulation-based tests in conjunction with a scheduled live Air Force experiment to facilitate transition to the Air Force. - Integrate prototype software with external systems and scale to large, high operational tempo scenarios. - Enhance models and user support interfaces in preparation for transition to operational testing by the Navy. - Commence development of market-based resource prioritization technology.

Programs in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 near-peer adversary force in a contested environment. SESU-developed capabilities will provide the small unit with improved awareness of enemy force composition, disposition, and intent. It will also provide the means to deter escalation of threat, and, if deterrence fails, the ability to destroy enemy combat systems. The goal of the fight will be to push enemy decision makers beyond loss tolerance before they achieve operational objectives. Technologies to accomplish this include command, control, & communications (C3) that operate in a contested environment and interoperate with host-nation forces; distributed sensing, including the ability to leverage indigenous information sources; and hybrid effects that include a mix of kinetic, non-kinetic, and information operations capabilities. A major thrust within the SESU program will be systems architecture and technology to enable manned-unmanned teaming with a focus on C3 and autonomy of the unmanned platforms. SESU technologies will be integrated using system-of-systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, also budgeted in this Program Element/Project. A Campaign of Learning (CoL) will be conducted in partnership with the Army, and technologies produced by this program will be transitioned to the Services. FY 2018 Plans: - Begin development of system-of-systems architecture that supports rapid and adaptive kill-web composition. - Begin development of baseline mission scenarios and define SESU components. - Develop architectures for autonomous drones to provide land warfighters with targeting, situation awareness, and terrain knowledge. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate initial technologies in a simulated environment. - Develop C3 and situation understanding technologies. - Develop plan for live field experimentation.

PROTEUS will provide the tools and automation to enable small tactical units to compose force packages optimized to specific urban combat objectives and challenges. These tools will support planning and force composition for all missions relevant to the urban environment: command & control, fires, maneuver, logistics, intelligence, force protection, and medical. PROTEUS will be adaptive to an inherently dynamic and fluid environment that will extend to the social complexity of urban combat as well as kinetic warfighting.

Title: Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) Description: Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future. The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location. ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture. The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration. The ReACT system will sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest. The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy. FY 2018 Plans: - Continue broadband estimation analysis and algorithm development for accomplishment of program metrics. - Integrate node capabilities, hardware, and externally mounted apertures for a dynamic airborne demonstration on multiple aircraft. - Operate airborne array at suitable test facility with real world scenario/environment.9.615 5.584 - Volume 1 - 211UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 18 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / NET-01 / B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The objective of the Maritime Systems project is to identify, develop, and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships, and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them, and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) Description: The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program seeks to identify and implement architectures consisting of novel combinations of manned and unmanned systems to execute long-range kill chains and develop a robust \"kill web\" against submarines and ships over large contested maritime areas. By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability. The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness. The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.

Title: Mobile Offboard Command, Control and Attack (MOCCA) Description: The Mobile Offboard Command, Control and Attack (MOCCA) program seeks to counter the fourth generation submarine signature quieting technology that has significantly degraded passive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) sonar detection range and targeting performance. The MOCCA program will nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems. The off-board UUV sonar projector will operate, under positive control, at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links. The program seeks to achieve breakthrough capability for long-range submarine detection and precision target tracking. The program will develop compact, high output acoustic transducers and novel low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication signaling. In addition, the MOCCA system will be integrated into submarine onboard sonar and weapons control systems. This program will transition to the Navy.

Title: Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) Description: The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in ocean basins over extended periods of time. Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals. At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk. Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time. The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin. A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location. By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus trilaterate its position. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy. FY 2018 Plans: - Complete development of user equipment. - Continue development of the acoustic propagation models and signal waveforms. - Complete development of user equipment ocean models to support real-time ranging. - Demonstrate interference mitigation and anti-spoof capabilities. - Demonstrate real-time undersea positioning with an AUV tracking multiple acoustic sources.

Title: Tactical Undersea Network Architecture Description: Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment. This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems. Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair. These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems. The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment technologies. The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes. The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies. The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity. Program technologies will transition to the Navy.

Title: Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) Description: The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program will provide the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment. The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors will have a transformative impact on a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning. For all of these applications, coherent sensor gain is currently achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays. Based on technologies explored in the Mobile Offboard C2 and Attack (MOCCA) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, the TEAC program will create the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively and semi-autonomously to focus energy undersea. This concept would provide an extensible, affordable, and flexible method to harness the rapid development of undersea vehicles, ocean energy sources, and new acoustic source technologies. Technologies developed under this program are intended to transition to the Navy.

Ocean of Things builds upon advances made in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, which is also in this Program Element. Ocean of Things will develop large numbers of heterogeneous sensing and effects platforms to cover large ocean areas. These platforms will leverage satellite communications to populate a large data repository with sensor outputs for shared processing. Ocean of Things will apply advanced analysis techniques to the stored data to synthesize and discover new signals and behaviors in the ocean environment. The program will research the spatio-temporal composability of sensors and develop applications for distributed platform behavior using an internet of things architecture deployed across the world's oceans. Further research will examine additional platform capabilities and system impacts of various communication rates and platform behaviors. The Ocean of Things program will improve ocean awareness and provide access to areas not covered by existing platforms. Technologies developed in Ocean of Things will transition to the Navy.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 decrease reflects program completion and transition of technologies from this program to the Navy. Title: Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) Description: The goal of the Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program is to dramatically improve U.S. Navy submarine superiority. HyDem will apply breakthroughs in materials and material system technologies, and multi- disciplinary design methods to a Virginia Class submarine propulsor, a critical component in submarine performance. The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise. Submarines could exploit expanded areas that were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions. The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class submarine. The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials. It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement submarines, and back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class submarines. Technology developed under this program is transitioning to the Navy.

Title: Blue Wolf Description: Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise. Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water. Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance). Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems. However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications. The Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems. Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment. The program will leverage Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program will transition to the Navy. FY 2018 Plans: - Complete battery module and system safety testing and analysis. - Complete test vehicle system integration and checkouts. - Complete demonstration vehicle system integration. - Conduct demonstration vehicle testing from barge in controlled area. - Complete system safety approval for at sea testing. - Transition to the Navy.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Aerial Dragnet Description: Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets. Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other movers. Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use. Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms. The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows an Aerial Dragnet to rapidly detect, track, and classify UAS incursions, thus enabling multiple defeat options. This program focuses on the development of payloads, to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation. The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city- sized areas. Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army and Marines with particular relevance to missions in the EUCOM and CENTCOM Area of Responsibilities (AORs). FY 2018 Plans: - Conduct engineering subsystem tests to assess small UAS detection performance in an instrumented urban test area. - Complete development of initial hardware sensor payloads. - Evaluate software for non-line-of-sight UAS tracking 18.230 Volume 1 - 225UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 15 R-1 Line #58Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-01 / SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Technology Description: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data. Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and static due to pre-programmed target lists and operating mode, limiting mission execution capabilities. Extending ATR Technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time consuming. The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR Technology. The program will focus on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR technology; (2) recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems. ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services. FY 2018 Plans: - Continue to improve ATR algorithm performance, focusing on reducing processing times and system size and power requirements. - Develop flightworthy prototype, low-power ATR processing hardware that executes the ATR algorithm in real-time. - Demonstrate Open Mission System (OMS) enabled ATR operation in tactical radar System Integration Laboratory (SIL). - Prepare for a flight demonstration of ATR algorithms running on an airborne platform. - Conduct flight verification of ATR hardware and software and perform flight demonstration of ATR algorithms operating on an airborne platform.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Description: The Seeker Cost Transformation (SECTR) program will develop novel weapon terminal sensing and guidance technologies and systems, for air-launched and air-delivered weapons, that can: (1) find and acquire fixed and moving targets with only minimal external support; (2) achieve high navigation accuracy in a GPS-denied environment; and (3) have very small size and weight, and potentially low cost. The development objectives are technologies and systems with small Size, Weight and Power (SWaP), low recurring cost, applicability to a wide range of weapons and missions such as small unit operations, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and time-sensitive targets. The technical approach for the sensing/ processing hardware is to use both passive electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture, such as the architecture developed in DARPA's Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors (ADAPT) program. The program will also develop a Government-owned open architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software). The technical approach to target recognition will start from \"deep learning\" and 2D/3D machine vision algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.

Title: Dynamically Composed RF Systems Description: Dominance of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum is critical to successful U.S. military operations. Radar systems, Electronic Warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time consuming to build and integrate onto platforms. The Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems. This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner. This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance14.450 20.689 12.080 Volume 1 - 231UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 15 R-1 Line #58Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 decrease reflects program evolution from technology maturation to specific integrated system design. Title: Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) Description: Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J aircraft in support of ground forces. Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors. The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors. Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces. The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program will develop a real-time spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging sensor that provides imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function. Technology from this program is anticipated to transition to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).4.500 3.300 3.150 Volume 1 - 232UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 15 R-1 Line #58Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

Building on technologies explored under the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program, also in this Program Element/Project, the objective of ASTRAL is to provide a factor of at least 1000 times improvement over current signal awareness processing speed over broad spectral coverage. The program will use technology that supports a development path leading to a mobile, tactical capability. The development objectives of the ASTRAL program are to (1) develop a hybrid processor that provides real-time processing of the most challenging Low-Probability-of-Intercept (LPI) threat signals across a wide bandwidth, and (2) identify exploitation algorithms for military applications that are well-suited to this type of hybrid processor. Several strategic and tactical spectrum awareness applications addressed include (a) real-time exploitation of optical communications, (b) city-wide wireless device geo-location, (c) broadband LPI radar warning, and (d) theater-wide spread-spectrum LPI radio geo-location.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Description: The 3DNow program aims to develop technologies that let warfighters rapidly access tactical 3D situational awareness data within a secure government owned framework built on a commercial technology base. Building on ideas explored in the System of Systems Enhanced Small Units (SESU) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), 3DNow will leverage the latest trends in image processing algorithms, embedded systems, portable devices, and assured separation kernel software to build an interface layer that securely connects the latest commercial hardware to the rest of the military infrastructure. In order to mature and demonstrate the concept, 3DNow will conduct several development cycles focused on supporting tactical level urban warfare.

Title: Cognitive Maneuver Description: The Cognitive Maneuver program will build decision aids for gray zone scenarios, where adversaries attempt to manipulate a U.S.-allied nation through the use of both kinetic and non-kinetic means. Based on research performed under the Resilient Synchronized Planning & Assessment Contested Environment (RSPACE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), the purpose of the Cognitive Maneuver program is to reduce ambiguity and reveal intent of gray zone actors who use techniques such as misinformation and intimidation to destabilize host nations and possibly produce advantageous conditions for military engagements. The tools produced by Cognitive Maneuver will automate gray zone information operations, and help U.S. Forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, Cognitive Maneuver will employ active sensing, and recommend actions U.S. forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, Cognitive Maneuver will build and demonstrate tools to 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments. Cognitive Maneuver will transition to the Services.- - 11.036 Volume 1 - 234UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 15 R-1 Line #58Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

FY 2018 to FY 2019 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2019 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) Description: The Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program will pursue new algorithms for rapidly protecting DoD systems against new or unknown radar-based threats. Protecting these systems currently relies on uniquely identifying an enemy radar and applying an appropriate, pre-programmed Electronic Countermeasure (ECM), which can take years to develop. The emergence of digitally-programmed radars that exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics, however, has made this approach to countering radar-based threats increasingly challenging. Developing new ECM over several years is no longer sufficient. ARC will therefore pursue new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures. Using techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system and then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy. The program is planned for transition to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne electronic warfare systems. FY 2018 Plans: - Conduct testing of ARC against advanced, complex radar signals in static and open-air testing environments. - Deliver ARC technology to Service transition partners for inclusion into identified airborne platforms.

The goal of this program was to demonstrate a new imaging radar architecture using an electronically scanned sub-reflector to produce a more readily available, cost-effective sensor solution that does not require platform or target motion. Key system attributes included: (1) high-resolution 3D imaging for enhanced identification and targeting, independent of platform or target motion; (2) video frame rates to provide well-focused images even when there is platform or target motion; (3) beam steer with a single transmit/receive chain to reduce system complexity resulting in lower cost, power, and weight; and (4) millimeter-wave (mmW)/terahertz (THz) electronic5.593 - - Volume 1 - 235UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 15 R-1 Line #58Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 component advancements from other DARPA programs for transmit and receive functions. This program resulted in a more readily available, cost-effective imaging radar technology that works in concert with a wide area surveillance system to provide target identification at video frame rates in all conditions where existing sensors do not work. Candidate military applications include efficient terminal seekers, imaging systems for defense of shipping in ports and littoral environments, base perimeter monitoring, and screening of personnel passing through access control points. Technology developed under this program transitioned to the Air Multifunction RF (MFRF) program enabled U.S. rotary wing aircraft forces to fight effectively in all forms of severely Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) when our adversaries cannot. The program went beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover/taxi, in route navigation, lethality, and survivability. Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program sought to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions. This reduced the overall Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden. The program approach included: (1) development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases; (2) development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWaP-C; and (3) implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs, and ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications. Technology developed under this program transitioned to the Army.3.540 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 134.174 107.813 86.610 C.
