Smith2, (PCOS) is a prevalent women 's health condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological manifestations. Weight loss can improve these symptoms and is a key goal; however, many women find this difficult to achieve. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical treatment that involves insertion of very fine metal needles into specific areas of the body and has been shown to be efficacious for weight loss in non-PCOS populations. However, few studies have been conducted in women with PCOS. A variant of acupuncture, auricular electro-acupuncture (AEA), may have beneficial effects on sympathetic tone, which is associated with insulin resistance, obesity and PCOS.

Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-020-00591-4(Continued from previous page) Methods: This prospective three-arm open label parallel randomised controlled trial will assess feasibility and acceptability of acupuncture and/or AEA for weight loss in women with PCOS. We will enrol 39 women from the community aged between 18 and 45 years, with physician diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria: body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m2. Women will be randomly allocated to receive one of three treatments for 12 weeks duration: body electro-acupuncture + lifestyle interventions, AEA + lifestyle interventions, or lifestyle interventions alone. The lifestyle intervention in this study is telephone-based health coaching (between 4 and 13 phone calls, depending on individual need), provided by the Get Healthy Service. Primary outcomes of the study are feasibility and acceptability of trial methods as determined by recruitment and retention rates, adherence, acceptability, credibility, and safety. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric (body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference), metabolic (glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity obtained from a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test with area under the curve insulin calculated using the trapezoid rule), reproductive (androgen levels, menstrual cyclicity, clinical hyperandrogenism using the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system), autonomic (heart rate variability, blood pressure), lifestyle (physical activity levels, diet quality, weight self-efficacy), quality of life, and psychological (depression and anxiety symptoms, internal health locus of control). Discussion: This study addresses the feasibility and acceptability of novel interventions to treat overweight/obesity in PCOS. Study findings have the potential to generate a new understanding of the role of acupuncture and auricular acupuncture in weight management. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, 8/6/18 ACTRN12618000975291 Keywords: ovary syndrome, PCOS, acupuncture, Heart rate variability, Insulin resistance Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 13% of women and can have significant reproductive, metabolic, and psychological manifestations [ 1,2]. Women with PCOS are more likely to be obese/overweight than age- matched controls, and excess weight worsens the fea- tures of PCOS [ 3]. Weight loss is a key goal in PCOS, and lifestyle management techniques (diet, exercise, and/ or behavioural interventions) targeted at weight loss are first-line approaches in overweight/obese women as even modest weight loss improves reproductive and metabolic outcomes [ 4]. Current evidence-based guidelines on PCOS recommend that obese women embark on 3 -6 months of lifestyle management for weight loss prior to considering assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, adherence is generally low [ 5,6], and achiev- ing adequate weight loss remains a significant challenge [4,7]. In non-PCOS populations, acupuncture, in particular auricular acupuncture and electro-acupuncture, is more efficacious than sham for reducing body mass index (BMI) (mean difference [MD] 0.47 kg/m2) as well as body fat mass (MD 0.66 kg), waist circumference (MD 2.02 cm) and hip circumference (MD 2.74 cm) [ 8]. These effects are mediated through multiple responses including appetite suppression [ 9,10], modulation of leptin and ghrelin [ 11-13], and improved insulin sensi- tivity [ 14-19]. Further, acupuncture may alleviate co- morbid anxiety symptoms in people with obesity [ 11,20, 21]. Effects also appear to be sustained after end oftreatment [ 22]. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in China on women with PCOS indicate that acupuncture and metformin is superior to metformin alone in women with PCOS for reducing BMI [ 23]. One study reported a mean difference of 0.97 kg/m2(95% CI 1.51, 0.43) for acupuncture and metformin compared to metformin alone [ 24]. A range of factors may contribute to increased BMI in PCOS, including abnormalities in energy homeostasis [3]. Insulin resistance (IR) has been demonstrated to be increased in women with PCOS compared to BMI- matched controls and is exacerbated by increased BMI [25,26]. Increased sympathetic tone is an associated fac- tor of IR [ 27] and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in PCOS [ 28]. In rats with steroid- induced cycling [ re- duced muscle sympathetic nerve activity in PCOS women in one trial [ 27]. Our qualitative work indicates high levels of acceptance of acupuncture as a possible adjunct to lifestyle interventions for weight loss [ 30]. A variant of acupuncture is auricular electro- acupuncture (AEA). Evidence suggests that AEA stimu- lates branch of the vagus nerve which in- creases parasympathetic tone [ 31], deactivates the sympathetic nervous system [ 31], and suppresses appe- tite [ 9]. Given that acupuncture is a relatively safe treatment [32-34] with preliminary evidence suggesting it may beEeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 2 of 12beneficial for weight loss in PCOS when used as an ad- junct, rigorous clinical research in this area is warranted. The primary objective of this study is to assess feasibility and acceptability of trial procedures for a randomised controlled trial comparing body acupuncture, AEA, and lifestyle interventions alone for weight loss in women with PCOS. Secondary objectives are to [ 1] determine an effect size for body electro-acupuncture or AEA and life- style interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for change in body weight for limited efficacy testing and to inform future sample size calculations and [ 2] explore the impact of body electro-acupuncture and auricular electro-acupuncture on sympathetic tone and insulin re- sistance. The primary outcome for a subsequent phase IIb trial will be change in weight in kilogrammes. Methods/design This is a prospective three-arm open-label parallel ran- domised controlled trial taking place over a 12-week intervention period. Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee, Western Sydney University, H11973 (27 February 2017). The trial was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ACTRN12618000975291, on 08 June 2018. The study protocol (version 12, 28 August 19) (see Additional file 1) has been designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines [ 35] and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The trial commenced recruiting in April 2019 and enrolled the first participant on 27 May 2019. Recruitment, setting, and informed consent Women living in Sydney, Australia, will be recruited via advertising through consumer organisations, social media, University staff and student networks, and fertil- ity and specialty PCOS clinics. To reduce selection bias, we will attempt to recruit from a wide variety of sources targeting the general population. Screening according to eligibility criteria is initially done through an online sur- vey and confirmed at the baseline visit where written in- formed consent will be provided. Participants attend for body acupuncture and AEA treatment at private acu- puncture clinics. Eligibility criteria The inclusion criteria are as follows: women who are aged between 18 and 45, with physician diagnosis of PCOS within the previous 5 years according to the 2003 Rotterdam Criteria [ 36]; BMI 25 kg/m2and < 40kg/m2; no diagnosis of other endocrine disorders; not on the following medications in the 3 months preceding enrol- ment: metformin or other medications affecting insulin and glucose metabolism, hormonal contraceptives or hormonal treatments for PCOS/assisted reproductive techniques including gonadotropins and the oralcontraceptive pill or hormonal intrauterine device, pharmaceutical or complementary (including nutri- tional/herbal) treatments for weight loss. Exclusion criteria include: /C15Planning to conceive within the next 3 months; /C15Not willing to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study; /C15Currently pregnant or breastfeeding; /C15Less than 6 weeks postpartum; /C15Breastfeeding within the previous 6 weeks; /C15Needle acupuncture in the previous 3 weeks; /C15Unable and blinding Women are randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either body acupuncture and lifestyle intervention, AEA and lifestyle intervention, or lifestyle intervention alone. Ran- domisation was performed in permuted blocks. The ran- domisation sequence was created using a computer programme ( www.sealedenvelope.com ) by a researcher external to the research team. This researcher will hold the randomisation sequence and created a series of 39 consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes that contain the ID number and allocation. The research as- sistant allocates participants by selecting the next con- secutively number sealed opaque envelope that contains the allocation. Once the participant has had eligibility confirmed and has provided written informed consent, she is enrolled and given the next consecutive random- isation ID number, and the research assistant will open the numbered envelope to reveal the allocation. Before opening the envelope, the research assistant writes the participant 's name on the envelope and the date and signs the envelope as a record of randomisation. Investi- gators (outcome assessors and investigators involved in statistical analysis) are blinded to treatment allocation, treating acupuncturists and participants are not. Treatment schedule Body acupuncture Chinese medicine needle acupuncture will be delivered in a semi-pragmatic setting, for a total of 11 treatments of acupuncture over 12 weeks (twice a week for the first 2 weeks, weekly for 4 weeks, then fortnightly for 3 treat- ments). A minimum of six study acupuncturists, located across different areas of metropolitan Sydney, have been chosen to administer the treatments. They have a bache- lor's degree in Chinese Medicine, have five or more years of clinical experience, and are registered asEeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 3 of 12Chinese medicine practitioners (acupuncture) with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Study acupuncturists receive hands-on train- ing from CE, an experienced acupuncture researcher, and registered acupuncturist. Refresher training is pro- vided if there has been a break of 2 months or more in between administering the trial interventions to partici- pants, and training is complemented by a detailed practi- tioner manual. Acupuncturists are to perform Chinese medicine diag- nosis based on history and examination as per usual clinical practice. The acupuncture point protocol is a semi-fixed protocol which delivers a traditionally-based style of acupuncture where treatment is designed on the basis of a traditional Chinese Medicine clinical assess- ment. In choosing the acupuncture prescription, study acupuncturists are given the following instructions: /C15Treatment of obesity/overweight is the primary objective of the acupuncture treatment /C15At least six acupuncture points must be chosen from a list of 17 core acupuncture points that will be provided to the practitioner. These points are chosen from the traditional points that are recommended for treatment of syndromes that are related to obesity and PCOS (based on literature and textbook review) and from the points used in previous acupuncture for obesity and PCOS trials [31,37]. /C15Points on the chest or back must be avoided to avoid risk of pneumothorax. A minimum of ten acupuncture needles will be inserted per session. The core acupuncture points to be used location of the points and the Chin- ese medicine rationale for use of the point [ 38]. The use of a manualised semi-fixed protocol, where acupunctur- ists choose from a core group of acupuncture points ac- cording to the Chinese medicine diagnosis and follow a written protocol, ensures that our treatment protocol maintains fidelity to acupuncture as a medical system (which requires individualisation and flexibility) while standardising the treatment that is provided to conform to scientific research methodology [ 39,40]. Acupuncture points will be generally needled bilat- erally. A combination of manual and electrical stimula- tion (electro-acupuncture) will be used. De qi , or needle sensation, is widely considered to be an essential compo- nent of acupuncture treatment [ 41] and is defined as numbness ,heaviness ,pressure ,soreness ,or tingling. De qi will be obtained for each point using thrusting, twirling, and rotating, until the participant reports numbness,heaviness, pressure, soreness, or tingling, and needles are manipulated every 10 min to obtain de qi. Electro- acupuncture will be applied to ST 28 and SP 6 acupunc- ture points bilaterally (located on the lower abdomen and lower leg) and delivered using Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA)-approved electro-acupuncture devices at low frequency (2 Hz) electrical pulses, 0.3 ms pulse width [ 42,43], and continuous stimulation to the attached needles. The intensity of electro-acupuncture will be increased gently during each session until muscle contractions are felt or seen, but below the threshold of any discomfort or pain. Needles are retained for 30 min. Acupuncture needles are standard, single use, stainless steel needles, 0.20 \u00d7 30 mm. Practitioners will record de- tails of each diagnosis and treatment, on an individual case report form which will be kept in a locked cup- board in the clinic and returned to the research team at the end of the study. Auricular electro-acupuncture stimulation The intervention in this arm is AEA using a fixed proto- col that is informed by both Chinese medical and med- ical acupuncture principles based on a literature review and expert consensus on the traditional and physio- logical indications of the points. A pilot study suggests that a novel device, the \"NeurovaTM\"(NESI Corp), may be effective for hot flushes from androgen-deprivation therapy, a condition underpinned by sympathetic hyper- activity [ 44]. This method involves insertion of indwell- ing needles into the concha of the ear and delivery of intermittent electrical impulses over 96 h by a small battery-powered device that is worn just below the ear. This significantly increases the \"dose \"of acupuncture that can be delivered ( \"protracted acupuncture \"). Women allocated to the AEA group will receive a total of 6 treatments over 12 weeks (once a week for the first 2 weeks, then fortnightly for four treatments), delivered by study acupuncturists. No additional Chinese medicine treatments will be provided including body acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, or additional physical or stimulation treatments such as moxibustion or cupping, and no Chinese medicine diagnosis is required. There is to be no variation in treatment. Each subject will receive needling at three acupuncture points on the concha of one ear only (stomach, appetite control, and thalamus) (see Fig. 1). No de qi sensation is to be sought. The Neuro- vaTMdevice will be attached after insertion of the needles to the ear, according to the manufacturer 's instructions. Needles are retained for up to 96 h. The participant is to remove the NeurovaTMdevice by gently pulling out the needles and disconnecting the wire and discarding the device into an approved sharps disposal container. Participants can removeEeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 4 of 12the device before 96 h if they experience significant discomfort. Needles are surgical-grade titanium, ster- ile and disposable, and are approximately 6 mm in length.Lifestyle interventions only The Get Healthy Service (GHS) is a free, confidential telephone-based coaching service that was introduced by New South Wales (NSW) Ministry of Health in 2009Table 1 Acupuncture point selection rationale Acupuncture pointRelevant Chinese medicine indication(s) for PCOS Location Zu San Li (ST36)Harmonises Stomach, 3 cunainferior to Dubi, one finger breadth lateral to the anterior crest of the tibia San Yin Jiao (SP6)Tonifies Spleen and Stomach Qiand resolves damp, harmonises Liver and tonifies Kidney regulates menstruation, Lower Jiao, invigorates Blood, calms the spiritOn the medial side of the lower leg, 3 cunsuperior to the prominence of the medial malleolus, in the depression close to the medial crest of the tibia Tian Shu (ST25)Regulates Intestines, Spleen and Stomach, resolves damp and damp heat, regulates Qiand Blood, eliminates stagnationOn the abdomen to 2 cunlateral to the umbilicus Feng Long (ST40)Transforms phlegm and dampness, clears phlegm from the heart and calms the spirit, activates the channel and alleviates painOn the lower leg, midway between the tibiofemoral joint line (level with the popliteal crease) and the lateral malleolus, two finger- breadth later to Tiaokou ST38 Zhong Wan (CV12)Harmonises the middle Jiao, tonifies the Stomach and fortifies the Spleen regulates QiOn the midline of the abdomen, 4 cunabove the umbilicus and midway between the umbilicus and the sternocostal angle.

Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 5 of 12[45]. The service is delivered by university-qualified health coaches, including dietitians and exercise physiol- ogists, and is available to all residents of NSW aged 16 years and above. Health coaches are trained in Health- Change\u00ae Methodology which draws on principles and techniques similar to those used in motivational inter- viewing, solution-focused coaching, and cognitive behav- ioural therapy and provides an overarching framework for integration of these approaches into specific health promotion programmes. HealthChange\u00ae Methodology also integrates numerous models from evidence-based health behaviour change literature [ 46]. All participants will be referred to the GHS, and one group will be allo- cated to receive only the GHS. The intervention consists of a minimum of four and up to 13 individually tailored telephone calls exploring healthy eating, physical activity, and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight consist- ent with national guidelines, which are also recom- mended by international evidence-based PCOS guidelines [ 4,47]. The frequency of health coaching is tailored according to individual need, coach and partici- pant availability, and stage of programme, with more fre- quent calls generally required in the early stages. Permitted and prohibited components of treatment Women in the body acupuncture group may be pro- vided diet and lifestyle advice according to Chinese medicine principles by the study acupuncturists. This advice usually consists of recommendations to avoidingesting foods that are considered too \"hot\"or\"cold \" for the patient 's constitution. However, no additional Chinese medicine treatments will be provided including Chinese herbal medicine or additional physical or stimu- lation treatments such as moxibustion or cupping. Par- ticipants will be discouraged from using other co- interventions during the study. Any co-interventions used are recorded at the final study visit. Outcome measures The primary outcomes for this study are feasibility and acceptability of recruitment methods, intervention, and outcome collection and will include: a. Recruitment rates (number of enquiries and number of enrolments per month of active recruitment; percentage conversion to enrolment measured as nenrolled/ nof enquiries, measures/ nenrolled) c. Adherence rates ( ncompleting at least 8 of 11 acupuncture treatments and 4 of 6 NeurovaTM treatments; nof hours of wear of the NeurovaTM device/percentage of women who wore the device for the prescribed 96 h duration; ncompleting all recommended phone calls with the GHS); d. Acceptability is measured using an exit survey which includes questions on perceived benefits of Fig. 1 Location of ear acupuncture pointsEeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 6 of 12body acupuncture, AEA, and health coaching, perceived detriments of being in the trial, likelihood of recommending the study to family or friends measured on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from \"I would definitely participate/recommend it \"to\"I would definitely not participate/recommend it \"; e. Credibility of the treatment and expectancy related to treatment are collected immediately after the first acupuncture or AEA treatment, using a modified Credibility and Expectancy questionnaire [48]. To maintain blinding during data analysis, these data will be analysed after all other data have been interpreted. f. Safety (adverse events) which will be collected by study acupuncturists at each treatment, or recorded by the participant or research team at any time during the intervention period, using an Adverse Events Form We will collect demographic and medical details using a survey at baseline, including age, ethnic background, smoking status, diet history, physical activity levels (number of 20-min sessions of vigorous and less vigor- ous exercise per week which will be converted to meta- bolic equivalents), family history of type 2 diabetes, acupuncture experience, and previous weight loss at- tempts. Concomitant medications are recorded at the baseline and 12-week visits. The primary outcome for the phase IIb trial will be change in weight in kilogrammes from baseline to end of treatment (12 weeks). Secondary outcome measures include other anthropometric measures, metabolic out- comes, reproductive, psychological, quality of life, and lifestyle habits. These are collected at baseline and at end of treatment (12 weeks) and include the following: Anthropometric measures We will measure weight on a calibrated medical-grade digital scale (Omron) with the participant in light cloth- ing and no shoes. We will measure waist and hip cir- cumference using medical-grade tape and height by stadiometer at the baseline clinic visit, following proce- dures outlined in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Anthropometry Proce- dures Manual [ 49]. Metabolic outcomes Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are obtained from a 2-h 75 g oral glucose and tolerance test collected by Laverty Pathology after an overnight fast. Serum is analysed for glucose levels using the hexokinase Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 CentaurRInsulin assay, ADVIARChemistry Systems, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Camberley, UK). Area under the curve (AUC) insulin will be calcu- lated using the trapezoid method. Reproductive outcomes Menstrual cyclicity will be calculated from menstrual diaries over 12 weeks. Sex hormone-binding globulin, free testosterone and Free Androgen Index will be col- lected by Pathology CentaurRTestosterone (TSTII) assays. Clinical hyperandrogenism is calculated using the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system [ 50]. Quality of life outcomes We will assess both health-related and global quality of life using the validated Modified PCOS Questionnaire (MPCOSQ) [ 51] and EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire [52] respectively. Psychological outcomes We will assess depression and anxiety symptoms using the validated Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) 21 [53]. The construct of locus of control refers to the ex- tent to which an individual believes that his or her envir- onment and choices are under his or her control. This is relevant in obesity where an external locus of control, or the belief that events or outcomes are controlled by forces external to oneself, is correlated with greater adi- posity [ 54]. We will measure locus of control using the validated Multidimensional Health Locus of Control questionnaire [ 55]. Lifestyle habits activity: Participants will wear an accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X+, initialised at 70 Hz) around the waist for 5 -7 days (that includes 2 weekend days) and complete an associated sleep diary in the week before commencing the intervention, and in week 11 /C15Low eating self-efficacy, or poor confidence in one 's ability to control eating behaviour in the presence of challenging situations, has been identified as a po- tential barrier to long-term adherence to reduced energy intake. We will measure weight self-efficacy using the validated Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Ques- tionnaire short form [ 56] /C15Change in dietary habits ( nof daily serves of vegetables and fruit, nof daily cups of sugar sweetened drinks, frequency of takeaway meals or snacks) is provided by the GHS at completion of the studyEeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 7 of 12Autonomic outcomes /C15Heart rate variability (HRV) provides non-invasive measures of both parasympathetic (high frequency/ HF component) and sympathetic tone (low fre- quency/LF component) [ 57]. HRV will be calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings during the clinic visits. ECG recordings take place in the NICM Neurocognition and HEADBOX Labs at Western Sydney University. Women will be asked to avoid caffeine and smoking for at least 2 h prior to HRV measurement. Five minutes of seated eyes- closed resting-state 2-lead ECG will be recorded with pre-jelled bipolar Ag/AgCl elec- trodes placed over space; between V1 and V2) and fifth intercostal space left midaxillary line (V6) via a Compumedics Neuroscan Synamps2 Digital Signal Processing System and Neuroscan 4.5.1 Ac- quire software. Data will be sampled at 1000 Hz and amplified with the manufacturer 's default gain set- ting. HRV will be derived from ECG trace via MATLAB (Mathsworks\u00ae). HRV frequency bands will be defined as very low frequency (VLF; < 0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF; Hz). LF/HF ratio will also be calculated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. /C15Blood pressure is measured while sitting quietly and after resting quietly for a few minutes, and with both feet on the ground, using an Omron digital automatic standard blood pressure monitor. A large cuff is used if required. Blood pressure on both arms will be obtained initially and the higher blood pressure of the two will be used. Three measurements will be taken, and the average of the last two measurements is recorded. If there is > 10 mm/Hg or > 6mm/Hg difference in systolic or diastolic blood pressure respectively, the participant is asked to rest quietly for 5 min and blood pressure measurement is repeated [ 58]. Criteria for success We will consider this feasibility study a success if the fol- lowing criteria are all met by the completion of all 12- week follow-up visits: /C15The body acupuncture, AEA interventions, and lifestyle interventions are safe and acceptable to participants (no serious adverse events that are probably or definitely related to the interventions; at least 75% of women indicate that they would definitely or probably recommend participating in the trial to a friend with PCOS; at least 75% ofwomen wore the NeurovaTMfor more than 72 h at a time) /C15Recruitment is feasible (recruitment target is reached; nof women enrolled per month of recruitment is at least 2; percentage of women enrolled compared to initial enquiry is greater than 12.5%; percentage of women enrolled compared to number of women who are potentially eligible is greater than 30%); /C15Retention is satisfactory (percentage of women completing 12-week outcome measures compared to women enrolled is greater than 75%) /C15Adherence is satisfactory in all three groups (percentage of women completing at least 66.67% of body acupuncture, AEA treatments or recommended telephone calls from GHS is greater than 75%) /C15Mean credibility score is > 6 (credibility is measured on a 9-point Likert scale) Sample size No sample size calculation is required as this is a feasi- bility study. We aim to analyse 30 participants by the end of treatment. Based on our collective experience, where trials which have required more intensive inter- ventions have reported a dropout rate of over 40% in women with PCOS [ 59] while a randomised sham- controlled trial on acupuncture in menopausal women reported attrition of < 20% [ 60], we estimate a 25% drop- out rate in this trial. Therefore, we aim to randomise 39 women (13 to body acupuncture, 13 to AEA, and 13 to lifestyle alone). Statistical analysis Data relating to recruitment, retention, safety, adher- ence, acceptability, and credibility are presented with de- scriptive statistics (measures of central tendency, e.g., mean, variability; e.g., standard deviation; and effect size, e.g., 95% confidence intervals). Mixed model analysis of variance will be used to determine within-group differ- ences for continuous outcomes between baseline and 12 weeks with time as a fixed effect and subject as a ran- dom effect and analysis of covariance for between-group differences for continuous outcomes with baseline score as a covariate, time and group as fixed effects, and sub- ject as a random effect. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used. Quality assurance Point location for body acupuncture and AEA and will be independently checked by an acupuncturist external to the study at least once for each practitioner. We will undertake regular calibration of digital weight scales andEeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 8 of 12ECG equipment as per laboratory standard operating procedures. Safety monitoring At each acupuncture treatment, study acupuncturists will enquire about adverse events (AE). All participants are provided with an AE form to complete if required and are provided with the principal investigator 's contact details to report all AE regardless of perceived causality. All AEs will be assessed for causality and severity by the chief investigator after consultation with other investiga- tors (see Table 2) and followed up until resolution or until such time as the event is considered stable. Serious AE's are reported to the Human Research Ethics Com- mittee within 24 h of becoming known to the research team. Discussion Obesity is a global health issue [ 61]. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled between 1975 and 2014 [ 62]. The obesity epidemic is a major contribu- tor to the steep rise of type 2 diabetes, cancer, and car- diovascular disease (CVD) [ 63,64]. The cost of obesity to the global health system is estimated at US$2 trillion annually [ 61]. Women with PCOS have a higher preva- lence of being overweight or obese [ 3] including greater longitudinal weight gain [ 65]. Overweight and obesity worsens the features of PCOS [ 66], and weight manage- ment is recommended as initial first line treatment in international evidence-based guidelines in PCOS [ 4]. Women with PCOS express dissatisfaction with con- ventional medical treatments (such as fertility drugs and the oral contraceptive pill) and an overwhelming prefer- ence for alternatives that they perceive to be safer [ 67]. They are frequent users of complementary therapies, with up to a third using acupuncture [ 68]. Acupuncture may represent a low-risk [ 32] non-pharmacological ad- junct to lifestyle interventions in women with PCOS and may contribute to reduction of the burden of chronic disease; however, there is a paucity of evidence from rigorous RCTs. Many RCTs fail due to inability torecruit to target [ 69]. To this end, the UK Medical Re- search Council recommends assessment of feasibility prior to full evaluation of complex interventions [ 70]. This can ensure that money spent on expensive trials is not wasted due to recruitment and retention failures. This feasibility study will examine the safety, accept- ability, and feasibility of recruitment and adherence to novel adjunctive interventions for weight loss in PCOS. Further, we will explore the impact of AEA, body acu- puncture, and lifestyle interventions on measures of sympathetic tone and IR, and related biomarkers that are clinically relevant in PCOS, in order to build an ac- curate scientific argument for the biological plausibility of the interventions. Several sham-controlled RCTs on acupuncture for a variety of clinical conditions suggest that it is more efficacious than sham in reducing sympa- thetic tone as measured by HRV [ 57,71,72]. Previous clinical research showed that AEA resulted in improve- ment in HRV LF/HF ratios over the course of the protocol intervention, implying improved sympathovagal balance [44]; however, this was measured using ambulatory HRV monitoring, which has not been validated against the gold standard of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. To date, the effect of acupuncture on HRV in women with PCOS has not been evaluated, although electro-acupuncture im- proved HRV and restored oestrous cycling compared to sham handling in a recent rat study [ 73]. This study also provides vital real-world feasibility data on the acceptability of NeurovaTMdevice, which will allow for further modification of the device for improved health consumer comfort, convenience, and clinical ef- fectiveness. This device represents an innovation in the delivery of acupuncture, allowing the device to be used at home, reducing the need for frequent clinic visits, and increasing the dose of acupuncture that can be delivered. Study findings will have the potential to generate new understandings of the role of acupuncture and allow greater exploration of the mechanisms underlying PCOS, a condition of significant health burden to women, with the potential to translate this research to other chronic conditions that are underpinned by autonomic dysfunction. Table 2 Assessment of causality and severity of adverse events Assessment of causality Assessment of severity Unrelated : where an event is not considered to be related to the study interventionMild : an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Possibly : although a relationship to the study intervention cannot be completely ruled out, the nature of the event, the underlying disease, concomitant medication or temporal relationship make other explanations possible.Moderate : an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. Probably : the temporal relationship and absence of a more likely explanation suggest the event could be related to the study intervention.Severe : an event that prevents normal everyday activities Definitely : The known effects of the study intervention or its physiological mechanisms suggest that study intervention is the most likely cause.Eeet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:53 Page 9 of 12There are some limitations to the proposed research. It will not be possible to blind the intervention providers or the participants, therefore introducing the possibility of performance bias. To minimise this risk, we will conduct blinded outcome collection and analysis and utilise object- ive measures for outcomes wherever possible (such as ac- celerometers to measure physical activity levels). Further, due to operational and funding constraints, the study is limited to women in Sydney, and we will not be able to test the feasibility of a multicentre trial. Conclusion This study addresses feasibility of a novel intervention to treat obesity, which is a global public health concern. With rising health costs and disease burden from obes- ity, there is an urgent need to identify effective treat- ments that are adjunctive to lifestyle interventions. Should the trial methods prove to be feasible and ac- ceptable and meet the criteria for success, we will con- duct a phase IIb randomised controlled trial assessing effectiveness and efficacy of the NeurovaTMdevice and body acupuncture as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions for obesity in women with PCOS.
