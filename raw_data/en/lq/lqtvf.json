With spring, we are introduced to more sun and more yang energy, translating into more activity and more movement. This is exactly what we need after winter's darkness and days indoors. However, introducing more activity requires nourishment of our body's Qi, or energy. A great way to keep Qi plentiful is to be mindful of the foods we eat and when. Think Upward, Sour and Sweet Thanks to modern transportation systems, we are able to get any food at any time of the year. So taking cues from our supermarket shelves can be a bit misleading. Therefore, it's always good to remember the food energetics of the season, to know what to be on the lookout for. For example, in the spring we should be eating foods that have an upward energy such as green, sprouting vegetables. For help from releasing winter's slump and stagnation, we should be seeking out [sour](http://mendacupuncture.com/springs-sour-foods/) and fermented foods. And for extra energy for our increased activity, sweet foods can provide a bit of a boost. But we must be careful to not overdue it as too much sweet can cause sluggishness. 5 Foods to Focus on in Spring: - Green Foods: During spring, it is recommended to eat foods green in color and rich in chlorophyll that help accelerate rejuvenation of the liver. This includes things like kale, Swiss chard, collard greens, spirulina, chlorella, parsley, and wheat grass. - Radishes: Pungent in flavor, radishes are perfect for the springtime. They help move liver Qi and open up the liver meridian. - Sour Citrus Fruits: Foods like lemons, limes and grapefruit are all good choices that help cut fats that may have been stored up in the body during the winter months, while also keeping the liver Qi moving smoothly. - Bitter Leafy Greens: Spring is the appropriate time for liver cleansing, which is what the bitter flavor does. So adding things like dandelion greens, arugula, radicchio, mustard greens and spinach will help tremendously. - A Little Sweetness: Think young vegetables such as young carrots and beets. This nourishes the blood and helps keep you vital during all the new activity.
