Essential Oil Safety - In line with the Therapeutic Goods Act, we do not recommend ingesting essential oils without the guidance of a registered Aromatherapist or Naturopath. Essential Oils are extremely potent and can cause serious harm if used incorrectly. - Essential oils should be kept out of reach of children and pets. - Avoid using Essential Oils during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding. - Essential Oils are very concentrated and are likely to cause irritation if applied directly to the skin. For this reason, we recommend diluting your essential oils before using topically (on the skin). For skin application we recommend a 2-4% dilution and for facial application we recommend a 1-2% dilution for adults. 100% Pure & Natural Our products are ethically sourced from the highest quality ingredients.
