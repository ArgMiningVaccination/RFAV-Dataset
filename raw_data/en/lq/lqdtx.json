The least exertion would trigger off a severe attack of breathlessness that I would dread. I had tried all other kinds of treatment for Asthma but nothing would relieve me. Then finally on the advise of one friend of mine, I opted for Dr Shah's homeopathic treatment. It was really surprising that I felt better with homeopathic treatment, for the first time in so many years. My cough and wheezing had settled to the minimum and the dosage of inhalers was also gradually reduced. This was the first time in so many years that I was able to be on a reduced dose of inhalers and was able to stop the other allopathic medicines. Now the attacks of Asthma are not as frequent and as severe as before and I am able to lead a near-normal life again, thanks to homeopathy. Saroj Dedhia - Child Asthma "}
