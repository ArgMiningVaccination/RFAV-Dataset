ACTION : Notice. SUMMARY : The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a comprehensive list of all guidance documents currently in use at the agency. This list is being published under FDA's Good Guidance Practices (GGPs). It is intended to inform the public of the existence and availability of all of our current guidance documents. It also provides information on guidance documents that have been added or withdrawn in the past 5 years. DATES : We welcome general comments on this list and on agency guidance documents at any time. ADDRESSES : Submit electronic comments to http:// www.regulations.gov. Submit written comments to the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. For information on a specific guidance or to obtain a paper copy, please refer to each Center's section of this document. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : I. Background FDA's GGPs were published in the Federal Register of September 19, 2000 (65 FR 56468), and became effective October 19, 2000. GGPs (21 CFR 10.115) are intended to ensure involvement of the public in the development of guidance documents, and to enhance understanding of the availability, nature, and legal effect of such guidance. FDA has adopted a new format for the publication of its comprehensive guidance list. This new format is intended to increase the timeliness of the comprehensive list. For information on a specific guidance or to obtain a paper copy, please refer to each Center's section of this document. The lists of guidance documents are either a printout of FDA's Web site as of April 2010 or a list compiled by the issuing office. You should note that some guidance documents pertain to more than one product area (e.g., drugs and biologics), and are, therefore, listed under both Centers involved or pertain to more than one subject matter (e.g., ''Food Defense and Emergency Response'' and ''Imports''), and are, therefore, listed under more than one category within a Center. So there may be some duplication in the guidance lists. You are encouraged to use FDA's Web site as the most up-to-date source for all current guidance documents in use by the agency, as the Web site is updated on a daily basis. In accordance with the agency's general policy on guidances, you may comment on this list and on any FDA guidance document at any time. We have organized the guidance documents by the issuing Center or Office within FDA. The dates in the list refer to the date we issued the guidances or, where applicable, the last date we revised a document. Because each issuing Center or Office maintains its own database, there are slight variations in the way in which they provide the information. II. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) For information a specific guidance document or to obtain a paper copy, contact: Office of Communication, Outreach, and Development, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville following is a list of CBER guidance documents that have been withdrawn: Title of Document Date of Issuance Date of Withdrawal Guidance for Industry: Gamma Irradiation of Blood and Blood Components: A Pilot Program for Li- censing 3/15/2000 4/10/2006 Draft Guidance for Industry: CBER Pilot Licensing Program for Immunization of Source Plasma Do- nors Using Immunogen Red Blood Cells Obtained from an Outside Supplier 7/11/2001 4/11/2006 Draft Guidance for Industry: Submitting Type V Drug Master Files to the Center for Biologics Eval- uation and Research 8/23/2001 August 9, 2010.
