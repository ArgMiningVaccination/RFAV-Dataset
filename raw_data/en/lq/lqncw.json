Provider Reference Guide | Section 2: Eligibility and Benefits 10 2.1 Eligibility and b enefit verification We strongly recommend verification of member eligibility and benefits before rendering services. Please do not assume the member is eligible if they present a current ID card. Eligibility and benefits should be verified on the date services are rendered . Confirmation n umbers A confirmation number is a n 11-digit identification number received when your office verifies member benefits and eligibility. Verification is obtained by : Speaking with a Call Center r epresentative Accessing the IVR Utilizing providers.eyesynergy.com Confirmation numbers affirm member eligibility for requested benefits and services. C onfirmation numbers are not required for all services. You are strongly encouraged to verify benefits and eligibility before rendering services. Benefits that generally require confirmation numbers include, but are not limited to: Replacement frames and lenses Medically necessary contact lenses for Medicaid members Two (2) pairs of glasses in lieu of bifocals Prescription sunglasses The confirmation request process requires you to attest that a member meets the defined benefit criteria, as outlined in the state specific P RG, when applicable. Upon attestation, a confirmation number is generated. Example: A member is diagnosed with keratoconus and requires contact lenses. You are required to request a confirmation and attest to the documented exam findings and/or diagnosis. The submitted claim must include the diagnosis of keratoconus . Payment is issue provided the member is eligible on the date services were rendered. Instances in which a confirmation number does not guarantee payment of a claim include: The member is not eligible on the date of service The member's benefit exhausted prior to claim submission IMPORTANT: Retrospective random chart audits are performed on claims submitted for services requiring attestation. Covered b enefits You can access a list of covered benefit s by: Signing into providers.eyesynergy.com o Resources > Provider Reference Guide > select the applicable state from the drop -down menu o Benefits and Eligibility menu in providers.eyesynergy.com ; Visiting marchvisioncare.com > Provider Resources > Provider Reference Guide o Benefits may be accessed by selecting the desired state from the drop- down menu Covered benefits include information such as benefit frequency, copayment amount, allowance amount, benefit limitations and benefit criteria. For children receiving Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services, any limits on services may be exceeded when medically necessary. Methods of v erification You may access providers.eyesynergy.com or the IVR System to verify member eligibility, benefits, and to request a confirmation number. 5 Provider Reference Guide | Section 2: Eligibility and Benefits 11 2.2 Non-covered services The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prohibits you from billing or seeking compensation from Medicaid beneficiaries for the provision of services that are covered benefits under their Medicaid plans. T here are certain circumstances in which a member requests services that are not covered or fully covered under their Medicaid plans. In these circumstances, the provider must inform the member and is required to have the member knowingly sign a waiver or statement acknowledging that the service is not covered and that the member is financially responsible prior to rendering non- covered service. Failure to do so may result in the provider being financially responsible for those services -- even if the member verbally agreed to the non- covered service or paid for the non- covered service up -front. Acceptable waivers A general waiver stating \"the member is responsible for all services not covered by insurance\" is not a valid waiver . It does not specifically define which services are not covered and the amount the member is expected to pay. You are required to have the member sign a waiver form that clearly explains that the specific service/procedure is not covered and that the member acknowledges that he/she will be responsible for the cost of the service(s). We recommend using our Non- Covered Service Fee Acceptance Form (availabl e in both Spanish and English) in Exhibit A , but it is not required. If you choose to use another form in place of our Non- Covered Service Fee Acceptance Form, it must contain the following elements: Documentation of the specific services provided (including dates of service, description of procedure/service, amount charged) The member's signed acknowledgement that he/she understands the service is not covered and he/she is financially liable for the services provided The member must receive a copy of the signed waiver. A copy of the signed waiver must also be placed in the member's medical chart. Provider Reference Guide | Section 3: Billing and claim procedures 12 3.1 Claim submission Preferred method You are encouraged to submit claims electronically at providers.eyesynergy.com , , our web- based solution for electronic transactions. providers.eyesynergy.com helps reduce claim errors resulting in faster processing times.

Paper claims Paper claims are accepted if submitted on an original red CMS- 1500 form that is typed or computer - generated with clear , legible black ink. Paper claims that are handwritten, contain light ink, or submitted on a copied CMS -1500 form are not acceptable and will be returned. Paper claims in the approved format can be mailed to: UnitedHealthcare I March Vision Care Attn: Medicaid Vision Claims PO Box 30989 Salt Lake City, UT 84130 Clean claim definition A clean claim is defined as a bill from a health care provider that can be processed without obtaining additional information from the provider of service or from a third party. An unclean claim is defined as any claim that does not meet the definition of a clean claim. State -specific exceptions to our clean claim definition are provided below. Claims submitted for payment should include: Member name, ID number, date of birth and gender Provider and/or facility name, address and signature Billing name, address and t ax identification number The rendering and billing National Provider Identifier (NPI ) Date of service Current and appropriate ICD-10 codes Service units Current and appropriate CPT/HCP CS codes Current and applicable modifier codes Place of service Usual and customary charges Patient account number We have the right to obtain further information from your office upon request when a submitted claim has errors or when we or the health plan has reasonable grounds for suspecting possible fraud, misrepresentation or unfair billing practices. Unclean claims are processed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. IMPORTANT: Please submit corrected claims on a red CMS -1500 form and clearly indicate on the claim that the submission is a corrected claim . This ensures the corrected information will be considered during claims processing and will help prevent payment delays. Provider Reference Guide | Section 3: Billing and claim procedures 13 3.2 American Medical Association CPT coding rules We reaffirm our adoption of CPT coding rules established by the American Medical Association, Medicaid, and Medicare Regulations , and applicable law : You can use a new eye ex amina tion bill ing code for an initial examina tion of a new patient. You may also bill for a new membe r examination if a me mber has not been ex amine d for three ( 3) consecutive y ears by that provider/group A routine examina tion fo r an estab lished patient in subsequent y ears can be b illed as a fo llow-up ex amina tion You can continue to bill this way unless the member has not been ex amined for three ( 3) consecutive years at that office, at w hich time the service may be bi lled wi th a new me mber examina tion c ode as indicated above A m edical examination may be billed if the member has the benefit as indicated in M arch's State-Spe cific PRG Follow-up examina tions for the same medical condition noted above may be billed ba sed on th e acuten ess of the c ondition and the d ocumented services prov ided According to Medicare Carriers Manual Section 15501.1 H, if more than one evaluation and management (face- to-face) service is provided on the same day to the same patient, whether by the same provider or more than one provider in the same specialty in the same group, only one evaluation and management service may be billed. Optometrists and Ophthalmologists from the same group are considered the same specialty, for covered services provided within the scope of optometry. Therefore, a comprehensive eye examination and a medical examination, such as a diabetic eye evaluation, may not be billed on the same date of service. Instead of billing two examinations separately, providers should select a level of service representative of the combined visits and submit the appropriate code for that level. The less extensive procedure is bundled into the more extensive procedure. The services furni shed and associated m edical reco rd documentation m ust meet the definition of the CPT code bi lled. The services furni shed and associated m edical reco rd documentation m ust meet the definition of the CPT code bi lled This is important w hen provide rs bill the hi ghest levels of vi sit and consultat ion codes . Example: F or you to bill a co mprehensive eye exam - new patient: The patient may not have been ex amined by a prov ider in the pr actice within the past three ( 3) years history must meet the CPT code 's definition of a co mprehensive history All components of an ex amin ation need to be re corded, inc luding dilation or equiv alent You sional di scretion w hether to dilate at subsequent visits for ex isting pat ients, but dilation is expected at the initial visit and at least every 3 years. M edica l nece ssity of a service is the overar ching criter ion for payment, in addition to the individual requirements of a CPT code. It would not be m edically necessary or appropriate to bill a higher level of evaluation and management service whe n a lower level of serv ice is warr anted o r performed. Similarly , it would not be wa rranted to bill for services if medical necessity is not established by stan dards of me dical o r optometric practice. The da te of service on the claim should always match the date of service on the medical record, and the medical record should include complete documentation related to all billed services The comprehensive nature of the examination codes includes a number of tests and evaluations. Some of these procedures have their own CPT code. When these procedures are broken out and billed in conjunction with a comprehensive examination it is referred to as \"unbundling\" and is an inappropriate billing practice. This type of billing practice will be subject to action from a health plan or insurance carrier. The m ost billing common errors include: Billing for a dilated fundus examination with the indirect ophthalmoscope and using the codes 92225, 92226, or separately billing visual fields using 92081 Billing color vision testing using 92283 Billing sensory motor testing using 92060 Billing gonioscopy using 92020 The appropriate and correct use of the CPT (procedure) and diagnosis code is the responsibility of every health care provider. Use the following set of links to national correct coding resources on www.cms.gov to assist you: Provider Reference Guide | Section 3: Billing and claim procedures 14 2019 ICD -10-CM - (cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2019- ICD-10-CM.html) National Correct Coding Initiative Edits - (cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/NationalCorrectCodInitEd/index.html) Med icare Claims Process Manual: Chapter 23 - Fee Schedule Administration and Coding Requirements The medical record should reflect the intensity of examination that is being billed in all instances . Claim submissions will be audit ed to ensure compliance. Audits include the review of medical records, including the records documenting all test results billed (i.e. photos, OCTs, etc.). In an effort to improve HEDIS and Star Ratings performance, we require you to submit CPT II and ICD -10 codes, on claims, to demonstrate performance and diagnosis for diabetic members : Please see Exhibit F : HEDIS/Stars Performance Reporting for more information. 3.3 Billing for r eplacements and r epairs Replacements and repairs are generally covered only under certain circumstances. For this reason, confirmation numbers are required for replacements and repairs. Replacement and repair services must be billed with the applicable modifier. The following are valid modifiers : RA (Replacements) RB (Repairs) Reimbursement for materials billed with the RB (Repair s) modifier will be reimbursed at 50% of the contracted rate. 3.4 Billing for g laucoma screenings The screening examination for glaucoma must include the following two ( 2) components: Dilated exam with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement Either direct ophthalmoscopy or slit lamp biomicroscopy CMS mandates payment for a glaucoma screening examination that is performed on an eligible beneficiary after at least 11 months have passed following the month in which the last glaucoma screening examination was performed. 3.5 Frame warranty Frames from our frame kit are fully guaranteed against manufacturing defects for a period of 1 year from the date the frame was dispensed.

External i ndependent third- party review Effective with denials dated January 01, 2020, and after, if you disagree with the outcome of your appeal by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, you can request an external independent third- party review (EITPR) of the appeal determination. EITPR is an optional process available to care providers only and the formal appeal must be completed prior to requesting an EITPR. The EITPR will be available to KanCare providers who have received a denial of authorization of a new healthcare service to a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member or a denial of a claim for reimbursement to the provider for a healthcare service to a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member. Documentation reviewed by the external reviewer will be limited to documentation submitted by you for the appeal process, along with the medical necessity criteria UnitedHealthcare Community Plan applied in the appeal decision (for denials of a healthcare service). EITPR can be requested in writing. o Download the EITPR request form o Submit by mail at : Attn: External Independent Third Party Review 10895 Grandview Drive, Suite 200 Overland Park, KS 66210 o Submit in person during regular business hours 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. CST at: 10895 Grandview Drive, Suite 200 Provider Reference Guide | Section 3: Billing and claim procedures 18 Overland Park, KS 66210 o Submit by email at KS_EITPR@uhc.com Your request for an EITPR must be received by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan within 63 calendar days from the date of the notice of appeal resolution. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will acknowledge receipt of your request, in writing, within five ( 5) business days of receipt. No additional documentation will be accepted with the EITPR request. Only the records and documentation reviewed during the appeal will be reviewed during the EITPR. You will receive a letter from the external reviewer that contains the external review decision. Following that, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will issue a notice that includes your right to request a state fair hearing regarding the external reviewer's decision within 33 calendar days of the date on the MCO's notice of external review decision. 3.11 O verpayment of c laims You will be notified in writing i f we determine a claim was overpaid or was paid incorrectly . Overpayment r efund requests are issued in accordance with the applicable provider services agreement and governing entity regulations. We do not issue overpayment refund requests more than 3 65 days following the payment date, even when permitted by governing entity regulations. Once an overpayment refund request is issued, if we do not receive an overpayment dispute request or refund of the overpaid amount within 60 calendar days, with three (3) additional days for mailing, we may offset the overpayment against future claim payments if not prohibited by governing entity regulations . 3.12 Balance b illing \"Balance billing\" means charging or collecting an amount in excess of the Medicaid or contracted reimbursement rate for services covered under a Medicaid beneficiary's plan. \"Balance b illing\" does not include charging or collecting deductibles or copayments and coinsurance required by the beneficiary's plan. You U are prohibited from balance billing our members. The explanation codes provided in the explanation of payment remittance advice clearly indicate when balance billing for a service is not permissible. 3.13 C oordination of Benefits Coordination of Benefits (COB) is a method of integrating health benefits payable under more than 1 health insurance plan, allowing patients to receive up to 100% coverage for services rendered. Patients that have health benefits under more than 1 health insurance plan are said to have \"dual coverage\". In some cases patients may have primary, secondary, and tertiary coverage. It is necessary to know what plan is primary and what plan is secondary or tertiary when a patient has multiple plans or \"dual coverage\" . The primary plan must be billed first and the claim is billed just like any other claim would be billed The secondary plan is billed once an explanation of payment (EOP) and possibly a payment is received from the primary plan The claims s ubmitted to a secondary or tertiary plan are considered \"COB claims \" When billing a secondary plan, the bill must have the primary insurance plans ' EOP attached The payments received from the primary plan should be indicated in field 29 of the CMS 1500 f orm The claim will be contested and the primary insurance EOP will be requested if the secondary plan is billed without an attached primary insurance EOP Medicaid will not make an additional payment if the amount received from the primary insurance company is equal to or greater than the Medicaid reimbursement amount We process COB claims in accordance with the applicable provider services agreement and governing entity regulations. When we are the secondary payor, the primary payor information is required for calculation of the secondary payment. We subtract the primary insurance payment from the lesser of our allowable or the primary insurance plan allowable, not to exceed our applicable reimb ursement rates and benefit allowance. Provider Reference Guide | Section 3: Billing and claim procedures 19 The timeframe for filing a claim in situations involving third party benefits (COB and subrogation) shall begin on the date that the third party documented resolution of the claim. COB claims must be submitted as paper claims on a red CMS 1500 form. Please mail COB claims to: UnitedHealthcare I March Vision Care Attn: Medicaid Vision Claims PO Box 30989 Salt Lake City, UT 84130 Provider Reference Guide | Section 4 : Standards of accessibility 20 4.1 Access standards Our optometrists and ophthalmologists are required to meet minimum standards of accessibility for members at all times as a condition of maintaining participating provider status. In connection wi th the foregoing, we have established the following accessibility standards, when otherwise not specified by regulation or by client performance standards: Appointments for routine, non- urgent eye examinations and eyeglass or contact lens fittings and disp ensing are available within 30 calendar days Rescheduling an appointment in a manner that is appropriate for the enrollee's health care needs and ensures continuity of care consistent with good professional practice When we are contractually responsible f or more than routine eye examinations, appointments for urgent/emergent eye care services, within the optometrist's or ophthalmologist's scope of practice, are available within 24 hours You are required to employ an answering service or a voice mail system during non- business hours, which provide instructions to members on how they may obtain urgent or emergency care. The message may include: o An emergency contact number (i.e. cell number, auto forwarding call system, pager ) o Information on how to contact another provider who has agreed to be on- call to triage or screen by phone, or if needed, deliver urgent or emergency care o Instructions to call 911 or go to the local emergency room Members with scheduled appointments will wait no more than 30 minutes from their appointment time before being seen by a provider o Wait time is defined as the time spent in the lobby and in the examination room prior to being seen by a provider Note : Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, HHS - Timely access - Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP must do the following: (i) Meet and require its providers to meet State standards for timely access to care and services, taking into account the urgency of the need for services. (ii) Ensure that the network providers offer hours of operation that are no less than the hours of operation offered to commercial enrollees or comparable to Medicaid fee -for-service, if the provider serves only Medicaid enrollees. (iii) Make services included in the contract available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when medically necessary. (iv) Establish mechanisms to ensu re compliance by providers. (v) Monitor providers regularly to determine compliance. (vi) Take corrective action if there is a failure to comply. 4.2 Access monitoring We are responsible for monitoring compliance with accessibility standards . This includes monitoring member's accessibility to providers within their demographic region to oversight regarding a member's wait times for scheduling or while at a provider's office waiting to be seen by the provider. The following are mechanisms we may employ to verify accessibility standards are met : Blast fax requests may be used to gather information from you to determine demographic, access and language information Telephone access surveys will be conducted by us through random calls to optometrist and ophthalmologist offices to verify capacity to ensure that appointments are scheduled on a timely basis, with appropriate office wait time, and that appropriate after -hours answering systems are being utilized Our grievance system serves to identify access -related concerns o The tracking of grievances and an investigation of grievance patterns may result in the implementation of new policies and procedures and/or the education of participating optometrists, ophthalmologists, and staff members Members may be provided with a Member Satisfaction Survey to comment on the service and products received from us and you The appointment books of participating optometrists and ophthalmologists may be periodically reviewed during on-site inspections to va lidate the availability of appointments for services within reasonable time frames Waiting rooms may be periodically monitored to determine how long members wait for scheduled appointments Provider Reference Guide | Section 5: Health care services 21 5.1 Quality Management Program Our Quality Management Program is our quality assurance program. It provides a planned, systematic, and comprehensive approach to monitor and evaluate quality improvement initiatives that both directly or indirectly influence our ability to meet our goal to deliver high quality of services to all of our customers that incl udes members, providers and clients. The scope of the program's focus is evaluated on an annual basis and includes, but is not limited to monitoring activities in the following areas: Delivery of quality of care Complaints and grievances Member access and availability to care, health education, satisfaction surveys, and others 5.2 Coordination with Primary Care Providers You are asked to contact a member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) should they notice any additional medical needs while providing vision services. Example: If a significant change is observed in an eye exam of a diabetic member, please call the PCP. The assigned PCP is noted on the front of the member's ID card. Y ou may contact the member's Health Plan directly for assistance in coordinating additional medical needs for the member. 5.3 Clinical decision making Our clinical decisions are based only on appropriateness of care and service, and existence of coverage. We do not reward health care providers for denying, limiting, or delaying coverage of health care services. We also do not give monet ary incentives to our staff making medical necessity decisions to provide less health care coverage or services. 5.4 Medical charting for e ye care services Our Health Care Services Department perform audits of medical records used as supporting documentation to substantiate post -payment claims submissions to ensure quality of services and to combat fraud, waste and abuse. Led by our Chief Eye Care Officer, we have identified over 17 elements necessary in a comprehensive eye examination. Records are evaluated and assigned a point value for each element based on their hierarchy of significance using a proprietary scoring system. The cumulative total point value is used to determine the adequacy of the supporting documentation. When a comprehensive examination is billed, if any of the critical elements are skipped 10 out 10 times, the audit score automatically defaults to the failing Severity Level score 4. These c ritical elements include: Biomicroscopy/ slit lamp exam Intraocular pressure Optic nerve head evaluation Dilated fundus exam. If any of these elements are missing or inadequately documented in the medical chart, we may send a request for a corrective action plan (\"CAP\"), asking you to address the documentation issue(s) identified during the audit. Keep in mind the following items to ensure your medical chart supporting documentation is sufficient to pass an audit: Provider Reference Guide | Section 5: Health care services 22 Paper charts The encounter must record critical general health care information and the traditional refractive data o Details of a patient's medicine list and a formal review of systems are critical elements of the eye exam Notes on pulse, blood pressure and body mass index You must query about tobacco use and alcohol use Assess patient orientation to time and place Rate the patient's emotional state during the exam Traditional paper charts may need to be updated to meet these standards. In addition to the requirements noted above, the form must include adequate space for a detailed slit l amp exam, notations for drugs that are administered during the exam, and a det ailed posterior pole exam. A sample form that meet s these requirement s can be found in Exhibit E. Electronic medical records The following issues may be problematic if you are using Electronic Medical Records ( \"EMR \"). It is important to take them into consideration to ensure supporting documentation is sufficient: The templates for each encounter type, includ ing the eye exam are customizable. Many providers have customized their office system in a way that has deleted key elements of the eye exam. Deleting some elements may make your charts non- compliant. EMR's have \"defaults\" for normal findings that often fill in descriptive, detailed language for normal structures/findings. Caution should be used with defaults so that the clinical data and test results correlate with the diagnosis, assessment and management plan. When documentation is worded exactly like or similar to previous entries, the documentation is referred to as \"cloned\" . Cloning of documentation from a previous visit lacks the encounter -specific information necessary to support services rendered to patients. A review of the EMR for consistency, logical assessment, and treatment plans should be completed before signing the chart. The chart should not be manipulated or corrected once it is signed by you . Critical elements of an eye exam Comprehensive eye exams are critical, not only to correct and preserve vision, but also for the early detection of systemic disease. Our Chief Eye Care Officer and our Peer Committee have developed Care Standards for eye health examinations to support our commitment to quality care for all patients . These guidelines reflect our focus on early detection and prevention. The following elements are required for all comprehensive eye health examinations: Element 1: Reason for v isit What is expected: The patient should be directly questioned as to why they presented for the encounter. The patient should be asked about issues with their eyes and vision or other problems that may be related to the visual system. The answers to these questions should be documented in the medical record. Element 2: Review of s ystems What is expected: Each of the following systems should be queried and the patient 's response recorded. For all positive responses, additional questioning may be indicated. Cardiovascular Constitutional Endocrine Gastrointestinal Head Hematologic/Lymphatic Immunologic Integumentary Provider Reference Guide | Section 5: Health care services 23 Musculoskeletal Neurological Psychiatric Respiratory Element 3: Medications and a llergies What is expected: Medication name and dosage for all drugs or supplements the patient is taking should be recorded. If no medication is being taken, this should be indicated on the chart as \"none\" and not left blank. For allergies related to medications, the name and the adverse effec t the member experienced should be listed. If the patient experiences environmental or food allergies, these should be noted as well. If no allergies are reported, the chart should indicate this. Element 4: Ocular h istory; family history; orientation, mood and a ffect What is expected: A detailed list of the patient's previous eye problems and procedures should be listed. The family history should query medical problems including diabetes, hypertension, thyroid problems and cancer in addition to eye prob lems such as cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration. The patients should be asked if they know the day, date and their current location. The clinician should note the validity and assess whether the patient's mood or affect is normal or abnormal. Element 5: Entering v isual acuity at distance and near What is expected: A measurement of visual acuity both uncorrected and with the patient's habitual correction should be performed at both distance and near. Element 6: Entering t ests, including vital signs and e xternal examination What is expected: Measurement of the fol lowing: Height Weight Body mass index Blood pressure for patients age 13 and older Pulse Testing of pupil response Direct Consensual Swinging flashlight Extra ocular muscle testing Cover test Visual field Confrontation Automated test Element 7: Refraction What is expected: The refraction is the subjective test that allows for the patient's visual perception of the physical refractive error. Auto- refraction, by itself, is not an acceptable measurement . Element 8: Near point testing What is expected: Testing may include measurements of accommodation and/or convergence as well as additional testing as determined by the provider (e.g. evaluation of saccadic eye movements). Element 9: Current o ptical prescriptions What is expected: The current glasses prescription should be measured and recorded in the refractive testing area. Element 10: Corneal curvature What is expected: The measurement should be recorded in the refractive testing area when indicated. Provider Reference Guide | Section 5: Health care services 24 Element 11: Biomicroscopy What is expected: Use of the slit lampbiomicroscope to inspect all anterior segment eye structures including the lids and lashes, tear film, cornea, anterior chamber, angle grade, iris and lens. The documentation must be individualized based on the findings of the examination. Cloned language in electronic health records should be carefully reviewed and revised to be consistent with the rest of the documentation in the record. Element 12: Intraocular p ressure What is expected: The type of instrument used and the time of measurement should be included wi th the numerical finding. Element 13: Optic n erve head evaluation What is expected: The optic nerve must be visualized, and details recorded at each visit. The details of the evaluation of the o ptic nerve should include all aspects of the nerve itself, including cup to disc ratio, disc margin, disc size, color, thickness and vessel caliber. The exam may be performed with a minimum of a fundus lens, or a direct ophthalmoscope, indirect ophthalmoscope, or photographically. Element 14: Dilated f undus examination What is expected: A thorough inspection of the optic nerve, macula, vascular tree and retinal surface with a fundus lens and biomicroscope, a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope and/or a wide- angle retinal imaging system. Document the method of examination. Although retinal imaging is acceptable in some cases, it is not a substitute for a binocular physical retina examination. All providers must be licensed and capable to dilate the pupil and perform the physical retina examination. Element 15: D iagnosis What is expected: These can be a refractive diagnosis such as m yopia, astigmatism, emmetropia, hyperopia, or presbyopia or medical eye as cataract, corneal dystrophy, choroidal nevus or glaucoma. Pertinent systemic medical diagnoses such as diabetes should also be listed. Element 16: Assessment, management, and treatment plan What is expected: The provider should summarize the overall examination , and clarify the points that need to be managed in this section . The treatment/management plan should spell out the steps to be taken to address the chief concerns identified in the clinical findings. In healthy patients , this can be as simple as, \"Normal Exam, return in 1 year for re- examination.\" For patients with refractive error , the verbiage can include the diagnosis and be stated as \"Myopia, order glasses to be used for distance only, return in 1 year.\" For patients with pathology , this section should be more specific and address patient education, glasses, contact lenses, low -vision aids, medications prescribed with directions for use, referrals, recommended testing, time frames and follow -up schedules. Other clinicians, reviewer s, and any party evaluating this clinical encounter will look to this section to determine the important clinical points of the case and identify the plan of action and recommended follow -up. Element 17: Legible r ecords What is expected: Records that are easily deciphered, following a consistent examination sequence, that are complete and document all findings, clinical decisions and any continuity of care recommendations. If using electronic medical records, it is important to review any \"pre- populated\" and/or \"cloned\" default data for accuracy, attest to the doctor personally reviewing history and medications and review all recorded data to ensure it reflects the examination findings and recommendations. A signature is required on all charts, if elect ronic it needs to be time and date stamped. The following equipment list is optional and can be used as a guideline during a comprehensive eye examination: Visual Acuity testing Charts o Distance o Near Color Vison Plates Provider Reference Guide | Section 5: Health care services 25 Stereo Plate Hand equipment (Occluders, Saccade/ Pursuit targets, PD stick, Maddox rod, Prism bars, Flippers) Blood Pressure Measuring Device Height and Weight measuring device Keratometer Lensometer Refractor o Phoropter or Trial Frame and Lens Biomicroscope (Slit Lamp) o Slit lamp Condensing lenses (78, 90) o Gonio lenses Tonometer Ophthalmoscope (Direct and Indirect) o Condensing lenses (20, 28) Provider Reference Guide | Section 6: Fraud, Waste, and Abuse 26 6.1 Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) Training of p roviders concerning the detection of health care fraud We recognize the importance of properly educating and training our providers to detect fraud.

In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a7 162.410, we require each provider rendering services to members to have a National Provider Identif ier. Provider Reference Guide | Section 8: Language assistance program 28 8.1 Interpreter services and l anguage assistance Access to i nterpreters If your office identifies a member as being Limited English Proficient (LEP) and the member is present in the office, telephone interpretation should be used immediately to avoid any delay in services. There are new federal requirements f or language services. The federal guidance, published as Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provides specific limitations on the use of Bilingual Staff and minors as interpreters. These requirements are not limited to federal programs. You are at risk if you use in -house bilingual staff who are not qualified interpreters. Qualified interpreters: Adhere to generally accepted interpreter ethics principles, including client confidentiality Have demonstrated proficiency in speaking and understandi ng both spoken English and at least one other spoken language Are able to interpret effectively, accurately, and impartially, both receptively and expressly, to and from such language(s) and English, using any necessary specialized vocabulary, terminology and phraseology Minors may not be used as interpreters except in emergency situations involving an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an individual or the public where there is no qualified interpreter for the individual with limited English proficiency immediately available. No one can give permission to use a minor in a non- emergency. You shall not: Require an individual with limited English proficiency to provide his or her own interpreter Rely on an adult accompanying an individual with limited English proficiency to interpret or facilitate communication, except: o In an emergency involving an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of an individual or the public where there is no qualified interpreter for the individual with limited English proficiency immediately available o Where the individual with limited English proficiency specifically request s that the accompanying adult interpret or facilitate communication, the accompanying adult agrees to provide such assistance, and reliance on that adult for such assistance is appropriate under the circumstances Non- compliance may expose you to the risk of violating a consumer's civil rights . This may result in civil rights lawsuits and subject you to lawsuits filed by the Office of Civil Rights. Enforcement and lawsuits may occur up to one year after the Date of Service. You should document all actions taken to comply with this law . This documentation must be accessible and complete. To assist in this area, you are encouraged to: Appoint an employee to oversee compliance ; Make sure aids and services comply with the law ; Draft the required nondiscrimination notice and, if the entity has 15 or more employees, grievance policy ; Review covered services to identify if any changes are needed Conduct training You are responsible for ensuring that patients have a full understanding of their diagnosis and treatment guidelines, regardless of their preferred language. To ensure that all limited English proficient members receive appropriate access to vision care, you are expected to c omply with federal and state requirements regarding cultural and linguistic services. It is not permissible to turn a member away; to limit the member's participation or access to services because of language barriers; to subject a member to unreasonable d elays due to language barriers; or to provide services to LEP members that are lower in quality than those offered in English. Provider Reference Guide | Section 8: Language assistance program 29 Interpreting services Access to free language assistance services for members with LEP is required by various regulations. Interpreters must be professionally trained and versed in medical terminology and health care benefits. You can contact us at 877-542-9235 to arrange language assistance services. A Customer Service Representative will require the following information: Member Information: Member name and identification number Language requested Provider information: Provider name and telephone number Office address Medical record documentation for LAP For all LEP members, it is best practice to document the member's preferred language in paper and/or electronic medical records in the manner that best fits your practice flow. Y ou should attempt to collect and document member's race, ethnicity, and prefer red written language in member's medical record, when possible. If a member refuses or declines interpretive services, you should document the refusal/declination of services in the medical record. This documentation not only protects you and your practic e, it also ensures consistency if your medical records are monitored through site reviews or audits. Documentation of p rovider/ staff language capabilities The provider directory lists fluent languages spoken by you and your office . This information is received via self - reported Provider Demographic Forms updated on a quarterly basis, or whenever there is a demographic change. The information you provide will be used to update our provider database, which is used to generate our provider directories and to provide members with online and automated information to assist them in identifying provider offices that may meet their language needs. Translation of w ritten material Translations of written informational material such as applications, consent forms, denial notices and explanation of payments are available through the member's Health Plan (the number on the back of their Identification Card) . Provider Reference Guide | Section 9: Cultural Competency 30 9.1 Cultural competency We shall ensure that all health plan members receive equitable and effective treatment in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. As a health care provider , you are expected to be culturally sensitive to the diverse population you serve by effectively and appropriately providing services to people of all races, cultures, religions, ethnic backgrounds, education, and medical status in a manner that recognizes values, affirms and respects the worth of each individual member, and protects and preserves the dignity of each. Everyone has the right to receive culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). The care delivered needs to be respectful of the person's believes, practices and unique needs for each and every member. For more information, including national standards and training, we encourage you to visit thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov . What is cultural competency ? Culture refers to integrated patterns of human behavior that include the language, thoughts, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions that unite a group of people. It impacts the care given to members because it describes: Concepts of health, healing How illness, disease, and their causes are perceived The behaviors of patients who are seeking health care Attitudes toward health care providers It also defines health care expectations such as: W ho provides treatment W hat is considered a health problem W hat type of treatm ent W here care is sought How symptoms are expressed How rights and protections are understood And why is it important? Cultural competency is one the main ingredients in closing the disparities gap in health care. It's the way patients and doctors can come together and talk about health concerns without cultural differences hindering the conversation but enhancing it. Quite simply, health care services that are respectful of and responsive to the health beliefs, practices and cultural and linguistic needs of diverse patients can help bring about positive health outcomes. There are many cultural influences that impact the office visit. Cultural preferences to remember include: Do members feel their privacy is respected? Are they the health care decision maker? Does their belief in botanical treatments and healers contradict standard medical practices and does it impact their decisions? What type of language skills and preferences do they use in their interactions? Because health care is a cultural construct based in beliefs about the nature of disease and the human body, cultural issues are actually central in the delivery of health services. Culture impacts every health care encounter . By understanding these influences and by communicating clearly at each visit you fulfill the opportunity to build rapport, help improve adherence and safety.

All providers must be licensed and capabl e to dilate the pupil and perform the physical retina examination. New patients All new patients require a detailed examination of the fundus. This can be accomplished with the pharmacological dilation of the pupil and examination with a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope and a slit lamp fundus lens or the professional review of a wi de- angle fundus image (Optos or equivalent). Established patients Patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes require dilation every year at a minimum, more often if they have retinopathy. Although the retinal imaging method is acceptable in some cases, it is not a substitute for a p hysical binocular retina examination. Care for p atients with diabetes The following actions will assure the care required for patients with diabetes: The history should include the name and, if available, contact information of the Primary Care Physic ian (PCP), or the provider managing the diabetes The history should include a list of all diabetes medications The HA1c should be documented in the chart. This may come from the patient, a lab report, or the PCP Dilation is required every year All common eye changes that result from diabetes should be documented in the medical record. These include, but are not limited to, retinopathy, dry eye, blepharitis, cataract, and low -tension glaucoma The retina examination must be detailed, and subtle background changes should be noted Education and counseling about blood sugar control and the required numbers to prevent vision loss should be emphasized Communication and coordination with the PCP are required. Send a full report of the dilated eye examination resul ts to the PCP and/or diabetes provider. You may contact the Health Plan or PCP to coordinate additional medical needs as identified while providing vision services. Correct coding and billing is required . Include the correct codes for retinopathy on your claim: the appropriate ICD -10 code related to the diagnosis diabetes (2022F, 2023F, Pre-glaucoma Family history Abnormal nerve head o C/D greater than 0.5 o Difference of > 0.2 between NH o NH pallor Abnormal IOP Other signs Testing protocol: o Threshold VF testing Yearly o OCT testing NH cube and Ganglion cell Yearly o Pachymetry One time only Keratoconus Every 18 months Post corneal surgery Yearly o NH photo Yearly o Gonioscopy Mild glaucoma Testing protocol: o Threshold VF testing Yearly o OCT testing NH cube and Ganglion cell Yearly o Pachymetry One time only Keratoconus Every 18 months Post corneal surgery Yearly o NH photo Yearly Moderate glaucoma Testing protocol: o Threshold VF testing Every 6 months o OCT testing NH cube and Ganglion cell Every 6 months o Pachymetry One time only Keratoconus Every 18 months Post corneal surgery Yearly o NH photo Every 6 months Advanced glaucoma Testing protocol: o Threshold VF testing As per a glaucoma specialist o OCT testing NH cube and Ganglion cell As per a glaucoma specialist o Pachymetry As per a glaucoma specialist o NH photo As per a glaucoma specialist Clinical criteria * The state-specific criteria in the Provider Reference Guide (PRG) outline the benefits according to the member's p lan.

The information provided in this document can be used by your IT administrator to implement secure email transmission with March Vision Care. us. For any support questions please call Microsoft Support for m ore details. The following details are from the Microsoft TechNet a rticle \"Article on Secure Your E -mail Traffic .\" 1BSecure Your E -Mail Traffic As part of establishing e-mail coexistence between your local Microsoft Exchange Server environments, we recommend that you implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) send and receive capability in your local Exchange Server environment. This is necessary because, during coexistence with Exchange Online, e-mail that was previously sent and received within your organization will now be sent over the Internet. The instructions in this section describe how to secure e-mail traffic on Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 2003 and Exchange Server 2007. To secure your e -mail traffic wit h TLS, you will require a certificate that is granted by a recognized certification authority (CA). To implement TLS in your local Exchange Server environment, you are required to: Identify the Exchange Server on which to install the certificate. Generat e a certificate request. Acquire the certificate. Install the certificate. Create a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) connector. Enable TLS. 2BStep 1: Identify the Exchange Server on w hich to install the certificate TLS should be enabled on the bridgehead server of your local Exchange Server environment. That is the computer that directs your organization's e-mail to and from the Internet. For more information about bridgehead servers and Exchange Server message routing, see HUExchange Server 2003 Message Routing Topology UH. If you have separate bridgehead servers for sending and receiving e-mail from the Internet, you will need to acquire and install a certificate on the SMTP server of each bridgehead server computer running Exchange Server; however, you will need to set up a connector and enable TLS only on the server that is used for sending e- mail to the Internet. Note If your Exchange Server environment relies on an external relay server to send and receive e-mail to and from the Internet, you will need to contact the administrator of the external service about their TLS support. When TLS has been enabled on the external s ervice, secure e- mail will flow between their relay server and Microsoft Online Services. If you have third- party bridgehead software or service, refer to that documentation to see how you can configure TLS. If you have a local Exchange Server bridgehead server running the standard SMTP virtual server, continue reading this topic. 3BStep 2: Generate a c ertificate request Use the Exchange System Manager in Exchange Server to generate a certificate request on your bridgehead server. You must provide the ful ly qualified domain name (FQDN) of the bridgehead server. For more information, see HUCreating a Certificate or Certificate Request for TLS U. H. 4BStep 3: Acquire the c ertificate Locate a recognized certification authority (CA), such as VeriSign, Comodo, or GoDaddy. Submit the certificate request file t hat you generated in the previous section. The CA will provide you with a certificate (CER) file that contains the certificate for your server. 5BStep 4: Install the certificate Use the Exchange System Manager to install the certificate file. You must provide the path to the certificate file that you received from the CA. Step 5 : Create an SMTP c onnector Based on your current e- mail environment, use one of the following procedures to create an SMTP connector or s end connector. Create 7BTo create an SMTP connector in Exchange 2000 or Exchange 2003 In Exchange System Manager, right -click Connectors , and then click New SMTP Connector . Type a name for the connector (for example, Microsoft Online). On the General tab, select Forward all e -mail through this connector to the following smart host , and then type mail.global.frontbridge.com . Important : U When you use the URL mail.global.frontbridge.com , e-mail messages are routed through servers to follow a path that balances the network load efficiently. If you want e-mail messages to be routed through servers in the United States instead of being routed through servers that might be located in other countries, type the following URL: mail.us.messaging.microsoft.com. Under Local Bridgeheads , click Add, and then select your bridgehead server computer running Exchange Server. On the Address Space tab, click Add , and then type your organization's Microsoft Online Services e- mail routing domain (for example, contoso1.microsoftonline.com). For more information about creating SMTP connectors, see HUHow to configure the SMTP connector in Exchange 200x UH. To create a Send connector in Exchange 2007 Open the Exchange Management Console, and then do one of the following: o On the computer that has the Edge Transport server role installed, select Edge Transport , and then, in the work pane, click the Send Connectors tab. o On the computer with the Hub Transport server role installed, in the console tree, expand Organi zation Configuration , select Hub Transport , and then, in the work pane, click the Send Connectors tab. In the action pane, click New Send connector . The new SMTP Send Connector wizard starts. On the Introduction page, do the following: o In the Name field, t ype a meaningful name for the connector (for example, type Microsoft Online Services) o In the Select the intended use for this Send connector field, select Internet , and then click Next . On the Address Space page, click Add. In the Add Address Space dialog box, in the Address field, type your organization's Microsoft Online Services e-mail routing domain (for example, contoso1.microsoftonline.com), and then click OK . On the Address Space page, click Next . On the Network Settings page, select Route all mail through the following smart hosts , and then click Add . In the Add Smart Host dialog box, select Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) , type mail.global.frontbridge.com , and then click OK . Important : U When you provide the URL mail.global.frontbridge.com, e -mail messages are routed through servers to follow a path that balances the network load efficiently. If you want e -mail messages to be routed through servers in the United States instead of being routed through servers that might be located in other countries, type the following URL: mail.us.messaging.microsoft.com. On the Network Settings page, click Next . On the Configure Smart host authentication settings page, select None, and then click Next . The Source Server page appears only on a computer with the Hub Transport server role installed. By default, the Hub Transport server that you are currently working on is listed as a source server. To add a source server, click Add . In the Select Hub Transport and subscribed Edge Transport servers dialog box, select one or more Hub Transport servers in your organization, and then click OK. 6BStep 6 : Enable TLS After you install the certificate, your server will be able to receive TLS e-mail. However, it cannot send TLS e -mail until you enable TLS. 8BTo enable TLS In Exchange System Manager, expand Connectors and locate the Microsoft Online connector that you created in the previous procedure. Right -click the connector and then click Properties . 1. On the Advanced tab, click Outbound Security, and then select TLS Encryption.

Exhibit P HEDIS and Stars performance reporting Because we administer benefits for medical plans, we are invested in improving members overall health care quality and cost. Including appropriate CPTII and ICD -10 codes on your claims helps us support our health plan partners as they manage members' medical conditions and identify candidates for disease management programs. The inclusion of appropriate codes also improves plan quality as measured by HEDIS and Stars ratings. Appropriate coding limits requests for HEDIS and Stars chart reviews, allowing your practice to spend more time on patient care. We only require CPTII coding for diabetic retinopathy screening at this time. However, you may include additional codes on your claims. Claims for members who have diabetes and present without evidence of retinopathy should include appropriate ICD -10 diagnosis codes and the applicable CPTII code: 2023F, 2025F or 2033F Claims for members who have diabetes and present with evidence of retino pathy should include the appropriate ICD -10 diagnosis code and the applicable CPTII code: 2022F, 2024F or 2026F Claims for members who have diabetes and present with low risk for retinopathy (no evidence of retinopathy in the prior year) should include the appropriate ICD -10 diagnosis code and the applicable CPT II code: 3072F Important: Always bill the appropriate ICD -10 code, including any medical diagnosis codes, at the highest level of specificity . A patient's medical record should always support the CPT, CPTII and ICD -10 codes billed . Normal billing rules apply. The requirements listed here should be included in your billing process. * CPTII codes are tracking codes used for performance measurement. They should be billed in the CPT/HCPCS field on your claim form and submitted on the same claim as the CPT codes.
