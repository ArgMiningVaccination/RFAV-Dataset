TIP 26 Foreword The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agency that leads public health efforts to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities. An important component of SAMHSA's work is focused on dissemination of evidence-based practices and providing training and technical assistance to healthcare practitioners on implementation of these best practices. The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series contributes to SAMHSA's mission by providing science- based, best-practice guidance to the behavioral health feld. TIPs refect careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health service research, demonstrated experience, and implementation requirements. Select nonfederal clinical researchers, service providers, program administrators, and patient advocates comprising each TIP's consensus panel discuss these factors, offering input on the TIP's specifc topics in their areas of expertise to reach consensus on best practices. Field reviewers then assess draft content and the TIP is fnalized. The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIP panelists and reviewers bring to this highly participatory process have helped bridge the gap between the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians and administrators to serve, in the most scientifcally sound and effective ways, people in need of care and treatment of mental and substance use disorders. My sincere thanks to all who have contributed their time and expertise to the development of this TIP . It is my hope that clinicians will fnd it useful and informative to their work. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, M.D., Ph.D. Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ix This page intentionally left blank. TIP 26 Executive Summary Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 26 provides a wide range of guidance in the latest evidence- based screening and assessment approaches, interventions, and services for substance misuse, including substance use disorders (SUDs), in older adults. It is intended for behavioral health service providers, healthcare professionals, and older adults, as well as those people who are signifcant in their lives. Introduction Older adults are a special group because they are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of substances and therefore substance misuse. Further, providers, professionals, and family and caregivers tend to overlook substance misuse in older people, meaning they are less likely than younger adults to be correctly diagnosed and offered treatments, services, or referrals. This oversight makes SUDs particularly dangerous for this population in terms of possible effects on mortality and comorbid conditions (including physical, cognitive, and mental disorders). This TIP is designed to help providers and others better understand how to identify, manage, and prevent substance misuse in older adults. This publication describes the unique ways in which SUD signs and symptoms manifest in older adults; drug and alcohol use disorder (AUD) screening tools, assessments, and treatments specifcally tailored for older clients' needs; the interaction between SUDs and dementia and other cognitive disorders; and strategies to help providers improve their older clients' social functioning and overall wellness\u2014both of which are critical to successful recovery. A consensus panel developed the TIP's content based on a review of the most up-to-date literature and on their extensive experience in the feld of geriatric alcohol and drug addiction treatment. Other professionals also generously contributed their time and commitment to this publication. This publication is an update of the original TIP . The content addresses many of the same key topics and messages, as well as new ones. Revisions refect the most recent scientifc knowledge, clinical advances, and guidance pertaining to preventing and treating substance misuse among older adults. Overall Key Messages Substance misuse in older adults is often overlooked and undertreated. In part, this is because of false beliefs among providers, professionals, and the general public that older adults do not develop or need treatment for drug and alcohol use disorders. Providers and professionals can beneft from an improved awareness about substance misuse in older clients, including how to approach screening, assessment, and treatment. Similarly, family members/caregivers can beneft from information and resources to help them recognize, prevent, and respond to substance misuse in their older loved ones. Empirical evidence supports the use of SUD treatment for older adults\u2014especially when tailored to their age-related needs. The notion that older adults are not interested in or do not respond well to treatment for substance misuse is simply untrue. In fact, when interventions are adapted to the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs of older clients, they are likely to be effective. It is critical that providers and professionals learn about available interventions and local resources so they can treat, serve, or otherwise refer older clients appropriately. xi TIP 26 Like treatments and services, screening and assessment techniques can and should be adapted to older adults. Many instruments have been developed specifcally to detect possible SUDs and common comorbid mental and physical conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, pain) in this population. Age-appropriate screening tools and interventions are available for older adults struggling with alcohol use, illicit drug use, or nonmedical prescription medication use. Comprehensive assessments should explore other areas relevant to older adults and substance misuse, such as their trauma history and risk of current elder abuse, fall risk, cognitive decline, and ability to perform activities of daily living and other functions. Nearly all of us will experience changes in our thinking as we age, but substance misuse can potentially worsen normal age-related changes in cognition. Further, older people already experiencing cognitive conditions, including dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), may have diffculty using substances like alcohol and prescription medications safely and according to recommended guidelines. Alcohol is the most widely used substance among older adults with substance misuse. It is vital that older adults and their family and caregivers receive information about moderate versus high-risk drinking, harmful effects of alcohol misuse, and available treatments for AUD. Providers, professionals, and family and caregivers should be especially watchful for signs and symptoms of nonmedical prescription drug use, including that of opioids and benzodiazepines. Most older adults take at least one prescription medication, and many take more than one. This increases their risk for potentially dangerous drug- drug interactions and drug-alcohol interactions. Older adults often experience reductions in their social network and social functioning as a part of normal aging, but among older individuals with substance misuse, this can be especially problematic. Social support is a critical piece of achieving and sustaining long-term recovery from substance misuse for all people, including Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults older adults. Providers and professionals should be mindful of this and work closely with older clients to help them enhance the size and diversity of their social network, increase their social functioning, and engage in meaningful, recovery-oriented social activities (e.g., mutual-aid support programs, peer recovery support). Recovery is just one part of wellness. To help older clients achieve true health and well-being, be sure to help them address any areas in which functioning may be lacking. This includes their physical functioning, mental health, emotional well-being, intellectual activities, spirituality, work or volunteer activities, and social life. All of these aspects of wellness play a role in recovery and in overall health. Many older adults consume alcohol, but how does one know whether an older adult's alcohol use is a problem? Part of your role is to provide a wide range of education and resources to help older adults and their family or caregivers better understand the risk factors for, signs and symptoms of, and treatments and services available for alcohol misuse. This TIP is divided into nine chapters designed to thoroughly cover all relevant aspects of the ways in which SUDs affect older adults and how providers, professionals, and family members and caregivers can offer treatment, services, support, and resources to help older adults prevent or overcome substance misuse. Content Overview The TIP is divided into chapters to make the material more accessible according to the reader's interests. Below is a summary of each TIP chapter's main messages and key content areas. Chapter 1: Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue This chapter lays the foundation for understanding the scope and importance of substance misuse as a problem among older aged populations. It is for a variety of audiences (e.g., providers, professionals, administrators, informal and formal caregivers, family). xii TIP 26 This chapter emphasizes the fact that substance misuse is indeed a serious\u2014and increasing\u2014 problem among older adults. SUDs tend to be underrecognized by providers, professionals, and family and caregivers in part because of false beliefs that drug and alcohol addiction is only a \"young person's disease\" and that older clients are not interested and willing to engage in treatment or services. These myths contribute to low rates of diagnosis, treatment, and service provision among older persons and interfere with their chances for recovery. Most providers and professionals do not have specialized training in geriatric substance misuse, and most family members and caregivers do not know how to recognize and respond to these problems in older adults. This chapter helps fll these knowledge gaps by laying out the facts and statistics, many from large-scale surveys and empirical research, that underscore how problematic drug and alcohol addiction truly is for older adults. In Chapter 1, you will learn that: Even though rates of drug and alcohol addiction are higher among adolescents and younger adults, SUDs can and do occur in older persons. Substance misuse is not something that only occurs in younger people. These ageist beliefs are a large reason why we see low rates of diagnosis and treatment/services in the older adult population. Substance misuse among older individuals is very dangerous and can increase their risk of death and other physical harms. Older persons are vulnerable to negative drug and alcohol interactions with prescription medications, adverse reactions from illicit drugs and prescription medications, and the harmful effects of alcohol. Not only are rates of illicit drug use among older adults growing, rates of co-occurring mental disorders are also high. As the number of older individuals in the U.S. population increases, the need for treatment providers and programs that understand and can respond to the needs of older adults with SUDs also will likely rise over time. Older adults with SUDs are more likely to misuse alcohol than any other substance. This is concerning because older individuals' bodies do not metabolize alcohol as effciently as those of younger people, increasing their risk of cognitive and physical problems, like confusion and falls. Most older adults take at least one medication, and many take more than one. This makes substance use and misuse even more dangerous because of potentially deadly or otherwise harmful interactions between prescription medications and drugs and alcohol. Like their younger counterparts, some older adults do engage in nonmedical prescription medication use, including nonmedical use of opioids and benzodiazepines. Providers and professionals may struggle to identify SUDs in older clients because symptoms can be hard to recognize and do not necessarily mirror diagnostic criteria. For example, changes in thinking attributable to alcohol misuse may appear similar to normal age-related changes in cognition. Although the idea that older adults are unwilling to seek treatment or services for substance misuse is false, certain barriers can make this population less likely to seek treatment. These barriers include negative attitudes among providers, professionals, or family/caregivers; denial on the part of the older adult; lack of knowledge about substance misuse among family and caregivers; and lack of provider awareness about available and effective treatment and services. Multiple treatment approaches for SUDs exist that are effective for older adults. These include screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment; brief structured treatment; patient education; relapse prevention methadone, buprenorphine, naloxone). xiii TIP 26 Chapter 2: Principles of Care for Older Adults This chapter describes guiding principles for evidence-based, effective, and safe treatments and services for older adults with substance misuse. This chapter will most beneft providers. Older adults are a diverse and unique population, and their SUD treatment and service needs typically differ somewhat from those of younger adults. Providers should understand developmental differences but also generational differences (e.g., baby boomers versus earlier cohorts) among their older clients. Age-sensitive and age-specifc interventions can help increase older adults' chances of achieving and sustaining long-term recovery. The treatment/service environment itself also should be adapted to this population, for example, through organization-wide training and encouragement of staff attitudes responsive to older clients' needs. Consider each older client's cultural background, gender, and age of onset of an SUD, all of which can infuence treatment needs and recovery outcomes. In Chapter 2, you will learn the following: To give older clients the best opportunities to access and beneft from substance use treatment and services, you must acknowledge, respect, and respond to differences among populations of older individuals. This includes differences in generation, age of and reason for substance misuse onset, gender, recovery needs and wishes, attitudes about substance use/misuse, available support network, and more. In short, providers must remember that no two older clients are alike. Organizations should create a treatment/ service environment that gives older clients the best chances for successful recovery. This means considering how the physical environment, as well as staff skills, services, abilities, and policies, can be tailored to overcome any age-related barriers. Older adults are diverse in gender, race/ ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Bias and discrimination can occur as easily as in any other age group. Take time to learn how such Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults diversity may infuence your clients' late-life substance misuse, health disparities, and access to care. Early identifcation, education, and intervention, even if brief and informal, are important because substance misuse in older adults is often unrecognized by older adults themselves, as well as by their family members, friends, and healthcare and social service providers. As a provider, you should learn the signs and symptoms of SUDs in older adults and be prepared to respond appropriately when they appear. This includes performing routine screening and assessment for substance misuse. For older adults uninterested in abstinence, provide health risk reduction services, such as education on the health benefts of reducing alcohol use. Person-centered care is the preferred approach for this population and emphasizes older clients' values, needs, and preferences from among a menu of care options. Age-sensitive approaches include those that are tailored to older clients' physical needs (e.g., diffculties with mobility, hearing, vision, or a combination of these), cognitive problems (e.g., memory and attention diffculties), learning needs (e.g., using a slower pace, repeating information), and age-related preferences (e.g., desiring age-specifc rather than mixed-age group treatment). Investing time and money in developing an age-sensitive workforce throughout your organization is important. Staff recruitment, hiring, retention, supervision, and professional development strategies should include a focus on understanding evidence-based approaches that are effective and appropriate for older adults. Older adults with substance misuse can beneft greatly from social support and community resources. Keep on hand a listing of resources and referrals, and help older clients access and engage in these services. Including caregivers throughout treatment and services (as appropriate) and providing them with education and resources (including access to case managers) can improve older clients' recovery chances. Not only will this xiv TIP 26 help them better understand the nature of SUDs and the recovery process, it can help reduce caregiver burden and stress, which, if unaddressed, can affect their own health as well as that of the older adult with the SUD. Chapter 3: Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse in Older Adults This chapter addresses how, when, and why to use screening and assessment for substance misuse in older clients. This chapter will most beneft behavioral health service providers, social service providers, and other healthcare professionals and paraprofessionals. Identifcation, screening, and assessment are critical steps to linking older adults with substance misuse to needed treatment and services. Older adults' signs and symptoms of SUDs can be diffcult to spot, however. By learning the steps to accurate and effective screening and assessment, you increase the chances of older adults receiving timely and appropriate care. This means taking a comprehensive approach that not only focuses on specifc drug and alcohol use disorders but also on related conditions that infuence (or are infuenced by) substance misuse. These conditions include co-occurring mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), certain physical problems (like chronic pain and sleep disorders), cognitive impairment, falls, trauma, and abuse (history and current experiences), and everyday functioning. In Chapter 3, you will learn the following: Screening and assessment for SUDs in older persons can be challenging because the signs and symptoms are not necessarily the same as those in younger adults and do not always mirror diagnostic criteria. To ensure proper and timely identifcation of problems, you should learn how to recognize and overcome these challenges. As a provider, you should regularly screen your older clients for substance misuse, at least annually. Also consider screening if the client displays signs or symptoms that are concerning, if the client or family/caregiver reports substance-related diffculties, or if you otherwise suspect substance misuse may be present. Numerous screening instruments are available that have been developed for or tested and approved for use with older persons. These include instruments to help you screen for alcohol misuse, illicit drug use, and nonmedical prescription medication use. Older adult screeners are also available to help you explore related areas, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, cognition, pain, and daily functioning. When communicating screening results, you should praise clients for fndings that indicate abstinence, and follow up on fndings that indicate substance-related problems. Be sure to also occasionally rescreen older clients even if their fndings suggest no problems are present. You should follow up on screening that indicates a potential substance-related problem by conducting an assessment. Brief assessments can occur immediately after screening. More thorough, comprehensive assessments are lengthier and may require a separate appointment. Comprehensive assessment for SUDs is a multistep process that will help you determine whether substance misuse is truly present and differentiate SUDs from possible co-occurring disorders (CODs), physical conditions common in older populations, and signs of normal aging. You should fully explore older clients' psychological, medical, family, vocational or retirement-related, social, sexual, fnancial, legal, substance use, and substance-related treatment histories. Also ask about older clients' fall risk, abuse potential, skills and abilities, and functional status. Not all clients who screen positive will need formal substance use treatment. For older clients with or at risk for mild or moderate substance misuse, a brief intervention may be suffcient (e.g., education, motivational interviewing). For older adults with moderate-to-severe SUDs, formal treatment may be necessary. xv TIP 26 Chapter 4: Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults This chapter discusses key aspects of alcohol misuse and the screening, assessment, and treatment of/services for binge drinking and AUD. It will most beneft healthcare, behavioral health, and social service providers working with older adults (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, alcohol and drug counselors, and peer providers). Alcohol is the most commonly used substance among older individuals with an SUD or substance-related problems. Although widespread screening is an effective method of detecting alcohol-related problems in this population, many providers and professionals fail to screen because of false beliefs (e.g., that older people do not experience AUD or would not be interested in treatment) and lack of knowledge about the importance of widespread screening. For older clients in need of treatment, services, referrals, or some combination thereof, you should use age-sensitive and age-specifc approaches to care that respect and respond to the unique needs of older adults. A wide range of interventions are available to draw from, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options. In Chapter 4, you will learn about: The ways in which older adults are at risk for harm from alcohol misuse, including age-specifc health effects as well as negative co-occurring mental and social conditions. The need to screen all older adults for alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems. Screening is especially important in primary care and emergency department settings, where older adults are often seen for co-occurring conditions like chronic pain and falls. Screening is necessary in certain situations, like following major life changes (e.g., retirement [especially if forced or unwanted], loss of a signifcant other), when starting a new medication, and as part of an annual physical exam. Measures developed and approved for use with older populations, such as the Alcohol Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Use Disorders Identifcation Test and the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test-Geriatric Version. The ways to respond appropriately to older clients who screen positively for alcohol misuse or alcohol-related problems. As a provider, remember that not all diagnostic criteria for AUD apply to older adults in the same way they apply to younger adults. For instance, older adults may report reduced socialization, but this is common with aging and not necessarily a sign that drinking is interfering with social abilities. The ways in which prescription medications can interact negatively with alcohol. This is critical information for providers and professionals because most of your older clients will be taking at least one prescription medication. Older adults taking numerous prescriptions or taking certain medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, antidepressants, blood thinners) are especially at risk for potentially harmful alcohol-drug interactions. The steps to guiding older clients through the continuum of care for substance misuse, including brief interventions, prevention strategies, outpatient care, inpatient rehabilitation, follow-up services, referrals, and recovery management. Adapting treatment and services for age-specifc needs of older adults, including clinical approaches (e.g., nonconfrontational and supportive approaches), treatment and service structure (e.g., fexible scheduling, shorter sessions), and content needs (e.g., focus on increasing behavioral change, quality of life, and social connectedness). You also should be aware of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions and their effectiveness and safety for use with older adults. Chapter 5: Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults This chapter discusses age-appropriate interventions and services for older adults with substance misuse (non-alcohol-related), including illicit drug use and nonmedical prescription medication use. This chapter will most beneft xvi TIP 26 healthcare, behavioral health, and social service providers who work with older adults (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, alcohol and drug counselors, peer recovery support specialists). Older adults can and do develop SUDs involving illicit drugs and nonmedical use of prescription medication. Many older adults take multiple medications and may be unaware of potential harms arising from substance misuse (e.g., overdose; dangerous interactions with alcohol and with other medications; increased risk of physical, mental, and cognitive problems). Age-specifc, evidence-based treatments and services are available for older clients with these conditions, including SUDs involving opioids, cannabis, stimulants, and benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics. There is no \"wrong door\" by which older adults access care for drug addiction, and as a provider, you should ensure education, formal and informal treatment, services, and referrals are available throughout the entire course of care, from prevention through continuing care and recovery management. In Chapter 5, you will learn that: Prescription medication misuse can be unintentional, underscoring the importance of educating your older clients about how to take medication correctly (including avoiding harmful interactions). Older adults are at risk for opioid addiction, given the high prevalence of chronic pain in this population. Opioid overdose prevention strategies, detoxifcation, and medication can be used safely and effectively with this population. Illicit substance use (e.g., opioids, cannabis, stimulants) does occur among older adults and can be treated using behavioral and pharmacological methods. Routine screening and assessment will help you detect substance misuse early and accurately. Thoroughly explore not just the client's substance misuse (current and past) but also other health behaviors (e.g., exercise, diet), changes in physical and mental functioning, and major life events that may put the person at risk for substance misuse (e.g., retirement, moving, loss of a loved one). A full assessment should cover topics like co-occurring medical and mental conditions, sleep problems, occurrence of pain, fall risk, and daily functioning. Diagnostic criteria for SUDs may not fully apply to older clients. Older clients' substance-related signs and symptoms may differ from those in the diagnostic criteria and in younger adults. Older adults with SUDs can beneft from a wide range of age-sensitive and age-specifc treatment and services across the continuum of care, including prevention strategies, early and brief interventions, formal inpatient and outpatient treatment, and recovery management techniques. Mutual-aid support programs and family involvement are important components of the continuum of care for older adults with SUDs. Social support and connectedness are often lacking in older adults and can help those with substance misuse achieve and sustain recovery, optimal functioning, and good quality of life. Chapter 6: Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment This chapter outlines the ways in which substance misuse can affect (and be affected by) declines in thinking, including the occurrence of dementia. This chapter will most beneft behavioral health, healthcare, and primary care service providers and prevention specialists who offer direct care to clients in behavioral health and healthcare settings and care for older adults who misuse substances. Changes in thinking, like diffculties with memory, attention, and learning, are a normal part of aging for most of us. But for older adults with substance misuse, these changes in thinking can be more severe and may develop faster than in the absence of substance misuse. Substance misuse can increase the risk of certain cognitive problems and can make managing those cognitive problems more diffcult. Furthermore, problems with thinking may make it harder for some older adults to remember how to take xvii TIP 26 prescription medication appropriately or keep track of their alcohol consumption to ensure it does not exceed recommended guidelines. In other words, cognitive disorders can increase older adults' chances of experiencing substance-related problems. The key to offering timely and effective treatment is to engage in routine screening and assessment to detect potential cognitive impairment, like dementia and MCI, as soon as possible. There are many age-appropriate interventions and services you can offer (or offer referrals for) to help maintain or improve older clients' mood, functioning, and quality of life. Involving caregivers is also important to make sure clients struggling with their thinking take prescription medication correctly, avoid or consume safe amounts of alcohol, avoid illicit drugs, and stay engaged in treatment and services. In Chapter 6, you will learn about: Facts that show substance misuse can and does occur in older adults, particularly alcohol misuse. The latest research on the effects of substances and certain medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) on cognition and brain functioning in general. The link between substance misuse and the risk of developing cognitive disorders in the future, such as dementia and MCI. The many mental disorders/symptoms that co-occur with substance misuse and that negatively infuence thinking, such as depression and depressive symptoms, anxiety, and PTSD and trauma. If offering treatment or services for older clients' substance misuse, it is critical to screen and assess for these mental disorders/symptoms because, if present and untreated, cognitive problems may persist. Screening instruments developed for and tested in populations of older individuals are available. These tools will help you detect possible co-occurring mental disorders as well as cognitive impairment. The numerous interventions for older clients with substance misuse and co-occurring behavioral health and cognitive disorders, Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults including education, drug and alcohol counseling, brief counseling, referral to mutual-aid support programs and peer-recovery programs, and other interventions that do not involve pharmacotherapy. Why including caregivers is essential for successfully treating older adults with substance misuse and co-occurring dementia or MCI. Additionally, your role is to help ensure caregivers have the support and resources they need to maintain their own health and well-being (including avoiding substance misuse themselves). Chapter 7: Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults This chapter outlines ways to help older clients with substance misuse leverage social supports and other wellness strategies to improve their chances of achieving and maintaining long-term recovery. This chapter will most beneft healthcare, behavioral health, and social service providers who work with older adults (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, alcohol and drug counselors, and peer recovery support specialists). Strong social networks are an essential part of older adults' health and well-being. You can help increase older adults' chances of recovery by offering interventions, services, and resources that target social supports and other aspects of wellness, like health literacy, illness management, and relapse prevention. Social isolation is unfortunately common among many older individuals and has been linked to risky behaviors, including substance misuse, as well as poor physical, cognitive, and mental health. But you can help older clients enhance their social functioning as a part of recovery treatment/services through interventions that expand your clients' social network, increase their feelings of connectedness, promote neighborhood/community supports, and engage their family members in recovery activities. In addition to addressing socialization, do not overlook other areas of health and well-being that may help enhance recovery efforts and xviii TIP 26 improve quality of life. This includes the older adult's physical health, emotional well-being, spirituality, vocational or volunteer work, and more. In Chapter 7, you will learn that: Declines in social functioning are a normal part of aging for many individuals, but you can (and should) help older clients with substance misuse do something about this. By helping older adults increase and enhance their social network and feelings of connectedness, you are at the same time also helping them improve their chances of overcoming substance misuse. You should help older clients with substance misuse expand the size and diversity of their social network, engage neighborhood and community supports, and involve family members or caregivers in their recovery. Be sure to offer recovery-specifc social supports, like mutual-aid support programs and peer support programs, among your services and referral options. Area Agencies on Aging are wonderful sources of information, support, and services to help your older clients engage in social support and other healthy activities. Online social networks, though often associated only with adolescents and young adults, also are a potential useful resource for older adults. Explore whether your older clients are interested in and need help accessing social media and related technologies; they can be an asset for older individuals who experience barriers to establishing or growing a social network of support. In addition to focusing on social functioning, help older clients with substance misuse establish all-around wellness by addressing multiple areas of functioning, like their physical health, spirituality, emotional health, fnances, work, and cognition. All of these can play an important role in recovery. Wellness recovery activities keep your older clients engaged in all aspects of life, health, and well-being. Brainstorm ideas together and link your clients to a wide range of wellness activities, like exercising, joining a spiritual or religious fellowship, creating a safe and welcoming living environment, enrolling in adult education or senior college courses, and volunteering. Complementary therapies and activities, like animal-assisted therapy, may help your older clients improve certain aspects of their physical, social, and emotional health. But be sure to discuss with them both the benefts and potential limitations of these strategies. Older adults should learn self-management techniques to independently monitor and improve their health. This is important for addressing chronic illnesses, like heart disease and chronic pain, which often affect older individuals and, if unmanaged, can lead to signifcant impairments in functioning and quality of life. By learning to independently track and manage their symptoms, clients feel empowered and gain control of their health. This also applies to recovery; by continuing to engage in recovery activities, use relapse prevention techniques, and rely on social supports, older clients can strengthen their resilience and maintain a sense of control over their recovery. Chapter 8: Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? This chapter focuses on older adults' alcohol consumption and key facts and information they (and family members/caregivers) should know about alcohol use and misuse. This chapter is for older adults who drink (including those with questions about how much they should drink), their caregivers, and their families. Many older adults drink alcohol but do not develop alcohol misuse or other alcohol-related problems. Understandably, they may have questions about what defnes a \"safe\" level of consumption; the signs, symptoms, and effects of alcohol misuse; and how, why, and when to seek professional treatment or services. Family and caregivers should be similarly armed with this information so they can offer support to an older signifcant other in need of care for alcohol misuse. In Chapter 8, you will learn about: Guidelines that defne \"moderate\" and \"at-risk/high-risk\" amounts of alcohol for xix TIP 26 adults, including what counts as one drink. Keep in mind that what is high risk for older adults is often different than what is high risk for younger individuals, because older adults experience the negative effects of alcohol at lower amounts. The causes of older adults' alcohol misuse, such as certain stressful major life events (e.g., forced retirement, death of a signifcant other), increased isolation, physical disability, and boredom/lack of meaningful activities or hobbies. The signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse in older adults, including cognitive, physical, emotional, social, and behavioral conditions. Aspects of alcohol use that can lead to or worsen health conditions. How to make sense of media reports that suggest light or moderate drinking is healthy. Which medications can have harmful interactions with alcohol and what those interactions include. Tips and strategies for older adults who want to try to manage their alcohol misuse on their Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults own and how to tell when it is time to seek help from a professional. The steps that occur when a person accesses professional treatment or services, such as screening, assessment, and follow-up visits. Also, you will learn about treatment options across the continuum of care, including formal and informal interventions, and how to select the best-ftting treatment. Ways to engage family and friends in support of recovery, as well as self-motivation strategies. Vital information for family and caregivers, like warning signs of alcohol misuse, helping an older adult access professional care, and the importance of self-care.

TIP 26TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN OLDER ADULTS Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue KEY MESSAGES Chapter 1 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) benefts all audiences (providers, supervisors, administrators, older adults, caregivers, and family members). It summarizes the extent of substance use and substance misuse, including substance use disorders (SUDs), among older adults. Chapter 1 will help you understand the current situation and trends to gain an overall, broad understanding of this critical issue. This TIP is for all audiences who provide care and support to older adults, including older adults themselves as well as individuals who are connected to an older adult, such as family members, friends, formal and informal caregivers, behavioral health service and healthcare providers, and aging services providers. Organization of This TIP Chapter 1 contains information of value to all audiences: it is an overview of substance misuse and addiction treatment among older adults. Chapter 1 also defnes terms and summarizes issues to help clients and providers communicate more clearly with each other. Exhibit 1.1 defnes important terms this TIP uses. Estimated rates of substance misuse in older adults vary widely. Substance misuse by this population is underrecognized and undertreated. Substance misuse can be very dangerous for older adults. They are affected by substances differently than younger adults, and smaller amounts of substances can have more of an impact. Substance misuse by older adults can worsen any chronic medical conditions they may have. Older adults also often take more than one medication, which increases their odds of being exposed to harmful drug interactions. It is never too late to stop misusing substances, no matter one's age. Treatment for older adults is available. Providers need to learn about effective interventions for older adults so that they can offer treatment or referrals for treatment quickly and appropriately. 1 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 1.1. Key Terms Addiction*: The most severe form of SUD, associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Age-specifc: Treatment approaches and practices specifcally developed for older adults (e.g., an older adult specialty group in a mixed-age SUD treatment program). Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). At-risk/high-risk drinking: Drinking alcohol in excessive amounts. This defnition encompasses both binge drinking and heavy drinking. Additionally, any alcohol consumption is considered risky when carried out by individuals with certain medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, those taking medicine that can interact harmfully with alcohol, those driving a car or engaged in other activities that require alertness, or people recovering from AUD. 1,2 Note that for purposes of this TIP, at-risk drinking and high-risk drinking are synonymous and either term is acceptable to describe an older adult's drinking patterns. Binge drinking: A drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. This usually takes place after four or more drinks for women and fve or more drinks for men. 3,4 However, older adults are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and treatment providers may need to lower these numbers when screening for alcohol misuse.5 Additionally, other factors such as weight, decrease in enzyme activity, and body composition (e.g., amount of muscle tissue present in the body) can also affect alcohol absorption rates. Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living, including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 6 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Drug-drug interaction: The interaction of one substance (e.g., alcohol, medication, an illicit drug) with another substance. Drug-drug interactions may change the effectiveness of medications, introduce or alter the intensity of side effects, and increase a substance's toxicity or the concentration of that substance in a person's blood. Potentially serious interactions can also occur with certain foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. 7 Heavy drinking: Consuming fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women in one period on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days.8 Illicit substances: Illicit substances include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and prescription medications that are taken other than as prescribed (e.g., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives). Moderate drinking: According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defned as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 9,10 However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over several days. 11 Additionally, individuals who don't metabolize alcohol well may need to consume even lower quantities. Some people, particularly those with certain alcohol-related illnesses or engaging in tasks requiring concentration, should not consume alcohol at all. The Dietary Guidelines stipulate that those who don't drink should not begin drinking for any reason. 12 Continued on next page Chapter 1 2 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Continued Psychoactive substances: Substances that can alter mental processes (e.g., cognition or affect; in other words, the way one thinks or feels). Also called psychotropic drugs, such substances will not necessarily produce dependence, but they have the potential for misuse or abuse. 13 Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When those positive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder. The ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defnes remission as present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving). 14 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Sensitivity: The extent to which a substance affects someone physiologically. Aging causes people to develop increasing sensitivity to substances. As a person ages, a given dose of a substance will have a greater physiological impact than it did when the person was younger. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to DSM-5, 15 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function, and by impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions of DSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerly called substance dependence. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Chapter 1 3 TIP 26 Who Can Beneft From This TIP and How? The demand for services to address substance misuse in older adults is increasing. All healthcare, behavioral health, and aging service/ long-term care providers need training in working on substance misuse-related problems with older adults, their families and friends, and formal and informal caregivers. 16,17 Such providers include primary and specialty healthcare providers, case workers, social workers, psychologists, drug and alcohol counselors, peer recovery support specialists, clergy, providers of aging-related services, and direct care workers. ~23% of SUD treatment programs in the U.S. offer services tailored to OLDER ADULTS.18 Caregivers and families need resources to help navigate initial identifcation, screening, assessment, and treatment options for older people who misuse substances or have SUDs. Key societal changes have made this a critical time to address substance misuse in the aging population: Substance use and SUDs among older adults are rising: -Illicit drug use is more common among current older adults than among previous generations of older adults. Current 65-and-older individuals and aging baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) are more likely than members of previous generations to use illicit drugs. -SUDs among older adults are expected to continue increasing. Rapidly growing numbers of older adults will need substance misuse prevention and counseling, and sometimes SUD treatment services, particularly to address nonmedical use of prescription medication. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Substance use and chronic health conditions have compound effects on older individuals. Chronic health conditions in older adults can complicate the effects of their substance use, increasing their need for comprehensive, integrated services. 19 Likewise, substance use can complicate the management of chronic conditions. 20 Older adults are increasingly willing to seek services. Baby boomers tend to view addiction treatment as more acceptable than previous generations have. 21,22 As baby boomers continue to enter old age, the number of older people needing treatment will continue to increase\u2014 and so therefore will the overall percentage willing to seek treatment. However, feelings of shame and stigma linked to SUD treatment settings cause many older adults to seek addiction care from providers who do not specialize in addiction treatment, including primary care and emergency department providers. 23 Older adults are affected by co-occurring mental disorders and SUDs. In the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH): 24 - 1.5 percent of Americans ages 50 and older (1.7 million) had any past-year mental illness and SUD; an estimated 0.5 percent (607,000) reported both a past-year serious mental illness (SMI) and a past-year SUD. - 37 percent with a past-year SUD also had any mental illness; 13 percent, an SMI. - 11 percent of older adults with any mental illness in the past year also had an SUD. - 18 percent of older adults with an SMI in the past year also had an SUD. Few providers specialize in dealing with geriatric substance use. Much research has been done with older adult populations, but guidance has lagged on implementing research fndings in ways that will improve services. This TIP flls gaps in the feld by focusing on ways to implement and improve the delivery of SUD treatment based on evidence and promising practices specifcally for older adults. Current gaps include: Chapter 1 4 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue A science-to-service gap in resources for providers. Few service improvement resources focus on tailoring treatment services for older clients with SUDs who may also have co-occurring physical disabilities or mental disorders. A gap in addiction treatment resources for clients, their families and friends, and caregivers. Free, user-friendly publications that inform older clients and those close to them about substance use and addiction services are diffcult to fnd. When reading this TIP, remember that some misuse is accidental or inadvertent. For example, individuals who are unaware of a medication's potential to cause dependence or other harms may consume more than prescribed. Other individuals may have diffculty in monitoring when they have taken their medication and take more than the recommended dose. Some individuals may become substance dependent even though they take their medication as prescribed. The pathway to misuse helps guide the selection of interventions and, if necessary, treatment. Accidental misuse stills requires a response. Overview and Scope of the Substance Misuse Problem Older Adults Today The Older Adult Population The older adult population is becoming more diverse. In the coming decades, the percentage of non-Hispanic White older adults in the U.S. population is projected to drop, whereas the percentages of Hispanics and races other than White are expected to increase. Gender ratios are also changing. The gap between the number of women and men is beginning to narrow because of the increased life expectancy of men, especially among men ages 85 years and older. 25 Healthcare and behavioral health service providers and caregivers must understand this diversity to provide culturally responsive services, including interventions and treatments for alcohol and other substance misuse. 26 Providers should also recognize differences between generations of older adults that may make some older adults more willing than others to discuss addiction and mental illness with their healthcare providers. The number of older adults with SUDs is increasing. The U.S. population of older adults increasingly consists of baby boomers. Baby boomers came of age at a time when substance use tended to be more culturally acceptable, making them more open to and less judgmental about substance use than prior generations. (Not all subgroups of baby boomers experienced this openness and freedom from judgment about substance use, such as racially and ethnically diverse populations.) Because of baby boomers' exposure to drugs and alcohol at a younger age, their generation has higher rates of past or current SUDs compared with previous generations. 27,28 These changes in older adult demographics will have major consequences for SUD prevention and treatment programs. Shifts in the older population will strain retirement systems, healthcare facilities, and other services. A rapidly increasing number of older adults will need comprehensive, integrated, age-specifc SUD screening, assessment, and treatment services. 29 Substance Misuse Among Older Adults Substance misuse in older adults is dangerous and potentially deadly. They have increased vulnerability to alcohol and to adverse drug reactions (whether the drugs are prescription or illicit) 30 because of physiological and mental changes associated with aging. Such changes include slower metabolism and lower body fat. This increased vulnerability makes identifying SUDs in older adults especially critical. Chapter 1 5 TIP 26 SUDs do occur in older adults, although less often than in younger people. Of adults ages 65 and older in the 2012-2013 Wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC III): 2.3 percent had a 12-month AUD, and 13.4 percent had a lifetime AUD. 31 0.8 percent had a past-year drug use disorder, and 2 percent had any lifetime drug use disorder. 32 Substance misuse rates in older adults vary by gender, race/ethnicity, and education level: In NESARC III, past-year cannabis use was reported by about 4 percent of non-Hispanic Whites, 6 percent of non-Hispanic Blacks, 3 percent of Hispanics, 0.7 percent of Asians, and 11 percent of American Indians/Alaska Natives ages 50 and older. 33 In the 2004-2005 Wave of NESARC, past-year prevalence of any SUD in adults 55 and older was: 34 -3.9 percent for non-Hispanic Whites, 3.6 percent for African Americans, 3.3 percent for Hispanics, 3.0 percent for American Indians/Alaska Natives, and 1.7 percent for Asian/Native Hawaiian/other Pacifc Islanders. -2.9 percent for individuals with less than a high school education, 3.1 percent for individuals with a high school education, and 4.5 percent for those with at least some college. Older adults are often willing to seek help for substance misuse or SUDs, as they are tending to take more accepting views about addiction treatment. 35 Yet negative attitudes (sometimes termed \"ageism\") about older adults' ability to recover from addiction persist, despite evidence that treatment is effective in reducing or stopping substance misuse and improving older adults' health and quality of life. 36,37,38,39,40,41 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Substance misuse, including SUDs, among older adults often goes unrecognized and untreated. Societal norms, values, and biases play a large role in this phenomenon. Some people hold the ageist false belief that SUDs do not exist or need no treatment in this age group. Others\u2014even some healthcare providers\u2014mistake SUD symptoms for normal age-related changes. Some healthcare providers may focus more on older adults' reports of physical/medical complaints. Similarly, some older adults may deny or hide their substance use-related problems from their healthcare providers. 42 Current cultural biases tend to minimize the scope of substance misuse among older adults, but this public health concern is more urgent than ever. Prevalence and Characteristics of Substance Use Among Older Adults Alcohol Alcohol is the substance that older adults use and misuse most frequently. The 2019 NSDUH43 found that, in individuals ages 65 and older, an estimated 5.6 million (10.7 percent) engaged in past-month binge alcohol use and an estimated 1.5 million (2.8 percent) engaged in past-month heavy alcohol use. The survey also showed that 903,000 adults ages 60 to 64 and 1.04 million adults ages 65 and older met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. These numbers were similar among slightly younger groups of older adults, with 939,000 adults ages 50 to 54 and 1.02 million adults ages 55 to 59 meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Exhibit 1.2 shows what constitutes a standard drink by type of alcohol. Chapter 1 6 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue EXHIBIT 1.2.

Image adapted from material in the public domain. 44 In healthcare settings, up to 15 percent of older patients may meet criteria for at-risk drinking. 45,46,47 For example, one study48 of 24,863 adults ages 65 and older in military and civilian healthcare clinics found that 9.2 percent of men and 2.1 percent of women regularly drank in excess of federal guidelines. The study found that 21.5 percent of patients drank moderately, 4.1 percent engaged in at-risk drinking, and 4.5 percent drank heavily or engaged in binge drinking. Among those who drank moderately, 10.2 percent had engaged in heavy episodic drinking one to three times in the past 3 months. The Dietary Guidelines defne moderate drinking as consuming up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Exceeding these numbers can lead to high-risk drinking. Older adults who drink at all in the following situations are also engaging in high-risk drinking: 49 While taking certain prescription medications (such as opioids or sedatives) Despite having a medical condition that drinking could worsen (like diabetes or heart disease) When planning to drive a car or engage in other activities that require alertness While recovering from AUD Older clients who engage in heavy drinking are at risk for worsening of existing health problems (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, mood disorders, cancer). 50,51,52 In addition, certain life stressors53,54 are linked to increased risk of alcohol misuse in older adults and could cause existing health problems to worsen. Such life stressors include: Financial strain. Job loss/retirement. Housing changes. Bereavement. Being a victim of theft. As adults age, they metabolize alcohol differently and become more sensitive to its effects even when they drink less. 55 This increases risk of confusion, falls, and injury, and worsens existing health issues. Chapter 1 7 TIP 26 Establishing clients' history of use can help providers recognize possible substance use concerns in the future. Taking a history is also an opportunity to offer prevention messages and encouragement to individuals maintaining abstinence or very low use. Older adults are more likely to take medications that interact badly with alcohol. Exhibit 1.3 lists some of these \"alcohol-interactive\" (AI) medications. In a review of 20 studies on reported use of alcohol and AI medication, more than half of individuals who used AI medication reported drinking alcohol. 56 Another study found that 77.8 percent of older adults who drank alcohol also took AI medications. 57 EXHIBIT 1.3. Potential AI Medications58 Medications to control heart or circulatory problems like arrhythmia or high blood pressure Diuretics, sometimes called water pills Seizure medications Antianxiety medications Muscle relaxers Pain medications, including opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone) and nonsteroidal anti-infammatory medications (e.g., ibuprofen) Medications to control diabetes Antidepressants Older adults who drink and regularly take AI medications may experience severe negative reactions (e.g., falls, gastrointestinal bleeding, low blood pressure, drowsiness, heart problems, liver damage). 59 Drinking can also make these medications less effective in treating health conditions. Healthcare and behavioral health service providers should discuss the risks of combining alcohol and AI prescription medications with older clients, especially those with a history of alcohol use. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Prescription Medications Most older adults take at least one prescription medication. Many take more than one. According to national estimates released in 2019, 60 87.5 percent of older adults in the United States have at least one prescribed medication, and 39.8 percent take fve or more prescription medications at the same time. From 2015 to 2016, the percentage of adults taking a prescription medication was greater for the 65 and older age group (87.5 percent) than for any other adult age group. High prescription medication use puts older adults at greater risk than the general population for harmful side effects and drug-drug interactions, especially when they use over-the-counter (OTC) medications in addition to their prescriptions. 61 Many prescription medications may interact badly with alcohol (Exhibit 1.3) and other substances, compounding this risk. Additionally, older individuals are more likely to experience negative side effects from prescription medications because of aging-related changes that alter how the body processes such substances. 62 # of older adults who VISITED the ER because of the prescription opioid TRAMADOL increased 481% from 2005 to 2011.63 In addition, older adults may make medication errors (e.g., take too much, forget to take medications) because they have diffcult or complex medication regimens. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 64 50 percent of emergency department visits for adverse drug events in Medicare recipients are caused by four medication types: medications for diabetes (e.g., insulin), oral blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), anti-blood-clotting medications (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel), and opioid pain relievers. Many older adults take numerous medications, thus increasing their chances of making errors. Chapter 1 8 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Adults 65 and older are particularly vulnerable to misusing prescription medications. Prescription medication misuse involves taking a medication other than as prescribed, whether accidently or on purpose. In 2019, the most commonly misused medications were pain relievers, with an estimated 1.7 percent (900,000) of adults ages 65 and older misusing them in the past year. 65 In 2019, pain reliever misuse was the fourth most common type of substance misuse among adults ages 65 and older in the United States. 66 Some older adults do use prescription medications to \"get high,\" but many develop SUDs from misusing prescription medications to address sleep problems, chronic pain, or anxiety. 67,68,69 The medications of most concern are psychoactive medications such as opioids and central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Opioids are medications that relieve pain. CNS depressants include antianxiety medications, tranquilizers, sedatives, and hypnotics. These medications affect brain function, which can result in changes in consciousness, behavior, mood, pain, perception, and thinking. Nonmedical use of prescription medications by older adults will likely increase in the future. Most misused medications (e.g., pain relievers, stimulants, tranquillizers, sedatives) are obtained by prescription. 70 Opioids Older adults are at risk for nonmedical use of opioids, given the high prevalence of chronic pain in this population. 71 Chronic pain is among the most common reasons for taking opioid medications, but for some individuals, prescription opioids do not relieve pain. 72 Older adults are also at risk for alcohol-opioid interactions. When taken with opioids, alcohol increases the risk of negative outcomes in older adults, including death. 73, 74,75 Rates of death and suicide caused by prescription opioid misuse are increasing. 76 In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about serious risks, including death, from combining opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, and required boxed warnings for prescription opioids and benzodiazepines. FDA's action was not meant to suggest that providers withhold buprenorphine or methadone, which treat opioid use disorder (OUD), from patients also prescribed benzodiazepines, although FDA recommends careful medication management of these patients. 77 Exhibit 1.4 lists common opioids. EXHIBIT 1.4. Common receive prescriptions for opioids to help manage their pain. For some, this creates a desire to get more pain medication than prescribed, because of tolerance. Having staff trained in the administration of naloxone is important in case clients experience an overdose of opioid medication. Providers should also learn about and offer older adults nonopioid pain medications (e.g., acetaminophen, antidepressants) and nonpharmacological pain management options (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation training, exercise). Opioids can be appropriate in the short term and for specifc uses, such as postsurgical discomfort or cancer-related pain. But for many older adults with chronic (e.g., greater than 3 to 6 months) noncancer pain, nonopioid options are appropriate, effective, and well tolerated. Chapter 1 9 TIP 26 Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed to older adults to treat anxiety and insomnia, despite having a high dependence potential. Benzodiazepines interact with alcohol, increasing the risk of negative outcomes. Recent research shows that, frequently, benzodiazepines are prescribed long term for older adults without a clear need for ongoing treatment. 78 Benzodiazepines are linked with a number of risks in older adults, including falls, 79 problems with thinking,80 motor vehicle accidents,81 and overdose death.82 Exhibit 1.5 lists Lorazepam Clonazepam Diazepam Alprazolam Cannabis Cannabis is illegal at the federal level, although an increasing number of states have legalized the recreational and medical use of cannabis. In 2019, about 2.7 million adults ages 65 and older (5.1 percent) engaged in past-year cannabis use. 83 The number of older adults using prescribed cannabis is unknown. From 2013 to 2014, 12-month prevalence of medical cannabis use among U.S. adults ages 50 and older was only 0.6 percent. 84 Older adults using medical cannabis are at risk for misuse and diversion (including forced or coerced diversion by others). 85 Other adverse effects can include psychomotor slowing (e.g., gait instability leading to fall risk), cognitive problems (e.g., short-term memory impairment), and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, psychotic episodes, and suicide. 86 Studies have shown limited benefts of cannabis for medical purposes, with, for example, Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults some evidence suggesting possible improvements in neuropathic pain and spasticity from multiple sclerosis in older adults; 87 also, certain components of cannabis have demonstrated some medical value when treating seizure disorders (Dravet's syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), wasting illnesses, and lack of appetite. 88 Other medications can treat these conditions, but they do not always work for older adults and may have unpleasant side effects. Little is known about interactions of cannabis with specifc medications. 89 Cannabis affects the CNS. The substance is associated with memory and thinking problems, diffculties with motor skills, depression, and anxiety, among other negative effects. 90,91,92,93 Moreover, the increasing potency of cannabis in recent decades may make cannabis use riskier. 94 Illicit Drugs Older adults are much less likely to use illicit drugs than younger adults. However, the pattern of drug use in older adults is changing. According to national survey data, use of illicit drugs among adults ages 50 to 64 rose from 2.7 to 10.4 percent from 2002 to 2019. 95,96 Baby boomers are more likely than earlier generations to report use of heroin and psychoactive drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine. 97 OTC Medications and Dietary Supplements According to a 2016 analysis of national survey data, 98 about 38 percent of older adults take at least one OTC medication; more than 63 percent take a dietary supplement (e.g., herbal products, vitamins). Among those who take prescription medications, 71.7 percent also take OTC medication or dietary supplements. OTC medications, including OTC pain medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and dietary supplements can interact harmfully with prescription medications, illicit substances, and alcohol. Older adults may lack awareness of side effects and possible negative interactions, because information that comes with OTC medications often does not include warnings specifcally for older adults. Chapter 1 10 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Providers should routinely discuss OTC medication use with older clients and advise them of possibly harmful interactions with prescribed medications, alcohol, and other substances. 99 Older adults (and their families and caregivers) should inform their healthcare providers of any OTC medications and dietary supplements, including herbal products, they take. Asking for guidance on safety is crucial when taking multiple OTC medications or using them in combination with alcohol or a prescribed medication. Risk and Protective Factors for Substance Misuse in Aging The unique physical, emotional, and cognitive challenges older adults face tend to mask SUD symptoms, making it harder for providers to identify and address SUDs. The aging process often includes major life changes and transitions. Some older adults turn to drugs or alcohol to cope. 100 Older adults also face many aging-related physical and mental health issues that may increase their risk of substance misuse and make detection and treatment diffcult. The aging process can cause changes in and problems with thinking. Symptoms of cognitive decline and symptoms of substance misuse may be similar. This makes it harder for family members, caregivers, and healthcare and behavioral health service providers to recognize when older adults misuse substances. Many older adults who misuse substances have a history of co-occurring mental disorders, which suggests that mental illness is a risk factor for this population. Older adults with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders are at risk for negative outcomes like greater need for behavioral health services and higher rates of homelessness and suicidal thoughts. 101,102,103 Exhibit 1.6 lists risk factors for substance misuse in older adults. EXHIBIT 1.6. Substance Misuse Risk Factors in Older Adults104,105 Retirement (when not voluntary) Loss of spouse, partner, or family member Environment (e.g., relocation to assisted living) Physical health (e.g., pain, high blood pressure, sleep and mobility issues) Previous traumatic events Mental disorders (e.g., disorders related to depression and anxiety) Cognitive decline (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) Social changes (e.g., less active, socially disconnected from family and friends) Economic stressors (rising medication and healthcare costs, living on reduced income) Lifetime or family history of SUDs High availability of substances Social isolation Protective factors help prevent or reduce 106,107,108 Exhibit substance misuse in older adults. 1.7 lists protective factors against substance misuse in older adults. EXHIBIT 1.7. Substance Misuse Protective Factors in Older Adults Protective factors are factors that can reduce substance misuse or make it less likely to occur. They include a person's strengths, skills, and abilities as well as environmental factors. Protective factors include: Resiliency. Marriage or committed relationship. Supportive family relationships. Retirement (when voluntary). Ability to live independently. Access to basic resources such as safe housing. Positive self-image. Well-managed medical care and proper use of medications. Sense of identity and purpose. Supportive networks and social bonds. Chapter 1 11 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 1.8. Barriers to Seeking Treatment Negative attitudes. Some families, caregivers, and service providers don't feel comfortable addressing substance misuse because of their negative views about SUDs. They may also be afraid of \"making waves\" or feel that asking about the issue would intrude on the older adult's life or independence. Denial of the problem. Family and friends often either ignore or accept older adults' substance misuse, especially if the problem is long standing. Accepting attitudes. Some adults live in settings where family and peers have accepting attitudes toward alcohol and drugs. Even caregivers and medical professionals may view substance use as okay for older adults (e.g., viewing substances as older adults' \"one last pleasure\"). 109,110 Lack of knowledge. Family and friends may not realize that older adults undergo physiological changes that make the effects of alcohol or drugs more dangerous. Misinformation about treatment. Some people hold the false belief that older adults cannot be treated for SUDs. However, evidence shows that addiction treatment for older adults has positive outcomes, can reduce or stop substance use, and improves health and quality of life. 111,112,113,114,115,116 See the Chapter 1 Appendix for a more detailed list of barriers to seeking treatment. Barriers to Seeking Treatment Exhibit 1.8 lists some of the barriers that prevent older adults from getting the SUD treatment they need. Understanding these barriers is a key step in reducing substance misuse in the older adult population. Such misuse limits one's ability to function and to achieve the best possible quality of life, regardless of age. The following two sections will be of greater interest to healthcare providers. These sections give overviews of basic information on screening, diagnosis, and treatment as they apply to older clients from the provider's point of view. Screening and Diagnosis Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is the overall model for and approach to screening and intervening with individuals who misuse, or are at risk for misusing, substances. Older adults with SUDs may receive screening, diagnosis, and treatment for SUDs in many different settings and from a variety of professionals. Few older adults seek help in specialized addiction treatment settings. All healthcare, behavioral health, and aging service providers must know the signs/symptoms of SUDs and substance misuse in older adults and have protocols for screening, treatment, or referral. 117,118 See Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of this TIP for more information about screening, assessment, and SBIRT. Screening Universal screening is key in SBIRT. Providers should screen all older clients for substance use (type of substance, frequency, quantity), misuse (including of prescriptions), consequences, and drug-drug interactions. UNIVERSAL SCREENING119 Healthcare and social service providers should give all older clients a brief prescreen. Most will screen negative, but prescreening helps identify substance misuse that may otherwise be overlooked. Settings in which older adults may receive screening for substance-related problems include: Healthcare clinics. Hospitals. SUD treatment programs. Home health care. Nursing homes. Social service agencies. Chapter 1 12 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Senior centers. Assisted living facilities. Faith-based organizations. The TIP consensus panel recommends yearly screening for all adults ages 60 and older and when major life changes occur (e.g., retirement, loss of partner/spouse, changes in health). For more accurate histories, ask questions about substance use in the recent past while asking about other health behaviors (e.g., exercise, smoking, diet). Asking straightforward questions in a nonjudgmental manner is the best approach. Providers should also ask about medical marijuana prescriptions or use. Screening helps fully determine which substances (including alcohol) and medications a client takes and what, if any, interactions these substances, prescription medications, OTC medications, and dietary supplements may have with each other. Many providers fail to ask about OTC medications. However, some OTC medications (particularly anticholinergic agents, PM]) can be problematic in combination with alcohol or prescription medications as well as illicit drugs. Screening for older adults can be verbal (e.g., by interview), with paper-and-pencil forms, or with computerized forms. All three methods are reliable and valid. 120 Any positive responses should lead to further questions constituting full assessment (or referral for full assessment by a qualifed provider). Chapter 3 of this TIP offers further information about substance misuse screening measures and how to follow up with clients who screen positive as well as those who screen negative. Diagnostic Issues in Working With Older Adults Some DSM-5 SUD criteria may not apply to older adults with substance use problems, even though DSM-5 criteria generally determine SUD diagnoses. For example, in retired older individuals with fewer familial and work obligations, substance use may not cause failure to fulfll major obligations at work, school, or home. Even so, it may negatively affect health, daily activities, or functioning. 121 Older adults have unique risk factors that increase their vulnerability to substance misuse, but signs and symptoms of SUDs often resemble those of other health issues, making detection diffcult. Bodily changes (e.g., slower metabolism, reduced muscle mass, altered body fat percentages and organ functions) make older adults more sensitive to the effects of alcohol and drugs. Because of such changes, smaller amounts of substances may cause more harmful effects. These changes can occur gradually, which may make them harder to notice. Older individuals who misuse substances may require treatment even if they do not meet DSM-5 criteria for an SUD. Quantity-frequency measures may be less effective than assessment of impact on overall well-being and quality of life in identifying substance misuse for this population. Healthcare and behavioral health service providers must determine these effects before focusing on interventions and treatments. Treatment Addiction treatment programs have begun to see an increase in admissions among older adults because of the population increase and the higher prevalence of lifetime substance use among baby boomers. 122,123 Although alcohol use remains the primary reason for admission, the years 2000 to 2012 saw a decrease in alcohol-related admissions and steep increases in admissions for prescription opioids as well as illicit drugs such as cocaine, crack, and heroin. 124 Early- and Late-Onset Substance Misuse SUD diagnosis and treatment planning depend, in part, on when substance use began in older adults. \"Early onset\" substance use is present in those with a history of at-risk or harmful substance use that began before age 50. 125 \"Late-onset\" substance use is present in those who began to misuse substances only later in life. Exhibit 1.9 shows early- versus late-onset aspects of alcohol misuse as an example. Chapter 1 13 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 1.9. Characteristics of Early-Onset Versus Late-Onset Alcohol Misuse126 Early onset: -Risky or harmful drinking patterns prior to age 50 -Long-term denial, which complicates treatment -Multiple medical comorbidities, limited social support, poor emotional skills, and cognitive impairment -More common, making up two-thirds of older adults127 Late onset: -Began misusing alcohol later in life (possibly following alcohol problems at various periods earlier in life) -May have begun misusing alcohol because of age-related stressors (e.g., retirement, loss of income or partner) -Preceded by stable periods of abstinence or low-level drinking over a long period of time -May appear \"too healthy\" to raise concerns People with late-onset misuse may seem \"too healthy\" to raise concern. Providers should ask older clients about lifetime substance use patterns. Problems can arise with stressors in older adulthood. 128,129 Medication Interventions AUD Acamprosate, disulfram, and naltrexone are approved to treat AUD. They can improve outcomes 130 but are not usually used for long-term treatment of older adults with AUD. Acamprosate Acamprosate is approved by FDA to treat AUD. 131 Clinical evidence suggests that acamprosate can help people with alcohol dependence maintain abstinence by reducing cravings and the pleasurable effects associated with alcohol. 132,133 It may also lessen symptoms of prolonged abstinence such as anxiety and insomnia. 134 To date, research on acamprosate use in older adults is not readily available. Because acamprosate is removed from the body through the kidneys and older adults are at elevated risk of diminished kidney function, this population should have baseline and frequent renal function tests as part of acamprosate treatment. 135 Disulfram Disulfram is approved by FDA to treat AUD.136 Disulfram triggers an acute physical reaction to alcohol, including fushing, fast heartbeat, nausea, chest pain, dizziness, and changes in blood pressure. 137,138 These reactions are supposed to motivate a person to avoid drinking alcohol. Because the effects of taking this medication in combination with alcohol can be harmful to older people, it is generally not recommended for use in this population and, if used, is done so only with great caution. 139,140 Also, for disulfram to be useful, clients must stick to strict medication protocols. 141 Doing so may be hard for older adults who have cognitive impairment or live alone and have no one to support them in taking medication as prescribed. A meta-analysis suggests that when compliance with disulfram is not monitored, its effcacy is no different from that of control conditions. 142 Monitoring for adherence is essential for disulfram to be effective. People taking disulfram may also need to be observed, as some may stop taking it on a day during which they want to drink. Chapter 1 14 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Naltrexone Naltrexone is approved by FDA to treat AUD.143 It reduces craving for alcohol and decreases the rate of relapse to heavy drinking. Some research suggests that naltrexone is tolerable in adults ages 50 and older, but widespread data on its tolerability in older individuals are lacking. 144 Naltrexone is an opioid blocker and cannot be used in clients who require prescription opioids for pain relief. Giving naltrexone to a client who takes opioid medication for pain may cause signifcant opioid withdrawal symptoms. OUD Medication treatment for OUD can reduce risk of relapse. 145,146 Three medications can treat older adults with buprenorphine, and methadone. The opioid overdose medication naloxone is also safe and effective in older adults. Learn more about medication for OUD in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) TIP 63, Medications for Opioid Naltrexone Naltrexone can prevent relapse after medically supervised opioid withdrawal. 147 It is not a pain medication. It is a medication that reduces cravings for and effects of opioids and alcohol. Research on its use in older adults with OUD is not readily available, but some studies have shown it to be safe and acceptable in older adults with AUD. 148,149 Buprenorphine Buprenorphine can treat opioid withdrawal or provide long-term medication maintenance for OUD. It is so effective that the World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as \"an essential medication.\" 150,151 Compared with methadone, less is known about use of buprenorphine in older adults with OUD. It may be preferable to methadone, because it is less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms, erectile dysfunction, and prolonged QT interval (see \"Methadone\" section). It may be safer than methadone for older adults with cardiovascular/respiratory disorders. 152 A study of short-term use of low-dose buprenorphine for older adults with depression found the medication to be safe and well tolerated. 153 However, more studies are needed to fully understand the benefts and side effects of buprenorphine in older adults with OUD. Certain buprenorphine formulations are FDA approved to treat chronic pain. One such formulation is the buprenorphine transdermal system, 154 which appears safe for pain treatment among older adults.155 Methadone Methadone is used to prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings for people with OUD. 156 As with buprenorphine, it is considered so effective that WHO lists it as \"an essential medication.\" 157,158 Methadone is available through federally certifed and accredited opioid treatment programs. It can be effective on its own, but research shows that it is often more effective in treating OUD when used with behavioral, social, and other medical services. 159 Methadone can also be prescribed to treat chronic pain in older adults. 160,161 Older adults taking methadone may experience certain side effects, some of which can be serious. 162 Methadone is associated with higher risk of prolonged QT interval, which can cause a potentially deadly cardiac arrhythmia. 163 This risk is even greater when methadone is taken at higher doses, with other QT-prolonging medication, or by someone with congestive heart failure. Many medications negatively interact with methadone. 164 This is an important consideration in older adults, who are likely to take multiple medications. As with other opioids, methadone can increase the risk of falls in older adults. 165 Chapter 1 15 TIP 26 RESOURCE ALERT: METHADONE SAFETY See Methadone Safety: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American Pain Society and College on Problems of Drug Dependence, in Collaboration With the Heart Rhythm Society (www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(14)00522-7/ fulltext). This guideline provides recommendations on the safe use of methadone and addresses the potential risks related to overdose and cardiac arrhythmias. Naloxone Naloxone does not treat OUD or pain by itself, but it can reverse potentially fatal opioid overdoses. It is so effective that WHO lists it as \"an essential medication.\" 166 Older adults are at increased risk of opioid overdose. Bodily changes that occur normally in aging cause older adults to experience a higher concentration of opioid metabolites than younger adults when the same dose is consumed. 167 Low-dose naloxone is safe and effective in older adults in case of opioid overdose. Formal and Informal SUD Treatment Approaches People can change their substance use at any age. Once substance misuse becomes apparent, hope for recovery should always follow. A wide range of professionals and providers across a variety of settings share the responsibility to help older clients achieve recovery. Some studies suggest that older adults who enter specialized SUD treatment have better outcomes than younger adults. 168,169,170,171 However, many traditional SUD treatment programs do not serve many older adults (compared with the number of younger people they serve). In 2019, only about 23 percent of SUD treatment facilities had older adult-specifc Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults programming.172 Thus, few studies with signifcant older populations have examined effectiveness of residential programming in this age group. Older adults do best in SUD treatment programs that offer age-appropriate care with providers who are knowledgeable about aging issues. 173 In the community-based Geriatric Addictions Program, for older adults with SUDs and co-occurring mental disorders, a multidimensional approach connected more older adults to outpatient and inpatient treatment than did traditional assessment and referral. The multidimensional approach included geriatric care management assessment, motivational counseling, in-home counseling, and referral to aging services and addiction treatment. 174 Many pathways lead to recovery, and many treatment options work for older adults (Exhibit 1.10). EXHIBIT 1.10. Range of Intervention and Treatment Strategies for Older Adults Minimal advice Structured brief intervention protocols (e.g., SBIRT) Structured brief treatments Formal specialized treatments Relapse prevention programs Few older adults who screen positive for substance misuse need specialized addiction treatment. Many can change their misuse through less intensive approaches, 175,176 such as: Professional and personal advice and discussions. Education about alcohol misuse, drug use, and prescription medication misuse. Brief structured interventions and treatments (both individual and group). Chapter 1 16 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Each older adult has an individual history and unique needs. Each older client's intervention or treatment path will also be unique. The path to improving outcomes is determined, in part, by the severity of the problem, the individual's willingness to get help with reducing or stopping substance misuse, the types of programs available, and the cost of care. Summary Evidence-based screening techniques, brief interventions or treatments, and specialized care options give older adults the best chances of improving their physical and emotional health. Identifcation and treatment of SUDs can be challenging, but is possible with the right knowledge and tools. This TIP will guide SUD treatment providers, supervisors, and administrators; mental health service providers; state and community behavioral health service agencies; healthcare providers; caregivers; families; and older adults in understanding and accessing evidence-based screening, intervention, and treatment options to address substance misuse in a number of settings. Chapter 1 17 This page intentionally left blank. TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue help all older clients receive the best possible care for substance misuse. The following table shows the many types of barriers older adults potentially face in addressing substance misuse. The table includes citations of supporting research; access these references to learn more about each barrier and how it affects older adults. Chapter 1 Appendix Older Adults and Barriers to SUD Treatment and Mental Health Services Older adults face barriers at many levels in accessing SUD treatment and mental health services. Barriers can be personal, interpersonal, structural, or a combination. Recognizing, understanding, and working to remove barriers will Barriers Older Adults Face in Addressing Substance Misuse BARRIER DEFINITION, DESCRIPTION, OR EXAMPLE OF BARRIER SAMPLES OF RESEARCH Common myths and negative beliefs Myths and negative beliefs include \"Drug addiction is only a 'young person's problem'\" or \"Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.\" Providers or family members with these beliefs might not offer to help an older person who misuses substances. Similarly, an older person who fears stigma that comes from hearing other people express these negative beliefs might not ask for help. Choi et al. (2014) 177 Blais et al. (2015) 178 Crome (2013)179 Co-occurring physical and mental health conditions Symptoms of substance misuse can seem similar to symptoms of other conditions common in older adults, including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, and sleep problems. Providers, family members, and clients themselves can easily mistake the symptoms of substance misuse for one or more of these conditions. Little research clarifes barriers for older adults with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. But in adults in general, these co-occurring disorders (CODs) are associated with several barriers to treatment access: stigma, negative beliefs about addiction and mental health services, lack of specialized services for people with CODs, and providers' failure to recognize both conditions in a client with CODs. Royal College of Psychiatrists (2015) 180 Crome (2013)181 Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (2020) 182 Priester et al. (2016) 183 Continued on next page Chapter 1 19 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued BARRIER DEFINITION, DESCRIPTION, OR EXAMPLE OF BARRIER SAMPLES OF RESEARCH Lack of awareness on the part of older clients Older clients may not realize how much they are drinking or that their substance misuse is a problem. For instance, older people are affected by alcohol differently than when they were younger. This is because of changes in the body that are a normal part of aging, like losing lean mass. For example, a woman in her 70s might think she can safely drink the same amount of alcohol that she drank in her 30s. This is not necessarily so. Some older adults think the amount of alcohol they drink is not risky although it exceeds recommendations for low-risk drinking. Sometimes a client's lack of awareness can result from cognitive impairment, making it hard for the client to self-monitor alcohol intake. Sacco & Kuerbis (2013) 184 Borok et al. (2013)185 Kuerbis et al. (2014)186 Family members' lack of awareness of older adults' misuse Adult children may not know how much their parent is drinking or that his or her substance misuse is harmful. Even when aware of an older adult's substance misuse, family members may not seek help as quickly as needed. They may have thoughts such as \"Alcohol is my father's last pleasure in life. I'd hate to take that away from him.\" Royal College of Psychiatrists (2015) 187 Briggs et al. (2011) 188 Ageism \"Ageism \" refers to negative beliefs or attitudes about older people that lead to stereotyping or discrimination. An example of ageism is failing to screen a client in her 80s for SUDs because \"people her age don't beneft from treatment.\" Royal College of Psychiatrists (2015) 189 Chrisler et al. (2016) 190 Views of SUDs as a moral failure or weakness An older client who believes that having an SUD is a sign of being \"weak\" or a \"bad person\" might feel too ashamed to ask for help. Royal College of Psychiatrists (2015) 191 Financial problems, insurance issues Examples of this barrier include low income or no income, as well as having no insurance or insurance that does not cover SUD treatment and mental health services. Choi et al. (2014) 192 Osborn et al. (2017) 193 Limited mobility, transportation, or both Examples of these barriers are having diffculty walking or not having access to mobility assistance devices (like a walker or wheelchair). This barrier also includes being unable to travel to appointments (e.g., not having a car, not having access to public transportation). Choi et al. (2014) 194 Hadley Strout et al. (2016) 195 Continued on next page Chapter 1 20 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Continued BARRIER DEFINITION, DESCRIPTION, OR EXAMPLE OF BARRIER SAMPLES OF RESEARCH Living situations and social settings that \"normalize\" substance misuse A home setting or social network that supports older adults' misuse of substances can hinder diagnosis and treatment. For instance, in some assisted living facilities, residents frequently use alcohol. This could make it harder for staff to identify an older client who misuses alcohol because drinking is seen as \"normal.\" In some nursing homes, staff do not regularly ask about alcohol use at intake and may fail to recognize when residents are misusing alcohol. Many long-term care facilities have no policies on illicit drug use. This suggests that staff members may not be fully prepared to recognize and respond to residents' drug use. Older adults with spouses/friends who misuse alcohol or support drinking may be at more risk for alcohol misuse because they are surrounded by people who make their alcohol misuse seem \"normal.\" Castle et al. (2012) 196 Klein & Jess (2002) 197 White et al. (2015) 198 Moos et al. (2011) 199 Lack of social support, including social isolation or low social connectedness Older adults with few or weak social relationships (like being single, widowed, or divorced) may be less likely to visit healthcare providers compared with older adults with stronger social ties (like being married or living with someone else). Older adults who are socially connected and feel positive about their social network appear to have better access to healthcare services and better health and well-being than older people who are not socially well connected. Bremer et al. (2017) 200 Graham et al. (2014) 201 Limit ed number s of providers with knowledge of and commitment to working with older adults Too few healthcare providers and behavioral health service pro viders are trained to work with older adults who misuse substances. Without this training, providers are less likely to screen, assess, diagnose, and treat older clients who misuse substances. Institute of Medicine (2012) 202 Bartels et al. (2014) 203 No coordinated services; limited access to behavioral health or social services across care settings or geographic regions Older adults who misuse substances, have other problems related to behavioral health, or both need coordinated, person-centered care. Coordinated care helps address all of clients' physical, mental, and social service needs. Many older clients who misuse substances do not receive coordinated care. Healthcare providers (including physicians, nurses, and physician assistants) and behavioral health service providers should be appropriately trained and working together closely when providing SUD treatment or mental health services. Institute of Medicine (2012) 204 Gage & Melillo (2011) 205 Continued on next page Chapter 1 21 TIP 26Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued BARRIER DEFINITION, DESCRIPTION, OR EXAMPLE OF BARRIER SAMPLES OF RESEARCH Lack of case management or care management Case managers (or \"care managers\") coordinate healthcare and behavioral health services across providers. When care is not coordinated, clients might not get access to the full range of treatments they need. The workforce needs to identify and include in coordinated services case managers or care managers who are specially trained in older adults' unique substance misuse and mental health issues. Providers who do not understand the particular ways that older adults experience substance misuse may be less likely to screen, assess, diagnose, and treat older clients for SUDs, as needed. Institute of Medicine (2012) 206 Ambivalence about changing a health behaviorLike young and middle-aged adults, older adults may feel ambivalent about changing a long-standing health behavior. This can be a barrier to entering treatment or following a provider's recommendations. National Research Council (2006) 207 Normal life changes Older adults commonly experience life changes that increase their risk of misusing substances. Such changes include moving into assisted living or other long-term care facility, retiring from work, and losing a family member (such as a spouse or adult child). It might be easy to \"normalize\" or make light of an older person's substance misuse in one of these situations. (\"He doesn't really have a drinking problem. He's just drinking because he lost his wife. Who can blame him?\") But substance misuse in these situations is just as serious and potentially harmful as in any other situation. Kuerbis et al. (2014) 208 Loss, especially death of children, spouse, siblings, or close friends; also, loss of employment (e.g., forced retirement) The death of a family member or friend can be extremely distressing. In some older adults, grief can increase the risk of substance misuse, especially alcohol misuse and tobacco use. Grieving older adults may misuse substances as a way of coping with their loss. If this is their main method of coping, it can be a barrier to entering treatment, as they likely will not want to quit. Some older people consider retirement a form of loss, especially when the retirement is unwanted. Many people defne themselves by their work. For them, leaving their job represents a loss of their identity and can lead to negative self-esteem. People may misuse substances as a way of coping, which could be a barrier to entering treatment. Stahl & Schulz (2014) 209 Kelly et al. (2018) 210 Continued on next page Chapter 1 22 TIP 26 Chapter 1\u2014Older Adults and Substance Misuse: Understanding the Issue Continued BARRIER DEFINITION, DESCRIPTION, OR EXAMPLE OF BARRIER SAMPLES OF RESEARCH Lack of health literacy \"Health literacy\" is a person's ability to access, understand, and communicate about health-related information. Older people with low health literacy may have trouble talking about substance misuse with their providers. They may also not understand, for example, what amount of alcohol is considered low risk versus harmful. In these instances, these individuals may not seek treatment. Levy & Janke (2016) 211 Geboers et al. (2016)212 Findley (2015)213 Cultural norms Cultural norms can infuence a person's help-seeking behavior. For example, an older person whose culture discourages talking about mental illness or substance misuse may not seek help. In some cultures, it is more acceptable to talk about physical symptoms, such as aches and pains or sleep problems, than it is to talk about symptoms of addiction or mental illness, like feeling depressed or wanting to hurt oneself. This can make it hard for a provider to know when a client from this kind of cultural background has a problem related to substance misuse or mental illness. Royal College of Psychiatrists (2015) 214 Barrio et al. (2008) 215 Jimenez et al. (2013) 216 Racial and cultural differences among older clients Racial and cultural factors can affect how a person thinks and speaks about his or her behavioral health, seeks help for addiction or mental illness, and receives treatment. For instance, an older individual who does not speak English fuently may feel uncomfortable asking for help from a provider who speaks only English. De Guzman et al. (2015) 217 Barrio et al. (2008) 218 Sorkin et al. (2016) 219 Gender and sexual identity Like race and culture, older adults' gender and sexual identity can affect whether they seek and receive help for substance misuse or mental illness. For example, older lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning adults may be slow to seek treatment out of fear that providers will refuse to care for them or because they are uncomfortable with physical exams. Older women are especially vulnerable to some barriers, like stigma, low income, or providers not recognizing their substance misuse. Auldridge et al.

TIP 26TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN OLDER ADULTS Chapter 2\u2014Principles of Care for Older Adults KEY MESSAGES Incorporating age-sensitive and age-specifc treatment practices into your program isimportant for engaging older clients andimproving their retention in treatment. The older adult population is culturally, racially,and ethnically diverse. Recognize and addressdiversity and health disparity issues related toaging. Collaboration among service providers acrosssettings is essential when working with olderadults who misuse substances, particularly forthose with co-occurring medical conditionsand mental disorders. Hiring, training, and retaining staffwho demonstrate high motivation andcommitment to serving older adults are vitalto successfully implementing substanceuse disorder (SUD) treatment programs andservices for this population. Chapter 2 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will most beneft healthcare, mental health, addiction treatment, and social service providers who work with older adults. It addresses principles of care for older clients who present across settings with substance misuse. By tailoring traditional treatment methods and adopting age-specifc, age-sensitive, science-informed interventions, providers can better fulfll the needs of a growing population of older adults who misuse substances. Older adults receive services in many settings besides SUD treatment programs: mental health service programs, primary care practices, emergency departments, senior centers, adult day programs, faith-based organizations, and assisted living and residential care facilities. Across settings, early identifcation, universal screening, and education for substance misuse can facilitate brief intervention and referral to treatment. Organization of Chapter 2 of This TIP Chapter 2 addresses the general principles of care\u2014across service settings\u2014for older adults with a history of substance misuse. The following are essential principles of care: Understand the developmental issues of aging. Acknowledge and address the diversity amongolder adults. Recognize the difference between early- andlate-onset SUDs among older adults. Emphasize client education, early identifcation,screening, and brief treatment. Engage in health risk reduction practices. Provide person-centered care. Build alliances with older clients; use age-sensitive strategies to engage/retain them intreatment. Help older clients use social networks andcommunity-based services. Encourage family and caregiver involvement. Coordinate care and develop service linkages. Make programmatic changes to effectively serveolder adults with SUDs. Invest in age-sensitive workforce development. Chapter 2 concludes with a list of targeted resources to support the delivery of older adult- focused services to address substance misuse. A more detailed resource guide is available in Chapter 9 of this TIP . Exhibit 2.1 provides defnitions for key terms that appear in Chapter 2. 25 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 2.1. Key Terms Addiction*: The most severe form of SUD, associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Age-sensitive: Adaptations to existing treatment approaches that accommodate older adults' unique needs (e.g., a large-print handout on the signs of substance misuse). Age-specifc: Treatment approaches and practices specifcally developed for older adults (e.g., an older adult specialty group in a mixed-age SUD treatment program). Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). At-risk/high-risk drinking: Drinking alcohol in excessive amounts. This defnition encompasses both binge drinking and heavy drinking. Additionally, any alcohol consumption is considered risky when carried out by individuals with certain medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, those taking medicine that can interact harmfully with alcohol, those driving a car or engaged in other activities that require alertness, or people recovering from AUD. 223,224 Note that for purposes of this TIP, at-risk drinking and high-risk drinking are synonymous and either term is acceptable to describe an older adult's drinking patterns. Binge drinking: A drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. This usually takes place after four or more drinks for women and fve or more drinks for men. 225,226 However, older adults are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and treatment providers may need to lower these numbers when screening for alcohol misuse.227 Additionally, other factors such as weight, decrease in enzyme activity, and body composition (e.g., amount of muscle tissue present in the body) can also affect alcohol absorption rates. Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living (ADLs), including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 228 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Drug-drug interaction: The interaction of one substance (e.g., alcohol, medication, an illicit drug) with another substance. Drug-drug interactions may change the effectiveness of medications, introduce or alter the intensity of side effects, and increase a substance's toxicity or the concentration of that substance in a person's blood. Potentially serious interactions can also occur with certain foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. 229 Drug use: The full range of severity of illicit drug use, from a single instance of use to meeting criteria for a drug use disorder. Heavy drinking: Consuming fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women in one period on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days. 230 Moderate drinking: According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defned as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 231,232 However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over several days. 233 Additionally, individuals who don't metabolize alcohol well may need to consume even lower quantities. Some people, particularly those with certain alcohol-related illnesses or engaging in tasks requiring concentration, should not consume alcohol at all. The Dietary Guidelines stipulate that those who don't drink should not begin drinking for any reason. 234 Continued on next page Chapter 2 26 TIP 26 Chapter 2\u2014Principles of Care for Older Adults Continued Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches or peer recovery support specialists), mutual-help groupsconsist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no offcial connection to treatmentprograms. Most are self-supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous andNarcotics Anonymous are the most widespread and well researched type of mutual-help groups, othergroups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affliated with a religion or church (e.g.,Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART [Self-Management and RecoveryTraining] Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Peer support: The use of peer recovery support specialists (e.g., someone in recovery who has livedexperience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training) to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiringtraining in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction andto their families. Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can,with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When thosepositive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery.Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not theonly healthy, prosocial feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder.The ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defnes remissionas present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with thepossible exception of craving). 235 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that cancause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use wouldconstitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances.According to DSM-5, 236 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function, and by impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive,behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic.They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuitsgoverning incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking),reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuencewhether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; thegenetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severeSUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions ofDSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerlycalled substance dependence. *The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a greatdeal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report isavailable online (https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Chapter 2 27 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults General Principles of Care Older adults tend to do as well as or better than younger adults in mixed-age SUD treatment.237,238 Moreover, growing evidence links age-specifc treatment to better treatment adherence and long-term outcomes for many older adults. 239 Even so, only about 23 percent of SUD treatment programs in the United States offer a program or group specifcally tailored to older adults. 240 Few SUD treatment approaches are designed specifcally for older adults. Therefore, this TIP provides general principles of care that can inform a fexible approach for age-sensitive, age-specifc treatment of substance misuse among older adults. The principles are a framework to guide your work with older adults across settings to address issues related to their misuse of substances. Understand the Developmental Issues of Aging Older adults are not a homogenous group. As with any group, older adults may hold a diverse range of opinions and attitudes toward alcohol and drug use. For example, within the older adult population, people in various age ranges differ from one another in signifcant ways that may infuence which approaches will most successfully address substance misuse. Earlier cohorts of older adults (e.g., adults born before or during World War II) are more likely to have moralistic attitudes about drinking and drug use\u2014attitudes that, for some, were shaped by Prohibition and the Temperance Movement. 241 They may feel deeply ashamed about alcohol misuse or drug use. If they attribute their substance misuse to a moral failing, they may be less likely to seek SUD treatment. 242 These cohorts are likelier to beneft from screening and brief intervention with a healthcare provider when questions about drinking and drug use are part of an overall approach to health assessments. Baby boomers (i.e., adults born between 1946 and 1964) grew up in a time when substance use was more culturally acceptable. They may have more permissive attitudes toward drinking and drug use. They are also more likely to be willing to seek and agree to specialized addiction treatment. 243 Older adults have unique developmental challenges that younger adults may not have. These include possibly losing a spouse or partner, as well as experiencing: Increasing numbers of deaths of friends in thesame age cohort. Role changes in families and work-relatedactivities. Reduced opportunities for increasing ormaintaining income levels. Normal age-related cognitive and physicaldecline leading to loss of functioning andreduced capacity to carry out ADLs. 244 Providing age-sensitive, age-specifc treatment approaches helps older adults feel more comfortable discussing personal issues and age-related changes than they would feel doing so in mixed-age treatment programs. 245 Whether or not you can offer age-specifc treatment options, your program needs to create an environment that responds to older adults' needs (Exhibit 2.2). Chapter 2 28 TIP 26 Chapter 2\u2014Principles of Care for Older Adults EXHIBIT 2.2. How Administrators Can Create a Treatment Environment Responsive to Older Adults246 Older adults have specifc developmental needs. To create an environment that is responsive to older adults' needs, the entire organization, not just providers, must be committed to this purpose. Some of the strategies administrators can use to create an age-sensitive treatment or service environment include: Make a commitment to understanding the developmental needs and cohort differences. Review and update your vision and mission statement to refect your commitment to older adults. Conduct an organizational self-assessment of attitudes, knowledge, and skills needed to effectively respond to older adults in your program. Conduct an organizational self-assessment of the physical environment and other barriers to access that must be addressed to provide services to older adults. Address organization-wide competence in the developmental needs of older adults and cohort differences in your strategic planning process. Assign one staff member to oversee the development of age-specifc practices and services. Develop an advisory board or task group with older adult members from the community. Engage clients, staff, and community members in planning/developing age-specifc services and programs. Develop and review policies and procedures to ensure that all staff are responsive to older adults' needs. Create an older adult-friendly environment that enhances engagement and retention of clients. Develop outreach strategies to improve access to care. The consensus panel recommends that you engage your clients in discussions about their attitudes toward substance misuse, create an age-sensitive treatment environment that is responsive to older adults, and offer age-specifc treatment options when possible. Acknowledge and Address Older Adults' Diversity The older adult population is as culturally diverse as other age groups. Yet older adults who are members of racial/ethnic and other minority groups are often at greater risk of poor health, disability, social isolation, and poverty than are their younger counterparts. Older adults from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds are also more likely to be underinsured and receive fewer routine screenings for health concerns. 247 Therefore, they face more barriers to accessing health care and experience greater health disparities. 248 These disparities increase risk for developing SUDs and increase barriers to treatment. Higher rates of deaths, disability, and chronic illness are more common among older adults who identify with diverse racial and ethnic groups. 249 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) older adults may experience poor health care and lack of access to services. Given discrimination and prejudice, they may have to hide, or feel the need to hide, their LGBTQ identity to receive care. 250 Gender-related disparities can create or compound health disparities in older adults. Older women are at higher risk for co-occurring mental disorders and social isolation than older men. 251 They are also more likely to be prescribed medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) that negatively interact with alcohol and to be prescribed them for longer periods of time, increasing the risk of SUDs. 252 Chapter 2 29 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults OLDER WOMEN are at higher risk for CO-OCCURRING mental disorders and social isolation thanolder men. Providers and program administrators must learn how older clients' race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and socioeconomic status infuence overall health, substance misuse, and availability of healthcare and behavioral health services. 253 They should also recognize that older adults can draw on their cultural heritage in ways that improve health and well-being. 254 As people age, they shape their world in ways that maximize their well-being ... within the confnes and defnitions of their respective cultures.\" \u2014H. H. Fung (2013), p. 375255 The consensus panel recommends that you maintain awareness of older adults' racial, ethnic, gender, and LGBTQ diversity when addressing late-life substance misuse, health disparities, and barriers to access to care. Provide culturally responsive screening, assessment, and treatment for clients across settings. RESOURCE ALERT: IMPROVING CULTURAL COMPETENCE The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) TIP 59, Improving Cultural Competence ( https://store.samhsa.gov/ product/TIP-59-Improving-Cultural-Competence/ SMA15-4849), helps providers and administrators understand the role of culture in the delivery of mental health services and SUD treatment. Recognize the Diference Between Early- and Late-Onset Substance Misuse Diagnosis and treatment planning differ for older adults who have a history of substance misuse (early onset) and those who develop problems only later in life (late onset). For example, older adults who begin to drink because of late-life stressors (e.g., loss of a signifcant other) may not have the same chronic, co-occurring medical conditions or mental disorders that older adults who have been drinking since adolescence or early adulthood have. Late-onset substance misuse may respond well to brief interventions. Older adults who exhibit chronic misuse may need more intensive SUD treatment. 256 The consensus panel recommends that, as part of regular screening and assessment, you determine whether clients have a history of substance misuse or are using in response to more recent stressors. Use this information to identify appropriate treatment options. Discuss these options with clients. Emphasize Client Education, Early Identifcation, Screening, and Brief Treatment Substance misuse in older adults is often unrecognized by older adults themselves, as well as by their family members, friends, and healthcare and social service providers. To ensure that older adults receive education, screening, assessment, and treatment, all who have regular contact with them\u2014whether in the home, at healthcare visits, at community-based senior services, or in long-term care facilities\u2014must recognize the signs of substance misuse (including prescription drug misuse) in older adults. Older adults are less likely to get referrals to specialized SUD treatment from healthcare providers than other sources (e.g., self-referral, referrals from legal incidents related to driving and substance misuse). 257 Yet healthcare providers are well positioned to identify and screen for substance misuse in older adults. Chapter 2 30 TIP 26 Chapter 2\u2014Principles of Care for Older Adults Older adults are more likely than younger adults to see their healthcare providers to discuss and receive treatment for numerous medical and health-related concerns. Healthcare visits are opportunities to discuss substance use and related health risks and consequences. Healthcare providers can also take these opportunities to talk with older clients about drug-drug interactions with alcohol, prescription medications, and other substances in the context of routine medical care. 258 If you are a healthcare or social service provider who has contact with older adults in home-care situations, residential care facilities, community-based programs, or emergency departments, you should be aware of the signs of substance misuse among this population. Within your scope of practice, you should engage in routine screening of older adults for substance misuse in accordance with your program's policies and procedures. A home healthcare nurse noticed empty beer bottles and the smell of alcohol on Joe's breath during one of her regularly scheduled home visits to monitor Joe's management of his diabetes. Joe also seemed unsteady on his feet. She recognized the signs of a potential problem and had a friendly conversation with him about his health in which she embedded screening questions about his drinking. Joe agreed to let her call his daughter to arrange for a ride for him to see his healthcare provider for an assessment. A growing body of research demonstrates that different kinds of brief interventions delivered in a variety of healthcare and social service settings can effectively reduce alcohol consumption and substance misuse and lower health-related risk among older adults. 259,260,261,262,263 Brief interventions can also facilitate entry into more intensive treatment. 264 The consensus panel recommends that providers across settings in which older adults may seek care: Promote early identifcation, education, outreach, and prevention in their programs/ communities. Promote universal screening for alcohol misuse, drug use, and prescription medication misuse for older adults. Develop and expand brief interventions for older adults who misuse substances. Engage in Health Risk Reduction Practices Older adults who misuse substances may not want to set abstinence as their goal. Engaging in health risk reduction practices is an important and viable option for older adults and is consistent with age-sensitive treatment practices. 265 For example, medical providers can slowly taper older adults to the lowest possible doses of benzodiazepines without withdrawing them completely. Another health risk reduction approach specifcally designed for older adults is the BRITE project, an adaptation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT). It has demonstrated lowered alcohol severity and depression in older adults and improvements in medication misuse. 266 (See Chapter 3 of this TIP for more information on screening and assessment.) Risk reduction strategies lower health-related risk for older adults and can boost functioning. Risk reduction can also be a frst step toward abstinence. For example, once older adults who misuse alcohol begin to experience the health benefts of less drinking, they may be more willing to stop completely. The consensus panel recommends engaging in health risk reduction practices to lessen the impact of substance misuse on the physical and mental health of older adults. Provide Person-Centered Care Based on a literature review and qualitative research, a consensus panel convened by the American Geriatrics Society determined that a Chapter 2 31 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults person-centered approach to care for older adults puts older adults' values and preferences at the center of the decision-making process regarding healthcare options and treatment goals. 267 'Person-centered care' means that individuals' values and preferences are elicited and, once expressed, guide all aspects of their health care, supporting their realistic health and life goals. Person-centered care is achieved through a dynamic relationship among individuals, others who are important to them, and all relevant providers. This collaboration informs decision-making to the extent that the individual desires.\" \u2014American Geriatrics Society (2015), p. 16268 Consider client needs and preferences when deciding treatment intensity (e.g., inpatient or outpatient), method (i.e., group or individual treatment), and goal choice (i.e., abstinence or reduction in use). Collaborating with clients to develop treatment goals enhances positive outcomes. 269 Offer clients a menu of treatment options that ft their needs and preferences. Options should include the least intensive treatment approaches that are medically appropriate as well as more intensive alternatives. More treatment leads to better outcomes, regardless of the level of care (e.g., residential versus outpatient treatment) or whether treatment is greater in intensity or greater in length of overall treatment. The more attention older clients receive, the more likely they are to improve. 270 Continually reassess older clients' needs, treatment goals, priorities, and intensity of care throughout treatment. Maintaining clients at the center of the conversation is essential to this process. The consensus panel recommends that you engage older clients in a comprehensive, person-centered, trauma-informed approach to SUD treatment that emphasizes their values, needs, and preferences. Offer a menu of care options, including the least intensive treatment approach. Build Alliances With Age-Sensitive Engagement and Retention Strategies Building a strong treatment alliance with each client fosters engagement and retention in treatment. The treatment alliance is a collaborative process based on agreement on treatment goals and tasks and a bond between you and your client. 271 A large body of research shows the alliance as signifcant in all kinds of helping relationships across a variety of treatment methods, including SUD treatment. 272 Retention in SUD treatment predicts good outcomes for older adults regardless of treatment approach. 273 Retention refers to a client's length of time in treatment and adherence to treatment. To engage and retain older adults in treatment, the following practices are helpful: Recognize the importance of establishinga collaborative r elationship as the primary mechanism for engaging clients in treatmentand supporting behavior change. Create a culture of respect, which isnonconfrontational, focuses on building olderclients' sense of value and worth, acknowledgesthe wisdom of their own lived experience,and expresses confdence in their ability toparticipate in treatment and accomplish theirtreatment and recovery goals. Respect thecustomary social conventions of older adults'age cohort (e.g., refrain from swearing or usingslang) and ask clients how they would like to beaddressed and introduced to others. Use proven treatment approaches that havedemonstrated effectiveness or shown promisewith older adults in addressing substance misuseacross a variety of settings. Such approachesinclude brief advice and brief interventions,SBIRT, motivational interviewing, supportivetherapy, problem-solving therapy, individualtherapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. 274,275 Chapter 2 32 TIP 26 Chapter 2\u2014Principles of Care for Older Adults Match treatment to older adults' needs and levels of functioning. - Outpatient programs should provide servicesduring daytime hours and assist clients withtransportation. Offer in-home or telehealthsupport services to homebound older adults. - Inpatient and residential treatment programsshould create an environment that is easyfor older adults to navigate. Facilities shouldbe well lighted and accessible to individualswith disabilities, and should have otheraccommodations as needed for older clients. - Programs should modify design and deliveryof services to accommodate vision, hearing,and mild cognitive problems that develop orincrease in later life. - A slower program pace, repetition ofinformation and instructions, and allowingtime for clients to integrate and respondto information and questions can enhancetheir learning and participation in programactivities. Implement age-sensitive group treatmentapproaches to meet older adults' needsand preferences. Older adults, regardless ofgender, tend to be more private and concernedabout how much personal information they willshare in a mixed-age group setting. They maynot relate to or feel comfortable sharing theirproblems with younger adults. 276 Use age-sensitive adaptions if your programonly has mixed-age groups: Emphasize privacy/confdentiality, physical needs,establish group norms for respect, and ensureolder adults' voices are heard by creatingopportunities to share without pressure todisclose. Work with older clients to explore pros andcons of age-specifc and mixed-age groups,and honor their preferences if possible in yourprogram. Age-specifc groups for older adultsshould focus on topics such as grief and loss,trauma, social isolation, social pressure to drink,life-stage and role transitions, and coping skillsspecifc to older adults (e.g., strategies forcoping with loneliness). Match older adults to groups based onavailability, primary substance use concerns,age-related issues, and client preference.If possible, match older adults who have experienced trauma to gender-specifc groups and those with chronic pain to groups that address pain and medication misuse. The consensus panel recommends incorporating into your program age-sensitive and age-specifc treatment practices that engage clients and improve retention in treatment. (See Chapters 4 and 5 for additional information on treatment of older adults for AUD and other SUDs, respectively.) Help Older Clients Use Social Networks and Community-Based Services Older adults in long-term recovery from SUDs demonstrate better outcomes when they have social supports that promote abstinence. 277,278 Social networks for older adults in recovery include caregivers, family, friends, faith-based communities, peer recovery support services, and mutual-help groups. Older adults' social networks frequently narrow because of retirement, loss of spouses or friends, or reduced ability to engage in activities outside the home. This can increase some older adults' isolation and contribute to substance misuse. 279 Assess older adults' current social networks. Help them improve and use social supports to reduce isolation and support recovery from substance misuse. CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES Case and care management (CCM) services are often the keys to better outcomes, particularly for older adults with SUDs or co-occurring medical conditions or mental disorders. 280 The CCM provider helps clients gain access to healthcare, addiction treatment, mental health, social, fnancial, education, employment, and other community-based services. CCM services can be provided by a nurse care manager, social worker, addiction treatment or mental health counselor, or a peer recovery support specialist. Programs serving older adults should either provide CCM or actively link clients to a CCM provider who can connect older adults and their families to community-based resources and services. Chapter 2 33 TIP 26 The consensus panel recommends that SUD treatment programs help older clients connect with social networks that promote recovery. Use a CCM approach to link clients actively to community services. Encourage Family and Caregiver Involvement Involving caregivers throughout treatment and ongoing recovery enhances retention and improves treatment outcomes for people with SUDs. 281 Include caregivers (e.g., family members or guardians) in the entire treatment and recovery process, with the permission of the older client. Caregivers and family members can be essential partners in helping older adults participate fully in treatment and recovery activities. For example, they can assist older adults who have mobility challenges and cognitive impairments that make it diffcult to follow treatment and recovery plans without support. Educate caregivers about how substance misuse can affect older adults' physical and mental health, as well as their relationships. Include them in counseling sessions that focus on recognizing relapse triggers, improving communication, and teaching constructive problem-solving skills. This knowledge will help them more effectively support the recovery of your older clients. Family members are often both caregivers and case managers for older adults with SUDs. The stress of this responsibility and resulting neglect of their self-care can put them at risk for developing SUDs, worsening chronic medical conditions, or increasing vulnerability to stress-related illnesses. 282 Help caregivers reduce their stress levels and maintain their own mental, emotional, and physical health. 283 Encourage family members to take care of their own emotional, mental, and health needs and participate in community-based supports such as caregiver groups. The consensus panel recommends that, with older clients' consent, providers across service settings involve caregivers in all aspects of older clients' treatment and recovery. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Coordinate Care and Develop Service Linkages Develop linkages to appropriate services and maintain ongoing relationships with other providers to coordinate care across settings for older adults with SUDs. Doing so will increase successful referral outcomes. 284 Coordinated care involves establishing and strengthening referral streams and partnering with community-based resources serving older adults (e.g., local Area Agencies on Aging). Referring older clients to other services is not a once-and-done event. It requires actively connecting clients to appropriate providers or services (e.g., a \"warm handoff\" in which you make a referral to another agency in person with the client present) and following up with clients to ensure that referral was successful. Care coordination and management are especially important for older adults with co-occurring medical or mental disorders. For example, a client with an SUD in a healthcare setting who screens positive for anxiety or depression should receive a referral for further assessment and treatment to a mental health service clinician experienced in working with older adults who have co-occurring disorders. Consider availability, accessibility, and client preferences when making referrals to other providers or community-based services. In addition, stay informed of available services. Treatment options within a given agency may change frequently. RESOURCE ALERT: DEVELOPING REFERRAL RESOURCES SAMHSA's Toolkit GET CONNECTED: Linking Older Adults With Resources on Medication, Alcohol, and Mental Health (https://store.samhsa. gov/product/Get-Connected-Linking-Older - Adults-with-Resources-on-Medication-Alcohol-and-Mental-Health-2019-Edition/SMA03-3824) addresses developing and actively linking to referral resources for alcohol misuse prevention and tre atment among older adults. Chapter 2 34 TIP 26 Chapter 2\u2014Principles of Care for Older Adults The consensus panel recommends that you establish ongoing relationships with providers across services and community-based programs to ensure active linkage of clients to older adult services, healthcare professionals who specialize in geriatrics, addiction treatment services, mental health services, and recovery resources. Make Programmatic Changes To Efectively Serve Older Adults With SUDS Before administrators and clinical supervisors can focus on workforce development, they must establish their organizations' vision and commitment to making programs more accessible to older clients and to creating new or adapting existing programs to accommodate older adults' unique needs. Start with an organizational self-assessment and change plan that includes: A rationale for providing age-sensitive and age-specifc services. An assessment of the organization's strengthsand needs for improving services for olderadults. A review of priorities, goals, and tasks to helpdevelop or augment existing services for olderadults. A plan for adapting facilities and programsto accommodate the unique needs of olderadults throughout the continuum of care. Thisincludes establishing age-sensitive and age-specifc policies and practices for outreach,universal screening for substance misuse, andenhancing access and fow of clients throughthe continuum of care from screening to briefintervention and referral or admission to SUDtreatment and continuing care. A plan for identifying and developing linkagesto community-based r esources serving older adults. A plan for involving staff, older clients, andmembers of older adult programs and recovery-focused organizations in the planning andimplementation of services. Guidelines for implementing organizationalchange that describe roles, responsibilities,timeframes, and specifc activities for each stepof the change process. 285 In addition, administrators need to be aware of state-level variance in policies and practices, which can dictate the parameters and limitations of a program's features and implementation process. The consensus panel recommends that you do an organizational self-assessment and have a plan in place before implementing any organization-wide changes to policies and practices. Invest in Age-Sensitive Workforce Development To implement older adult-specifc SUD treatment programs and services successfully, program administrators must hire and retain highly motivated staff who are committed to serving older adults. To ensure staff are knowledgeable and have the skills to care for older adults with SUDs, engage in ongoing workforce development practices: 286,287 Develop staff recruitment, retention, andpromotion strategies that engage clinical andprogram staff who are knowledgeable aboutolder adult health, mental health, and substancemisuse and are motivated to work with thispopulation. Recruit older peer recovery support providersand create a work environment that recognizeslived experience as a valuable source ofknowledge. Develop pathways for integrating older peerr ecovery support providers into service teams and provide them with ongoing supervision andprofessional development opportunities. Create training plans and curriculums thataddress ageism, health disparities, and culturaldiversity among older adults; the culture ofaging; physical and mental health needs of olderadults; and treatment practices and evidence-based approaches that are effective with olderadults. Provide ongoing clinical and administrativesupervision that emphasizes the attitudes,knowledge, and skills required to care for olderadults. Evaluate staff performance on the attitudes,knowledge, and skills required to care for olderadults. Chapter 2 35 TIP 26The consensus panel recommends that you implement workforce development strategies for building or improving age-sensitive and age-specifc treatment for older adults with SUDs. Summary The principles of care this TIP describes will support efforts to develop and improve age-sensitive and age-specifc services for older adults with SUDs. The key to implementing these principles is to work collaboratively with staff, older clients, other providers, and community stakeholders to foster awareness and commitment to providing quality services to older adults and their families.

Chapter 2 36 TIP 26TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN OLDER ADULTS Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse in Older Adults KEY MESSAGES Behavioral health service and healthcare providers in any setting should screen older clients for substance misuse. Many different healthcare providers can play a role in this. There is no \"wrong door\" through which older adults can arrive at the right diagnosis and care. The main reason for screening and assessment is to help you decide whether, where, and how to address substance misuse. Substance misuse affects older adults differently than it does middle-aged and younger adults. Providers across settings should be trained in giving age-appropriate care. They also need to have the skills to recognize substance misuse in older clients. Chapter 3 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will most beneft providers. It discusses identifying, screening for, and assessing substance misuse in older clients. In the United States and elsewhere, more and more people ages 50 and older struggle with substance misuse, but many providers do not screen for, diagnose, or treat substance use disorders (SUDs) among this population. OLDER ADULTS are less likely to be screened for SUBSTANCE MISUSE and more likely to be taking MULTIPLE medications. Older adults are less likely than younger adults to receive screening and assessment for substance misuse. 288 This is potentially dangerous because, as people age, they are more likely to feel the negative effects of drugs and alcohol. Older adults are also more likely to take multiple medications, which means they may face dangerous and potentially fatal drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, identifying substance misuse in older adults is not simple. The signs and symptoms of substance misuse can be easily mistaken for normal aging or physical or mental disorders common in older populations. Even so, substance misuse is detectable and treatable among older adults. Yet if left untreated or poorly treated, it can shorten their lives and keep them from living healthily and independently. For example, substance misuse increases the risk of falls, cognitive impairment, overdose, heart disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers, HIV, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and mental disorders. 289,290 This chapter of TIP 26 will help behavioral health service providers, social service providers, and other healthcare providers who work with older adults better understand how, when, and why to use screening and assessment to address substance misuse in their older clients. Who Can Beneft From Chapter 3 of This TIP and How? Chapter 3 will support behavioral health service and healthcare providers who work with older adults in overcoming barriers to identifying, screening for, and assessing substance misuse in older clients by helping these providers: Recognize early warning signs of substance misuse in older adults. 37 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Understand the relationship between substance misuse and depression, anxiety, trauma, and problems with thinking (also called cognitive impairment). Become more aware of common myths about substance misuse in older adults. Who in the geriatric workforce should be identifying, screening for, or assessing substance misuse in older adults? Nearly everyone! The Institute of Medicine report The Mental Health and Substance Use Workforce for Older Adults: In Whose Hands? 291 notes that the full range of providers should help meet the needs of older adults who misuse substances. These providers include: Mental health service and SUD treatment providers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, psychiatric nurses, and addiction counselors. Primary care providers, general internists, family medicine practitioners, trained pharmacists, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants. Geriatricians, geriatric nurses, geriatric psychiatrists, geropsychologists, and gerontological social workers. Direct care workers who provide in-home support services. Peer recovery support service providers. Informal and formal caregivers. Supports within the faith community. Social service providers. Chapter 3 will be useful across settings in which these workers encounter older adults. No single service provider or setting is solely responsible for making sure older adults receive the substance use-related care they need. However, all providers and settings can fulfll an important role. Organization of Chapter 3 of This TIP Chapter 3 offers a wide range of information and strategies to help you screen, assess, and treat older clients for substance misuse. The frst section of Chapter 3 is about the challenges to screening and assessing older clients for substance misuse. It also discusses why you need to screen and assess these clients. You will be more likely to use screening and assessment once you understand why they are so important. In the end, this will help your clients increase their chances for recovery. The second section discusses how to screen for substance misuse in older adults. Screening for substance misuse also includes screening for co-occurring mental and neurocognitive disorders that can affect (and are affected by) substance use, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dementia. Knowing why, how, and whom to screen for substance misuse and co-occurring mental or neurocognitive disorders will help you provide more complete care. It also increases the chances of clients receiving the correct diagnosis and needed treatment. The third section describes how to use brief assessments\u2014an important follow-up to screening\u2014for clients who screen at risk for substance misuse and co-occurring mental or neurocognitive disorders. Brief assessment helps make or rule out diagnoses and aids you and your clients in making appropriate shared treatment decisions. The fourth section describes how to fully assess older adults who screen positive for moderate-to-severe substance misuse. A full assessment does more than just ask clients about substance use. It also asks about their overall health and well-being. This will give you a more complete picture of your clients' substance-related issues and will help you understand how substance misuse affects them. The ffth section guides providers in treatment planning, treating, or referring for treatment. Knowing how and why to screen and assess is only half the picture. Understanding what steps to take in offering effective care or referral for care is a cornerstone of good clinical practice. The fnal section identifes targeted resources to support your practice, from screening to referral. A more detailed resource guide is available in Chapter 9 of this TIP . Chapter 3 38 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse For defnitions of key terms you will fnd in Chapter 3 of this TIP , see Exhibit 3.1. EXHIBIT 3.1. Key Terms Addiction*: The most severe form of SUD, associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Age-specifc: Treatment approaches and practices specifcally developed for older adults (e.g., an older adult specialty group in a mixed-age SUD treatment program). Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). At-risk/high-risk drinking: Drinking alcohol in excessive amounts. This defnition encompasses both binge drinking and heavy drinking. Additionally, any alcohol consumption is considered risky when carried out by individuals with certain medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, those taking medicine that can interact harmfully with alcohol, those driving a car or engaged in other activities that require alertness, or people recovering from AUD. 292,293 Note that for purposes of this TIP, at-risk drinking and high-risk drinking are synonymous, and either term is acceptable to describe an older adult's drinking patterns. Binge drinking: A drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. This usually takes place after four or more drinks for women and fve or more drinks for men. 294,295 However, older adults are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and treatment providers may need to lower these numbers when screening for alcohol misuse.296 Additionally, other factors such as weight, decrease in enzyme activity, and body composition (e.g., amount of muscle tissue present in the body) can also affect alcohol absorption rates. Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living (ADLs), including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 297 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Drug-drug interaction: The interaction of one substance (e.g., alcohol, medication, an illicit drug) with another substance. Drug-drug interactions may change the effectiveness of medications, introduce or alter the intensity of side effects, and increase a substance's toxicity or the concentration of that substance in a person's blood. Potentially serious interactions can also occur with certain foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. 298 Heavy drinking: Consuming fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women in one period on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days. 299 Illicit substances: Illicit substances include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and prescription medications that are taken other than as prescribed (e.g., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives). Moderate drinking: According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defned as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 300,301 However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over several days. 302 Additionally, individuals who don't metabolize alcohol well may need to consume even lower quantities. Some people, particularly those with certain alcohol-related illnesses or engaging in tasks requiring concentration, should not consume alcohol at all. The Dietary Guidelines stipulate that those who don't drink should not begin drinking for any reason. 303 Continued on next page Chapter 3 39 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued Psychoactive substances: Substances that can alter mental processes (e.g., cognition or affect; in other words, the way one thinks or feels). Also called psychotropic drugs, such substances will not necessarily produce dependence, but they have the potential for misuse or abuse. 304 Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When those positive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder. The ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defnes remission as present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving). 305 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Screening: A process for evaluating the possible presence of a specifc problem. The outcome is normally a simple yes or no. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT): An evidence-based, comprehensive, integrated public health approach to identify, reduce, and prevent misuse of and dependence on alcohol and illicit drugs. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to DSM-5, 306 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function, and by impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions of DSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerly called substance dependence. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Chapter 3 40 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Challenges to Identifcation, Screening, and Assessment Some health experts have called older adults who misuse substances an \"invisible\" population. 307,308 Although older adults have frequent medical visits, behavioral health or healthcare providers often do not recognize substance misuse in their older clients. Older clients are less likely than younger clients to tell you that they are having a problem with substance use and are less likely to ask for treatment. 309 Some barriers older adults face are unique to their population. Older adults' substance misuse can stay \"hidden\" when: 310 Providers believe that older clients do not have alcohol or drug problems later in life. (\"Drug use is a young person's problem.\" Or, \"No one starts abusing alcohol in their 60s.\") Providers have negative thoughts and attitudes about aging. This is also called ageism. (\"Talking about drugs and alcohol with someone who is older is a waste of time.\" Or, \"He's 83 years old and has been drinking his whole life. He's never going to change, so why bother?\" Or, \"Older people are less likely to change or beneft from treatment.\") Providers feel uncomfortable talking about substance use and misuse with older adults. (\"Given his age, I don't want to be disrepectful or tell him what to do.\") Family members feel uncomfortable asking an older relative to stop using substances\u2014 especially alcohol. (\"I'd rather not ask Mom to stop drinking. I'd be taking away her one last pleasure in life.\") Providers lack knowledge about drug and alcohol screening and assessment tools. (\"I don't know the frst thing about how to look for addiction problems in older clients.\") Providers and family members misunderstand the difference between symptoms of substance misuse and similar symptoms of physical and cognitive decline or mental illness common in older populations. Such problems include dementia, pain, anxiety, and depression. (\"At her age, it's normal to forget people's names. Drinking has nothing to do with it,\" or, \"Dad's not depressed; he just lost his 'pep' in getting older.\") Providers believe that they don't have enough time to give screening and assessment measures. (\"I barely have time to see all my clients. There's just no time for screening and assessment.\") Older adults experience substance-related functional impairment, which providers may have a hard time detecting in older clients who no longer work, drive, or have signifcant obligations to others professionally or at home. Older adults seek services in nontraditional addiction treatment settings. Providers spend too little time with clients (and older adults in particular). To remove these barriers, providers need education and skills training aimed at helping them better recognize possible substance misuse in their older clients. To spot substance misuse in older clients as early as possible, tailor your approach to working with them: Be aware of your beliefs about/attitudes toward older clients that make you not screen for substance misuse. Choose a method for drug and alcohol screening that you can use with all older clients. Use an interview style that older clients will fnd comfortable (e.g., supportive). Train counselors on how to spot substance misuse early. Screening for Substance Misuse in Older Adults Substance misuse is common among clients seen in healthcare311 and behavioral health service settings. Although most older adults do not misuse substances, some do. Consider these facts, which show that substance misuse does occur in older people: In 2019, estimates showed that 4.7 million adults ages 50 and older had a past-year SUD. 312 Chapter 3 41 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults In 2019, an estimated 8.8 million adults ages 50 and older reported using an illicit drug in the past month. 313 In 2019, more than 56 million adults ages 50 and older were estimated to have engaged in past-month alcohol use. 314 The rate of prescription opioid misuse among older adults (ages 60 and older) is lower than among younger adults (ages 20 to 59), but from 2006 to 2013, older adults increasingly misused prescription opioids with suicidal intent and showed an increasing trend in death rate. 315 Know the different types of prescription medications older clients may misuse. These include: Sedative-hypnotics: These medications are often used to help people relax or sleep. They include barbiturates (like amobarbital and secobarbital) as well as benzodiazepines (like lorazepam and alprazolam). Opioid analgesics: These medications are often prescribed to provide pain relief by attaching to opioid receptors in the brain. Examples include oxycodone and hydrocodone. Why, When, and How To Screen The TIP consensus panel recommends that addiction treatment, other behavioral health service, and healthcare providers screen for alcohol, tobacco, prescription drug, and illicit drug use in all older clients at least annually. The TIP consensus panel recommends performing universal screening during health visits. Screening and assessment are very important steps in diagnosing substance misuse and making the right care decisions. Screening can help you answer the following important questions: Does my client need an assessment? Although the two terms are often confused for one another, \"screening\" is not the same as \"assessment.\" Screening is the process of evaluating whethersymptoms of substance misuse are present. Screening helps you decide whether further assessment is necessary. Assessments give detailed information for diagnosis, treatment decisions, and treatment planning. Is my client's substance use potentially harmful? Screening can help you learn whether a client's alcohol or drug use could be harmful because of an existing condition or use of prescription medications. In some cases, any substance use at all may be harmful. Many older clients have chronic medical illnesses and take more than one prescription medication. Combining drugs and alcohol with medications can be dangerous and even lead to death. Drug and alcohol use can also make certain illnesses worse and keep clients from feeling their best. Does my client seem afraid to ask for help? Screening is necessary because older clients are less likely than younger clients to ask directly for help. 316 However, older adults are diverse, and older adults from the baby boomer generation (birth dates 1946 through 1964) may be more willing to discuss SUD and mental illness with their healthcare providers than earlier generations. Screening is helpful when clients feel afraid or ashamed of revealing their problem spontaneously. SUDs are chronic conditions. You can help older clients feel less shame and stigma by talking about substance misuse in the same way you would a mental disorder, like depression or anxiety. Use basic terms rather than confusing or judgmental language. Be sure to also ask about their overall health, functioning, and well-being. This shows clients that you are concerned and feel empathy for them rather than making them feel like their substance use is a consequence of weak willpower or a personal faw. My client doesn't seem to meet diagnostic criteria for an SUD. Could this person still be misusing substances? Screening is initially more useful than relying solely on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Most older adults who misuse substances do not meet full DSM-5 criteria for a specifc SUD but may be engaging in risky use of substances. This is because several key criteria are not typically present in older adults. Chapter 3 42 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse For example, older adults have lower tolerance for substances like alcohol than younger and middle-aged adults and may experience harmful effects at lower amounts of consumption than younger adults. Compared with younger and middle-aged adults, older adults are signifcantly less likely to endorse the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse criterion for alcohol use in \"physically hazardous\" situations. 317 Does my client need SUD treatment? Screening can lead to earlier treatment, and thus, better health. 318 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that healthcare providers screen for unhealthy alcohol use in adults age 18 years or older and provide people engaged in risky or hazardous drinking with brief behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use (www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryDraft/ unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions). Chapter 3 will help you decide which screening tools to use, how and when to administer them, and who should do so. Every practice should select screening tools and develop procedures for who will give the screenings and when to give them. You can select screening measures based on which substances you want to ask about (Exhibit 3.2). Be aware that not all of these measures have been validated\u2014in other words, tested and approved for use\u2014in older adults. Your practice should also identify steps to take when screening tests are positive (see the section \"Communicating Screening Results\"). No screeners have been statistically validated for assessing prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medication misuse that would identify accidental misuse or noncompliance issues. Nevertheless, healthcare and behavioral health service providers should assess how older adults use such medications, with an eye toward potential adverse reactions and interactions. The American Geriatrics Society's 2019 Beers Criteria \u00ae address medications that are potentially inappropriately prescribed for older adults. 319 See the Chapter 6 text box on the 2019 Beers Criteria\u00ae.

Screen regularly, before starting new medication, and when potentially substance-related problems arise, such as injury or accidents. Have clinical assistants administer screening instruments in an interview or as part of other health screenings. Provide a paper or digital tablet version for clients to complete by themselves. USPSTF recommends electronic screening and brief intervention as an effective strategy to prevent excessive alcohol use. 320 Some older adults may not be comfortable using computers or tablets. Others may have diffculty reading or writing. Be sensitive to each client's skills and abilities when selecting screening formats. Chapter 3 43 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Review screening results and discuss them with clients. Help clients understand their risk levels and the consequences of substance misuse. Gauge motivation and readiness for change. Keeping an open, nonjudgmental attitude will help your clients feel more comfortable sharing more information with you. Make sure you have the required training and credentials or licensure before performing screening, assessment, or diagnosis. If no providers in your program have appropriate licenses or credentials to screen, assess, or diagnose clients for mental disorders, refer clients to another program for those needs. Also make sure you review the training requirements on administration and scoring; formal training may be required prior to using some instruments. When formal training is unnecessary, learn how to give each screening measure and assessment; instructions and scoring may vary depending on population demographic features and other factors. Federal guidelines for moderate drinking are as follows:321,322,323 Overall consumption that minimizes risk and can help avoid alcohol-related problems includes: No more than one standard drink a day for women and no more than two standard drinks a day for men. These numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over multiple days. However, guidelines do not recommend that individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking for any reason. 324 Older adults should not drink any alcohol if they: Are taking alcohol-interactive prescription medications, especially psychoactive prescription medications (e.g., opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines). Have medical conditions that can be made worse by alcohol (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). Are planning to drive a car or participate in other activities requiring alertness and skill. Are recovering from AUD. Substance Misuse Screening Measures Appropriate for Use With Older Adults This section discusses examples of substance misuse screening instruments useful for older adults. A full selection of screening resources appears in the Chapter 3 Appendix. Many tools described here were developed specifcally for older adults. Some are self-report tools (i.e., clients complete the tools themselves); a behavioral health service provider must deliver others. Older clients may have limited vision or diffculty writing and may need help completing screens. Alcohol Screening USPSTF recommends screening adults for alcohol misuse, 325 including screening for risky drinking and AUD with brief instruments like the AUDIT-C. USPSTF also recommends brief counseling for clients who engage in risky drinking. 326,327 A very brief \"prescreen,\" especially for alcohol misuse, can be easily incorporated into healthcare clinic or social service agency screening protocols. A short prescreen is not burdensome as a universal screening tool. However, many clients will be ruled negative for problematic use. If results are positive, more comprehensive assessments can be administered to determine severity and make treatment recommendations. For more information about alcohol screening, see the \"Screening and Assessment\" section in Chapter 4 of this TIP. AUDIT The AUDIT was developed to screen for heavy alcohol use. It can reveal alcohol misuse in people ages 65 and older. 328 The frst three AUDIT questions measure alcohol intake and are known as the AUDIT-C. Use the AUDIT or the AUDIT-C to get more detailed information from clients who use alcohol. The AUDIT has demonstrated reliability in studies of AUD screening. 329 The AUDIT (self-report version) and the AUDIT-C are available in the Chapter 3 Appendix. Chapter 3 44 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse SAMI The SAMI330 is a fve-item questionnaire for older adults who may engage in risky alcohol use. This questionnaire includes a checklist of symptoms and open-ended questions about alcohol use. 331 A score of 1 or higher suggests problem alcohol use. The SAMI is available in the Chapter 3 Appendix. SMAST-G The SMAST-G is the frst brief alcohol misuse screener developed for older adults. If a client marks two or more items on the SMAST-G with a \"yes\" response, that suggests potential alcohol misuse. 332 The SMAST-G is available in the Chapter 3 Appendix. Cannabis Screening CUDIT-R The CUDIT-R333 measures cannabis misuse in the past 6 months. Developed from the AUDIT measure, it is a short version of the 20-item CUDIT screener. A score of 12 or higher means you should assess for cannabis use disorder. Yet this cutoff score has not been tested thoroughly. Do not assume that a score below 13 means the client does not misuse cannabis. 334 The CUDIT-R is available in the Chapter 3 Appendix. Screening for Multiple Substances ASSIST ASSIST screens clients for all categories of substance misuse, including alcohol and tobacco (see \"Resource Alert: The ASSIST Screener\"). This World Health Organization (WHO) screener also measures substance-specifc risk. Many providers do not use the ASSIST because it is long and somewhat hard to score. A computer version and a shorter version (ASSIST-Lite; see https://eassist. adelaide.edu.au/#/eassist-lite for a computer version) are available and easier to use. 335,336,337 RESOURCE ALERT: THE ASSIST SCREENER The full version of WHO's ASSIST screener, scoring system, and client feedback guidance can be downloaded in multiple languages (www.who.int/ substance_abuse/activities/assist_test/en). Brief Addiction Monitor The Brief Addiction Monitor is a 17-item scale originally made for the Veterans Health Administration healthcare system. 338 It can indicate the severity of a client's substance misuse and show how people in treatment or recovery are doing. 339 The Brief Addiction Monitor asks about risk factors for substance misuse (e.g., craving, family or social problems) as well as factors that protect against substance misuse (e.g., social supports for recovery, religion or spirituality). This instrument is available at www. mentalhealth.va.gov/communityproviders/docs/ bam_continuous_3-10-14.pdf. CAGE-AID The CAGE (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener) Questionnaire is widely used to screen for risk of alcohol misuse. A similar version, the CAGE-AID, 340 asks about substance misuse. A \"yes\" response on any of the questions can mean substance misuse is present. However, the CAGE-AID does not ask about certain important aspects of substance use, including past substance use, frequency of use, and effects of using the substance. The CAGE-AID should be used with, but not in place of, longer and more detailed alcohol and drug screeners. It is available at www. hiv.uw.edu/page/substance-use/cage-aid. Chapter 3 45 TIP 26 NIDA Quick Screen V1 0 The NIDA Quick Screen V1.0 is a brief screener that asks about a client's past-year use of alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs (nonmedical use), and illegal drugs. If a client answers \"yes\" to the question about using illegal drugs, follow up by giving a slightly longer screening tool called the NIDA-Modifed ASSIST V2.0. Both tools are available on NIDA's website (www.drugabuse.gov/ sites/default/fles/pdf/nmassist.pdf). Screening for Co-Occurring Disorders and Conditions Co-Occurring Mental Disorders Many older people who misuse substances also have co-occurring mental disorders. Some of these disorders, like major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and PTSD, have symptoms similar to those seen in substance misuse and in cognitive impairment. You might at times have diffculty telling these conditions apart from one another. Co-occurring mental disorders can make substance misuse worse or result from substance misuse. You might be surprised to learn that: In 2019, approximately 1.7 million U.S. adults ages 50 and older had an SUD and a mental disorder. 341 Approximately 36.8 percent of adults older than age 50 with SUDs also have mental disorders, and 10.7 percent of adults over 50 with mental disorders also have SUDs. 342 SUDs in older adults often occur alongside depression and other affective disorders, psychosis, and cognitive disorders (e.g., dementia). 343,344 Older people with serious mental illness (SMI; complex mental disorders like bipolar disorders and schizophrenia) are especially likely to misuse substances compared with older adults without SMI, 345 but more research is needed. For example, of more than 7,000 adults ages 50 and older receiving inpatient services for SMI, 26 percent also met criteria for an SUD. 346 The most common SUD was for cocaine (9.5 percent). Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults In 2019, approximately 1.7M Americans 50 and older were living with an SUD & a MENTAL DISORDER. For older adults with both an SUD and a mental disorder, alcohol misuse and depression are a common combination. 347 Having these two co-occurring disorders (CODs) may lead to negative physical and behavioral health consequences. For example, in a study of adults ages 65 and older who were receiving inpatient treatment for depression, those with co-occurring alcohol misuse had higher rates of drug use, liver disease, and suicidality than older adults with depression who did not also misuse alcohol. 348 Be sure to screen older clients who misuse substances for co-occurring mental and cognitive disorders as well. Exhibit 3.3 indicates which screening measure to use by specifc disorder, plus it lists a screening instrument for elder abuse. Older adults may also be at risk for negative outcomes, including: Increased mortality.349 Increased risk of unintentional injuries leading to emergency department service use. 350 Increased risk of self-harm.351 Older adult men are at especially high risk for suicide. Older adults with CODs may also have an increased risk of suicide attempt, but this requires more research. 352 Self-medication through substance misuse.

Screening Tools for Co-Occurring Mental and Cognitive Disorders Co-occurring conditions in general Comorbidity Alcohol Risk Evaluation Tool (CARET) Depression Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-Short Form Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Anxiety Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) PTSD, trauma symptoms, and elder abuse PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 Primary Care PTSD Screen for Abuse Suspicion Index\u00a9 (EASI\u00a9) Cognitive impairment Mini-Cog\u00a9 CARET You can screen for CODs using the CARET, which was developed from the short version of the Alcohol-Related Problems Survey. 353 Research supports using the CARET with older adults354,355 to identify those at risk for alcohol misuse. The CARET asks about alcohol-related risk factors and risky behaviors\u2014many of which you may see in older clients. Such risk factors and risky behaviors include using alcohol while also: Having physical conditions negatively affected by drinking (like high blood pressure and diabetes). Having a history of falls or accidents. Having memory problems. Having trouble sleeping. Feeling sad or \"blue.\" Taking medications that can be harmful when mixed with alcohol. These include arthritis and pain medications, depression medications, blood thinners, antiseizure medications, and sleep medications. Driving a car or other vehicle. For more information about the items in the CARET and how to score them, please see Barnes et al., 2010. 356 Depression Screening Make sure to screen for depression. Depression is both a risk factor for and an outcome of substance misuse in older individuals. 357 Approximately 4.7 percent of adults in the United States ages 50 and older have depression. 358 MDD is commonly found in older clients who misuse substances.359,360 GDS-Short Form One of the most commonly used depression screeners for older adults is the short form of the GDS 361 (Exhibit 3.4). Clients with a GDS score of 6 or higher need further assessment and may need treatment for MDD. 362 Clients with a GDS score below 6 should be screened again in 1 month if symptoms of depression are still present. 363 If a client's depressive symptoms are no longer present in 1 month, give the depression screener again in 6 months. 364 Chapter 3 47 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 3.4.

The PHQ-9 is available via https://cde.drugabuse.gov/instrument/ f226b1a0-897c-de2a-e040-bb89ad4338b9. A two-item version of the PHQ-9 is available (the PHQ-2) that includes only the frst two questions from the PHQ-9. However, compared with the PHQ-9, the PHQ-2 has a higher likelihood of giving older adults a false positive (that is, incorrectly rating a person as depressed when they are not). 368 To get more reliable results, you should give the full PHQ-9. If you give the PHQ-2, be sure to give the full PHQ-9 to older adults who have a total score of 3 or higher. 369 Scoring: The total score for the PHQ-9 is derived by frst summing each column (e.g., each item chosen in column \"More than half the days\" = 2), then summing the column totals. Total scores range from 0 to 27 and indicate the following levels of depression severity: 0-4: None-minimal 5-9: Mild depression 10-14: Moderate depression 15-19: Moderately severe depression 20-27: Severe depression In addition to the total score, review responses to Question #9 (suicidality) and the unnumbered question below it (the effect of symptoms on the client's daily functioning) when determining whether to initiate or refer for further assessment and treatment. 370,371,372 Screening for Anxiety About 10 to 11 percent of older adults have had an anxiety disorder in the past year. 373,374 About 15 percent have had an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. 375 Older women may be especially at risk for anxiety. The number of women ages 55 and older with any anxiety disorder in the past year has been estimated to be almost double that of older men (about 14 percent versus nearly 8 percent). 376 Anxiety is underdiagnosed in the older adult population. 377 Providers may view older clients' worries and concerns as a normal part of aging.378 Older adults' symptoms of anxiety can also be mistaken for physical conditions common in older age, as well as depression. 379 Chapter 3 49 TIP 26 Yet different types of anxiety disorders can and do occur in older people. Some of these include: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and social phobia. 380 In the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, the 12-month prevalence of GAD in people ages 65 and older was 1.2 percent. 381 In the same study, 0.7 percent of adults ages 65 and older had past-year panic disorder, and 2.7 percent had past-year social phobia. PTSD. Estimates of past-year PTSD prevalence for those 65 or older range from 0.4 percent to 2.6 percent. 382,383 Symptoms of anxiety that are present but do not meet full criteria for an anxiety disorder are more common than full anxiety disorders. As many as half, or possibly slightly more, of older adults in the community and in treatment settings may have anxiety symptoms. 384 It is not unusual for older people with anxiety to misuse substances, especially alcohol and tobacco: In the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, adults 65 and older with any anxiety disorder in their lifetime had a 1.5 times greater chance of having a lifetime AUD, when compared with adults 65 and older without anxiety disorders. 385 They also had a 1.6 times greater chance of having a lifetime tobacco use disorder. 386 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Among older people assessed for treatment for alcohol misuse, 387 the most commonly reported reason for using alcohol among women (24 percent) was \"to reduce tension or anxiety.\" This was also the second-most-common reason reported by men (20 percent). Adults ages 55 and older with GAD in the past year were 2.2 times more likely to have had an SUD in the past year. 388 Adults ages 50 to 64 who had an anxiety disorder in the past year were 1.7 times more likely to have smoked cigarettes in the past year. 389 A review of anxiety assessment tools created for or approved for use with older people 390 found the PSWQ and the Geriatric Mental Status Examination are useful and strongly supported by scientifc evidence. The Geriatric Mental Status Examination is a somewhat lengthy semistructured interview, not a brief screening tool. For that reason, it is not included here. Another valid and reliable self-report anxiety scale designed specifcally for older people is the GAS (Exhibit 3.5). 391 The original GAS has 30 items. A short form of only 10 items was developed and, like the full measure, was found to be valid for use in older people. 392 Higher scores on the GAS indicate higher anxiety. More research in larger clinical samples is needed to determine the optimal cutoff score, although in the 30-item scale, a cutoff of 16 may be clinically useful. 393 Chapter 3 50 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse EXHIBIT 3.5.

Each item loads on only one scale. Items 26 through 30 are used to help clinicians identify areas of concern for the respondent. They are not used to calculate the total score of the GAS or any subscale. Total Score = sum of items 1 through 25. Somatic subscale (9 items) = sum of items 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 17, 21, 22, 23 Cognitive subscale (8 items) = sum of items 4, 5, 12, 16, 18, 19, 24, 25 Affective subscale (8 items) = sum of items 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 \u00a9 Daniel L. Segal, Ph.D., 2014. Reprinted with permission.394 The PSWQ395 is a self-report instrument with 16 items, each rated on a 5-point scale. Items 1, 3, 8, 10, and 11 are reverse scored as follows: Very typical of me = 1 (circled 5 on the sheet) Circled 4 on the sheet = 2 Circled 3 on the sheet = 3 Circled 2 on the sheet = 4 Not at all typical of me = 5 (circled 1 on the sheet) The remaining items are scored regularly. The item scores are added to produce a total score ranging from 16 to 80, with higher scores refecting more worry. A score of 50 or higher by an older person could mean signifcant worries are present, but research on cutoff scores in older people is too limited to know for certain. 396 Do not assume that an older client who scores below 50 does not have anxiety. The PSWQ is available in the Chapter 3 Appendix. Screening for PTSD, Trauma Symptoms, and Abuse People with PTSD are at high risk for substance misuse. 397 People with PTSD may use substances to help themselves cope and feel better. Even if a person does not meet criteria for PTSD, experiencing a traumatic event at any point in one's life raises the risk for substance misuse. 398,399 As with any other clients, explore whether older clients have a history of trauma. About 52 percent of people 50 and older have had at least one adverse childhood experience, 400 such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, or extremely stressful family events including: Seeing the abuse of a family member. Living in the home with someone who misuses substances or has a mental disorder. Experiencing the death of a parent or abandonment by one's parents. Chapter 3 52 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Having a household member in the criminal justice system. PTSD in older adults is not very common. Past-year PTSD occurs in only about 0.4 percent to 2.6 percent of people ages 65 and older. 401,402 Many people with trauma do not meet criteria for PTSD but do meet criteria for depression. 403 Thus, depression screening is important in older clients who misuse substances. Trauma in older clients can include being a current victim of elder abuse. According to CDC, 1 in 10 adults (ages 60 or older) who live at home is a victim of elder abuse each year. 404 Elder abuse can manifest as emotional (or mental) abuse, fnancial abuse (or exploitation), physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. 405 Of women over age 65, 20 to 30 percent have been victims of intimate partner violence. 406 Older adults who experience abuse are more likely to:407 Have depression or anxiety. Have thoughts of suicide. Attempt suicide. Need emergency department care. Be hospitalized. Die prematurely. Some research shows that older adults from minority ethnic or racial groups may be more likely to experience abuse. 408 The most recent nationally representative study of elder abuse found that lack of social support is a primary risk factor for experiencing elder abuse and for having negative outcomes following such abuse. 409 Cognitive disorders are a major risk factor for experiencing abuse. Older adults with dementia are almost fve times more likely to be victims of abuse as older people without dementia. 410 Ask all older clients with ongoing or past substance misuse about their history of trauma, including trauma in childhood and current trauma. Be sure to ask about any current abuse, including intimate partner abuse. Use brief screening measures to further explore these areas. Screening for trauma and abuse in older clients is important, as older adults with PTSD may have different or milder symptoms than younger clients. PTSD can thus be harder to recognize in older people. 411 Trauma is a sensitive topic for many clients. You need to know not just what to ask but how to ask it. Otherwise, clients might \"shut down\" or feel uncomfortable sharing private details with you. Some tips to help you assess trauma fully but in a gentle, sensitive manner include the following: 412 Remind the client you are there as a support. Explain what will take place during and after the screening and assessment so that the individual knows what to expect. Use screening and assessment tools that have been well researched and approved for use with older adults. Remember that trauma can come in many forms. Use a checklist or question list to make sure you cover all possible traumas and not just ones that are commonly thought of (like physical and sexual abuse). You can fnd more information about Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on the CDC's website (www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/ childabuseandneglect/acestudy/index.html). Tell clients that they can answer whichever questions they wish, however they wish. If they choose to only partly answer a question, that's okay. If they choose not to answer a question at all, that's also fne. Remind them that they are safe. Sometimes talking about a trauma can feel scary, as if the traumatic event is happening again. You don't want clients to feel that talking about their trauma is dangerous. This could lead them to avoid talking about it altogether, and that is not helpful. Do not ask clients to \"relive\" their trauma by describing it in detail. Let your clients answer questions about their trauma in the ways that are most comfortable to them. There's no \"right or wrong way\" for them to talk about their experiences. Ask how the client's trauma symptoms affect functioning. This includes ability to complete daily activities, engage in self-care, and maintain intimate relationships and a healthy social life. Screen clients with histories of trauma for CODs and suicide risk. Some people naturally feel more comfortable sharing information in writing than verbally. Chapter 3 53 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Have paper-and-pencil or computerized self- report trauma measures on hand for clients who would rather not take part in a clinical interview. Share resources and information with clients as needed to keep them safe and feeling supported. End positively. After assessment, ensure that the client feels safe and ready to leave the session. PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Exhibit 3.6) is an updated version of the widely used and researched PTSD Checklist (PCL), which was based on DSM-IV criteria. Not much research has yet been conducted on the use of the PCL-5 with older adults. The PCL-5 has been used to screen for PTSD in some studies of older veterans, 413,414,415 but these studies were not designed to look at the validity of the PCL-5 in aging populations. More research is needed in this area. The optimal PCL-5 cutoff score in older adults is unclear. One study of Vietnam veterans (thus, mostly older men) found a PCL-5 score of 37 made the best cutoff for PTSD screening. 416 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) instructions on the PCL-5 (www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ assessment/adult-sr/ptsd-checklist.asp) note a cutoff score of 33 as \"reasonable\" to use until further research is published on the best cutoff scores in different groups of people (such as veterans versus civilians). 417 The VA warns that cutoff scores from the original PCL and those for the PCL-5 are neither equal nor interchangeable given that the PCL-5 contains changes in rating scales and number of items. You should not use PCL cutoff scores when interpreting scores from the PCL-5. EXHIBIT 3.6.

You should ask the client Questions 1 through 5. You can answer Question 6 yourself. Questions apply to the last 12 months. A \"yes\" response on one or more questions (other than on Question 1) is considered a positive screen. This measure appears in the Chapter 3 Appendix. Screening for Co-Occurring Cognitive Disorders You should also screen older clients who misuse substances for cognitive impairment, which includes dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Dementia is a brain disorder affecting mental ability and personality that gets worse over time. Several types of dementia exist, such as Alzheimer's (the most common form) and Parkinson's dementia. People with dementia have diffculties in at least one area of thinking, such as memory, learning, language, or attention. These diffculties make it hard for people to live their everyday lives without help from others (e.g., needing help getting dressed, bathing, feeding themselves, or managing their money). Current research suggests almost 9 percent of Americans ages 65 and older have dementia. 423 That includes over 3 percent of people ages 65 to 74, roughly 10.5 percent of people ages 75 to 84, and almost 30 percent of people ages 85 and older. 424 MCI is a milder form of cognitive impairment that often represents early brain changes that may precede and lead to dementia. In MCI, defcits in thinking from a previous level of performance are present but are not severe enough for a person to need help from others in their everyday life. A person with MCI is at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. About 10 percent to 20 percent of adults in the United States ages 65 and older have MCI, with the likelihood increasing with age. 425,426,427 (Chapter 6 of this TIP provides more information about cognitive disorders and older adults who misuse substances.) Chapter 3 56 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Substance misuse, especially heavy alcohol use, can negatively affect thinking. Keep in mind that: Heavy alcohol use can harm the brain, heart, liver, and other organs. 428,429 Alcohol's negative effects on the brain can lead to memory problems, diffculty learning new information, and diffculty thinking quickly. 430,431,432 Heavy alcohol use can also cause brain cells and tissues to shrink or no longer work properly. 433 In some people, even moderate alcohol use can harm the brain. 434 Heavy drinking may do more harm to older adults' cognitive abilities than those of younger adults. 435 Less research has been done on how substances other than alcohol can affect one's chances of having a cognitive disorder like dementia or MCI. However, the long-term use of benzodiazepines, 436,437,438 cannabis,439,440,441 cocaine,442 and tobacco does seem to carry a somewhat greater risk of cognitive problems.443 Mini-Cog\u00a9 The Mini-Cog\u00a9 is a brief screening tool that was created to detect dementia in older adults. It takes about 3 minutes to complete and involves a verbal memory task and a clock drawing task. The Alzheimer's Association endorses using the Mini-Cog \u00a9 in primary care settings to screen for cognitive impairment, and the National Institute on Aging lists it as an instrument to consider using for this purpose. 444,445 Several reviews have found the Mini-Cog\u00a9 to have acceptable-to-good test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, specifcity, negative predictive value), although research suggests that it is better at detecting dementia than MCI. 446,447,448 The Mini-Cog\u00a9 and its administration and scoring instructions are freely available to individual clinicians at https://mini-cog.com/mini-cog-instrument/standardized-mini-cog-instrument. Two brief screening tools for cognitive impairment that have been more widely administered\u2014the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (which was created to screen for MCI) and the Mini-Mental State Examination\u2014now have costs associated with their use. 449,450 Communicating Screening Results Knowing what to do after screening is as important as knowing why and how to screen in the frst place. Whether negative or positive, you should inform all clients of their screening results. Read further to learn the specifc steps to take next, which will differ based on the client's screening results. Negative Results No formal intervention is needed for people who screen negative. Instead: Acknowledge clients who are substance free. (\"I see that it's important to you not to smoke.\") Offer positive comments about the benefts of drug- and alcohol-free living. (\"You know, people who don't smoke generally live longer, healthier lives than people who do.\") Reinforce attitudes, behaviors, and strategies that promote health. Think about asking whether their lack of substance use is new or lifelong, or whether it is because they are in recovery. (\"Not drinking is a healthy decision. What made you decide not to drink?\") For older adults who screen negative or at low risk for substance misuse, be sure to: Use positive language to urge them to continue using substances appropriately. Give brief education, such as reminding them of low-risk alcohol intake levels for older adults. Continue monitoring them for future signs and symptoms of possible at-risk substance use. Even if a screener is negative, the TIP consensus panel recommends that you occasionally rescreen clients. Why is that necessary? Because substance use can change over an individual's lifetime. Substance use patterns can also change with life events, cognitive functioning, and mental health status. Chapter 3 57 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults No clear scientifc data indicate exactly how often you should rescreen clients. The TIP consensus panel recommends that you use your clinical judgment to determine how often to rescreen. You might consider screening more often (at least once a year) if the client has repeatedly requested prescription drugs or has certain conditions, such as: Physical conditions that are often alcohol or drug related (e.g., high blood pressure, insomnia). Diabetes or ulcers unresponsive to treatment. Staph infection on face, arms, or legs. Repeated fractures, lacerations, or burns. Depression. Unexplained weight loss. Frequent falls. Repeated trauma suggesting domestic violence. Sexually transmitted diseases. When doing an SUD screen, if the depression screener is negative but the client has some symptoms of depression, you will want to give another depression screen in 1 month. Symptoms to look for include low mood, diffculty making decisions, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, and feelings of hopelessness. You should continue to monitor the client's symptoms over time. You may want to give another depression screen earlier if the client reports worsening symptoms or if the client seems to be feeling worse. If the depression screen is negative and the client has few or no symptoms of depression, you can continue screening on a yearly basis. If the client reports new symptoms or you suspect the person may be feeling depressed at any time, you should give a depression screener again. When doing an SUD screen, if trauma or elder abuse screeners are negative, continue with routine clinical care. Rescreen any time you suspect that trauma or abuse has occurred. For instance, if a client reports disagreements with her husband and has visible bruises, screen for possible abuse. You can also give a substance-related, depression, or trauma screener again if the client experiences major changes that could lead to substance misuse, depression, anxiety, or PTSD. Such changes include the death of someone signifcant to the client, a transition to an assisted living residence or nursing home, or retirement. Positive Results For clients who screen positive for potential substance misuse, three possible approaches exist. These are based on the severity of the problem and possible risk of having substance misuse. (None of the three approaches listed below is appropriate for an intoxicated client, who may need an immediate and specifc response [e.g., referral to detoxifcation].) The three approaches are: Immediately give a brief assessment during the same visit in which you gave the screening measure. (See the section \"Conducting Brief Assessments and Interventions\" below.) Give a full assessment if the screening results are unclear. You may need to schedule another visit for this longer assessment. Refer the client to another provider for assessment. Refer high-risk clients to a program where specialized SUD treatment services are available, if possible. If a cognitive screener is positive, you should refer the client for further testing by a behavioral health service provider with special training in diagnosing clients with dementia and MCI. Making such diagnoses requires additional, indepth cognitive testing. Do not give a diagnosis of dementia or MCI based solely on a positive cognitive screen. If a depression, anxiety, PTSD, or trauma screener is positive, give a full assessment using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to determine whether a disorder is present (or refer the client for further evaluation if you do not have the training and credentials to make a mental disorder diagnosis). Chapter 3 58 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse This may mean giving a full diagnostic interview, perhaps at another appointment. Even if full diagnostic criteria are not met, the client may still beneft from treatment if symptoms are upsetting or interfere with daily living. If an elder abuse screener is positive, follow your state's laws on reporting suspected abuse. Unless you work in private practice, you frst need to contact your immediate supervisor to ensure that you are following program procedures and abiding by state laws. You may need to consult with social services or Adult Protective Services on next steps. The Department of Justice provides a list of online resources to help you learn your state's laws about reporting abuse and involving Adult Protective Services (www. justice.gov/elderjustice/elder-justice-statutes-0). The National Center on Elder Abuse links to state-specifc reporting numbers and other agencies (https://ncea.acl.gov/Resources/State.aspx). Make sure you are familiar with these laws and resources before giving abuse screeners so that you can act right away if a screener is positive. Present the results of positive screens to clients in a gentle manner. For example, you might say, \"After reviewing your answers on the screening questionnaire, there are some things I'd like to follow up on with you,\" or, \"Your answers are similar to the answers of people who may be having a problem with alcohol.\" Conducting Brief Assessments and Interventions Positive screens for substance misuse require follow-up, but next steps may not be immediately clear. Decisions about follow-up care depend on how much time and effort you can expend, how much training and experience you have in drug and alcohol counseling, and your program's treatment abilities. Also essential are the client's agreement, engagement level, and preferences. Starting Of on the Right Foot A successful assessment starts by creating a welcoming environment. This is key to helping older clients \"open up\" and feel safe talking about substance misuse. You can do this by keeping a gentle, respectful, and empathetic attitude. Many clients who misuse substances feel uncomfortable talking about their substance use in medical settings. A friendly, nonjudgmental atmosphere can put clients at ease and help them share information they may fnd embarrassing, like feeling depressed or being abused. 451 Using motivational interviewing approaches, such as asking open-ended questions, is more helpful than asking basic yes/no questions. 452 (See the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's [SAMHSA] update of TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder Treatment [https://store.samhsa. gov/product/TIP-35-Enhancing-Motivation-for - Change-in-Substance-Use-Disorder-Treatment/ PEP19-02-01-003]). What is motivational interviewing (MI)? Per SAMHSA, it is a clinical approach to helping clients make positive changes in their behavior. MI involves techniques like showing concern and empathy, avoiding arguing, and supporting a client's self-effcacy (a person's belief that he or she can successfully make a change). Keep in mind that almost all clients will have mixed feelings about their substance use. They will fnd some aspects of it pleasant and benefcial but other aspects diffcult, painful, or harmful. You can help clients discover their own reasons for wanting to change by talking about these mixed feelings and pointing out problem areas. SAMHSA's TIP 34, Brief Interventions and Brief Therapies for Substance Abuse, offers more guidance on how to make assessment and interviews successful. 453 Chapter 3 59 TIP 26 Looking for a simple way to help clients \"open up\"? Avoid asking yes/no questions. Open-ended questions are more thought-provoking and help clients share their own experiences in a more meaningful way. Start by asking broad questions about a client's health in general, such as: \"How would you rate your health overall?\" \"Compared with other people your age, how would you say you are doing?\" \"What health problems do you have?\" Next, move into more specifc questions about the client's substance misuse. Try asking questions like: \"What concerns do you have about your alcohol use?\" \"In what ways might your life be different were you not using tobacco?\" \"How has using opioids affected your relationships?\" Questions that can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" can seem harsh or judgmental. Older clients might already feel ashamed and uncomfortable talking about their substance use. Closed-ended questions could make those feelings even worse and cause clients to \"shut down.\" On the other hand, open-ended questions can help clients become aware of and express their own experiences and motivations related to substance use. Brief Assessments If a client's screening results show mild substance misuse, conduct a brief assessment to get more information. Assessment questions should cover: The severity of substance use (including what, how often, and how much the client uses). The types of problems connected with the client's use. The frequency of problems that occur with the client's use. Other special physical and mental factors (e.g., whether a mental or physical disorder is present that could be making the person's substance-related symptoms worse). Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults If the client's responses suggest an SUD diagnosis per DSM-5 criteria, you should conduct or provide a referral for an indepth assessment. However, you can give a brief outpatient therapeutic intervention if: Only mild or mild-to-moderate substance misuse is present. The client appears to be at risk for harm because of current substance use. Co-occurring illnesses or conditions may be made worse by continuing to drink or use drugs. The client declines referral for further assessment or treatment. Brief Interventions: SBIRT SBIRT is an approach to providing brief interventions after screening, referrals for further assessment, or treatment. SBIRT approaches are focused on getting clients into treatment early. They include: Screening for possible substance misuse and level of risk. Offering a brief outpatient intervention to help clients understand the need to change their substance misuse and help them increase their desire to change. Referrals to SUD treatment programs or mental health services for clients who need more indepth assessment or intervention. Behavioral health service and healthcare providers can easily incorporate brief interventions into standard practices. Brief interventions: Give you the chance to: -Explain screening results to clients. -Provide information about low-risk substance use. -Give advice about changing substance misuse habits. -Assess clients' desire for change. -Work with clients to set goals and strategies for change. -Figure out how best to make sure clients are sticking with their treatment plan. Chapter 3 60 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Are usually only 10 to 15 minutes long and include a limited number of sessions. May require at least one follow-up visit. However, even more follow-up sessions may be needed depending on the setting, the severity of the substance misuse, and clients' responses. Are usually inexpensive and quick to conduct. Most older adults at risk for substance misuse do not need formal specialized SUD treatment. However, many clients can beneft from education to prevent problems before they occur. They can also beneft from SBIRT techniques. For instance, SBIRT that involves basic education as an intervention has been shown to help reduce older adults' risky alcohol use. 454,455 Educate clients on risky alcohol use as a prevention measure and an intervention. Boston University School of Public Health provides helpful information and resources (e.g., demonstration videos) on screening and brief intervention techniques successfully used in primary care and emergency department settings (www.bu.edu/bniart/sbirt-in-health-care/ sbirt-brief-negotiated-interview-bni/). Why do your clients want to change their substance misuse? Knowing the answer to this question is more useful than just knowing whether clients are ready to change. Helping clients explore their reasons for wanting to change their substance use can help them feel more positive and confdent about making this change. It also helps better support them during assessment and treatment. It is okay if the reasons for change are initially attributable to outside forces rather than the clients' own desires. Clients pressured into treatment\u2014such as through parole and probation or drug courts\u2014 are as or sometimes more likely to succeed in treatment as clients who enter on their own. 456 SBIRT services must meet the special age-related needs of older adults to give them the greatest chance for success (Exhibit 3.7). You can make your SBIRT services age sensitive by: Using supportive language in your discussions so that older clients do not feel shame or fear. Using clear, basic terms with older clients rather than confusing terms or medical language. Sharing information that is specifc to older clients, such as guidelines about low-risk levels of substance use for older adults or physical effects of substance misuse. Including strategies and materials that are culturally sensitive to clients and to the unique issues that older adults face. For example, your older adult clients may be: -Worrying about not being able to live independently, without help from others. -Coping with grief (over loss of a partner, spouse, child, or another signifcant person). -Adapting to major life changes, like retiring or moving into an assisted living residence. Thinking about the role of chronic physical conditions in older clients' misuse of substances (e.g., use of substances to manage chronic pain). Such conditions can also affect symptoms of substance misuse and treatment response. Using tailored screening and assessment measures that were made specifcally for older adults or are approved for use with them. Giving interventions that meet older clients' needs. For instance, if possible, in-home treatment is helpful if clients cannot travel to your program. Keeping referral information on hand about local providers who specialize in addiction treatment and are skilled at working with older adults who misuse substances. Chapter 3 61 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 3.7. Successfully Applying SBIRT Principles to Older Adults The Florida Brief Intervention and Treatment for Elders (BRITE) pilot project457 was funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and modeled on SBIRT. In this program, older adults who screened as needing a brief SUD intervention received: Education to help reduce substance misuse, develop healthier habits, and improve quality of life. MI to increase their desire to change substance misuse-related behaviors. Age-appropriate information designed to address high-risk situations, coping with urges to use substances, and preventing return to substance misuse. Results from the program were positive. 458 Specifc outcomes included the following:459 Clients who completed the program had lower SMAST-G scores. At the end of the study, nearly 30 percent of clients in the BRITE program had fewer fags in their medical chart for prescription medication misuse. People in the BRITE program had large decreases in depression (measured by the GDS) and suicide risk scores. The number of older adults getting treatment in the program was three times greater than the number who were getting SUD services before BRITE began. RESOURCE ALERT: DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING SBIRT PROGRAMS FOR OLDER ADULTS SAMHSA's A Guide to Preventing Older Adult Alcohol and Psychoactive Medication Misuse/ Abuse: Screening and Brief Interventions is a manual to assist addiction treatment providers and administrators in designing, implementing, and delivering screening and brief intervention programs to prevent substance misuse in older adults. It is available online (www.ncoa.org/wp - content/uploads/SBIRT-Older-Adult-Manual-Final. pdf). SAMHSA has other resources to help you integrate SBIRT into your program (www.samhsa. gov/sbirt/resources). The National Council on Aging also offers an instruction manual and workbook for effective screening and brief intervention strategies for risky alcohol use in older adults (www.ncoa. org/wp-content/uploads/BI_OlderAdults_ ImplementationManual.pdf ). Conducting Full Assessments for Substance Misuse Conduct a full assessment for any client whose screening suggests moderate-to-severe substance misuse. Full assessments gather not just substance-related information, but information about overall functioning and health (Exhibit 3.8). This information will help you differentiate among substance misuse, CODs, physical conditions common in older populations, and symptoms of normal aging. Common physical conditions and symptoms of normal aging that can be confused for substance misuse include low energy, memory changes, sleep problems, and decreased appetite. Chapter 3 62 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse EXHIBIT 3.8. Key Objectives of a Full Assessment for Substance Misuse Key objectives of giving a full assessment for substance misuse can include: Getting older clients' substance use history (including prescription and OTC medications). Checking clients for CODs that can affect substance misuse, such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Checking clients for other trauma or abuse. Learning older clients' physical conditions and physical and medication history. This is especially important for physical conditions that can lead to or result from substance misuse, like sleep problems and pain. Asking about social supports available to older clients who misuse substances. Referring clients with cognitive problems for a full cognitive assessment by a neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist to see whether dementia, MCI, or delirium is present. Understanding clients' unique substance misuse. This means asking them about: -When and with whom they misuse substances. -Why they misuse substances. -How misusing substances fts into their life. -How they feel and what they believe about their misuse of substances. Full assessments often involve several members of the care team, depending on the setting and available resources of your program. Which care team members contribute to the full assessment depends on the qualifcations and level of expertise needed to address the client's problems. For instance, the assessment may start with a certifed drug and alcohol counselor or other licensed provider taking a complete psychosocial history. Other licensed providers may need to complete a psychological evaluation (e.g., if the intake interview is given by someone not licensed to diagnose mental disorders) and look for withdrawal indicators or educate the client on the need for medical withdrawal. A medical staff member may take a medical history and perform a physical exam. Nurses or occupational therapists, rather than behavioral health service providers, usually give assessments of ADLs and fall risk. If your program does not have any medical staff members, you should refer clients elsewhere for this part of the assessment. A physician, nurse, or pharmacist may be consulted to determine risk for medication misuse, whether accidental or intentional. Determining risk for medication misuse involves reviewing the client's: Current prescriptions and OTC medications. Management of these medications. Ability to obtain prescriptions (referring to cost as well as accessibility). Potential adverse reactions to medications. Full assessments help the treatment team: Make the right diagnosis (whether it be an SUD, a mental disorder, or a cognitive disorder). Learn the severity of the substance misuse. Guide treatment planning, including giving clients the right level of care in the right setting. Decide whether medical conditions are present that need to be addressed during treatment. Decide whether other conditions are present that need to be addressed during treatment. The Assessment Process A complete assessment has several parts. These include: Full mental health, medical, family, vocational, social, sexual, fnancial, legal, substance use, and SUD treatment histories. A health history and physical exam for common co-occurring physical conditions that affect mental health as well as physical conditions that suggest the client has substance misuse (e.g., sleep problems, chronic pain). This part of the assessment also sometimes includes biological screening measures, like urine screens (for benzodiazepines and opiates), breath alcohol testing (i.e., breathalyzer), and laboratory tests. Medical professionals should also check Chapter 3 63 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program for additional information about clients' prescribed medications. Further assessment for CODs. Sometimes referral to an outside provider (e.g., licensed psychologist, clinical social worker) is needed, depending on the expertise of the staff members in your program. Assessment of skills used in everyday living, like dressing, bathing, shopping, and managing money. Assessment of the client's fall risk. (For example, see the CDC's fall prevention program, \"Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries,\" at www.cdc.gov/steadi/.) Assessment of the client's basic needs (e.g., housing, nutrition), support network, and strengths/resources. The most important parts of your full assessment are gathering information about the client's substance use, mental health, physical health, and SUD treatment histories, as well as a listing of prescribed and OTC medications. It may take multiple visits to complete the assessment. Clients will feel safe sharing detailed information as their trust in you builds. The following sections describe some of the most common parts of a full assessment, targeting only those parts that are most appropriate for older clients who misuse substances. The sections do not cover questions about a client's recreational, military, occupational, or avocational/retirement history. The section on health history and the physical exam discusses disordered sleep and pain because these are common physical conditions seen in older people who misuse substances. But other health and physical assessments may be needed beyond what is listed in that section. Make sure you have the required training and qualifcations before assessing for or diagnosing SUDs. If no providers in your program have the necessary licenses and qualifcations to assess for and diagnose mental disorders, make referrals as necessary to providers who can do so. Health History and Physical Exam Taking a complete physical history of clients is very important. Asking about clients' physical history can help you learn about: The medical effects of their substance use (e.g., soft tissue infection, hepatitis B or C, HIV infection) that may need treatment. Consequences of substance misuse that might get clients to change (e.g., elevated blood pressure, worsening acid refux symptoms, increased risk of falls). Physical health issues (e.g., severe liver disease) that affect whether medications can be given for certain SUDs, such as opioid use disorder. Possible drug-drug interactions. Sleep problems Sleep quality is closely linked to substance misuse in adults in general. For instance: Alcohol misuse and withdrawal can lead to many types of sleep problems. These include: 460,461 -Increased awakening during the night. -Insomnia. -Excessive -Less total sleep time. -Worsening of sleep apnea and other breathing-related sleep conditions. Adults ages 50 and older who binge drink are at an increased risk of insomnia compared with adults in this age group who do not binge drink. 462 Compared with people who have never smoked cigarettes, people who smoke report having worse sleep quality, taking longer to fall asleep, sleeping less than 6 hours, and having disturbed sleep. 463 Cocaine use is linked to taking longer to fall asleep and having decreased total sleep time. 464 Chronic opioid use is associated with an increased risk of central sleep apnea and other breathing-related sleep problems. 465 Chapter 3 64 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse RESOURCE ALERT: SAMHSA GUIDANCE ON TREATING SLEEP DISORDERS IN CLIENTS WITH SUDS SAMHSA's Treating Sleep Problems of People in Recovery From Substance Use Disorders offers tips on how to manage clients who have SUDs and sleep problems. 466 It is available online (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/Treating-Sleep-Problems-of-People-in-Recovery-From-Substance-Use-Disorders/sma14-4859). Sleep is an important part of clients' physical history. Sleeping less and waking earlier are normal parts of aging. But it is abnormal for older clients to be very tired in the day or not sleep through the night. These problems can increase risk of negative events like falls and even death. 467,468,469 If symptoms of poor sleep are present, also ask about the client's: 470 Sleep history. Leg movements during sleep. Grief or recent loss. Level of physical activity during the day. Caffeine intake. Alcohol consumption. Need to use the bathroom during the night. Several medication and nonmedication treatments can improve sleep problems. Depending on symptom severity, the medical provider conducting this part of the assessment may consult with a sleep medicine specialist for an indepth assessment or with a psychologist for behavioral management of symptoms. A full assessment of sleep should include an assessment for sleep apnea, which may involve an in-home or in-clinic overnight sleep study. Sleep problems that result from a physical condition or medication can usually be treated by addressing the medical illness and by switching medication or adjusting the dose. Chronic pain Chronic pain can be hard to manage in any client. But in clients who misuse or are at risk of misusing substances, managing chronic pain becomes even more diffcult. This is because substance use can often affect chronic pain in positive ways, even though the substance itself is harmful. For example, many older clients start taking pain medication to reduce physical discomfort. However, they may continue taking the medication to also manage emotional pain or to reduce withdrawal symptoms that occur when they try to stop taking it. Clients may misuse both prescribed and nonprescribed substances, such as alcohol, for such reasons. People with chronic pain may be at risk for substance misuse. This is not surprising given that substances like opioids, alcohol, and cannabis can help reduce physical pain. The following are fndings from several studies of older adults: In Wave 3 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, adults ages 50 and older who engaged in nonmedical cannabis use were signifcantly more likely also to report past-year injuries, greater pain interference, and nonmedical pain reliever use compared with those not using cannabis. 471 The study authors suggest that, in some older adults, nonmedical substance use and misuse may refect their efforts to reduce pain without help from doctors. Having numerous painful medical conditions, or more severe pain, was associated with a 15-percent to 20-percent increased chance of having physical, mental, or social problems related to drinking. 472 Older adults with pain severe enough to interfere with ADLs were especially likely to have alcohol-related problems. 473 Using alcohol to self-medicate pain is associated with greater pain intensity, greater pain interference with everyday activities, and higher levels of depression and anxiety compared with not using alcohol to self-medicate pain. 474 Chapter 3 65 TIP 26 Older clients are likely to underreport their pain.475 Using a two-step approach will help you thoroughly assess for chronic pain in older clients: First, ask your clients directly about their pain. -Self-report is the most reliable method of assessing pain in older people. 476 Even most clients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment can accurately tell you about their pain. 477 -Open-ended questions (\"Tell me about your aches and sores,\" or \"Tell me about any discomfort you are having\") may be more useful than yes/no questions (\"Are you feeling any pain?\"). 478 -You should try using words other than \"pain,\" because some older adults will not report feeling pain. 479 Instead, you can use words like \"discomfort,\" \"aches,\" \"hurt,\" and \"sore.\" Second, use a pain rating scale to learn the intensity of your client's pain. -The revised Iowa Pain Thermometer (IPT-R; see the Chapter 3 Appendix) and the revised Faces Pain Scale (see the Chapter 3 Appendix) are approved for use in older adults, including those from diverse racial and ethnic populations. 480 The IPT-R can also be used with older adults with cognitive impairment. 481 -Verbal descriptor scales (VDS; Exhibit 3.9) can be used with older adults with and without cognitive impairment. 482 These scales come in two main types.483 One type asks clients to rate their pain only using words, such as \"none,\" \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" or \"extreme.\" The second type asks clients to rate their pain using a number scale. The number scale usually ranges from 0 to 5 or 0 to 6. All three of these tools (the IPT-R, the revised Faces Pain Scale, and VDS instruments) are easy to use and easy for older clients to understand. Although pain scales can be useful, do not rely on them alone. Assessment and treatment planning should consider not just how a client rates on a pain scale but also his or her level of functioning in the presence of pain. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 3.9. Verbal Descriptor Scales (VDS)484,485 (Word-based scale) Please describe \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" as it could be.\" (Number-based scale) Please describe your pain using these numbers: 0 for no pain, 1 for slight pain, 2 for mild pain, 3 for moderate pain, 4 for severe pain, 5 for extreme pain, and 6 for the most intense pain imaginable. Older clients with chronic pain can be treated effectively. However, giving older clients prescription opioid medications to treat chronic pain raises concerns. That's because: Little evidence exists that opioids offer long-term relief of chronic noncancer pain in older adults. 486 Nonopioid medications, like acetaminophen and topical nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can be effective for certain conditions and are alternatives to opioid medications. 487 Compared with younger adults, older adults have a higher risk of harmful drug-drug interactions because they often take one or more prescribed medications for chronic illnesses. The combination of opioid medications and alcohol is also very dangerous in older people. (See the CDC's factsheet on screening for alcohol use before prescribing opioids at www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/prescribing/ AlcoholToolFactSheet-508.pdf.) Long-term opioid use can increase the risk for certain negative physical conditions. These conditions include breathing problems and hormone changes for older adults. 488 This age group is also at risk for opioid misuse and addiction. 489 In 2018, more than 9,200 opioid overdose deaths occurred among people ages 55 and older. 490 From 2017 to 2018, opioid overdose deaths among people ages 65 and older increased by 14.3 percent, and deaths from prescription opioid overdose among this same age group increased by 7.4 percent. 491 Chapter 3 66 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Some nonmedication treatments may be benefcial and carry less risk of harm to older adults than opioid medications, although more research is needed on these management approaches. 492,493 Healthcare providers and prescribers must carefully weigh the possible benefts of opioid treatment with its risks. For instance, healthcare prescribers should: 494 Try using nonmedication treatments in place of or along with opioid treatment. Use a \"start low and go slow\" approach to dosing. Check for possible drug-drug interactions with clients' other medications. Discuss with clients the benefts and possible harms of taking opioids. Screen and assess clients for factors that increase the odds of misuse and addiction. Carefully monitor clients for harmful reactions. Educate clients about opioid-related safety issues. These include drug-drug interactions, fall risk, driving risks, and safe storage of opioid medications. Periodically review the ongoing need for the opioid medication, and consider whether the dose can be reduced, tapered, or discontinued. Nonmedication and medication treatments are available to help older adults reduce their pain and improve their everyday activities and quality of life while keeping their risk of opioid misuse and addiction low. Nonopioid medication treatments for pain recommended by CDC in its 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain 495 include: Epidural injections. In some instances, opioid medication may be appropriate and can be used safely if used within CDC guidelines for safe practices. 496 However, proven nonmedication approaches to pain management exist, such as acupuncture, cognitive- behavioral therapy, physical therapy, massage, biofeedback, and chronic pain self-management programs. Of note, if medication is used, acetaminophen or oral NSAIDs in older adults can increase their risk of hepatic, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal toxicity, especially when used long term, in excess, or in combination with certain other medications. 497,498 Psychosocial History Substance use history Substance use histories can help you learn the severity of a client's substance misuse, make SUD treatment plans, discover whether potential drug interactions are present, and understand the negative consequences of the substance misuse. Asking about the client's history of substance use will help you learn about the individual's severity of use and effects of that use on life. This may include asking about: Choice of substances used. Age at frst use. The person who frst introduced the client to the substance. Routes of taking the substance (e.g., injection, smoking). History of tolerance, withdrawal, mixing drugs, and overdose. Reasons for starting and continuing to use the substance, which may change over time. Be sure to also ask about current patterns of use, which will help you make treatment decisions. Such questions could include: \"How much do you drink when you do use alcohol?\" \"How often do you smoke or use tobacco?\" \"When was the last time you had a drink?\" \"Have you ever wondered whether your substance use is affecting your life or health in any way? Have you ever had a DUI?\" \"Does drinking alcohol help you feel better? (If yes) In what ways does it help you feel better? How do you feel after you have stopped drinking?\" Chapter 3 67 TIP 26 \"Which prescription and over-the-counter medications do you take? Do any of them interact with alcohol in a way that could harm you?\" SUD treatment history Clients' history of seeking SUD treatment or stopping use on their own can help guide treatment planning. Also ask clients about what led to their return to substance use after having stopped for a period. Successful and unsuccessful quit attempts can help you make treatment planning decisions. Taking an SUD treatment history could include asking clients about: Specifc settings in which they were treated (e.g., inpatient versus outpatient, criminal justice versus non-criminal justice). Their history of using support groups and community support and in what ways such supports were (or were not) helpful. Previous SUD treatments that were and were not successful. In addition, ask about periods following treatment where clients were successful (e.g., what worked for them). Previous attempts at stopping use, why they attempted to stop, and how many times they have tried to stop. Circumstances that led to the clients' starting treatment. (Was it voluntary? Why start treatment now, today?) Relapse prevention and recovery strategies that worked in the past. How treatment ended. (Did they complete treatment or leave treatment early? If the latter, why?) History of mental illness and mental health services Co-occurring mental illness is very common among people who misuse substances. 499,500 The 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that 49.2 percent of adults with an SUD in the past year also had a mental illness, 501 whereas only about 16.8 percent of adults without an SUD in the past year also had a mental illness. 502 The survey also estimates that 10.7 percent of Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults adults ages 50 and older with any mental illness also have an SUD. 503 Meanwhile, an estimated 36.8 percent of adults ages 50 and older with an SUD have a co-occurring mental disorder. 504 Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are especially likely to co-occur with substance misuse. 505,506,507,508 Keep the following points in mind when you assess for these conditions:509 Older clients may be more likely to talk about physical symptoms than emotional ones. You should ask about any medications the client is taking. Some medications can cause side effects that are similar to symptoms of depression (like trouble sleeping or feeling low energy). Depending on the client's cognitive abilities, you may need to speak with a family member or a family caregiver to get information about the client's mental health and history. Be sure to get permission from the client before doing this. Older women in particular can be easily mistaken as having depression or other mental disorders (like anxiety) instead of PTSD. 510 Remember the importance of helping clients feel safe physically and emotionally. -Trauma and abuse can occur at any point in a person's life. Suicide also can occur in older people. Before assessing for depression and PTSD, make sure you have a safety plan in place. This will help you respond appropriately to any client's reports of abuse and self-harm. -Keeping your clients safe isn't just the right thing to do\u2014it's the law. Make sure you know your state's laws about responding to reports of abuse and self-harm. The co-occurrence of a mental disorder and SUD can make treatment diffcult and is associated with negative events. In older adults, such events include increased mortality, an increased chance of experiencing harmful medication-substance interactions, the co-occurrence of complex medical conditions (like dementia), and an increased risk of suicide. 511 Be sure to ask clients about psychosocial symptoms they have during periods of substance misuse and abstinence. Chapter 3 68 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Social history Learning about a client's social environment and relationships can guide you in treatment planning. That is because social factors can affect whether a client stays in treatment or leaves treatment early, as well as treatment outcomes. Valuable information about the social environment includes the client's: Transportation. Caregiver needs. Caregiving responsibilities (e.g., whether the client cares for a child or other dependent). Cohabitating status (i.e., living alone versus with someone). Regular access to safe, secure, and stable housing. Criminal justice involvement. Employment status and quality of work setting. Relationships with family, friends, or close others who themselves use substances. (Get the client's consent before speaking to any of these people directly.) Sexual orientation, identity, and history, including risk factors for HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Level of safety at home, especially in terms of potential for violence. Note that substance use greatly increases the risk of intimate partner violence. Screen all women who seek SUD treatment for intimate partner abuse, regardless of their age. 512 Substance use increases the risk of abuse toward older adults,513 and experiencing elder abuse can contribute to substance misuse among older adults. If you suspect an older adult is misusing substances, screen for elder abuse. Family history Family can play a major role in whether a person is at risk for substance misuse. Always ask clients about the substance use histories of their parents, siblings, and partners. Family-related factors that can increase the risk of having substance misuse include: 514,515 Genetic factors. The home environment in which a person was raised\u2014specifcally, whether the client was exposed to substance use in the household during childhood. Having a frst-degree relative (i.e., a parent, child, sister, or brother) who misuses substances. For instance, a person has fve times the risk of developing alcohol dependence if he or she has any frst-degree relative with alcohol dependence. 516 The client's misuse may have a basis in genetic factors, modeling of behavior of others, or both. Having negative or low-quality parent-child relationships in adolescence that were unsupportive and featured a lot of arguing or fghting. 517 Activities of Everyday Living As people age, many sooner or later have problems completing everyday tasks on their own, like bathing, cooking, shopping, and driving. Substance misuse can make everyday living even more diffcult, including ADLs and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). ADLs are basic everyday tasks like dressing, using the toilet, using the phone, and feeding oneself. IADLs are more complex tasks that need more skills to complete. They include balancing a checkbook, shopping, cooking, and driving. As part of assessing substance misuse, measure clients' ability to complete ADLs and IADLs without help. This will paint a full picture of the effects of substance misuse. Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living The Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL; see the Chapter 3 Appendix) 518 is one of the most commonly used measures of ADLs. It assesses performance in six areas: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. Chapter 3 69 TIP 26 Barthel Index Like the Katz ADL, the Barthel Index is a brief, widely used screener for ADLs.519,520 It measures a person's ability to perform the following: feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, toileting, controlling bladder and bowels, transfers, mobility, and using the stairs. Unlike the Katz ADL, the Barthel Index collects information from three sources\u2014clients, their caregivers, and direct observation\u2014to see whether older adults can complete activities without help. Functional Activities Questionnaire The Functional Activities Questionnaire is a measure of IADLs. 521,522 It is completed by a person (usually an adult family member) who knows the client well, has seen the client's behavior, and can assess the client's ability to complete IADLs and how much assistance the client needs to complete them, if any. Fall Risk Assessment Older people are at an increased risk of falling, and substance misuse can increase this risk. Falling is the number one cause of injury among people ages 65 and older. 523 Each year, more than 800,000 adults are hospitalized for a fall.524 Between 30 and 40 percent of adults in the community (that is, not in a hospital) ages 65 and older fall at least once each year. In 2014 alone, older Americans had approximately 29 million falls, which resulted in roughly 7 million injuries. 525 Falls are not only potentially dangerous, they can be expensive as well. The direct cost of care for nonfatal fall-related injuries in older adults in the United States is estimated to be more than $31 billion a year. 526 Physical and mental conditions (including substance misuse) that can increase an older person's fall risk include: 527,528,529,530,531,532 Dementia. Delirium. Cognitive problems in general. Depression. Poor sleep. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Use of multiple medications, especially antidepressants. Benzodiazepine use. Excessive alcohol use. How do you know which client does and does not need a fall assessment? The American Geriatrics Society and the British Geriatrics Society 533 suggest you ask yourself three simple questions: Has the client had two or more falls in the past year? Has the client had a recent fall? Does the client have trouble with walking or balance? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, you may want to assess the client for fall risk. Timed Up & Go Test The CDC's Timed Up & Go is one of the easiest ways to assess a client's fall risk. This test measures a person's ability to stand from a sitting position, walk a short distance (10 feet), turn around, and walk back to where the individual was sitting. Instructions for how to give the Timed Up & Go are available online (www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/ TUG_Test-print.pdf). Determining Diagnosis and Severity of an SUD Because diagnosing SUDs in older adults differs from diagnosing SUDs in younger adults, try: Using DSM-5 criteria to make an SUD diagnosis. 534 Using an SUD assessment instrument based on DSM-5 criteria will improve diagnostic accuracy. However, not all DSM-5 diagnostic criteria apply to older adults. Always use clinical judgment when making an SUD diagnosis. Using diagnostic decision trees made specifcally for SUD in older clients. Making a treatment plan only after getting a positive substance misuse screen, completing a full assessment, and making a diagnosis of SUD. Chapter 3 70 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Knowing how to keep older adults interested and willing participants in the screening and assessment process (e.g., knowing what to say to older clients and how to say it). If diagnostic criteria are met, also fnd out the severity of the diagnosis. You can do this by counting the number of DSM-5 SUD criteria met by the client's symptoms. 535 A mild SUD is present when 2 or 3 of the 11 SUD diagnostic criteria are met. A moderate SUD is present when 4 or 5 criteria are met. A severe SUD is present when 6 or more criteria are met. Keep in mind that DSM-5 criteria should be interpreted in an age-appropriate manner. (See Chapter 4 for examples of how DSM-5 criteria for AUD might not be age appropriate.) For instance, tolerance is a DSM-5 criterion for an SUD diagnosis. But older people are more likely to achieve tolerance faster and on smaller amounts of the substance than younger adults. Therefore, tolerance in an older individual does not necessarily mean that they are dependent on the substance. Also remember that symptoms of SUDs are often the same as symptoms of other physical diseases and mental disorders. You must rule out these other mental and physical disorders before making an SUD diagnosis. Remember that not every addiction treatment provider is qualifed to make a mental disorder diagnosis. If you do not have the training and licensure to make diagnoses, send the client to another provider in your program who can. If no one in your program has the required qualifcations, refer the client to another program that does. Integrated programs can be particularly effective at meeting older adults' full range of biopsychosocial needs and may be a suitable referral option. When possible, help facilitate these referrals by offering a \"warm handoff\" of clients to the referred provider, which helps ensure that clients are able to successfully access mental health services. Treatment Planning, Referrals, and Treatments Treatment Planning Treatment planning includes preparing to provide treatment or refer to the most appropriate treatment provider. You should start with treatment planning, and then either give the treatment or refer to an outside provider if your program cannot provide the services or level of care the client needs. Although rare, age-specifc treatment settings and programs may provide the most effective care for older clients. The foundation of treatment planning is individualized assessment. This should be done systematically with a tool such as the Level of Care Utilization System for Psychiatric and Addiction Services (LOCUS 20). 536 LOCUS allows the user to characterize the following dimensions based on client strengths, challenges, resources, and risks and produce a specifc rating: Risk of Harm Functional Status Medical, Addictive and Psychiatric Co-Morbidity Recovery Environment both in terms of level of stress and level of support Treatment and Recovery History Engagement and Recovery Status For older adults, be sure to think also about age-related factors when making decisions about where to place the client for treatment. For example, if a client uses a wheelchair, you will want to select a treatment setting that the individual can access. Clients who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing may need individual therapy, small-group therapy tailored to their hearing needs, or both. LOCUS 20 describes six broadly defned levels of care and provides a decision tree and grid to help you map the multidimensional assessment of the client to the level of care most likely to meet their needs. The six levels of care are: Chapter 3 71 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Recovery Maintenance/Health Management. Low Intensity Community Based Services. High Intensity Community Based Services. Medically Monitored Non-Residential Services. Medically Monitored Residential Services. Medically Managed Residential Services. The LOCUS 20 tool can be downloaded for free from www.communitypsychiatry.org/resources/ locus. Using Shared Decision Making Shared decision making helps people who are receiving treatment for or in recovery from an SUD feel more involved in their own care. Decision making should involve the client in determining preferences for treatment. Statements like those below can help clients participate in the shared decision-making process: \"I want to work with you to fnd the best treatment setting possible for you and your needs.\" \"Let's see what your spouse and brother think about these treatment options.\" (Be sure to get the client's consent before speaking with family.) \"Let's review your smoking cessation options so that you know everything that is available to you.\" \"Many people do not understand what 'intensive outpatient addiction treatment' means. Let's talk about that so I can clear up any misunderstandings and answer any questions you might have.\" \"You said you would like to hear more about inpatient detoxifcation. Let me review with you the admission requirements so we can fgure out whether this type of setting is best for you.\" \"I know we talked about many treatment options today. Why don't you tell me what you think would be the best ft, and then I can share with you my thoughts about the best option. I'll bet we can fnd something we both agree on.\" When cognitive impairment is present, you may need to adapt these statements to elicit an older adult's feedback. Nonetheless, best practices suggest that service providers, healthcare professionals, and guardians maximize each individual's input in the healthcare decision-making process. 537,538 Research supports involving clients with SUDs in treatment decision-making processes. 539 In some cases, matching clients' substance-related treatment preferences has led to improved outcomes. 540 However, shared decision making in the context of SUDs can be challenging. Clients who have SUDs may have mixed feelings about whether they can, or even want to, stop using substances. This is where MI can be a useful tool. MI Motivational interviewing is a client-centered approach to treatment planning that can be used with shared decision making. Combined, these methods can help clients feel confdent in their treatment decisions and ability to change their substance misuse. 541 MI has been reported to be effective for people with many different health conditions, including SUDs. 542 It has been used successfully with older adults to help improve physical health and health-related behaviors (e.g., weight loss, exercise) as well as substance misuse (including alcohol misuse and tobacco use). 543 MI can help clients:544 Address any mixed feelings they have about entering treatment. Explore their thoughts about changing their behaviors, such as cutting down on alcohol use or monitoring their prescription medication intake. Develop personal and meaningful reasons for wanting to change their behaviors. Create an action plan for how they will change their behaviors. Referrals If your program cannot offer treatment for SUDs, refer your clients to counseling and tailored psychosocial supports that have the capacity to meet older adults' unique needs. You should refer to the level of care that is the least intense yet will address all the client's needs. The following paragraphs describe several options. Chapter 3 72 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse A safe withdrawal is the frst order of business. If detoxifcation is needed, that will be the frst referral indicated, whether inpatient or outpatient. Develop a plan for seamless transitions between services and warm patient handoffs. Refer for SUD treatment and mental health services as needed. You may need to refer the client to an outside provider for SUD treatment if your setting cannot offer the level of care or types of services the client's symptoms warrant. For example, a client may need inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation, but your program only offers outpatient care. Referral to mental health services is appropriate if the severity or type of mental illness is beyond what you can treat. Clients with depression, PTSD, or other mental disorders may be more likely to succeed in addiction treatment if those conditions are managed. When considering referral for treatment, frst consider the client's thinking abilities. Problems with thinking could affect a client's ability to participate in treatment. The client might need a treatment provider who has experience working with older clients with cognitive problems. Individual treatment rather than group treatment might also be a better choice. Even if you refer to formal SUD treatment elsewhere, you can still support the client. Follow up with him or her by periodically asking about current substance use and progress in treatment. Use these questions as an opportunity to identify clients at risk for relapse while offering positive reinforcement in a warm and nonjudgmental manner. Addiction treatment providers can also provide ongoing support and encouragement to older clients who enter the formal treatment system by: Learning about treatment resources in the community that offer appropriate services. (See \"Resource Alert: Making the Most of Your Referral Resources.\") Keeping in touch with the client's specifc treatment program. This can help you make sure the program is offering appropriate care. It will also help you understand the approach and services the program offers so you can appropriately refer future clients there. Asking the treatment program to share with you, from time to time, reports about the treatment plan and how the client is doing in treatment. (Get the client's written permission before doing so.) Stressing the importance of continuing with treatment when discussing progress with the client. Make referrals to medical services that provide respectful, consistent physical health care. This can help clients recover from substance misuse. As with any client, you should make appropriate referrals for medical care that is beyond what your practice setting offers. Make referrals to mutual-help groups for clients who wish to join such groups in addition to receiving addiction treatment or mental health services. These programs can offer clients social support and encouragement to help them avoid substance misuse. (See \"Mutual-Help Programs\" below.) Make referrals to additional services that meet clients' needs. In addition to SUD treatment, mental health, and medical services, older adults who have SUDs may need additional support in certain areas. They may beneft from help in areas like: Case management. Food access. Housing. Transportation. Legal assistance. In-home services and supports to facilitate completing ADLs and IADLs. Insurance-related needs (e.g., assistance enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, or both). Chapter 3 73 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults RESOURCE ALERT: MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR REFERRAL RESOURCES Having a collection of substance-related treatment referral resources on hand will help you give clients more options and better access to care. Ask yourself the following questions to help make the most of the available referral resources. What specialized SUD treatment programs are in my community? Most communities have a public or private agency that keeps a directory of SUD treatment programs. This directory can give useful information about program facilities (e.g., type, location, hours, accessibility to public transportation), services, eligibility criteria, cost, and staff experience, including languages spoken. Each state also has a single state-level alcohol and drug agency that oversees the licensing and program review for all SUD treatment programs in that state. This agency often offers a statewide directory of all SUD treatment programs licensed in the state. You can fnd SUD treatment facilities by using https://fndtreatment.gov/ . SAMHSA offers a Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator (https://fndtreatment.samhsa.gov/ ) and a National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/ default/fles/reports/rpt23267/National_Directory_SA_facilities.pdf ). Who are my local resources and points of contact? Reach out to local resources and introduce yourself. Learn what services they offer. This will help you get clients into the system of care more quickly. What mutual-help groups are in my community? What do they offer older clients specifcally? Keep on hand names of mutual-help groups that can meet older clients' age-related needs. For instance, Seniors In Sobriety (SIS) (www.seniorsinsobriety.com) is a part of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). SIS maintains an online list of SIS and senior-friendly AA meetings in several states (http://www.seniorsinsobriety.com/wp-content/ uploads/2019/03/SISMeetings-Mar2019.pdf ). Treatments Older adults can and do beneft from SUD treatment, although less is known about what works for older adults than for other age groups. 545 Older adults who get SUD treatment may show the same levels of abstinence as younger adults. 546 In some cases, older adults have had even more success than younger adults.547,548 More treatment (e.g., more outpatient sessions, longer inpatient stays) can improve older adults' treatment outcomes. Mental Health Services A range of mental health interventions exist for older adults who misuse substances. Effective psychosocial treatments and levels of care that have worked for older clients include: 549,550,551,552 Motivational enhancement. Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Individual and group therapy. Supportive therapy. Pharmacological treatments. Couples and family therapy. Brief advice or targeted education. Telephone-based brief interventions. Relationship enhancement therapy. Case management. Outpatient treatment. Inpatient treatment. Many of these treatments can also address MDD, PTSD, and other CODs in older clients who misuse substances. To get the best results, recommend mental health services that meet older adults' special needs. Age-related needs often relate to the unique stressors and life events, like retirement, death of a signifcant individual, or moving into a nursing home, that older adults are likely to experience. Chapter 3 74 TIP 26 Chapter 3\u2014Identifying, Screening for, and Assessing Substance Misuse Mutual-Help Programs Well-known mutual-help programs include the 12-Step programs AA and Narcotics Anonymous. Many other peer-recovery support groups are available as well, like: Women for Sobriety. SMART (Self-Management and Recovery Training) Recovery. LifeRing Secular Recovery. Secular Organizations for Sobriety/Save Our Selves. Celebrate Recovery. Double Trouble in Recovery (for people with CODs). Dual Recovery Anonymous (for people with CODs). Mutual-help programs offer older adults a network of peers with whom they can relate. These groups help older adults share common experiences in substance misuse and recovery. Mutual-help programs also help keep clients socially active and reduce loneliness. These groups and their availability vary greatly in various parts of the county. Some will not be available in many localities, but online and telephone meetings may be available. Finding local mutual-help programs that are only for older adults can be diffcult. Instead, try to fnd local groups that are open to adjusting their sessions toward older clients and their needs (e.g., using a slower pace, being willing to discuss life-stage changes and loss). You should also look for local groups that already have older-age attendees. 553 RESOURCE ALERT: AA AND OLDER ADULTS AA offers a large-print handout for older adults interested in attending an AA meeting. This handout is titled A.A. for the Older Alcoholic\u2014 Never Too Late. Consider sharing this with older clients who misuse alcohol and express an interest in learning more about 12-Step programs. (Available at www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-22_ AAfortheOlderAA.pdf ) Summary A well-thought-out approach to comprehensive screening and assessment will help you identify older adults with or at risk for substance misuse and related conditions. This is an important step in making sure clients get the right diagnosis and timely treatment (or treatment referral). The many screening tools approved for use with older adults can help you detect substance misuse. In addition, numerous measures can help you identify conditions common in older people with substance misuse. These conditions include problems with thinking, depression, anxiety, PTSD, elder abuse, sleep problems, chronic pain, struggles with ADLs, and risk of falling. Indepth assessments allow you to better understand the full range of factors in clients' substance misuse. Screening and assessment results contribute to client-centered care by helping you offer treatment options that meet clients' individual symptoms, risk factors, treatment needs, and treatment preferences. Remember that a wide range of providers in many different settings can be involved in helping to identify, screen, and assess older clients for substance misuse. There's no \"wrong door\" through which older adults can receive a diagnosis and the treatment they need.

It contains only three questions, which add up to a total score of 0-12. A higher score usually means the client is engaging in more hazardous alcohol use. The AUDIT-C is scored as follows: For Questions 1 and 3, assign 0 points to response a, 1 point to response b, 2 points to response c, 3 points to response d, and 4 points to response e. For Question 2, assign 0 points to responses a and b, 1 point to response c, 2 points to response d, 3 points to response e, and 4 points to response f. A total score of 3 or higher for women and 4 or higher for men means problematic alcohol use. In such cases, you should assess further (or refer for formal assessment) to learn more about the client's drinking habits and determine whether AUD is present.

Therefore, widespread screening for alcohol use and misuse in all healthcare settings and emergency departments is recommended. Screening and assessment tools and treatment options for alcohol misuse among older adults should be senior friendly and meet their unique physical, emotional, and social needs. Education about low-risk levels of alcohol use and about alcohol-drug interactions can be a powerful brief intervention as well as a prevention tool in keeping seniors safe. You can help increase your older clients' chances of success by offering many different treatment choices based on their symptoms and needs; addressing all co-occurring health conditions; and using a stepped-care approach to the management of referrals and ongoing coordination of care. Chapter 4 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will beneft healthcare, behavioral health service, and social service providers working with older adults. It addresses alcohol use and misuse among older adults. National survey data show that alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are increasing in this population at a concerning rate. 567 Addiction counselors and other healthcare providers should understand the unique needs of older adults when addressing alcohol-related issues. Although older adults generally have lower rates of alcohol misuse, including AUD, than younger adults, baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) are more likely to drink and have alcohol-related problems than earlier generations of older adults. Even low levels of drinking can lead to negative health effects in older adults because of age-related physical changes, negative interactions between alcohol and commonly used medications, and decreases in physical and cognitive functioning (thinking abilities). Organization of Chapter 4 of This TIP This chapter of TIP 26 presents facts about alcohol misuse, including AUD, among older adults. It also addresses screening and assessment, co-occurring health conditions and mental disorders often related to alcohol misuse, and treatment and recovery management approaches for older adults. The frst section of Chapter 4 describes alcohol misuse among older adults. It includes defnitions; numbers and fgures; and the physical, mental, social, and economic effects of AUD. It also addresses co-occurring health conditions and mental disorders in older adults who drink. 87 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults The second section addresses screening and assessment of alcohol misuse in older adults. It covers screening tools for alcohol misuse, limitations of the ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for AUD as applied to older adults, signs of late-onset AUD, and misuse of alcohol with prescription medications. This section also addresses screening for and assessing commonly co-occurring health conditions and mental disorders among older adults who drink. The third section briefy describes the continuum of care for older adults, including brief interventions for alcohol misuse and inpatient detoxifcation or rehabilitation. The fourth section discusses specifc treatment approaches for older adults with AUD. These include brief interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), problem-solving therapy (PST), skill-building (TSF) therapy, age-specifc inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, and pharmacotherapy. EXHIBIT 4.1. Key Terms The ffth section explores recovery management strategies for older adults. It covers strategies for including family members in treatment; addressing caregiver needs; and linking older adults to evidence-supported, community-based recovery support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and SMART (Self-Management and Recovery Training) Recovery. The sixth section presents clinical scenarios to show how to match treatment approaches to a client's level of alcohol misuse, from those who are abstinent (not drinking at all) for health reasons to those with AUD requiring inpatient rehabilitation and ongoing recovery management. The fnal section offers targeted resources to support your practice. For more resources related to addressing substance misuse among older adults, including misuse of alcohol, see the Chapter 4 Appendix and the additional resources in Chapter 9 of this TIP . For defnitions of key terms you will see throughout Chapter 4, refer to Exhibit 4.1. Addiction*: The most severe form of substance use disorder (SUD), associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Age-sensitive: Adaptations to existing treatment approaches that accommodate older adults' unique needs (e.g., a large-print handout on the signs of substance misuse). Age-specifc: Treatment approaches and practices specifcally developed for older adults (e.g., an older adult specialty group in a mixed-age SUD treatment program). Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and AUD. At-risk/high-risk drinking: Drinking alcohol in excessive amounts. This defnition encompasses both binge drinking and heavy drinking. Additionally, any alcohol consumption is considered risky when carried out by individuals with certain medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, those taking medicine that can interact harmfully with alcohol, those driving a car or engaged in other activities that require alertness, or people recovering from AUD. 568,569 Note that for purposes of this TIP, at-risk drinking and high-risk drinking are synonymous and either term is acceptable to describe an older adult's drinking patterns. AUD: DSM-5 defnes this disorder.570 An AUD diagnosis is given to people who use alcohol and meet at least 2 of the 11 DSM-5 symptoms in a 12-month period. Key aspects of AUD include tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control, and continued use despite negative consequences. AUD covers a range of severity and replaces what the previous edition of DSM termed alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Continued on next page Chapter 4 88 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Continued Binge drinking: A drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. This usually takes place after four or more drinks for women and fve or more drinks for men. 571,572 However, older adults are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and treatment providers may need to lower these numbers when screening for alcohol misuse.573 Additionally, other factors such as weight, decrease in enzyme activity, and body composition (e.g., amount of muscle tissue present in the body) can also affect alcohol absorption rates. Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living (ADLs), including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 574 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Drug-drug interaction: The interaction of one substance (e.g., alcohol, medication, an illicit drug) with another substance. Drug-drug interactions may change the effectiveness of medications, introduce or alter the intensity of side effects, and increase a substance's toxicity or the concentration of that substance in a person's blood. Potentially serious interactions can also occur with certain foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. 575 Harmful drinking: Alcohol use that worsens or complicates current alcohol-related problems.576 Hazardous drinking: Alcohol use that increases the risk of future harm.577 Heavy drinking: Consuming fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women in one period on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days. 578 Moderate drinking: According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defned as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 579,580 However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over several days. 581 Additionally, individuals who don't metabolize alcohol well may need to consume even lower quantities. Some people, particularly those with certain alcohol-related illnesses or engaging in tasks requiring concentration, should not consume alcohol at all. The Dietary Guidelines stipulate that those who don't drink should not begin drinking for any reason. 582 Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches or peer recovery support specialists), mutual-help groups consist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no offcial connection to treatment programs. Most are self-supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as AA and Narcotics Anonymous are the most widespread and well researched type of mutual-help groups, other groups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affliated with a religion or church (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Peer support: The use of peer recovery support specialists (e.g., someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training) to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When those positive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Continued on next page Chapter 4 89 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder. DSM-5 defnes remission as present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving). 583 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Stepped care: A science-based approach that matches an individual's treatment needs to different levels of care, from least intensive to most intensive. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to DSM-5, 584 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function, and by impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions of DSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerly called substance dependence. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction. surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Alcohol Misuse Among Older Adults Age-Specifc Efects of Alcohol Use More older adults are misusing alcohol than in earlier years. An estimated 23.2 million adults ages 65 and older drank alcohol in the past month, 5.6 million engaged in past-month binge drinking, and 1.5 million engaged in past-month heavy drinking. 585 The signs and effects of alcohol misuse, including binge drinking and AUD, often differ between older and younger adults. Understanding the differences will help you identify, assess, and treat older adults. Older adults metabolize alcohol less effciently than younger adults. Older adults have less lean body mass and less total body water than younger adults. This smaller water volume is one reason why an older adult and a younger adult can drink similar amounts of alcohol, but the older adult's blood alcohol level will be higher and stay high longer. In addition, older adults' central nervous system (CNS) is more sensitive to alcohol's effects, leading to lower tolerance. 586 These differences can lead to or worsen chronic illnesses common in older adults (e.g., high blood pressure). 587 Drinking also increases health-related risks for older adults who take medications that may interact negatively with alcohol. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to take multiple Chapter 4 90 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults medications, further increasing this risk. Moreover, up to 19 percent of older adults in the United States use alcohol and prescription medications in a way that could be considered misuse. 588 Alcohol Misuse Older adults can meet the defnition of alcohol misuse at lower levels of alcohol use than adults younger than 60. Older adults who have been drinking for years may face more alcohol-related problems\u2014and those problems may be more severe\u2014even if their use has not increased over time. A review of survey data indicates that 4 percent to 14 percent of older adults may misuse alcohol. 589 The rate of alcohol misuse among older adults increases when including health status and overall functioning, rather than just amount of alcohol used and frequency of use. For instance, a study on alcohol-related health risk in older adults in the United States found that among older adults who drink, 53.3 percent had harmful or hazardous use. 590 This number was more than three times greater than the number of older adults consuming alcohol above federal guideline limits. The discrepancy in the consumption rate and the rate of harmful or hazardous use is explained by the health status of older adults. RESOURCE ALERT: A CONSUMER WEBSITE FOR CALCULATING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION Rethinking Drinking: Alcohol & Your Health (www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov) is a National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) interactive website that provides individuals with accurate information about what a standard drink is and how to calculate their level of alcohol use based on the types and amounts of alcoholic beverages they drink. Low-risk drinking guidelines at this website are for all adults; they are not reduced for older adults. Discuss why older adults may need to adhere to lower numbers before referring your clients to this website. Alcohol misuse among older adults is likely responsible for a large portion of the damage some experience to their health and well-being. 591 For the older adult population, drinking even small amounts of alcohol can have serious physical, mental, and social effects. For example, one or two drinks a day may lead to increased cognitive impairment (problems with thinking) for individuals who already have dementia, or sleep problems (e.g., sleep apnea). 592 The economic costs of alcohol misuse among older adults are signifcant. Older adults who misuse alcohol are at greater risk for injury and falls. Certain events among older adults that can be related to alcohol use\u2014such as injury deaths, falls treated in emergency departments, hospitalized falls, and fall-related traumatic brain injury deaths\u2014 have risen signifcantly in the past decade. 593 Older adults who misuse alcohol are at risk for:594 Liver disease. Sleep problems. Cancer. Diabetes. Congestive heart failure. Lowered general health functioning. Older adults who drink beyond recommended guidelines have higher rates of tobacco use disorder and are at risk for: 595,596,597 Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders. Memory problems. Cognitive changes such as dementia. Sleep disorders. Agitation or violent behavior. Suicide. Chapter 4 91 TIP 26 DRINKING IN RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES Participating in social activities with family and friends who drink reinforces alcohol use and misuse. This is particularly true in retirement communities, where drinking and socializing often go hand in hand. 598 A recent study of a large retirement community in Florida found that 15.4 percent of the respondents to a survey on drinking reported hazardous drinking levels. However, when asked about health-related concerns and quality of life, most responded that drinking was a part of their social lives, did not report many health concerns, and reported a high quality of life. 599 This result suggests that some older adults whose social drinking exceeds recommended limits may improve their quality of life, which could balance out any potential health risks. However, subjective measures of health-related effects of heavy alcohol use are not always as trustworthy as objective measures, such as lab results for medical conditions. When you assess the health risks of an older adult's drinking, keep in mind the cultural context of his or her drinking, the amount and frequency of drinking, and any objective measures of health effects in addition to self-report fndings. Binge Drinking Binge drinking is a drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. On average, this occurs after fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women. 600,601 However, for older adults, who have increased sensitivity to alcohol, lower alcohol consumption levels may be considered binge drinking. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 10.7 percent of adults ages 65 and older binge drink (defned as fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women, per event). 602 This percentage would be even higher if the survey could factor in that binge drinking occurs at lower alcohol consumption levels for some older adults. Binge drinking appears to Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults be more of an issue for older men than older women. 603 Yet binge drinking among older women is rapidly increasing.604 Binge drinking creates additional health problems for older adults. Binge drinking is related to a number of health and safety issues, including accidents, an increased chance of physical injury (e.g., falls), and higher death rates. 605,606 Binge drinking is also related to a higher risk of AUD in both men and women as they age. 607,608 AUD Baby boomers drink more than earlier generations, which is likely to lead to a large increase in the number of older adults with AUD as this generation ages. 609 Furthermore, the number of adults ages 65 and older in the U.S. population is predicted to increase from about 56 million in 2020 to more than 85 million by 2050. 610,611 In the general population, only an estimated 1.52 percent of adults ages 60 and older report AUD in the past 12 months; 16.1 percent report AUD in their lifetime. 612 Conversely, up to 30 percent of older adults hospitalized in general medical units and up to 50 percent hospitalized in psychiatric units have AUD. 613 This is signifcant, because older adults with AUD who are hospitalized might not report their level of drinking to healthcare providers and could be at risk for alcohol withdrawal during their hospitalization. So too, these percentages may not capture the actual prevalence of AUD in this population, as DSM diagnostic criteria do not always accurately identify AUD in older adults. 614 According to the 2019 NSDUH, 10.7% of adults ages 65 and older BINGE DRINK. Chapter 4 92 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Co-Occurring Health Conditions and Mental Disorders Alcohol use can worsen the effects of many co-occurring mental health and health conditions (e.g., depressive disorders, high blood pressure, and diabetes). In addition, many physiological changes naturally take place during the aging process; clients need to understand that drinking can accelerate these health-related changes. Anxiety Anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are common in adults ages 60 and older in community and treatment settings. 615 Older adults also have a high rate of co-occurring anxiety disorders and AUD. 616 Anxiety causes high personal distress, reduces life satisfaction, and increases the risk for disability among older adults. Anxiety also increases the risk of death among older adults from suicide and from heart disease. 617 Older adults who drink to lessen their anxiety increase their health-related risks. Depression Depression is one of the most common co-occurring mental disorders among older adults with AUD. Approximately 4.5 percent of older adults (ages 50 and older) met past-year prevalence of major depression. 618 This estimate does not include those who meet either DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for other depressive disorders or have symptoms of depression that interfere with everyday functioning. The negative effects of depression in older adults include suicide risk, increased cognitive impairment, a higher risk of dementia, and poorer physical health. 619 Alcohol is a depressant drug (meaning it reduces activity of the CNS). Drinking alcohol can worsen depression or increase the risk of late-life depression. 620 In approximately 30 percent of older adults with co-occurring AUD and depression, the depression is not directly linked to drinking but instead was present before the onset of AUD or developed separately from AUD. 621 RESOURCE ALERT: TREATING DEPRESSION IN OLDER ADULTS See SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practices KIT (Knowledge Informing Transformation) The Treatment of Depression in Older Adults (https:// store.samhsa.gov/product/Treatment-Depression-Older-Adults-Evidence-Based-Practices-EBP-Kit/ SMA11-4631) for more information and treatment strategies. Diagnosing depression in older adults with AUD is challenging. Depression may be underdiagnosed because its symptoms are similar to those of dementia and common complaints of older adults, such as loss of interests, slowed thinking, lack of energy, or general aches and pains. 622 Assess depression and other mood disorders at the start of AUD treatment, and reassess from time to time to learn whether abstinence or a reduction in alcohol use reduces symptoms of depression. Serious Mental Illness People with serious mental illness (SMI), like schizophrenia, typically have higher levels of stress, tobacco use, and alcohol use than the general population. They are also more likely to have poor overall health, an inactive lifestyle, and an increased risk of death. 623 About 19 percent of older adults with SMI have a co-occurring SUD, and AUD is one of the most common. 624 Co-occurring AUD and SMI among older adults has not been studied widely. However, alcohol use is a factor in people not taking their psychotropic medication as prescribed, and co-occurring AUD is related to longer length of psychiatric stay and an increase in co-occurring medical conditions. See Chapter 6 of this TIP for details on the links between alcohol use and dementia among older adults. Chapter 4 93 TIP 26 Pain Chronic pain is a common condition in older adults that reduces their ability to move and perform ADLs. A study of U.S. older adults estimated that 52.9 percent, or as many as 18.7 million, have pain that makes their daily functioning diffcult. 625 Older adults with chronic pain who drink to reduce their pain are at risk for late-onset AUD. 626 Drinking while taking pain medications also increases other health-related risks (e.g., serious liver disease, overdose death). Common pain medications older adults may take include nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids (e.g., hydrocodone, oxycodone). Screening and Assessment Many older adults who misuse alcohol do not need specialized addiction treatment services. Still, screening and brief educational and motivational interventions can help older adults reduce alcohol use and health-related harms when delivered in healthcare and mental health service settings. 627 AUD is often underdiagnosed in older adults. Some DSM-5 diagnostic criteria may not apply to them. For example, the criterion of failing to fulfll major duties at work will not apply to an older adult who is retired. Furthermore, providers may mistake AUD symptoms for other conditions that are commonly, yet often incorrectly, thought to be normal signs of aging, such as: 628 Sleep problems. Memory loss. Depression. Anxiety. Aches and pains. Poor diet. Loss of interest in sex. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Older adults in long-term care settings, such as assisted living and nursing homes, are often not diagnosed or treated for AUD. 629 The key to fnding the right interventions for alcohol misuse, including AUD, is to adapt screening, assessment, and diagnostic criteria to older clients, regardless of the settings in which they receive health or social services. Widespread Screening Widespread screening in healthcare and behavioral health service settings is an opportunity for brief intervention and, when needed, referral to addiction-specifc treatment services. 630 Older adults are often not screened for alcohol misuse because providers hold incorrect beliefs about alcohol use in this population. They may think that older adults don't drink much or, if they do drink, they should be allowed this \"one last pleasure\" of life. 631 Providers also may choose not to ask older adults about their drinking history and current alcohol use for fear that asking these questions will hurt their relationship with these clients. However, baby boomers tend to be more accepting than earlier generations of the idea of talking about and seeking help for mental disorders and SUDs. Challenge false beliefs by educating your fellow providers and supporting widespread alcohol screening as a normal, ongoing practice. Doing so can help reduce any mixed feelings providers have about screening older adults. It can also increase the chances of identifying alcohol misuse early in older clients. (Chapter 3 of this TIP offers more information on screening and assessing for substance misuse in older adults.) Chapter 4 94 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults WHEN TO SCREEN OLDER ADULTS FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE632 As part of every annual physical exam As part of the initial assessment in behavioral health service settings As part of the initial intake or admission process to older adult-focused social service programs When the older adult starts a new medication When the older adult has major stressful life changes (e.g., death of a signifcant other, retirement, major illness or declining health, loss of social supports) When potential signs and symptoms of an alcohol-related problem are present, such as sleep diffculties, falls, injuries, depression, and problems with daily living skills When the older adult has multiple healthcare providers or uses more than one pharmacy When the older adult reports that a medication is not working as well over time When the older adult reports a past personal or family history of substance use or mental disorders The consensus panel recommends widespread screening of older adults for alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in all healthcare settings and emergency departments, where older adults are frequently seen because of accidents and falls related to alcohol use. Also screen older adults for alcohol misuse at the initial intake or assessment when admitted to social services agencies and behavioral health service programs. Screening Tools The Alcohol Use Disorders Identifcation Test (AUDIT) and the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test-Geriatric Version (SMAST-G) are two common, easy-to-use, brief instruments that can successfully screen older adults for alcohol misuse and signs of AUD. 633 AUDIT The AUDIT is a 10-item screening instrument for heavy drinking from the World Health Organization. The AUDIT collects information about alcohol use, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems over the past year. 634 It is a validated (tested and approved) measure of alcohol-related risk in people of different genders, ages, and cultures. 635 There are two versions\u2014one given by clinicians and one that clients complete by themselves. (See the Chapter 4 Appendix for both.) A cutoff score of 8 generally indicates hazardous and harmful alcohol use. For older adults, however, a score of 5 means you should assess further. 636 SMAST-G Researchers at the University of Michigan developed the MAST-G, a 24-item screening instrument specifcally for use with older adults. The MAST-G can be used to identify alcohol misuse in older adults. The SMAST-G is a shorter, 10-item, validated version of MAST-G. 637 The SMAST-G does not ask about amount and frequency of alcohol use; it focuses more on the older adult's relationship to alcohol and effects of drinking. The SMAST-G is about as reliable and accurate for older adults as the AUDIT. Two or more \"yes\" responses indicate possible alcohol misuse. 638 (See the Chapter 4 Appendix for the SMAST-G.) Considerations When Using AUD Screening Instruments Although screening instruments can help you quickly identify potential alcohol misuse in older adults and offer a chance to use prevention strategies (Exhibit 4.2), they can sometimes be overly sensitive and lead to false positives. 639 Some questions on alcohol screening instruments refer to physical complaints that are often age associated. Conversely, brief screening does not always capture symptoms that may indicate AUD. Always follow up positive screens with more questions and indepth assessment (or referral to assessment) for AUD. Chapter 4 95 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 4.2. Preventing Alcohol Misuse Among Older Adults You can support prevention efforts by helping older adults develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills they need to make good choices about alcohol use before their drinking puts their physical and mental health at risk. The key to prevention is identifying early which older adults drink alcohol. You can often help older adults to reduce their drinking, or to seek help if their alcohol use begins to affect their health, simply by giving them information about standard drink sizes, guidelines for low-risk drinking, health risks of alcohol misuse, and health risks of mixing medication with alcohol. Early identifcation and prevention begin with widespread prescreening in all healthcare and community- based senior service settings. 640 The following decision tree shows the early identifcation and prevention process. Adapted from material in the public domain.641 Assessment and Diagnosis of AUD It is essential that you, or another provider with suffcient qualifcations, perform indepth assessments for AUD in your older adult clients. Older adults with AUD are often underdiagnosed because DSM-5 criteria do not always capture AUD in older adults. Also, some signs of AUD may be mistaken for symptoms of co-occurring medical or mental disorders or natural aging processes. If you only use DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to diagnose AUD, you may miss many older adults with alcohol-related problems, which means they may not receive proper treatment. 642 A full assessment should address the client's: History of alcohol use. Age of onset of alcohol-related problems. Past and current amount and frequency of alcohol use (with attention to periods of binge drinking). Relationship between his or her drinking and daily functioning. Co-occurring medical conditions. Past attempts to limit or control alcohol intake. Chapter 4 96 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Co-occurring mental disorders, particularly depression and anxiety. Current medications. Use of alcohol to cope with sleep problems, depression, anxiety, stressful life events, or pain. For information on how to give an indepth assessment for AUD, refer to Chapter 3 of this TIP . Understanding DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria Versus Alcohol-Related Risk Criteria For an AUD diagnosis, your client must have at least 2 out of 11 symptoms listed in DSM-5. However, as noted before, some of these symptoms may not apply to older adults. Exhibit 4.3 summarizes the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of aging you should think about when using these criteria to assess and diagnose AUD in older adults. EXHIBIT 4.3. DSM-5 Criteria for AUD and Considerations for Older Adults DSM-5 CRITERIA FOR AUD643 CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS644,645,646,647,648 Criterion A1 Older adults may need less alcohol to feel physical effects. Cognitive impairment can make it hard for older adults to keep track of their drinking. Criterion A2 No special considerations for older adults. Criterion A3 Effects of alcohol can result from drinking even small amounts, so relatively less time may be spent getting and drinking alcohol and recovering from using it. Criterion A4 No special considerations for older adults. Criterion A5 Older adults may have different role responsibilities because of life-stage changes, such as retirement. Role responsibilities more common in older adulthood include caregiving for a spouse or another family member, such as a grandchild. Criterion A6 Older adults may not realize that social or interpersonal problems they are experiencing are connected to their alcohol use. Criterion A7 Older adults may take part in fewer activities generally, making it more diffcult to discover when drinking is causing them to withdraw from activities. Criterion A8 Older adults may not understand that their alcohol use is hazardous, especially when they are drinking the same as or less than before. In addition, older adults may not realize the physical dangers of drinking in certain situations (e.g., before using a step stool). Criterion A9 Older adults experiencing physical or psychological problems may not realize that drinking could be a factor. Criterion A10 Changes in tolerance occur because of increased sensitivity to alcohol with age. Previously manageable quantities of alcohol may cause greater impairment. Criterion A11 Withdrawal symptoms in older adults can last longer, be less obvious, or be mistaken for age-related illness. Chapter 4 97 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults DSM-5 diagnostic criteria related to physical and emotional effects (e.g., craving, desire to cut down) may be key signs of AUD in older adults. 649 When deciding whether an older individual's alcohol misuse meets DSM-5 criteria for AUD, remember older adults' lowered tolerance to alcohol and the unique aspects of withdrawal from alcohol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs, like benzodiazepines. To diagnose AUD in older adults, use alcohol- related risk criteria in addition to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. For example, alcohol-related risk criteria for older adults in the Comorbidity Alcohol Risk Evaluation Tool (CARET), based on the Alcohol-Related Problems Survey, 650 include:651 Amount and frequency of alcohol use (e.g., drinking more than recommended guidelines). Brief periods of excessive drinking (e.g., binge drinking). Driving after drinking. Others being concerned about the older adult's drinking. Co-occurring medical and mental disorders. Symptoms caused or worsened by drinking (e.g., cognitive impairment). Medications that interact negatively with alcohol or that do not work properly if taken with alcohol. The amount and frequency of drinking described as \"at-risk\" for older adults is paired with specifc drinking behaviors, use of medications, and co-occurring conditions in the past 12 months. For more information about the items in the CARET and how to score them, please see Barnes et al., 2010. 652 For example, if an older adult has chronic liver disease and drinks any alcohol or even binge drinks just once a week, he or she may not meet DSM-5 criteria for AUD. Still, his or her drinking is a risk for serious alcohol-related health consequences. Using age-adjusted DSM-5 criteria and CARET health-related risk criteria will more accurately gauge severity of AUD and the degree to which your client may exhibit behavioral or health-related effects of drinking that should be a focus of treatment. In assessing and diagnosing AUD in older adults, the consensus panel recommends that you think through all aspects of health-related risk in addition to age-specifc issues. Late-Onset Alcohol Misuse and AUD Most older adults meeting criteria or receiving treatment for AUD began drinking earlier in their lives. However, some older adults begin to misuse alcohol later in life (called late-onset alcohol misuse or, if severe enough to meet criteria for AUD, late-onset AUD). Older adults who begin misusing alcohol late in life may not realize their increased risk for health-related harms related to drinking. They may start misusing alcohol to cope with co-occurring medical or mental disorders, grief and isolation upon the loss of a loved one, or the stress of life changes, such as retirement. 653 Stress, role or identity loss, and approval of drinking by members of older adults' social groups are linked to an increased risk of late-onset AUD. 654 Assessments should address risk factors related to late-life alcohol misuse among older adults (Exhibit 4.4). Assessment is a chance for you to use education as a prevention and early intervention tool. ~78% of older adults in the U.S. who drink also take MEDICATIONS that INTERACT with ALCOHOL. Chapter 4 98 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults EXHIBIT 4.4. Risk Factors Related to Alcohol Misuse in Late Life655 Physical risk factors: Long-lasting pain Physical disabilities or problems getting around Changes in care or living situations Poor health status Chronic physical illness Multiple prescription drugs Mental risk factors: Avoidance coping style (e.g., drinking to cope with stressful events) History of alcohol misuse Past or co-occurring SUDs (including tobacco use disorder) Past or co-occurring mental disorders Social risk factors: Financial stress, including having a fxed income and having diffculty obtaining Medicare/Medicaid and other health benefts Bereavement Unexpected or forced retirement Social isolation Assessing Alcohol-Drug Interactions Alcohol-drug interactions are a major factor in the overall health risk for older adults who drink. 656 Changes in older adults' ability to absorb and metabolize alcohol and medications (i.e., higher sensitivity) can increase the risk of negative alcohol-drug interactions. Alcohol can also increase or reduce a medication's therapeutic effect and interfere with its effectiveness in treating medical illnesses commonly seen in older adults, like high blood pressure, depression, gout, and insomnia. 657 Some older adults may also be at greater risk for negative alcohol-drug interactions because of the number and types of medications they take. Approximately 78 percent of older adults in the United States who drink also take medications that interact with alcohol. 658,659 Emergency department visits are increasing for dangerous alcohol-drug reactions in older adults. Many classes of prescription medications can interact negatively with alcohol, including: 660 Antibiotics. Antidepressants. Antihistamines. medications. Anti-infammatory agents. Opioids. Anticoagulants. Learn more about commonly used prescription and over-the-counter medications and how they interact with alcohol in NIAAA's publication Harmful Interactions (www.niaaa.nih.gov/ publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/harmful-interactions-mixing-alcohol-with-medicines). Chapter 4 99 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults RESOURCE ALERT: ALCOHOL AND DRUG INTERACTION CHECKERS a Learn more about interactions between alcohol and specifc medications by using a drug interaction checker (e.g., the one available at www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.html). Check for interactions between ethanol (the type of alcohol in alcoholic beverages) and medications (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements (e.g., vitamins, herbal products). With permission, you can also check with your client's pharmacist about alcohol-drug interactions for the specifc medications your client takes. Always learn which medications your client takes. Nonjudgmentally offer information about the ways alcohol can interfere with a medication's effectiveness and increase the risk of harmful effects. The consensus panel recommends that you educate older adults about negative alcohol- drug interactions and work with your clients to help them reduce or abstain from alcohol use while taking these medications. Continuum of Care A continuum of care exists for older adults with lcohol misuse, including AUD. It ranges from least to most intensive: from brief interventions, to outpatient or intensive outpatient treatment (IOP) in programs that specialize in mental health services or SUD treatment, to inpatient detoxifcation and rehabilitation. Continuing care should focus not only on achieving abstinence from or reducing alcohol use but also on improving quality of life. AUD treatment goals are like treatment goals for any other chronic condition. They include: 661 Respectfully helping older adults participate in treatment throughout the continuum. Helping them stay motivated to change risk behaviors to improve their health and quality of life throughout treatment and recovery. Using multiple treatments as needed, including pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Reducing the risk of relapse. Apply a stepped-care approach that starts with the least intensive treatment option that meets the needs of the older adult, and then increase the level of intensity as needed. Exhibit 4.5 shows the possible treatment pathways along the continuum of care for older adults with alcohol misuse. EXHIBIT 4.5. Continuum of Care Pathways for Older Adults Brief Intervention Follow-Up Inpatient Detoxication Inpatient Detoxication and Rehabilitation Outpatient or IOP Recovery Management* Recovery Management* Outpatient Recovery Management* Note: Pharmacological interventions may be started at any time across the continuum of care to meet clients' needs. *For more about recovery management, see the \"Recovery Management\" section of this chapter. Based on Severity 100 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Treatment Approaches Suited to Older Adults Despite common stereotypes, older adults are generally open to and accepting of alcohol treatment, especially when programs offer age-specifc groups, age-sensitive treatment (i.e., treatments that meet their special needs), and providers trained in issues unique to older adults. 662,663 Older men and women who participate in alcohol treatment:664 Are successful in reaching treatment goals of abstinence or risk reduction. Have nearly the same or better outcomes than younger adults. Are more likely to complete treatment than younger adults. Beneft greatly from age-specifc treatment. The consensus panel recommends that all treatment providers adopt the age-sensitive practices in Exhibit 4.6. (For more information on principles of care for older adults, see Chapter 2 of this TIP .) EXHIBIT 4.6. Characteristics of Age-Sensitive Alcohol Treatment for Older Adults665 Regardless of the settings and modalities in which you offer treatment services to older adults, they are more likely to be open to and respond to treatment if interventions are: Supportive and nonconfrontational (e.g., forming a respectful partnership with your clients, which is the primary way to support behavior change). Flexible (e.g., supplying services at home or over the phone if clients cannot get to you). Sensitive to gender differences (e.g., addressing in AUD treatment the fact that women are more likely to be prescribed psychoactive medications than men). Sensitive to cultural differences (e.g., using print materials in your clients' primary language). Sensitive to the client's level of physical and cognitive functioning (e.g., using shorter sessions; meeting in a room close to the building entrance; giving information in multiple formats, like verbally and in writing). Holistic and thorough (e.g., addressing cognitive, physical, social, mental, fnancial, emotional, and spiritual factors that may inhibit treatment engagement or enhance recovery). Focused on helping older adults develop and improve coping and social skills (i.e., instead of focusing on internal mental processes, using treatment that focuses on behavioral change to reduce their alcohol-related risk and increase quality of life, such as developing problem-solving strategies to manage triggers for drinking and strengthening social connections with nondrinking friends or members of mutual-help groups). Brief Interventions for Alcohol Misuse Brief interventions can support AUD prevention and risk reduction (e.g., helping clients to reduce or abstain from drinking to decrease health-related risks). Brief intervention also can be a starting point for entry into more intensive AUD treatment. (See Chapter 3 of this TIP for more information.) Older adults are likely to participate in and accept this approach to addressing alcohol misuse. 666,667,668 Brief interventions are a good ft for many different treatment settings, including primary care, emergency departments, older adult-focused social service settings, and outpatient behavioral health service programs. They are cost effective, low intensity, 669,670 and effcient, generally consisting of one to four sessions that last from 15 to 60 minutes. 671,672 Brief interventions may include: Chapter 4 101 TIP 26 Referral as needed to medical specialists. Inpatient/outpatient addiction-specifc treatment. Older adult-focused social services. Community-based mutual help and recovery support groups, such as AA. RESOURCE ALERT: SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS See SAMHSA's A Guide to Preventing Older Adult Alcohol and Psychoactive Medication Misuse/ Abuse: Screening and Brief Interventions at www. ncoa.org/wp-content/uploads/SBIRT-Older-Adult - Manual-Final.pdf for more information about prevention strategies and brief interventions. You can use the guide's \"Health Promotion Workbook\" (included as an appendix) when conducting brief interventions for alcohol misuse. Motivational Interviewing Motivational interviewing (MI) strategies are a cornerstone of brief interventions for alcohol misuse. You can combine these strategies with longer therapeutic approaches to treat AUD in older adults. 673 MI can help people of many different ages and ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds participate in treatment. MI is fexible and focuses on empathetic, refective listening and a respectful, client-centered approach. 674 MI strategies may be particularly useful with older adults who may not be aware of the health risks related to their alcohol use. Because MI is a nonjudgmental and nonconfrontational approach, it may also be useful with clients who have mixed feelings about changing their drinking. MI can help older adults change risk behaviors, such as reducing or abstaining from alcohol use. 675,676,677 However, not many studies have looked at MI's usefulness in getting older adults to reduce or stop alcohol use. Some of the ways in which MI affects behavior change may be different for older adults than for younger adults. 678 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults KEY ASPECTS OF MI Being willing to collaborate with the client Being accepting and nonjudgmental Offering compassionate and empathetic responses to client concerns Asking clients about their concerns and goals for treatment instead of forcing your own agenda for change on them 679 The mnemonic \"FRAMES\" outlines the most common MI strategies used in brief interventions to address alcohol misuse: F: Give specifc and nonjudgmental, objective Feedback to your clients about their drinking, including information about health risk and potential effects. This feedback is often based on results of alcohol misuse screening instruments. R: Point out to your clients their personal Responsibility for change and emphasize that it is up to them to decide what, if anything, to change about their drinking. Responsibility for change also means respecting your clients' independence and decisions about behavior change. A: Give clear Advice and recommendations to your clients about changing their drinking. In the spirit of a client-centered approach, ask permission to give advice, and then ask your clients about their understanding of the recommendations you offered. M: Offer a Menu of options for changing drinking behaviors if your clients choose to change. Options may include altering drinking behaviors, abstaining, or accepting referral to more intensive mental health services or addiction-specifc treatment. E: Use an Empathetic communication style that is respectful, supportive, and focused on listening to your clients' views and concerns about their drinking. S: Support Self-effcacy by recognizing clients' knowledge about and ability to change behaviors in support of their health and well-being, including changing drinking behaviors. 680,681 102 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults MI generally focuses on:682 Helping clients deal with any mixed feelings they may have about changing their drinking. Asking clients about their own reasons for change. Having a respectful and joint conversation about behavior change based on clients' stated goals. Exhibit 4.7 shows a brief intervention developed specifcally for older adults that builds on the FRAMES model and uses MI strategies, such as discussing the client's reasons to reduce or quit drinking and summarizing the discussion at the session's end. EXHIBIT 4.7. Brief Alcohol Intervention Parts for Older Adults683 After you fnd that an older adult is misusing alcohol, use a semistructured brief intervention, including the following steps: 1. Ask the client about future goals for health, activities, hobbies, relationships, and fnancial stability. 2. Adapt your feedback based on the client's responses to screening questions relating to drinking patterns and other health habits (which may also include smoking, nutrition, and tobacco use). 3. Discuss how the client's drinking compares with that of others in his or her age group; review defnitions of standard drinks (one standard drink equals 12 ounces of beer or ale, one 1.5 ounce shot of distilled spirits, 5 ounces of wine, 3-4 ounces of sherry, or 2-3 ounces of liqueur 684). 4. Discuss the \"pros and cons\" of drinking if appropriate. Doing so can help you understand the role of alcohol in the older adult's life, including its role in coping with loss and loneliness, without infuencing the client to move toward any specifc change. 5. Give information about the effects of heavier drinking in a nonjudgmental way. Some older adults may have problems in physical, mental, or social abilities despite drinking within recommended limits. 6. Discuss the client's reasons to cut down or quit drinking. Staying independent, having good physical health, and keeping mental abilities can be key motivators in this age group. 7. Offer information about drinking limits and ways to cut down or quit (e.g., participating in social activities that do not involve alcohol, taking up hobbies and interests from earlier in life, fnding volunteer activities). 8. Create a drinking agreement. Agreed-upon drinking limits that are signed by the client and the provider are particularly helpful in changing drinking patterns. 9. Discuss ways to cope with risky situations when the client may feel tempted to drink beyond agreed-upon limits. Social isolation, boredom, and negative family interactions can be problems in this age group. 10. Summarize the session. If clients are already motivated to change their drinking, exploring their mixed feelings can accidentally lead to \"sustain talk\" (i.e., talk about reasons for not changing) instead of \"change talk\" (i.e., talk about reasons for changing). Sustain talk can keep clients from making improvements. You should assess clients' readiness to change at the beginning of a brief intervention. If clients appear ready to make changes, urge them to talk more about the positive reasons for changing their alcohol use instead of focusing on the \"pros and cons\" of changing. 685,686,687,688 Chapter 4 103 TIP 26 Treatment of Co-Occurring Conditions and Disorders Co-occurring medical conditions and mental disorders can contribute to or worsen AUD. They can also complicate treatment of AUD in older adults. These conditions should be addressed at the same time as AUD, either by the same provider or provider team or through active referral to and care coordination with other medical or behavioral health services. 689 Factors that will help you decide how to address co-occurring conditions include:690 The severity and duration of AUD and any co-occurring conditions. Client preference. Availability of services in the community. The availability of care coordination among different providers. You can address co-occurring health conditions and mental disorders in older adults by: Helping clients who do not have a primary healthcare provider fnd one, and referring them to healthcare for an indepth physical, including screening and assessment for: -High disease. -Osteoporosis. -Sleep disorders. -Cancer. -Diabetes. -Heart disease. Screening for cognitive impairment and, if needed, referring for an indepth geriatric assessment. (See Chapter 6 of this TIP for more information.) Providing emotional support and behavioral interventions instead of standard CBT for older adults with cognitive impairments. 691 Assessing for other SUDs, including tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder. Giving clients treatment and intervention options for tobacco use disorder, pain management, and sleeping diffculties (e.g., CBT, relaxation training, exercise, physical Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults therapy).692 Options should be scientifcally supported and nonpharmacological whenever possible. Screening, assessing, and treating mental disorders (including depression and anxiety) within the scope of your practice, or referring to mental health services. Referring for pharmacotherapy for SUDs or mental disorders as needed to a medical provider trained in older adult care. Addressing mental disorders in age-sensitive/ age-specifc co-occurring treatment programs. Following up with other providers regularly and keeping track of clients' treatment progress together with the clients. (See the \"Referral Management and Care Coordination\" section.) The consensus panel recommends that you treat co-occurring medical conditions and mental disorders among older adults while you treat the AUD. Referral Management and Care Coordination The keys to positive outcomes in a stepped- care approach are effective management of referrals to the right level of treatment and ongoing coordination of care. You can adapt to many different settings the following strategies for referral management and care coordination for older adults: Identify a provider (e.g., nurse manager, case manager, social worker) in your organization who can help older adults with referral and follow-up after referral. This provider should be knowledgeable of older adults' needs and of age-sensitive/age-specifc resources in the community. Identify and develop linkages to age-appropriate medical, mental health, addiction treatment, recovery support, and social service resources and programs in your community. 693 In areas where no age-specifc treatment is available, work with programs to offer such services. 104 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Gather information about programs' eligibility criteria, treatment length, type of treatment, philosophy, and continuing-care options so you can match clients to the right program. 694 Keep an updated referral list of contacts and phone numbers of treatment resources. Keep on hand current information on services offered, cost, schedule, and accessibility. 695 Contact key individuals in that organization, and maintain an ongoing relationship with them. Match the referral to treatment with your clients' stated goals, treatment needs, problem severity and available resources. Include family members and caregivers in conversations about treatment planning, with clients' permission. Address your clients' hopes for treatment by: -Describing the type of program to which you are referring clients. -Asking and responding to any questions they may have. -Acknowledging their worries through refective listening. -Clearing up incorrect beliefs with information about treatment and its usefulness. -Offering hope by describing other older adults' positive outcomes with AUD treatment. Address clients' concerns about confdentiality, and get all necessary paperwork signed so you can communicate with other providers while your clients are in treatment. Offer a \"warm handoff\" (i.e., introduce clients directly) to the care coordinator or behavioral health service provider in your integrated care organization. Be prepared to take on the responsibility of managing the referral and coordinating care if you are not part of an integrated care team. 696 Follow up with clients to make sure referral was successful or to make another referral if needed. 697 Keep track of clients' progress in treatment; work closely with other providers to offer ongoing care as needed. Higher Intensity Treatment Approaches for AUD Several scientifcally supported approaches to AUD treatment are a good ft for older adults in outpatient, intensive outpatient, or inpatient residential settings. Treatment approaches that work best for older adults with AUD who need more intensive treatment than a brief intervention include CBT, TSF , pharmacological interventions, and inpatient AUD treatment tailored to older adults. CBT for Older Adults CBT is a well-established and scientifcally supported approach for treating AUD as well as co-occurring conditions often present in older adults, such as depression, anxiety, pain, insomnia, physical disability, and other SUDs. 698,699,700 CBT includes both cognitive and behavioral interventions applied separately or together. CBT is effective for individual and group sessions. Its fexibility and adaptability are pluses for treating the complex medical and mental health concerns of older adults. 701 Although CBT can be adapted to healthcare, outpatient, inpatient, and residential settings in which SUD treatment is available, older adults may have better outcomes with CBT in outpatient settings. 702 CBT for AUD focuses on helping clients fnd and change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that lead to alcohol misuse. CBT assumes that thoughts and feelings that occur before drinking behaviors take place are set in motion by situations or cues (e.g., attending a wedding where alcohol is served, smelling a favorite alcoholic beverage). In CBT, the client learns to identify these thoughts, feelings, and cues and then applies skills and coping methods to manage them. 703 Strong evidence supports CBT's usefulness in helping a wide range of client populations and ages, including older adults, reduce alcohol misuse and support and continue abstinence. 704 For older adults with memory problems, CBT provides a structured and educational approach. 705 Treatment programs using CBT report improved Chapter 4 105 TIP 26 This chain of events is for a 72-year-old woman who recently lost her spouse. She is having trouble sleeping.

Summarize and repeat information, cognitiveand behavioral change strategy steps, and theclient's new awareness and insights several timesthroughout and at the end of each session. Urge the older adult to take notes on keypoints of the session, or you can take notesand give a copy to the client at the end of thesession. Once permission is obtained from theclient, you may want to arrange for a familymember or signifcant person to attend andlearn information and skills. Offer handouts, forms, and reminder calls toincrease the chances that the older client willcomplete between-session assignments Skills-based approaches, relapse prevention, and PST are CBT adaptations that have been used successfully in the treatment of AUD among older adults. Skills-based approaches and relapse prevention Skills-based approaches may work well with older adults. Skills-based interventions focus on reducing health-related risks for alcohol use and continuing abstinence if the client decides that abstinence is the goal. The most commonly used skills-based approaches in AUD treatment that can be adapted for use with older adults are social skills training and coping skills training. Social skills training helps older adults grow or improve social networks to decrease the effects of substance use, loneliness, and depression in their lives. Social skills training helps clients keep existing or create new social networks that support reduced drinking or abstinence. A key element for clients with AUD is learning skills for turning down drinks when in social situations. Coping skills training helps older adults learn about and avoid or manage high-stress or high-risk situations they used to cope with by drinking. Key elements of coping skills training adapted for older adults with AUD are learning the ABCs (antecedents, behaviors, and consequences) of alcohol use, breaking down this chain of events, then identifying and practicing other ways of coping in high-risk situations. 708,709 Exhibit 4.8 depicts an example of an AUD behavioral chain for a 72-year-old woman. EXHIBIT 4.8. Drinking Behavioral Chain of Events Adapted from material in the public domain.710 106 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults RPT combines social skills and coping skills training into a structured program that can be used in group or individual treatment. One 16-week group treatment approach designed for older adults includes the following structured sections that can be repeated as needed: 711 Identifying individual-specifc behavioral chains for drinking Managing social pressures to drink Developing coping strategies for being home and alone Coping with negative thoughts and emotions related to drinking (e.g., anxiety, anger, depression, loneliness) Managing cues that lead to drinking (e.g., seeing a beer commercial on television) Coping with urges to drink Preventing a return to drinking after a period of abstinence (also known as a \"slip\") from becoming a full return to past levels of alcohol use and negative effects PST Older adults face many everyday stressors, including chronic medical illnesses and cognitive and physical limitations. PST is a simple approach that older adults can learn easily, including those who have mild cognitive impairment. 712 PST assumes that fnding the best solution to everyday problems reduces stress. Reducing stress improves people's functioning and well-being. Teaching people problem-solving skills helps them identify and apply solutions to current and future problems of living. 713 PST includes the following steps: Identify the client's view of the problem (i.e., a positive or negative view of the problem or of the possibility of identifying solutions). Defne the problem in specifc terms. Brainstorm possible solutions to the problem. Review the possible solutions. Select the best possible solution. Use the chosen solution, and track whether it is useful. Adjust the solution, if needed, and then use and review the new solution. 714 PST is widely used in many settings, including healthcare settings, outpatient addiction treatment, and home care. It is useful across age groups, including older adults, and across many mental disorders. 715 MINING THE WISDOM OF AGE AND LIVED EXPERIENCE When you work with older adults, remember that they have a great deal of wisdom from their life experience. This experience is like gold; mine it to help them solve their current problems. After you help clients defne a problem, ask, \"How have you dealt with a similar challenge in the past?\" or \"What are some of the ways you solved similar problems in your life?\" Talking with older adults about their skills and abilities empowers them and is a respectful and supportive way to help them recognize their own knowledge and wisdom. TSF Twelve-Step recovery support groups such as AA, as well as other mutual-help groups, can deliver positive outcomes for people with AUD. Such outcomes including a greater likelihood of stopping alcohol use, improved psychosocial functioning, and greater levels of self-effcacy. 716 Factors related to these improved outcomes include: Participating in 12-Step meetings held at the treatment facility. Attending 12-Step meetings while participating in outpatient or inpatient addiction treatment. Attending and actively participating in 12-Step meetings consistently, early in the recovery process, and frequently (e.g., three or more meetings per week). Participating in other 12-Step group activities (e.g., doing service at meetings, reading 12-Step literature, doing \"step work,\" getting a sponsor, calling other AA members for support). 717 Creating nondrinking social networks.718 Increasing spirituality and participating in spiritual practices like prayer and meditation. 719,720 Chapter 4 107 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults TSF therapy is a structured therapeutic approach that links people to, and helps them stick with, community-based 12-Step recovery support groups. TSF interventions range from 4 to 12 sessions of individual or group treatment in inpatient or outpatient settings. During sessions, the provider: Explores different 12-Step themes (e.g., powerlessness, personal responsibility, spirituality). Explores the client's attitudes about those themes and other aspects of 12-Step support groups. Identifes solutions to barriers hindering the client's active participation in 12-Step support groups. Some evidence exists that TSF therapy is effective with older adults and, like CBT, gives support, structure, goal direction, and opportunities for older adults to develop positive coping skills and a social network that values abstinence and a recovery focus. 721 RESOURCE ALERT: TSF THERAPY MANUAL The Twelve Step Facilitation Therapy Manual\u2014 found at https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/ projectmatch/match01.pdf\u2014was designed to standardize TSF therapy as a 12-session treatment approach for the original Project MATCH multisite clinical research trial. The manual, published by NIAAA, offers an overview of Project MATCH and the trial's standardized TSF modules. The TSF manual is the basis for other types and adaptations of TSF interventions. Adapt the confrontational interventions described in this manual for older adults, who respond better to and are more accepting of nonconfrontational approaches. Pharmacological Interventions Options for pharmacological interventions to treat AUD are more limited for older than younger adults. 722 Although these medications may work well and be safe for older adults, the risk of negative reactions is higher because older adults are more likely to have co-occurring medical problems, take multiple medications, and have a decreased ability to eliminate medications given age-related changes in liver and kidney functions. 723,724 To avoid harmful drug-drug interactions, prescribers must review all medications an older adult uses before giving a new prescription to treat AUD and consider a lower dose of the AUD medication when appropriate. Three medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD, but clinicians should note for each of these the effectiveness and safety profle in older adults specifcally. Furthermore, none of these medications have been studied across numerous long-term, randomized, controlled trials of older populations. 725 This limits understanding of their true benefts and drawbacks to older clients. Nonetheless, potential pharmacologic options and some of their considerations include: Acamprosate, which reduces symptoms of protracted withdrawal from alcohol, such as sleep and mood problems, by altering brain changes related to alcohol use. 726 It can also reduce craving and the pleasurable effects of alcohol. 727,728 Not enough research exists on the effcacy and safety of acamprosate in older adults. Because it is removed from the body through the kidneys, healthcare providers should frst evaluate and then monitor renal function in older clients. 729,730 Naltrexone, which reduces craving and the pleasurable effects of alcohol. 731 It comes in an oral formulation that is taken daily or an injectable formulation that requires a monthly visit to a healthcare provider. A very small number of studies suggest that naltrexone may be tolerable in adults ages 50 and older, but widespread data on its tolerability in older aged 108 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults individuals are missing.732 Prescribers should consider the following: - Naltrexone is removed from the body through the liver and should be used cautiously in older adults with possible liver problems. 733 - Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids used to treat chronic pain, which is common in older adults. 734 A client who begins naltrexone treatment while still taking opioids can suffer acute opioid withdrawal serious enough to require hospitalization. 735,736 Ask older adults about their use of opioid pain medication before starting naltrexone treatment. (See SAMHSA's TIP 63, Medications for Opioid Use Disorder [https://store.samhsa.gov/product/TIP-63-Medications-for-Opioid-Use-Disorder-Full-Document/PEP20-02-01-006], for more information about naltrexone.) - Naltrexone can trigger symptoms of major depression, including suicidal ideation. 737 Closely watch older adults with a history of depression who take naltrexone. 738 - Although naltrexone's potential side effects are relatively benign (e.g., dizziness, nausea, reduced appetite, increased daytime sleepiness), they can be signifcant in older adults. 739 Clinicians should monitor older clients appropriately. Disulfram, which triggers an acute physical reaction to alcohol, including fushing, fast heartbeat, nausea, chest pain, dizziness, and changes in blood pressure. It is prescribed to motivate people to abstain from alcohol. Because these effects can be harmful to older people, disulfram is generally not recommended for use with older adults and, if used, is done so only with great caution. 740,741 Physicians and other providers must closely monitor older clients taking disulfram for the occurrence of these effects. Additionally, family/ caregivers may need to supervise older adults taking disulfram to make sure they take it correctly and do not take it while continuing to use alcohol, which can lead to serious complications. 742 RESOURCE ALERT: MEDICATIONS FOR AUD For more information about medications for AUD, including dosing considerations for older adults, see SAMHSA's Medication for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: A Brief Guide (https:// store.samhsa.gov/product/Medication-for-the - Treatment-of-Alcohol-Use-Disorder-A-Brief - Guide/SMA15-4907). Medical Management Counseling Older adults with AUD who have no access to addiction-specifc treatment and do not need medically supervised withdrawal can get treatment in general healthcare settings with pharmacological interventions and brief treatment. Medical management counseling for this approach includes: Providing feedback on lab tests that show potential drinking-related health issues. This feedback can help increase motivation to change drinking habits. Recommending abstinence as the safest course while supporting movement toward that goal. Frequently checking that the older adult is taking his or her medication as prescribed, then reducing the frequency of visits after an appropriate period of abstinence. Actively linking the older adult to supports, such as to AA or other mutual-help and recovery support groups (see the \"Recovery Support Groups\" section) that welcome older adults. Urging and supporting active participation in recovery activities. Brief medical management counseling and following clients to make sure they take AUD medications as prescribed can help individuals with AUD stop drinking and remain alcohol free. 743 Chapter 4 109 TIP 26 The consensus panel recommends using medications to treat AUD in older adults when necessary. Key parts of pharmacotherapy for older adults include: Carefully reviewing potentially harmful drug- drug interactions. Using lower doses of medications. Following up with clients and making sure they take medications as prescribed. Linking clients to recovery supports. Inpatient AUD Treatment for Older Adults Inpatient treatment can be a good ft for older adults who: Meet criteria for AUD. Have co-occurring health and mental health concerns. Need medically supervised withdrawal. Chose abstinence as their primary treatment goal. Inpatient treatment may be limited to medically supervised withdrawal followed by active referral and immediate start of outpatient or IOP specialty treatment or can include a longer residential stay for an indepth recovery-oriented rehabilitation program. 744 All inpatient treatment programs should use age-sensitive practices for older adults (Exhibit 4.6). Medically supervised withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal symptoms in older adults can differ in severity, may occur 7 days or longer after the last drink, and are more likely to happen in people who have had withdrawal symptoms in the past. 745 Detoxifcation, also known as medically supervised withdrawal, should consider the unique aspects of alcohol withdrawal in older adults: Older adults are more likely to have delirium (i.e., rapid onset of a confused mental state) during withdrawal, which may be mistaken for early signs of dementia. 746 Typical withdrawal symptoms may be less obvious yet last longer in older adults. 747 Typical withdrawal symptoms include: -Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., increased pulse rate, blood pressure, and temperature). Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults -Restlessness. -Sleep problems. -Anxiety. -Nausea. -Tremor (shaking/shivering). Withdrawal may worsen other medical issues (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) and mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) in older adults. 748 Older adults are at greater risk than younger adults for alcohol withdrawal-related medical and neurological problems. This is because older adults have higher rates of co-occurring physical and mental disorders and cognitive impairments and an increased sensitivity to medications used to treat withdrawal symptoms (e.g., benzodiazepines). 749 Watch older adults closely for signs of delirium or seizures during withdrawal. Older adults may be at greater risk for harmful drug events during medically supervised withdrawal if they are taking medications to treat other medical conditions. Conduct an indepth assessment and continue to follow clients to learn: Which medications are being taken for other medical conditions. The client's risk of falls while being treated with common medications for managing withdrawal symptoms (e.g., benzodiazepines). Which co-occurring medical conditions are present (e.g., heart disease, breathing problems, diabetes, cognitive impairment). See Chapter 6 for more information about assessing cognitive impairment in older adults. RESOURCE ALERT: TIP 45, DETOXIFICATION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT SAMHSA's TIP 45 offers guidance for medically supervised alcohol withdrawal and additional information about older adults (https://store. samhsa.gov/product/TIP-45-Detoxifcation-and-Substance-Abuse-Treatment/SMA15-4131). 110 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults To reduce the risk of complicated withdrawal, older adults should complete medically supervised withdrawal in a medically supervised inpatient facility. 750 The revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale-Revised (CIWA-Ar) is an objective measure of alcohol withdrawal and shows the use and dosage of medications (e.g., short-acting benzodiazepines) to ease withdrawal symptoms. See \"Resource Alert: Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale-Revised (CIWA-Ar).\" However, the CIWA-Ar may not be as accurate for older adults with co-occurring medical conditions that hide or increase withdrawal symptoms. 751 Treatment during withdrawal should be based on your knowledge of the unique physiology of older adults, clinical judgment, and close tracking of clients. RESOURCE ALERT: CLINICAL INSTITUTE WITHDRAWAL ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL SCALE-REVISED (CIWA -Ar) The CIWA-Ar is umem.org/fles/uploads/1104212257_CIWA-Ar.pdf . Age-specifc treatment Age-specifc treatment for older adults helps support clients in seeking, entering, and staying in treatment. It also improves their treatment experience. 752 Whereas some older adults beneft from mixed-age treatment, other older adults are more likely to beneft from age-specifc treatment, such as those with more chronic co-occurring health conditions and problems with functioning, and those ages 75 and older. 753 Research shows positive outcomes; for instance, 60 percent to 85 percent of older adults who participated in age-specifc inpatient treatment programs were still abstinent 12 months after leaving treatment. 754 These programs offered:755 Individual and group therapy and community activities. Adaptations for older adults (e.g., slower pace; adaptations for vision, hearing and cognitive needs). Special topic groups for older adults that focused on grief, loss, isolation, physical health issues, recreation, and life changes. A nonconfrontational therapeutic approach highlighting the therapeutic alliance while using CBT, MI, and a 12-Step philosophy. PARTS OF A SUCCESSFUL INPATIENT REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR OLDER ADULTS Positive outcomes have been achieved by inpatient SUD rehabilitation programs for older adults that use: Nonconfrontational group therapy for grief, denial, anger, shame, age-related loss, and loneliness. CBT and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) focusing on: -Teaching clients how to manage distress, how to control emotions, and how to improve relationship skills. -Allowing people to rebuild social-support networks. -Using self-awareness to deal with grief, loneliness, and depression. Medical and mental health services, including 24-hour access to nursing care. Personal care aides, if needed. Health and wellness activities, including: -Massage. -Acupuncture. -Hydrotherapy. -Movement therapy. -Meditation. -Mindfulness practice. Family involvement in treatment. Active links to medical, social, and case management services. Chapter 4 111 TIP 26 Recovery Management Per SAMHSA, recovery is \"a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential.\" 756 Recovery management is an organizing philosophy for addiction treatment and recovery support services to help individuals and family members achieve and continue long-term addiction recovery. Not everyone who misuses alcohol needs ongoing recovery management support, but some older adults may beneft from ongoing tracking and recovery support, including those with: 757 Co-occurring medical conditions or mental disorders. Social isolation. Little support from family and friends. Recovery support for older adults who misuse alcohol can begin after a brief intervention in a healthcare setting or while the older adult is in mental disorder or AUD treatment (Exhibit 4.5). However, ongoing recovery management is most like the continuing care approach to addiction treatment and to the philosophy of ongoing illness management in the treatment of chronic medical illnesses like diabetes. In the addiction treatment research, some of the continuing care interventions that work well for older adults and show positive effects include: 758 Home visits. Telephone counseling. Recovery checkups. Linkages to community resources, such as recovery support groups. In addition, using case management services and helping supportive family members participate in the older adult's treatment can support ongoing recovery. Case and Care Management Services Case and care management (CCM) services focus on helping older adults reduce the health-related risks of alcohol misuse and enter addiction-specifc treatment when necessary. CCM models can be particularly helpful to older adults who Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults are isolated, because the CCM provider can offer services: In the client's home. By phone. Through videoconferencing. At the healthcare provider's offce. In community-based social service settings. In residential or long-term care facilities. For older adults, whose social networks tend to get smaller with age, CCM strategies should focus on connecting them to age-related resources in the community that support recovery. The CCM provider helps clients access medical, mental health, social, fnancial, education, work-related, and other community-based services. Nurse care managers, social workers, addiction treatment or mental health counselors, or peer recovery supporters can offer CCM. CCM services often lead to positive outcomes for older adults with AUD or co-occurring medical conditions or mental disorders. 759 CCM models may be particularly good at supporting and keeping older adults in treatment and offering a complete approach to addressing the needs of older adults with complex medical and mental health issues. CCM services are part of a comprehensive approach. They focus on overall health improvement, which is a common goal among older adults, rather than just addressing AUD (which may feel uncomfortable or shameful to older adults). 760 Program reviews of CCM approaches support case management as a key part of a long-term recovery management approach for older adults with AUD. 761 Caregiver Involvement Involving caregivers throughout treatment and ongoing recovery can help improve an individual's chances of staying in AUD treatment. It can also improve AUD treatment outcomes. 762 However, the client must give permission for you to involve others in their treatment. Issues of confdentiality and protection of dignity are highly important. You should know whom the older adult trusts or prefers for support. Caregivers may include a spouse or partner, adult children, 112 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults siblings, or extended family members, friends, or neighbors. Caregivers may be family members or individuals signifcant to the older adult who might be involved in the older adult's health decisions. Caregivers: Often make the frst contact with treatment services and should be involved in the initial assessment of the older adult (with the older adult's permission). Often supply strong motivation for the older adult to enter treatment. Can also offer important details about the older adult's drinking history and health-related risks related to current alcohol use. Should also be involved throughout treatment, including during development of a posttreatment recovery plan for the older adult and ongoing recovery support. Ways to involve a caregiver in AUD treatment include helping the caregiver: Develop contingency contracts for specifc AUD behaviors (e.g., taking AUD treatment medication, attending mutual help and recovery support groups, effects of returning to drinking). 763 Improve daily interactions and reinforce positive communication. Find caregiver education groups where caregivers learn and share with others. Develop and engage in shared recreational activities as alternatives to drinking. Reinforce positive change (e.g., praising steps to reduce or stop alcohol use). Develop constructive problem-solving skills (e.g., how to identify relapse triggers and respond with coping skills or strategies to prevent relapse, how to reengage with the recovery plan). Respond more effectively to the older adult's drinking (e.g., make sure the older adult is safe, then follow through with the consequences agreed to in the contingency contract instead of arguing or judging; encourage reengagement with the recovery plan and return to treatment if needed). RESOURCE ALERT: HOW TO TALK TO AN OLDER PERSON WHO HAS A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL OR MEDICATIONS This easy-to-read online article for family members and concerned others offers information about how to identify signs that the older adult may be misusing alcohol, how to talk with the older adult in a nonconfrontational way, and how to get help (www.hazeldenbettyford.org/ articles/how-to-talk-to-an-older-person-who-has-a-problem-with-alcohol-or-medications). A legal guardian (who may or may not be a family member) should participate in the treatment and recovery process for an older adult with cognitive impairment who cannot manage his or her own affairs. When a guardian has the healthcare power of attorney, the guardian should sign releases to speak with all providers involved in the older adult's treatment. Addressing Caregiver Needs Family members and others signifcant to older adults with AUD often take on the role of caregivers and case managers, particularly when co-occurring chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes) or mental/neurocognitive disorders (e.g., depression, dementia) are involved. Caregivers often get left out of treatment decisions and recovery planning, despite their commitment to and important role in the care and ongoing health management of these older adults. 764 Because of the stress of this responsibility and lack of support, caregivers can develop health-risk behaviors, such as sleep disorders, poor diet, smoking, alcohol use, and substance misuse. Caregivers may ignore their own care, which may worsen their own chronic medical conditions or increase their risk of stress-related illnesses. 765 You can help address caregivers' needs by:766 Identifying primary caregivers by reviewing clients' medical records. 767 Make sure all necessary paperwork is signed to allow family members and other providers to speak with one another. Chapter 4 113 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Involving them in the treatment and recovery planning process. Asking them about their own use of alcohol and other substances and history of mental disorders. Screening, assessing, and referring them to treatment for SUDs or mental disorders as needed. Supporting their use of healthy self-care activities, such as: -Getting enough sleep. -Eating a healthy diet. -Quitting smoking. -Exercising moderately. -Getting an annual physical with their primary care provider. -Reducing or avoiding alcohol use. Reminding them to ask for help from other family, friends, community members, or social service agency representatives who may be able to offer respite care. Exploring available caregiver supports in the community, such as the local Area Agency on Aging. (See \"Resource Alert: Community-Based Supports for Caregivers.\") Urging them to participate in mutual-help groups (e.g., Al-Anon, caregiver support groups). Reminding them to take breaks from the caregiver role. Pointing out that they are still the relative, spouse, or partner of the older adult, and that relationship has meaning and can still give them satisfaction. RESOURCE ALERT: COMMUNITY - BASED SUPPORTS FOR CAREGIVERS For more information on Al-Anon family groups and fnding local/online meetings, go to https:// al-anon.org. For more information about local and online caregiver support groups for family members of older adults with dementia, go to www.alz.org/ events/event_search?etid=2&cid=0 . Recovery Support Groups Older adults who have social supports that reinforce abstinence from alcohol have better outcomes in long-term AUD recovery than older adults without those social supports. 768 Two key factors for older adults in continuing recovery over time are having people in their lives who support their recovery and not having people in their social networks who encourage or enable alcohol use. 769 A key factor in long-term recovery for older adults is not having people in their social networks who encourage alcohol use. Community-based recovery support groups highlight the importance of developing social relationships that support recovery rather than drinking. 770 Although a growing range and number of recovery support groups are available to adults who have AUD, AA and SMART Recovery are widely available and may be the most useful supports for older adults. AA AA is the most well known and widely available recovery support group for older adults with AUD. It offers a community-based, long-term recovery management approach to treating AUD. AA meetings and activities following treatment can be cost-effective sources of ongoing social support. 771 Key elements of AA especially well suited to older adults include:772,773 Decreasing social ties that support drinking. Increasing social ties that support abstinence. Providing social support, goal direction, and structure. Offering opportunities to participate in substance-free social activities. Helping participants improve their self-effcacy and coping skills. Research on AA has found that older adults who attend more group meetings and have a sponsor have better 1-year alcohol-related and mental stress outcomes and less alcohol use at 114 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults 5-year follow-up than those who do not.774 The structured social support of AA may help older adults whose social networks have become smaller by improving their interpersonal and social coping skills. 775,776 Some research has found that older adults are less likely to attend AA meetings than younger adults. Results are mixed on older adults' level of involvement in AA meetings compared with that of younger AA members. 777,778 Sometimes older adults feel shut out by the culture, language, and experiences of younger adults in AA meetings. However, other evidence indicates that older adults' membership in AA is increasing. The AA Membership Survey showed increases from 2007 to 2014 in members ages 61 to 70 (from 12.3 percent to 18 percent) and in members ages 71 and older (from 5.3 percent to 7 percent). 779 Starting and staying in AA may be challenging for older adults with AUD, but not participating may put older adults at increased risk for return to alcohol use and negative long-term outcomes. 780 When older adults do participate in AA, they beneft by: 781,782 Having better drinking-related outcomes. Feeling less stress. Participating in more spiritual practices. Increasing social interactions and support. Having improved recovery. BARRIERS TO AA ATTENDANCE FOR OLDER ADULTS783 Lacking transportation Facing physical limitations Feeling uncomfortable going to meetings at night Having smaller social networks because of aging Having less interest than younger adults in increasing their social networks Relying on a spouse for recovery support SMART Recovery SMART Recovery is a network of local and online abstinence-focused recovery support groups that is based on principles of CBT and MI. Unlike AA meetings, SMART Recovery meetings are run by trained volunteers. The SMART program 784 is based on helping people: Build and keep motivation. Cope with urges. Manage thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Live a balanced life. The principles and structured format of SMART Recovery follow CBT and MI approaches to treating older adults. Research suggests that it is as effective as other community-based mutual-help approaches in supporting abstinence and in reducing the severity of the effects of alcohol misuse, particularly for people with less severe AUD. 785 SMART Recovery may also be an important option for those who feel uncomfortable with the spiritual underpinnings of AA and the 12-Step approach. Although the mutual-help group is less available in some areas of the country, online or telephone meetings are becoming more popular in all recovery support groups. The program does not support use of labels such as \"alcoholic,\" which may beneft older adults who feel shame and fear discrimination or judgment because of having AUD. SMART Recovery, like AA, offers chances for older adults to improve their recovery and quality of life by serving as volunteers. RESOURCE ALERT: SMART RECOVERY WEBSITE The SMART Recovery website (www. smartrecovery.org) gives information about SMART Recovery principles and training opportunities, including how to become a facilitator for meetings. It also has a searchable database of local and online meetings. Chapter 4 115 TIP 26 You can help older adults become involved in mutual-help groups by: Actively linking clients to available mutual-help groups, and supporting them in trying different groups so that they can fnd the one that best fts their needs. Asking clients about their understanding of and any past participation in mutual-help groups. Discussing the benefts of being involved in mutual-help groups as a part of recovery. Exploring ways to overcome barriers to joining and participating in mutual-help groups. Contacting local, regional, or state AA groups or other mutual-help groups or recovery community organizations (RCOs; see text box) to ask about community outreach efforts for older adults. Helping older clients fnd an age-friendly home group with older adult participants or a Seniors in Sobriety meeting (see \"Resource Alert: Seniors in Sobriety\"). Linking older adults to mutual-help group volunteers/peer recovery support specialists who can introduce them to the group, attend some meetings with them, and introduce them to other older members. Teaching them about sponsorship and how clients can fnd an AA sponsor or mutual-help group mentor who can guide them in the recovery process. RESOURCE ALERT: SENIORS IN SOBRIETY Since 1990, AA has actively reached out to older adults with AUD. Efforts include urging local meetings to be senior friendly and starting Seniors in Sobriety (SIS) meetings. The SIS website (www.seniorsinsobriety.com/ ) has information on SIS's history, focus, and annual conference and other meetings. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults WHAT IS AN RCO? \"A recovery community organization (RCO) is an independent, nonproft organization led and governed by representatives of local communities of recovery. These organizations organize recovery-focused policy advocacy activities, carry out recovery-focused community education and outreach programs, and supply peer-based recovery support services (P-BRSS).\" 786 Search for an RCO near you (https:// facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/arco/arco - members-on-the-map/ ). The consensus panel recommends that you actively link older clients to age-sensitive case management and ongoing recovery supports for older adults. Family, caregivers, and community-based mutual-help groups are key elements of recovery support for older adults. Clinical Scenarios The level of intensity of clinical interventions for older adults should match the severity of alcohol misuse. Interventions range from healthcare providers asking clients about their alcohol use during an annual screening to inpatient treatment for older adults who have AUD. Exhibit 4.9 shows how to match levels of health-related risk associated with alcohol misuse with different clinical interventions. The higher up the pyramid, the higher the level of risk and the more intense the intervention. In this graphic, the level of health-related drinking risk is defned as follows: Abstinence: Does not currently use alcohol. Low-Risk Drinking: Drinks within recommended limits. Moderate-Risk Drinking: Drinks above recommended limits. High-Risk Drinking: Binge drinks or drinks above recommended limits and has a co-occurring health condition or mental disorder. AUD: Meets DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for AUD. 116 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults The following clinical case scenarios are examples of different levels of alcohol misuse. They show how to use prevention strategies and clinical interventions that match risk levels in Exhibit 4.9. EXHIBIT 4.9. Alcohol Health-Related Risk and Treatment Response Pyramid787,788,789 Clinical Scenario: Abstinence During the initial screening for alcohol misuse, ask about earlier alcohol use even if the older adult reports that he or she does not drink at all. The older adult may have always abstained from alcohol, identify as being in recovery, or have stopped drinking for health-related reasons, which is common as people age. The following clinical scenario shows the importance of asking about earlier alcohol use when deciding which treatment to offer. Abstinence: An older adult reports no alcohol use in the past 3 years. Treatment Setting: Outpatient healthcare clinic Provider: Nurse practitioner (NP) Prevention/Treatment Strategies: Ask about earlier alcohol use; support abstinence using a brief problem-solving intervention. George is 76 years old and has been divorced for 5 years. He recently moved to a retirement community near his oldest daughter. He goes to see a new primary care provider for an initial medical exam. As part of the health history questionnaire, which includes the AUDIT, George says that he does not currently drink, but he was injured earlier because of his drinking. His primary care provider reviews George's questionnaire and Chapter 4 117 TIP 26 sees that George does not meet the AUDIT criteria for alcohol misuse but fags the item about alcohol-related injury. During the clinical interview, the provider asks about an item on the AUDIT in a curious, nonjudgmental way. The NP says, \"I noticed on the health questionnaire that you may have been injured after drinking. Can you tell me more about that?\" George says that he used to drink from time to time, but 3 years ago he twisted his ankle badly after having a couple of drinks and had to use a walker for several weeks. He tells the NP that he decided not to drink at all because he didn't want to risk any more injuries. The NP praises his commitment to his health and urges him to continue to avoid drinking. George feels comfortable opening up to the NP and says that since he moved to the retirement community, he has participated in a lot of social activities with alcohol. He likes socializing but feels uncomfortable when people offer him drinks all the time. He says, \"I know they are just being friendly, but sometimes they just don't give up.\" George states that he does not want to drink but does want to keep going to the social activities. The NP uses brief problem-solving by asking George, \"How have you dealt with a challenge like this in the past?\" The NP then invites George to brainstorm some solutions to the current problem, including ideas from his earlier struggles. George decides that he can say \"no\" frmly and tell people that alcohol doesn't agree with him when they continue to urge him to drink. George states that he feels good about that solution and will try it out at the next social event. The NP writes a treatment note about George's chosen solution in the electronic medical record and gives him a copy, telling him that if this plan doesn't work to schedule a follow-up visit soon. Clinical Scenario: Low-Risk Drinking For many older adults, the relationship with their primary care provider is often one of their strongest and most stable. The annual physical is a chance to screen for alcohol misuse and any changes in alcohol use related to life events, such as a death in the immediate family. The following Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults REMINDER ABOUT DRINKING IN RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES Hazardous drinking may be more common among older adults in age-separated residential settings (e.g., continuing care and planned retirement communities) than community-dwelling older adults. A recent survey reported that 15.4 percent of people who took the survey and live in a large retirement community had hazardous drinking compared with around 10 percent in the general older adult population. 790 Although older adults in these settings may drink to cope with problems, they usually drink because they want to socialize, and they believe that their peers affect their drinking. 791 Avoiding alcohol in these settings can be a challenge for older adults. scenario addresses the importance of conducting an annual screen for alcohol misuse with older adults and shows how to actively link clients to a referral for grief counseling and care coordination. Low-Risk Drinking: An older adult drinks within recommended guidelines and has no co-occurring physical or mental illness that limits daily functioning. Treatment Setting: Integrated outpatient medical and behavioral health clinic Providers: Primary care provider (PCP); licensed clinical social worker Prevention/Treatment Strategies: Screen for alcohol misuse, depression, and stressors that may put the older adult at risk for increased alcohol use; supply information on drinking guidelines for older adults; offer a menu of options for addressing grief; coordinate follow-up care. Lily is 80 years old. Her husband of 60 years died 6 months ago. Lily goes to her doctor for her annual physical. Her PCP tells Lily that she is sorry to hear about her husband's death. They talk for a few minutes about how she is doing and what kinds of recreational activities and social support she has in her life right now. Lily tells her PCP that she belongs to the local church and is still active 118 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults in volunteer activities there. Her son and her granddaughter live nearby and visit on a regular basis. She goes to an arts and crafts class on Wednesday afternoons at the local senior center. The PCP then tells Lily that she wants to ask her a few more questions about her health, including alcohol use, if that is okay with her. Lily feels comfortable talking with her PCP and agrees. The PCP mixes in questions from both the AUDIT and the SMAST-G with her general health questions. Lily says that she drinks one 5-ounce glass of white wine two to three times a week (an AUDIT score of three) and sometimes has another drink when she feels lonely (an SMAST-G score of one), but she has not used more alcohol since her husband died. She says, \"If I drink too much, I feel lightheaded, and I worry that I'll fall and break something.\" The PCP offers information on drinking guidelines and praises Lily for staying within those guidelines. The PCP then tells her that sometimes when older people lose a spouse, they may start drinking a bit more when they feel sad or lonely or they may simply lose track of how much they are drinking. The PCP tells Lily to call her if that happens. Lily says she will, then states, \"You know, I have been feeling a bit blue in the past few weeks, and I haven't been sleeping well. I really miss him.\" The PCP follows up on Lily's statement by saying, \"It seems like you are keeping busy and have a lot of good support in your life. At the same time, I am wondering if it would be helpful to have someone other than your family to talk to about how you have been feeling recently. I can suggest a few options if you are interested.\" Lily says that she doesn't like to burden her family and that talking to someone might be good. The PCP offers two suggestions: \"There is a grief support group at the same senior center where you take your arts and crafts class. Or, I can introduce you to a counselor right here at the clinic who knows a lot about helping folks with loss.\" Lily says she wouldn't feel comfortable talking in a group. The PCP describes the counselor with whom she would like Lily to talk. Lily agrees to meet her after the appointment with the PCP . The PCP also conducts an initial depression screening. The PCP arranges a follow-up phone call for Lily from the nurse care manager who will coordinate care with the PCP and the counselor. The PCP then walks Lily over to the licensed clinical social worker at the clinic and does a \"warm handoff.\" The licensed clinical social worker talks briefy with Lily, gives her a large-print handout that explains the grieving process, and schedules a follow-up visit that includes a depression assessment. (See the Chapter 4 Appendix for a large-print handout on grief for older adults.) Clinical Scenario: Moderate-Risk Drinking All too often, spouses of people who misuse alcohol drink as a shared social activity with their spouse. For older spouses, this can easily turn into their own health risk behavior, particularly if, to reduce the stress of being a caregiver, they take medication that negatively interacts with alcohol. The following scenario focuses on the importance of assessing family members' alcohol and medication use while at the same time addressing their needs as caregivers. Moderate-Risk Drinking: An older adult drinks above recommended limits while also taking a sedating medication. Treatment Setting: Outpatient behavioral health program Provider: Behavioral health service provider (provider) Prevention/Treatment Strategies: Supply information about drinking guidelines; screen for anxiety; give information about risks for alcohol and medication use; explore strategies for family members to address the spouse's drinking and to address caregiver needs. Rose is 69 years old. She is married to Ed, who is 78 years old. Ed drinks heavily daily, has a history of bipolar disorder, and recently was diagnosed with early-stage dementia. Ed sees the same PCP as Rose and also sees a psychiatrist for medication management for bipolar disorder. Rose is growing more worried about Ed's drinking and is unsure of how to take care of him as his dementia worsens. Chapter 4 119 TIP 26Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Rose calls an outpatient behavioral treatment program after a friend of hers tells Rose that she is worried about Rose's health. The friend also recommends a counselor she had seen there. At the initial appointment, the provider assesses Rose's substance use. Rose reports that she drinks one to three standard glasses of wine about three to four times a week when she and Ed go out to dinner or to social events. She also tells the counselor that she takes a benzodiazepine prescribed by her PCP about one to two times a week when she can't sleep. Rose states, \"When Ed drinks at night, he becomes aggressive and sometimes gets very confused. I worry about him so much that I can't get to sleep.\" The counselor acknowledges Rose's distress about Ed's drinking, then asks her if it would be okay to talk with her briefy about her drinking and use of benzodiazepines. Rose agrees. The counselor offers this personalized feedback to Rose: \"Based on what you have told me about your own drinking, it looks like you are drinking over the recommended guidelines on the days you have more than one drink a day. Also, you may not be aware that the sleep medication you are taking can increase the depressant effect of alcohol in your body and could put you at risk for oversedation, memory loss, and even overdose if you forget how much you had to drink or mistakenly take too many pills.\" The counselor asks Rose what she makes of this information. Rose says, \"I had no idea that drinking and taking sleep medication might be so dangerous. It also makes me think that I might not be helping Ed with controlling his drinking if I drink with him.\" After exploring possible strategies to address her own health risks, Rose decides that she will stop drinking completely while she is taking the sleep medication and tell Ed why she can't drink with him when they go out. The counselor supports Rose's decision and suggests that one way she can help Ed is to fnd positive recreational activities that they can share without drinking. Rose becomes excited and says she can think of several things they can do together that they both enjoy without drinking, like going to lectures at the local senior adult education program. The counselor then asks Rose to tell her more about her diffculties with worry and sleep, and conducts an anxiety screening. They also explore self-care strategies for managing worry and getting to sleep. Rose decides she can tell Ed that she is going to sleep in another room if he is up late and has been drinking. The counselor then teaches Rose a relaxation exercise she can do before bed, and Rose practices it in the session. Rose agrees to talk with her doctor about less risky medication for sleep. RESOURCE ALERT: OLDER ADULTS AND SLEEP The National Institute on Aging has a webpage with information and useful tips for helping older adults get a good night's sleep (www.nia.nih.gov/ health/good-nights-sleep). The counselor shifts the conversation to what further support Rose may need to address Ed's drinking while taking care of herself. Rose identifes her PCP and Ed's psychiatrist as potential supports. She states that Ed has given permission for her to talk with both. The counselor suggests she ask both to discuss Ed's drinking with him, state frmly that Ed should not drink at all, and then put their recommendations in writing. Both Ed and Rose can then refer to the recommendations instead of getting into an argument about his drinking. Rose likes this idea and feels confdent that she can express her concerns to both of Ed's providers and ask for their help in addressing Ed's alcohol misuse. The counselor explores other self-care and recovery strategies with Rose, including Al-Anon and a dementia caregiver support group. Rose is not sure that she wants to try Al-Anon but then agrees to talk with a peer recovery support specialist the counselor knows at the local recovery community center who is Rose's age and helps family members. The counselor sets up a series of sessions with Rose. She will continue to track Rose's drinking, benzodiazepine use, and strategies for self-care. 120 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Clinical Scenario: High-Risk Drinking Older adults may not know that their drinking is negatively affecting their physical and mental health. The following scenario focuses on the importance of screening for alcohol misuse in settings where older adults are being treated for mental disorders and shows how a brief intervention focused on alcohol use can improve physical and mental health. High-Risk Drinking: An older adult drinks above recommended limits, including binge drinks, and has a co-occurring mental disorder (depression) and health condition (high blood pressure). Treatment Setting: Hospital-based mental health clinic Provider: Geriatric psychiatrist Prevention/Treatment Strategies: Supply feedback on AUDIT score; give information about the risks of taking medications for depression and high blood pressure while drinking; offer nonjudgmental advice about abstaining from alcohol use; continue to watch alcohol and medication use. Carl is 68 years old. His PCP refers him to a geriatric psychiatrist for medication management of his major depression. Carl currently takes one tricyclic antidepressant\u2014which, when taken with alcohol, increases his risk for oversedation and low blood pressure\u2014and a blood pressure medication, which can lower his blood pressure even more. The psychiatrist gives Carl the clinical interview version of the AUDIT as part of the initial psychiatric evaluation. Carl's score on the AUDIT is a 9 and includes positive responses to daily drinking and binge drinking about once a month. The psychiatrist offers Carl nonjudgmental feedback about his AUDIT score and says that Carl's drinking may be worsening both his depression and his high blood pressure. At frst, Carl makes light of his drinking by saying, \"I really don't drink that much. And besides, I have been drinking the same amount for years, and it's never been a problem before.\" The psychiatrist acknowledges Carl's mixed feelings, then asks if he would be interested in more information. After Carl agrees, the psychiatrist describes the health risks of drinking while taking antidepressants and blood pressure medication, stating in a nonjudgmental, factual tone that alcohol can keep his medications from working correctly. He also states that the type of antidepressant Carl is taking can lead to low blood pressure when he drinks, especially when taken with his blood pressure medication, and can cause harmful effects like increased depression, dizziness, and fatigue. Carl responds, \"Now that you mention it, I have noticed feeling very tired in the afternoon. I really don't like feeling that way. It's like the depression is getting worse.\" The psychiatrist supports Carl's ability to make his own decisions, then gives him clear advice: \"Although it is up to you in the end, I think that in your situation you are better off not drinking at all while you are being treated for depression and high blood pressure. What do you think you would like to do about the drinking?\" Carl agrees to stop drinking to see whether abstinence improves his health. The psychiatrist supports Carl's decision; summarizes their conversation; writes out a brief alcohol use agreement that supports Carl's decision to remain abstinent but also tracks his alcohol use if he does drink; and schedules a follow-up visit in a month. (See the Chapter 4 Appendix for an alcohol use agreement and drinking tracking cards.) At the next visit, Carl says that his depression has gotten better and that he no longer feels tired or gets dizzy. Carl says that he wants to continue not drinking because he feels so much better. The psychiatrist supports Carl's efforts to avoid drinking and, after discussion with Carl, prescribes a different antidepressant medication for him. In future medication management visits, the psychiatrist tracks Carl's depression, his response to the new medication, his blood pressure, and his success in avoiding alcohol. Clinical Scenario: AUD Older adults with a long history of heavy drinking, multiple past periods of treatment, or co-occurring mental disorders often need medically supervised withdrawal and age-sensitive, age-specifc treatment to address multiple co-occurring Chapter 4 121 TIP 26 conditions at the same time. This scenario focuses on age-specifc treatment, RPT, and recovery support for an older adult with AUD and co-occurring disorders. AUD: An older adult has a long history of heavy drinking and meets criteria for AUD. Treatment Setting: Inpatient detox and rehabilitation program Provider: Licensed alcohol and drug counselor on a multidisciplinary treatment team Treatment Strategies: Offer CBT, RPT adapted for older adults, trauma-informed counseling strategies to address emotional dysregulation, and recovery management strategies. Barb is 72 years old and enters an inpatient treatment program after her three adult children intervene. She has a long history of heavy drinking and brief periods of treatment followed by a return to drinking. Barb has been married four times and was recently divorced from her fourth husband. She has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and binge eating disorder, for which she had gastric bypass surgery. This is her fourth treatment for AUD. Her pattern of returning to drinking tends to happen when she is having diffcult relationships, intense emotions, and traumatic stress reactions. Barb is carefully watched throughout detoxifcation at the facility; she is then transferred to the rehabilitation program, which includes an age-specifc track for older adults. Barb's primary counselor offers relapse prevention approaches, which are focused on identifying and managing relapse triggers. Barb's CBT counseling focuses on strategies to address the communication issues between Barb and her daughter and to help her identify and replace negative automatic thoughts about drinking triggered by relationship problems. For example, when Barb's daughter criticizes her, Barb feels ashamed. Barb replaces the negative thought, \"I drink because I can't stand to feel ashamed\" with a more positive thought, \"I can stand to feel shame for a while, until the urge to drink goes away.\" Barb's group counseling at the older adult program includes focused topic groups for older adults, relapse prevention coping skills groups, and a DBT group. The DBT group teaches her mindfulness Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults skills for distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and effective interpersonal interactions. With permission, Barb's counselor keeps contact with her family. They attend family group sessions, too. During an individual session, Barb and her counselor discuss her improvement in treatment. The counselor opens the conversation: \"I know this is your fourth time in treatment. How would you say this time has been different for you?\" Barb says, \"I really like the group discussions on topics that are important to me at this stage in my life. Staying here for such a long time has helped a lot, too. I needed the extra time to let all this information about recovery and all the skills I have learned really sink in.\" Near the end of her time at the treatment facility, Barb's counselor actively links her to a continuing care group and individual outpatient counseling at an addiction treatment program in her community, as well as women's and senior-friendly AA meetings. Staying in treatment longer allows Barb to improve her emotional regulation, work on relapse prevention, and improve her interpersonal skills in a safe, supportive place. It also helps her get connected to community-based support before she ends treatment. RESOURCE ALERT: DBT DBT, a variation of CBT, was developed for adult women with chronic suicidal behavior who meet the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder. 792,793 More recently, adaptations of DBT skills training have been shown to help adults with borderline personality disorder and SUDs, adults with binge eating disorder, older adults with depression, and family caregivers of older adults with dementia. 794,795 DBT uses mindfulness practices and helps people manage overwhelming emotions. This skill-building approach shows promise in treating older adults with emotional dysregulation and poor interpersonal skills. For more information about DBT, the latest research, and training opportunities, go to the website of the Behavioral Research and Therapy Clinics at the University of Washington (http:// depts.washington.edu/uwbrtc/ ). 122 Chapter 4 TIP 26 Chapter 4\u2014Treating Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults Summary As older adults' levels of alcohol use and related risk of negative health effects increase, more complex and intense interventions are needed. MI and adaptations of CBT (including PST and RPT) are useful in brief interventions and long-term treatment. Whichever strategy you use, take a nonconfrontational, age-sensitive approach when working with older adults with alcohol misuse, including AUD. Ongoing recovery management strategies increase the chance that improvements will continue over time and not only help older adults reduce negative alcohol-related health and mental health outcomes, but also help improve their quality of life.

This includes: Acknowledging your pain. Accepting that grief can bring up many different and unexpected feelings. Understanding that your grieving process will be unique to you. Seeking out face-to-face support from people who care about you. Supporting yourself emotionally by taking care of yourself physically. Learning the difference between grief and depression. The Grieving Process Grieving is highly individual; there's no right or wrong way to grieve. The grieving process takes time. Healing happens gradually; it can't be forced or hurried\u2014and there is no \"normal\" timetable for grieving. Some people start to feel better in weeks or months. For others, the grieving process is measured in years. Whatever grief is like for you, it's important to be patient with yourself and allow the process to naturally unfold.

TIP 26TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN OLDER ADULTS Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults KEY MESSAGES Illicit drug use and prescription medication misuse do occur in older adults, but they are treatable. Regular screening and assessment can help you learn whether an older client is struggling with drug use or prescription medication misuse. Education and brief interventions are often enough to help older adults prevent, reduce, or stop drug use and prescription medication misuse. Most older clients who use illicit drugs or misuse prescription medication do not need care from programs or providers that specialize in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Age-specifc and age-sensitive treatments are useful in reducing drug use and prescription medication misuse and related health risks. These treatments are designed to meet the special physical, cognitive, and social needs of older individuals. For many older adults, these adaptations can make all the difference in helping them start, stay in, and beneft from treatment. Chapter 5 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will beneft healthcare, behavioral health service, and social service providers who work with older adults (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners [NPs], physician assistants, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, drug and alcohol counselors, peer recovery support specialists). It addresses drug use, prescription medication misuse, and SUDs other than alcohol use disorder among older adults. Prescription medications are some of the most commonly misused substances in this population, 803 and rates of substance misuse in general are increasing. These increases result, in part, from the size of the aging baby boomer generation (those born from 1946 to 1964) and the fact that baby boomers are living longer and have higher rates of lifetime substance misuse, including SUDs, than past generations. Many older adults who misuse substances do not need specialized SUD treatment. Prevention strategies and brief interventions are often enough. Even so, research shows that older adults do beneft from addiction treatment. 804,805,806 In fact, older adults in addiction treatment programs are more likely than younger adults to complete treatment, and older adults have nearly as good or better outcomes. 807,808 Thus, as the older population in the United States grows, the need for a full range of treatment approaches that meet the unique requirements of older adults will continue to increase. Organization of Chapter 5 of This TIP This chapter of TIP 26 addresses rates of drug use and prescription medication misuse, including drug use disorders, among older adults as well as treatment and recovery management approaches that meet older adults' specifc needs. The frst section of Chapter 5 describes illicit drug use and prescription medication misuse, including drug use disorders, among older adults. Defnitions and facts are discussed as well as the physical, mental, social, and economic effects of drug use disorders. The second section describes how to identify, screen, and assess for drug use disorders in older adults. The parts of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) are discussed, along with specifc tips for screening older adults. 131 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults The third section describes the continuum of care for older adults with drug use disorders, which ranges from brief interventions for prescription medication misuse to inpatient detoxifcation and rehabilitation for older adults with drug use disorders. The fourth section discusses specifc treatment approaches for older adults with drug use disorders. These approaches include acute care, overdose treatment, medically supervised withdrawal, medication maintenance therapy, psychosocial approaches, age-specifc treatment options, referral management, and care coordination. The ffth section provides an overview of recovery management strategies for older EXHIBIT 5.1. Key Terms adults with drug use disorders. It covers topics such as family member involvement in treatment and linking older adults to evidence-supported, community-based recovery support groups such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). The sixth section provides clinical scenarios. This section uses clinical case material to show how to apply approaches and strategies discussed in Chapter 5 to older clients. The seventh section identifes targeted resources to support your practice. A more detailed resource guide is in Chapter 9 of this TIP . For defnitions of key terms you will see throughout Chapter 5, refer to Exhibit 5.1. Addiction*: The most severe form of SUD, associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Age-sensitive: Adaptations to existing treatment approaches that accommodate older adults' unique needs (e.g., a large-print handout on the signs of substance misuse). Age-specifc: Treatment approaches and practices specifcally developed for older adults (e.g., an older adult specialty group in a mixed-age SUD treatment program). Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living (ADLs), including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 809 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Diversion: A medical and legal term describing the illegal sharing of a legally prescribed, controlled medication (e.g., an opioid) with another individual. Drug-drug interaction: The interaction of one substance (e.g., alcohol, medication, an illicit drug) with another substance. Drug-drug interactions may change the effectiveness of medications, introduce or alter the intensity of side effects, and increase a substance's toxicity or the concentration of that substance in a person's blood. Potentially serious interactions can also occur with certain foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. 810 Drug use: The full range of severity of illicit drug use, from a single instance of use to meeting criteria for a drug use disorder. Illicit substances: Illicit substances include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and prescription medications that are taken other than as prescribed (e.g., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives). Continued on next page 132 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults Continued Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches or peer recovery support specialists), mutual-help groups consist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no offcial connection to treatment programs. Most are self-supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as AA and NA are the most widespread and well researched type of mutual-help groups, other groups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affliated with a religion or church (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART [Self-Management and Recovery Training] Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Peer support: The use of peer recovery support specialists (e.g., someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training) to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Prescription medication misuse: The full range of severity of problematic use of prescription medication (meaning using a medication to feel good, using more than prescribed or in a way not prescribed, or using medication prescribed to someone else), from mild misuse to meeting criteria for an SUD. Psychoactive substances: Substances that can alter mental processes (e.g., cognition or affect; in other words, the way one thinks or feels). Also called psychotropic drugs, such substances will not necessarily produce dependence, but they have the potential for misuse or abuse. 811 Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When those positive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, pro-social feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder. The ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defnes remission as present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving). 812 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to DSM-5, 813 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function, and by impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions of DSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerly called substance dependence. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction. surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Chapter 5 133 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse Among Older Adults Drug use and prescription medication misuse are growing problems among older adults. In the next decade, approximately 20 percent of the U.S. population will be over age 65. 814 As the large baby boomer population ages up, drug use and prescription medication misuse will likely increase. This group has higher rates of illicit drug use than past generations, 815,816 and their misuse of pain medication and other prescription medication is signifcant. Taking opioids for pain is one pathway to drug use or prescription medication misuse for older adults. They may start taking opioids for pain and become physically dependent. Other than alcohol and tobacco, the most commonly misused substances among older adults are psychoactive prescription medications, such as opioids and benzodiazepines (i.e., medications for sleep, pain, and anxiety). Research shows that older adults also use cannabis, cocaine, and heroin. For example, past-year cannabis use by older adults increased from 2006 to 2013 by 57.8 percent for adults ages 50 to 64 and by 250 percent for adults ages 65 and older. 817 Drug use and prescription medication misuse can lead to many negative health outcomes for older adults, such as: Increased risk of injury and falls. Problems with thinking (also called cognitive impairment). Harmful drug-drug interactions. Prescribed medication is not always misused on purpose. Older adults: Can accidentally take more of a prescribed medication than they meant to. Can accidentally mix up medications. May not know the potential risk of harmful effects of using certain substances (e.g., over-the-counter [OTC] medications, dietary supplements) while taking medication, even when taking it as prescribed. Overdose, which can be fatal. Suicide. Liver and heart disease. Sleep problems. Drug use and prescription medication misuse have negative economic effects. They cost the United States billions of dollars each year, including $193 billion for illicit substances in 2007 818 (the last year in which those numbers were reported) and $78.5 billion for prescription opioids in 2013 819 (the last year in which those numbers were reported). Drug use and prescription medication misuse also lead to greater healthcare costs. Older adults already use more healthcare resources than younger adults. As older adults with drug use disorders age, they are at an increased risk of co-occurring medical conditions, which means they will use more healthcare services. 820,821,822 Drug use and prescription medication misuse among older adults negatively affect relationships, families, and friends. Many family members, friends, and caregivers recognize but minimize drug use or prescription medication misuse among older adults. Well-meaning family and friends may assume that drug use and prescription medication misuse in older adults cannot be treated, especially if the behavior has been going on for a while. They may feel that the time for treatment has passed or that previous attempts at treatment make trying again pointless. 823,824 Often, friends and family view the use of certain substances by older adults as one of their \"last pleasures\" or distractions in life. 825 Ageist, incorrect beliefs about drug use and prescription medication misuse among older adults can prevent older adults from getting treatment. Treatment access for older adults is key, as research increasingly shows that SUD treatment for older adults can reduce or stop drug use and prescription medication misuse and improve health/ quality of life. 826,827,828,829,830 Prescription Medication Misuse Prescription medication misuse includes: Taking larger doses of a medication than prescribed. Changing the dose without guidance from the prescriber. 134 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults Taking a medication for reasons other than its intended purpose. Taking someone else's medications. Older adults are prescribed and use more medication than any other age group. From 2015 to 2016: 831 An estimated 87.5 percent of adults ages 65 and older took at least one prescription medication in the past 30 days, versus 67.4 percent of adults ages 45 to 64 and 35.3 percent of those ages 18 to 44. Adults ages 65 and older were the largest group of people taking fve or more prescription medications in the past 30 days (39.8 percent) compared with adults ages 45 to 64 (19.1 percent) and adults ages 18 to 44 (3.9 percent). Age-related changes to metabolism and body fat affect the medication dosage that older adults need and increase the risk of older adults feeling negative effects of medication. For example, older adults are very likely to feel memory-related and psychomotor effects of benzodiazepines and opioids. Also, older adults have a higher rate of co-occurring conditions than do younger adults, which means they take more medication and are more likely to experience harmful drug-drug, alcohol-drug, and drug-co-occurring condition interactions. 832,833 Providers face challenges when prescribing for older adults in general and need to exercise extra caution. One challenge is that a medication may not have a recommended dosage for older adults, in which case providers should prescribe the minimum dosage needed to achieve a positive outcome. Prescribers also need to think about what formulation of a medication will work best for an older patient and what dosing schedule will be easiest to follow. Yet another common challenge is that older patients may be taking unnecessary medication given their specifc clinical conditions. Such medication should be discontinued, consulting with the patient and using tapering as appropriate. 834,835 Also, some medications are potentially inappropriate for older adults: see the Chapter 6 text box on the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria \u00ae. Younger people tend to misuse psychoactive prescription medication for mood effects (i.e., wanting to feel very happy or euphoric), but older adults tend to develop drug use disorders because they are using drugs or misusing prescription medication to treat their chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and sleep issues. 836,837,838 Opioids The United States is facing an opioid use and overdose crisis. (See SAMHSA's TIP 63, Medications for Opioid Use Disorder, for more information; https://store.samhsa.gov/product/ TIP-63-Medications-for-Opioid-Use-Disorder-Full-Document/PEP20-02-01-006). The years 2006 to 2013 saw an increase in calls to U.S. poison control centers about older adults' misuse of prescription opioids, including misuse of prescription opioids for self-harm. 839 Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons for taking medication. Older adults have the highest rate of chronic pain of any age group, 840 leading to more clinic visits and increased prescribing of opioid medication. Older adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) and chronic pain may have a hard time accepting that they have OUD. Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam) are mainly used to treat sleep and anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines are thought to be safer than barbiturates and nonbarbiturate sedative-hypnotics. 841 However, the physical dependence potential for benzodiazepines is very high. Long-term use or misuse of benzodiazepines in older adults has many risks. Results from more than 68 clinical trials show that benzodiazepines, no matter how long they are used (either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting) can lead to cognitive impairment. The greater the dose, the greater the impairment. 842 Chapter 5 135 TIP 26 Many older adults experience adverse drug reactions because they are managing numerous prescribed medications (sometimes from multiple prescribing physicians). Adverse drug reactions are not necessarily the result of intentional or accidental misuse; rather, they result from complying with a dangerous regimen of drugs. Multiple Medications The aging process causes changes to the body that increase the chances of older adults feeling negative effects of medication. For example, older adults have decreased ability to metabolize drugs. Older adults often take more than one medication. 843 Negative effects are more likely to occur when older adults take many OTC or prescription medications. 844 Taking more than one medication that affects the central nervous system (CNS) increases the risk of: 845 Problems with daily functioning. Cognitive impairment. Falls. Death. Coprescribing of opioid and benzodiazepine medications is a concern. The risk of death increases with the dose of benzodiazepine prescribed. 846 In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Drug Safety Communication warning about serious risks, including respiratory depression and death, from combining opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol), and requiring boxed warnings for prescription opioids and benzodiazepines. FDA also cautioned that healthcare professionals \"should limit prescribing opioid pain medicines with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants only to patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. If these medicines are prescribed together, limit the dosages and duration of each drug to the minimum possible while achieving the desired clinical effect.\" FDA further advised healthcare professionals to screen these patients for SUDs, plus listed other precautions. 847 Note that even greater caution should be used with older patients because of their higher risk of experiencing negative effects from medication. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults FDA in 2017 advised against withholding buprenorphine or methadone treatment for OUD from patients taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, but recommended careful medication management of these patients. Although combining these OUD medications with CNS depressants increases the risk of serious side effects, FDA noted that this risk can be outweighed by the risk and harm of untreated OUD. 848 For strategies on caring for these patients, see the FDA Drug Safety Communication at www.fda. gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-urges-caution-about-withholding-opioid-addiction-medications and the section \"Concurrent Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) Benzodiazepines or Alcohol\" in SAMHSA's TIP 63 (https://store.samhsa.gov/ product/TIP-63-Medications-for-Opioid-Use-Disorder-Full-Document/PEP20-02-01-006). Again, keep in mind the need for using extra caution with older patients. Illicit Substances Illicit substances include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and prescription medications that are taken other than as prescribed (e.g., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives). Because federal law bans the recreational and medical use of cannabis, this publication considers it an illicit substance (although in some states, medical use of cannabis is legal and in others, both recreational and medical use are legal). In 2019, 3.7 million adults ages 65 and older had used illicit substances in the past year. 849 Of these drugs, older adults most commonly used:850 Cannabis: 2.6 million adults. Prescription pain relievers: 900,000 adults. Tranquilizers or sedatives: 325,000 adults. From 2000 to 2012, SUD treatment admissions for illicit substance use increased for adults ages 55 or older. 851 Rates of cannabis use among older adults are likely to continue rising. This is a major concern as baby boomers, who tend to be more accepting of cannabis use than previous generations, enter 136 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults 3.7 MILLION ADULTS ages 65 and older used ILLICIT SUBSTANCES in 2019. 900K 2.6M 325K Cannabis Prescription Tranquilizers or Pain Relievers Sedatives the later stages of life. From 2000 to 2019, the percentage of adults ages 50 to 64 who had ever used cannabis increased from approximately 24 percent to around 54 percent. 852,853 The effects of using cannabis while also taking specifc prescription medications are not known. However, cannabis use is related to an increased risk of injury and short-term memory problems. Cannabis affects central and peripheral nervous system processes in ways such as: 854,855,856,857 Increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Increasing problems with cognition and learning. Worsening motor coordination (i.e., the ability to use and control muscle movements). Moreover, the increasing potency of cannabis in recent decades may make cannabis use riskier. 858 Screening and Assessment If you think a client might be using drugs or misusing prescription medication, screening measures will help you identify and address this behavior. 859 Screening older adults for drug use and prescription medication misuse and providing education about health risks related to interactions between prescribed medication, alcohol, and illicit substances are prevention strategies you can use in many different settings. Screen and assess older adults for substance use and co-occurring medical and mental disorders (e.g., cognitive impairment) that can mask SUDs or appear similar to SUDs. CO-OCCURRING CONDITIONS AMONG OLDER ADULTS Older adults with SUDs have high rates of mental disorders and co-occurring health conditions. In 2019, an estimated 36.8 percent of adults older than age 50 with SUDs also had mental disorders. 860 Co-occurring mental disorders and SUDs among older adults are probably underdiagnosed, so the rates of co-occurring disorders (CODs) may actually be higher. 861 Compared with older adults who have only an SUD or a mental disorder, those with both are at risk for: 862,863 Higher rates of inpatient and outpatient behavioral healthcare service use. Thoughts of suicide and of death in general. Certain physical conditions related to substance misuse (e.g., heart disease, organ damage, some cancers). Given high rates of CODs in older adults with SUDs, you should use holistic, detailed approaches to screening, assessment, and treatment. Screening Strategies To successfully make routine screening for drug use disorders a part of your clinical practice with older adults, use simple, consistent approaches that can be added to screening practices you already have in place. Screening questions can be asked verbally, on paper, or electronically. Make sure print is large enough for older adults to read easily. Ask about drug use: 864 In a straightforward and nonjudgmental manner. While asking about other health behaviors (e.g., exercise, weight, smoking, alcohol use). While keeping the focus on helping clients improve their overall health, functioning, independence, and quality of life. Screen adults ages 60 and older: Yearly, as part of the annual checkup in both healthcare and behavioral health service settings. When changes in physical or mental health status occur (e.g., falls, memory issues). Chapter 5 137 TIP 26 During major life events or changes (e.g., retirement, moving, loss of a signifcant person). The consensus panel recommends screening all adults ages 60 and older yearly and when life changes occur (e.g., retirement, loss of a partner or spouse, changes in health). Several measures can help you screen for substance misuse, but few are validated (tested and approved for use) with older adults. 865 (See Chapter 3 of this TIP for an indepth discussion of substance use screening tools that can be used with older adults.) One option is to use screening questions developed for the general adult population. For example, open your conversation with older clients by asking, \"Have you taken a prescription medication differently than prescribed by your healthcare provider?\" You can also use a single-question screener for drug use, such as, \"How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or taken a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?\" 866 If the client says \"yes\" to the frst question or answers the second question with one or more, begin more indepth screening. Indepth screening includes asking clients about: Use of prescription and OTC medications. Use of other substances (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, tobacco). Amount/frequency of past-month substance use. Effects of using substances. Concerns about their substance use as well as concerns of family members or friends. RESOURCE ALERT: NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE- MODIFIED ALCOHOL, SMOKING, AND SUBSTANCE INVOLVEMENT SCREENING TEST This screening tool (www.drugabuse.gov/sites/ default/fles/pdf/nmassist.pdf ) offers a helpful way to organize your questions about types of substances used, lifetime and recent amount and frequency of substances used, and substance use concerns. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults SCREENING FOR USE OF MULTIPLE MEDICATIONS: A BROWN BAG MEDICINE REVIEW Older adults often take a number of prescribed medications as well as OTC medications and dietary supplements. As part of an annual physical, or given signs that the older client is misusing medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids), urge the client (or a family member, with consent) to bring in all prescribed and OTC medications and dietary supplements in a bag so that you and the client can review them together. This is known as a \"brown bag medicine review.\" This is a chance to discuss the health risks of taking multiple medications, of drug- drug interactions, and of misuse. 867,868 Brown bag medicine reviews can improve client reporting of medication use and improve provider-client discussions about medication use. 869 When using verbal, electronic, or printed screeners: Be empathetic and nonconfrontational. Make the screening questions easy to understand. Speak clearly and repeat instructions or questions as needed, especially if the client has cognitive impairment or problems with vision or hearing. Make sure the client can hear and understand you. Use large type for printed questions and screen reader-friendly adaptations for computer screening. Ask questions about the client's illicit substance use or prescription medication misuse as a part of assessing overall health status. Assess and reassess if the client is having problems using a computer, tablet, or writing on a printed form. If needed, offer a verbal interview in which you read the screening questions. Assessment and Diagnosis of Drug Use Disorders Screening is the frst step in performing an indepth assessment of substance misuse. Some signs of drug use disorders in older adults may be mistaken for symptoms of co-occurring 138 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults LINKING SCREENING QUESTIONS ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE TO HEALTH STATUS You can help older adults understand the reason for your asking substance use questions by giving them information about age-related changes in metabolism and how specifc medications, such as sedatives and antianxiety medications, can negatively interact with alcohol. You can also help older adults understand the relationship between substance use and health outcomes by discussing their substance use and other health problems, such as falls, high blood pressure, and depression. medical or mental disorders. Using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria alone may underdiagnose older adults who have drug use-related and prescription medication misuse-related health and functioning problems. This can keep clients from getting needed treatment. A full assessment should include questions about a client's: History of substance use (including alcohol andtobacco use). Age at which substance misuse issues began.Amount and frequency of substance use. Current prescription medications, OTCmedications, and dietary supplements. Co-occurring medical conditions. Relationship between substance use and dailyfunctioning. Co-occurring mental disorders, particularlydepression and anxiety. Use of substances to cope with sleep problems,depression, anxiety, stress, or pain. Management of daily medication regimens. Note any signs that clients may be under the infuence of substances. Although clients who appear to be so may give incomplete answers, current infuence of substances is by itself a clear sign that further assessment and intervention are needed. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria A formal SUD diagnosis is based on your client meeting 2 out of 11 DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, some of the physical and social factors described in DSM-5 may not apply to older adults because of age-related changes in tolerance to substances, cognitive functioning, role responsibilities, or social isolation. 870 Exhibit 5.2 summarizes the physical, mental, and social aspects of aging you should consider when using these criteria to diagnose SUD in older adults. EXHIBIT 5.2. DSM-5 Criteria for SUD and Considerations for Older Adults DSM-5 CRITERIA FOR SUD871 CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS872,873,874 Criterion 1 Older adults may need less of a substance to feel its physical effects. In addition to age-related or co-occurring medical-related decline in cognitive functioning, use of many substances can increase cognitive impairment and the ability to keep track of the amount and frequency of substance use. Criterion 2 This is the same as in the general adult population. There are no special considerations for older adults. Continued on next page Chapter 5 139 TIP 26Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued DSM-5 CRITERIA FOR SUD CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS Criterion 3 Effects from substance use can occur from using relatively small amounts compared with the general adult population. Criterion 4 Although older adults may have cravings, they may not recognize substance cravings in the same way as the general adult population (e.g., cognitive decline may increase confusion about physiological cues related to craving). Criterion 5 Role responsibilities may be different for older adults because of life-stage changes, like retirement. Role responsibilities more common among older adults include caregiving for a spouse with a chronic illness and parenting a custodial grandchild. Criterion 6 Older adults may not realize their substance use is related to social or interpersonal problems. Criterion 7 Older adults may participate in fewer activities than younger adults, making it diffcult to know whether a reduction in activities is related to substance use. However, social isolation is related to substance use and should be noted and addressed. Criterion 8 Older adults may not understand that their use is harmful, especially when using substances in smaller amounts. Older adults may not identify certain situations (e.g., using a step stool or taking medications together) as physically dangerous. Criterion 9 Older adults may not realize their substance use is related to physical (e.g., gastrointestinal distress) or mental problems (e.g., anxiety). Criterion 10 Because of increased sensitivity to substances with age, older adults may have lowered rather than increased tolerance depending on the substance used. Criterion 11 Withdrawal symptoms among older adults can be less obvious and more drawn out. Older adults may not develop physical dependence if they started using the substance in late life; if prescribed and correctly using medications like benzodiazepines, they may develop physical dependence. Biopsychosocial Assessment and Placement The Level of Care Utilization System for Psychiatric and Addiction Services (LOCUS 20) is an assessment and placement tool that supports adoption of a systematic approach to these important steps in meeting the needs of older adults. The tool can be downloaded for free from www.communitypsychiatry.org/resources/locus. Continuum of Care The SUD treatment continuum of care has many points of intervention where older adults can receive services (Exhibit 5.3). Treatment for drug use disorders can be delivered in many different settings using behavioral and pharmacological methods. 140 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults EXHIBIT 5.3. SUD Treatment Continuum of Care PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION TREATMENT RECOVERY MANAGEMENT Address individual and environmental risk factors for substance use through science-informed prevention strategies aimed at individuals, families, and communities. Identify and screen for substance misuse; provide psychoeducation and brief interventions to reduce health risk; refer to treatment as needed. Adapted from material in the public domain.875 More than 14,500 specialized treatment facilities in the United States provide SUD services, such as:876 Counseling. Rehabilitation. Behavioral therapy. Case management. Medication therapy. Psychoeducation. Peer recovery support services. Early intervention for an older adult's drug use or prescription medication misuse can take place in a healthcare offce, a hospital, an emergency department (ED), an outpatient behavioral health clinic, or an older adult-focused social service Provide medication as needed, psychosocial interventions, and supportive services to achieve recovery and maximize functioning. Levels of Care: Outpatient Intensive outpatient/ partial hospitalization Residential/inpatient Medically managed intensive inpatient services Off er comprehensive discharge planning, referral management, continuing care, and linkage to community-based services (e.g., mutual-help groups; medical care; social, legal, educational, and fnancial services) that support ongoing recovery and improve wellness and quality of life. agency. Primary care providers (PCPs) are often the entry point for brief interventions and referral to drug use disorder-specifc treatment. Different levels of care include: Outpatient individual, group, and family counseling. Intensive outpatient care (i.e., daily or weekly individual and group counseling for many weeks/months). Residential care (i.e., 24-hour supervision and clinical monitoring). Medically managed inpatient care (i.e., treatment services in a medical or mental hospital setting). Chapter 5 141 TIP 26 When you work with clients to develop a treatment and recovery plan based on their preferences, as well as on the accessibility and appropriateness of the chosen treatment, clients are more likely to follow your recommendations. Unless clients present with active suicidal ideation, withdrawal risks, or an acute health concern (e.g., overdose, signifcant impairment, delirium, falls), let them choose their preferred treatment method. Offer options and discuss the benefts of each as they apply to each client. Recovery management, including discharge planning and continuing care, is an important part of the continuum of care. Older adults leaving intensive addiction treatment should: 877 Have routine medical care for co-occurring, chronic medical conditions. Be linked with older adult-focused, community-based services. Be introduced and referred to recovery groups to support their ongoing recovery but also to reduce isolation and loneliness, which are common among older adults. (See Chapter 7 of this TIP for more information about social isolation.) Treatment Approaches Suited to Older Adults Many safe and effective interventions exist for older adults who use drugs, misuse prescription medication, or have drug use disorders. You should approach decisions about treatment by considering: The drug being used or the prescription medication being misused. The level of care needed (e.g., brief intervention, detoxifcation, maintenance). Overdose prevention and treatments. Psychosocial approaches adapted to older adults. This section describes general approaches that work with older adults who misuse prescription medications and use illicit substances. It also describes treatment strategies for specifc kinds of substances. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults ENDING, CHANGING, OR CONTINUING TREATMENT878 Clients' progress in treatment, as gauged by clearly defned, agreed-upon goals, should determine their length of time in treatment. The main criterion for discharge is that clients have met treatment goals. If clients are making progress and that progress is likely to continue, treatment should continue. If clients cannot meet treatment goals or they develop new treatment-related challenges, they should receive recommendations for different types of services or treatments. SBIRT Many older adults who use illicit drugs or misuse prescription medication do not need specialized addiction treatment. Education is often enough to help older adults change their behaviors. Older adults often respond well to nonjudgmental, brief education about: Medications they are taking. Potential drug-drug interactions. Negative effects of using medications in ways other than as prescribed. SBIRT is an indepth approach to screening and brief intervention with older adults who may exhibit at-risk drug use, misuse of prescription medications, or use of illicit substances. 879 Screening helps you quickly assess the severity of drug use or prescription medication misuse and identifes the right type and intensity of treatment. The brief intervention focuses on helping older adults increase awareness of their drug use or prescription medication misuse and motivation for changing health risk behaviors. Referral to treatment secures access to assessment and treatment by providers who specialize in addiction, when needed. 880 Providers can implement SBIRT in many settings, including behavioral health service programs and healthcare clinics. 142 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults Chapter 3 offers indepth discussion of SBIRT, research on its usefulness, and adaptations for older adults. Treatment for OUD Opioid Overdose Treatment Because of physiological changes, older adults show higher blood concentrations of opioid metabolites. This results in greater substance potency, toxicity, and longer duration of action than in younger adults. 881,882 These factors may increase older adults' risk of opioid overdose, which should be treated as a life-threatening emergency. Follow recommended guidelines for naloxone administration, and offer overdose prevention education and emergency naloxone kits to clients, caregivers, and families in case of overdose. 883,884 Medically Supervised Opioid Withdrawal Older adults are likely to have intense opioid withdrawal symptoms, especially related to chronic pain. ACUTE CARE: MEDICAL STABILIZATION AND SUPERVISED MEDICAL WITHDRAWAL Individuals must be medically and mentally stabilized if they:885 Are acutely intoxicated. Are having an overdose. Are in withdrawal. Return to substance use. Acute inpatient treatment may also be needed for individuals who: Are frail. Have multiple addictions. Have suicidal ideation. Medically supervised withdrawal in a monitored or managed setting is recommended for older adults who have been taking high doses of a substance (e.g., opioids) or using for a long time. Inpatient treatment will ensure that individuals are medically monitored for a safe withdrawal process. This is especially important for older adults with co-occurring mental and medical conditions. Monitoring reduces risk of severe negative effects, including death, as older adults have more clinical risks related to withdrawal and medical stabilization. Medication To Treat OUD Three FDA-approved medications886 can treat OUD in older adults: Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine carries less risk for overdose than methadone.887,888 Buprenorphine's risk of respiratory depression or sedation is low, 889 and the medication doesn't produce the euphoria caused by heroin or synthetic opioids. Buprenorphine: -Is a good option for patients with repeated return to opioid use. -Is usually more convenient and cost-effective than methadone, because it can be provided in offce-based settings by qualifed physicians, NPs, physician assistants, and, until October 1, 2023, qualifed clinical nurse specialists, certifed registered nurse anesthetists, and certifed nurse midwives. -Is available as an implant, in sublingual and transmucosal formulations, and as an injection. This makes it a good option for older adults with mobility or transportation issues, as it reduces the need for frequent visits to the provider. 890 Chapter 5 143 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Methadone. Methadone can prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms and reduce drug cravings. Methadone is available in almost every state from specially licensed opioid treatment programs. Methadone is a benefcial intervention. 891 Naltrexone. Naltrexone is best for clients who want to stop all opioid use. Research on naltrexone for OUD treatment in older adults is not readily available. It is less useful for individuals needing long-term medication maintenance therapy for SUDs or for those with chronic pain. Naltrexone must not be prescribed to individuals who are currently using opioid medications. Nonopioid Treatments for Chronic Pain Older adults may develop OUD because of chronic pain. Given the complexities of managing the care of older clients with chronic pain, a comprehensive treatment approach is recommended. 892 Chronic pain in older adults is best managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes (when possible) a: 893 Geriatrician. Rheumatologist. Physical medicine and rehabilitation physician. Psychiatrist or psychologist. Physical therapist. Occupational therapist. Pharmacist. Nonpharmacological treatments can successfully treat chronic pain in older adults. These include: 894 Meditation. Relaxation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Exercise therapy. Physical therapy/occupational rehabilitation. Exhibit 5.4 shows the general approach to managing chronic pain in older adults. RESOURCE ALERT: VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINICAL DECISION TOOLS FOR OPIOID USE AND CHRONIC PAIN The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guideline for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain (www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/Pain/cot) describes the critical decision points in the management of opioid therapy for chronic pain. It provides clear and comprehensive evidence-based recommendations using current information and practices for practitioners throughout the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare systems. It includes special dosing considerations for older adults. The Opioid Safety Initiative Toolkit (www.va.gov/PAINMANAGEMENT/Opioid_Safety_Initiative_OSI.asp), created by the Veterans Health Administration National Pain Management Program, can aid in clinical decisions about starting, continuing, or tapering opioid therapy and other challenges related to safe opioid prescribing. Clinical teams caring for older adult veterans with chronic pain may fnd this useful. 144 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults EXHIBIT 5.4. Chronic Pain Assessment and Treatment Approaches for Older Adults 895,896 Assessment. An indepth assessment should review the client's: Cognitive and functional status. Social support. Co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions and SUDs. History of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments. Current medication and alcohol use. ADLs. (See Chapter 3 for more information about assessing these.) Goals and hopes for treatment. Treatment. An indepth approach should include: Building a treatment alliance with the older adult by asking about his or her preferences and goals. Providing consistent and prompt follow-up to a client's requests and phone calls. Providing backup coverage with providers who understand the unique treatment needs of older adults. Providing/actively linking the client to physical or occupational therapy and other community-based resources. Offering pharmacological (when needed) and other treatments (e.g., CBT, physical therapy, mindfulness). Using praise and positive reinforcement when the client meets treatment tasks and goals. When necessary, adapting treatment approaches to meet the needs of the older adult. Including family and caregivers in treatment planning and recovery/rehabilitation activities (with the older adult's permission). If you are treating older adults with opioids for chronic pain, do not stop treatment suddenly. This can cause serious withdrawal effects. In addition, the return of pain may lead older adults to misuse or use other prescribed medications, alcohol, OTC medications, and illicit drugs. The consensus panel recommends that you slowly titrate older adults off of opioids, while at the same time offering them other pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options. Treatment of Drug Use Disorders Other Than OUD Benzodiazepines Given the potential risks and harmful effects, medical providers are cautioned against prescribing benzodiazepines to older adults. If a benzodiazepine is needed, prescribe the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time. Harmful effects of benzodiazepines can include: 897 Residual sedation. Decreased attention. Decreased memory and cognitive function. Changes in motor coordination. Increased risk of falls. Drug dependence and withdrawal. Increased risk of car accidents. Although life-threatening benzodiazepine overdoses are rare, the risk is higher in older adults because of age-related declines in medication metabolism. In the event of a benzodiazepine overdose, low doses of a benzodiazepine antagonist are safe for older adults. 898 Medically supervised withdrawal from benzodiazepines for older adults should include: 899 Counseling. A stepped withdrawal schedule. Client education about benzodiazepine use and withdrawal. Chapter 5 145 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms can be similar to alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, sleep disturbances, and life-threatening complications such as seizures. A gradual, tapered approach to medically supervised withdrawal is best. Because older adults can have withdrawal symptoms even after taking the medication for relatively short periods of time, tapering should be gradual. It should last for a minimum of 4 weeks, although most clients need longer. 900 One study using a 22-week tapering protocol and education about the tapering process found that 27 percent of clients stopped taking benzodiazepines within 6 months, compared with 5 percent in the control group. 901 A review of 28 studies of older adults tapering off benzodiazepines reported positive outcomes and no serious harmful effects with tapering only (32 percent), tapering and CBT (32 percent), and tapering plus other medication (36 percent). 902 Other Sedative-Hypnotics Medical providers often prescribe sedative-hypnotic medication to older adults for insomnia. Sedative-hypnotics should not be frst-line treatment for insomnia. Some older adults can beneft from benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics as short-term solutions to sleep issues. However, long-term use of these medications increases the risk of physical dependence. Be very cautious prescribing them to older adults because of the increased risk of: 903 Memory impairment. Falls. Fractures. Car accidents. The consensus panel discourages treatment of insomnia with sedative-hypnotics for more than 7 to 10 days. Patients need frequent monitoring and reassessment if treatment continues past 2 to 3 weeks. Intermittent dosing at the lowest possible dose is best. Prescribe no more than a 30-day supply. SLEEP HYGIENE TO REDUCE INSOMNIA IN OLDER ADULTS The aging process can cause changes in sleep that lead to increased awakenings during the night. Older clients who practice good sleep hygiene and receive CBT can retrain their bodies and brains for better, more restful sleep. Sleep-related best practices that combine principles of sleep hygiene with CBT include the following: 904,905,906,907 Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially before bed. Take medications in the morning if possible, especially if they are stimulating or cause alertness. Don't take daytime naps. Follow a regular bedtime. Use the bedroom only for sleep and sexual activity; remove TVs, electronics, and items unrelated to sleep. Limit exercise to earlier in the day. Avoid heavy meals before bedtime. Learn relaxation techniques and use them before bed and during night wakening. If awake for 10 to 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing (e.g., read a book in some place other than bed). Go back to bed only when sleepy. This helps the brain link the bedroom to sleep only. Keep a sleep diary to track habits and changes in sleep over time. Cannabis The widening legalization, availability, and social acceptance of cannabis has led to more frequent recreational and medicinal use of this drug by older adults. Sometimes, this results in cannabis use disorder (CUD). According to DSM-5, CUD includes symptoms such as: 908 Taking cannabis in larger amounts or over a longer period than was planned by the person. Having an ongoing desire to cut down or control use or past unsuccessful efforts to do so. 146 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults Failing to fulfll major role responsibilities at work, school, or home because of cannabis use. Experiencing tolerance or withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can lead to a return to use and include: 909 Irritability. Depression. Anxiety. Sleep problems. Dysphoria (sad mood). Evidence-based treatments for CUD are lacking for the general population and for older adults. More studies and interventions designed for older adults are needed. The National Institute on Drug Abuse recommends three behavioral approaches to treat CUD: 910 motivational interviewing (MI), CBT, and contingency management. Stimulants Stimulant intoxication (e.g., from cocaine or amphetamines) is linked to mental symptoms (e.g., anxiety, agitation, psychosis) as well as autonomic hyperactivity (i.e., high blood pressure, rapid heart rate). Benzodiazepines or neuroleptics may be prescribed for withdrawal-related symptoms, such as agitation and sleep issues (e.g., insomnia, extreme sleepiness). 911 Other withdrawal symptoms can include: Depression. Irritability. Anxiety. Psychosis. At this time, there are no FDA-approved, evidence-based pharmacological treatment options for individuals with cocaine use disorder 912 and no approved treatments specifc to older adults with stimulant use disorders. However, some pharmacotherapies have shown success in adult populations, including disulfram, bupropion, and naltrexone. 913 CBT remains the gold-standard treatment for stimulant cravings and return to stimulant use. 914 Psychosocial Treatment Approaches Psychosocial interventions are generally effective in reducing and even stopping drug use and prescription medication misuse. Some interventions, such as CBT, MI, and relapse prevention therapy, are effective for many types of drug use. 915 Medication treatments for drug use may be more effective in combination with psychosocial treatment, compared with either medication or psychosocial interventions alone. 916,917 It is unclear which psychosocial treatments are most effective for older adults with drug use disorders. Some psychosocial approaches, like problem-solving therapy and CBT, have effectively treated older adults for other behavioral health issues (e.g., depression, tobacco addiction) that often co-occur with drug use disorders. 918,919,920 A systematic review found that older adults do as well as or better than younger adults across SUD treatment approaches. 921 You can adapt standard psychosocial counseling methods for use with older adults by: Repeating information. Using a slower pace. Offering shorter sessions. Giving information in different ways (e.g., verbally, in large print) to match clients' level of physical and cognitive functioning. Using age-sensitive approaches with structured (not open-ended) questions. Such approaches are: -Nonconfrontational. -Responsive to gender/cultural differences. -Flexible (e.g., provide in-home or phone service for clients without transportation). -Focused on helping older adults learn/ improve coping and social skills. (Chapter 4 of this TIP discusses CBT, MI, relapse prevention therapy, and problem-solving therapy treatment approaches for older adults in more detail.) Chapter 5 147 TIP 26 Age-Specifc Treatment Age-specifc treatment approaches and practices help older adults seek, participate in, and complete treatment. Such approaches also improve older adults' treatment experience (Exhibit 5.5). Whereas some older adults beneft from mixed-age addiction treatment, those ages 75 and older or with more chronic co-occurring health conditions and functional limitations beneft from age-specifc treatment. 922 Regardless of the treatment approach, older adults prefer age-specifc, age-sensitive approaches that are nonconfrontational, person centered, and fexible. Age-specifc programming 923,924 improves treatment completion and improves older adults' 12-month rates of abstinence. It also results in higher rates of attendance at group meetings compared with mixed-age treatment. Age-specifc programs that have been studied have featured: 925 An emphasis on individual and group counseling and community activities. Adaptations such as slower pace and accommodations for vision, hearing, and cognitive impairment. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Special topic groups for older adults focusing on: -Grief. An emphasis on the therapeutic alliance while using CBT and MI, and a 12-Step philosophy. Exhibit 5.5 highlights important characteristics of age-specifc treatment for older adults recommended by the consensus panel. Referral Management and Care Coordination Limited time and resources may keep you from treating older adults with drug use disorders. However, as part of care coordination, you should develop linkages with treatment providers who EXHIBIT 5.5. Age-Specifc SUD Treatment for Older Adults Accessibility Use a larger font on print and electronic client screening, assessment, and educational materials. Offer adaptations for individuals with cognitive, vision, or hearing impairments. Offer transportation, in-home services, and telephone checkups. Offer a sliding scale for self-paying clients. Use adaptations for individuals with physical disabilities and problems getting around. When needed, supply linkages to: -Food, clothing, and shelter. -Specialized medical services. -Older adult-focused social services. -Employment services. -Financial and housing assistance. Program Specifc Use a nonconfrontational manner emphasizing the therapeutic alliance while using therapeutic approaches that have been shown to work with older adults (e.g., CBT, MI, problem-solving therapy). Focus on building self-esteem and coping skills. Use a slower pace and adaptations for vision, hearing, and mild cognitive problems. Offer individual, group, and family counseling. Offer special topic groups for older adults. Give individual counseling and one-on-one attention. Ensure that staff are trained in the unique concerns and treatment needs of older adults. Use gender-specifc content. Offer counseling with providers who specialize in geriatrics. Offer age-specifc linkages to services within the community. Offer peer recovery support services geared to older adults. 148 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults can do so and with other resources within the community.926 (See \"Resource Alert: Developing Referral Resources\" in Chapter 2 of this TIP .) Referring older clients to the right level of treatment and offering ongoing coordination of care are the keys to getting positive outcomes for older adults in addiction treatment. Effective referral starts with matching your referral to the client's stated goals and available resources. You must also address the client's outlook and hopes for the referral. Once you make a referral, follow up with both the client and the other provider to make sure that the client is continuing in treatment. Work together with the other provider to offer ongoing care as needed. (See Chapter 4 of this TIP for more strategies for referral management and care coordination.) Recovery Management Recovery management is an organizing philosophy for addiction treatment and recovery support services. Recovery management can help individuals and family members participate in treatment and achieve long-term recovery. 927 Not everyone who uses illicit substances or misuses prescription medication needs ongoing recovery management support. However, some older adults may need ongoing monitoring and recovery support, especially if they have co-occurring medical conditions or mental disorders, experience social isolation, or receive little support from family and friends. 928 Continuing care interventions that suit older adults and positively affect addiction treatment include: Home visits. Telephone counseling. Recovery checkups. Active linkage to community resources, such as recovery support groups. Offering case management services and including supportive family members in the older adult's treatment can also support ongoing recovery. (See also the \"Family Involvement\" section.) Case and Care Management Services Case and care management (CCM) services can help older adults reduce health-related risks of drug use or prescription medication misuse. The CCM approach to addiction treatment is broad. It addresses clients' overall health and connects them to recovery resources within the community, such as NA and AA. CCM services focus on getting clients into addiction treatment programs when needed and linking them to other services, like: Housing support. Employment services. Financial services. Specialty medical treatment. CCM services are commonly available in community-based agencies, healthcare offces, and residential or long-term care facilities. 929 Addiction treatment programs and comprehensive behavioral health programs also may have care coordination and resource linkage services, which are increasingly offered by peer recovery support specialists. CCM models can help older adults enter and stay in treatment, possibly because this approach seeks to reduce feelings of shame older adults often feel about entering treatment, and it provides support to the individual. CCM does this by focusing on older adults' overall health rather than just their drug use. 930,931 CCM strategies should help older adults gain access to age-related resources in the community that support recovery. 932,933 Family Involvement Involving family throughout treatment and ongoing recovery can help improve older clients' chances of staying in addiction treatment. It can also improve treatment outcomes. Family members: Often make frst contact with treatment services. Can motivate the older adult to participate in treatment. Chapter 5 149 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Can help the older adult overcome barriers to access. Can help the older adult with the diffculties of the medical and specialized addiction treatment systems. Can provide important details about the client's history of and current substance use. With the client's permission, involve family members and caregivers who support the older adult's recovery efforts: In the initial evaluation of the older adult. Throughout treatment. During ongoing recovery support. In posttreatment recovery plan development. Although family members and caregivers can be key in providing support, they may also feel shame related to their family member's drug use disorder. You can help them feel more open to being involved by stressing that addiction is a chronic illness, like heart disease, and reminding them of the confdential nature of treatment. Without meaning to, sometimes family members exacerbate the older adult's drug use or prescription medication misuse by helping him or her get access to illicit substances or supporting the misuse of prescribed medication. Family members may beneft from psychoeducation, delivered in a nonjudgmental way, about the health risks of drug use and prescription medication misuse. (See Chapter 4 of this TIP for more information about family involvement in treatment and caregiver support resources.) Mutual-Help Groups Twelve-Step recovery support groups offer community-based support for individuals who have drug use disorders, including people who are in continuing care following brief interventions or specialized addiction treatment. 934 A growing body of research suggests that mutual-help group participation improves long-term recovery, psychosocial outcomes, and self-effcacy. 935,936 However, no systematic studies address outcomes for older adults. Even so, mutual-help group participation may improve recovery and help older adults reduce social isolation, shame, and the effects of discrimination associated with drug use disorders. 937 The key to linking older adults to mutual-help groups is fnding available resources in your community and matching clients to specifc groups that may be a better ft for older adults. For example, when an older client cannot easily access an NA meeting, the client may beneft from attending AA meetings instead. 938 Older clients may feel more comfortable going to AA than NA, where participants are typically younger and use multiple substances. 939 Key elements of 12-Step groups that are especially well suited to older adults include: 940 General social support, goal direction, and structure. Participation in substance-free social activities. Activities to improve participants' self-effcacy and coping skills. These strategies can help you link older clients to community-based recovery support groups: Become familiar with age-friendly mutual-help groups available in your community. Contact local support group offces and ask which meetings are accessible to people with disabilities and have active members who are older adults. Ask groups to provide contact information for older adult members who can act as temporary sponsors or provide transportation. Link clients to peer recovery support specialists in your own organization or in the community. Urge older clients to attend several different meetings before they decide whether mutual help is something they want to pursue, because each meeting has its own tone and feeling. 150 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults RESOURCE ALERT: SMART RECOVERY SMART stands for Self-Management and Recovery Training. SMART Recovery is a network of local and online abstinence-focused addiction recovery support groups based on evidence-supported principles of CBT and MI approaches, which are appropriate for treating older adults. Unlike AA, NA, and Cocaine Anonymous, SMART Recovery meetings are run by trained volunteers and do not include a spiritual component. The SMART Recovery website (www.smartrecovery. org) offers information about SMART Recovery principles and training opportunities, including how to become a facilitator for meetings. It includes a searchable database of local and online meetings. You can also learn more about SMART Recovery in Chapter 4 of this TIP. Clinical Scenarios The clinical cases that follow give examples of substance misuse by older adults and ways to apply clinical interventions in these situations. Interventions and treatments can range from PCPs asking the older adult about personal use of substances (e.g., benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, alcohol use with medication misuse or illicit substance use) to inpatient addiction treatment. The level of intensity of interventions and treatments for older adults depends on: The substance used. The level of use. Effects on and risks to client. Clinical Scenario: Benzodiazepine Misuse and Polypharmacy For many older adults, the relationship with their PCP is often one of their strongest and most stable. Visits to their PCP provide an opportunity to screen for substance use and misuse, including substance use related to late-life changes (e.g., retirement, moving, grieving a death). This scenario demonstrates thorough screening of a new client and strategies for problem-solving and referral. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder: An older adult woman becomes physically dependent on benzodiazepines after long-term use and increases her health risk by taking benzodiazepines with other sedative-hypnotic medications. Treatment Setting: Outpatient healthcare clinic Providers: PCP; clinical social worker (CSW) Treatment Strategies: Screen for alcohol misuse; discuss history of sedative use; provide information on risks of taking substances together; explore tapering off benzodiazepines; refer to CSW who uses CBT strategies for anxiety; follow up with the client. Joan is a 70-year-old widow who has two grown children who live far away from her. She started to have signifcant anxiety in her 50s, when the company she worked for closed and her job ended. She was never able to look for or fnd a job again. At that time, she was prescribed a benzodiazepine by her PCP and she has taken it for many years. In the past year, her husband died, and she moved from her house to an apartment because she could not afford to stay in the house. She became more anxious and started taking extra doses of the benzodiazepine. Her sister also has a benzodiazepine prescription and has given Joan extra pills when she runs out, which happens more often lately. Joan has arthritis pain, making sleep diffcult. To help with this, her doctor prescribed sleeping pills on a short-term basis. Joan stopped drinking alcohol when her husband stopped drinking 10 years before his death. Her long-term PCP retired recently\u2014another signifcant loss for Joan. She started seeing a new PCP at the same group practice after the nurse care manager reached out by phone to set up an initial consultation. Her new provider is screening all new clients for a variety of health behaviors. The PCP asks Joan about her alcohol use and notes that she has been taking benzodiazepines for more than a decade. Joan states, \"I have been taking Xanax for years for my 'nerves.' It made it easier for me to go to social events and church after Jake died.\" Joan also says that the pills make it a little easier to sleep but that she has recently had to take more sleeping pills to get any sleep at all. Joan likes her new doctor, so she is willing to talk Chapter 5 151 TIP 26 about her benzodiazepine dosage. She discusses how she gets some extra pills from her sister because she runs out before the prescriptions are ready to be flled and starts to feel \"bad.\" At this meeting, the new PCP discusses Joan's anxiety and, in a nonjudgmental way, gives information about the risks of taking benzodiazepines for a long time, taking more than prescribed, and adding sleeping pills to the mix. She says, \"You know, many people who take this medication for a long time, even as prescribed, start to need a higher dose just to keep the anxiety at bay or then add a sleeping pill because the tranquilizer isn't working anymore. There are some options we can talk about that could help you feel better without all of this medication. Can we discuss some options and fgure out together what might work best for you?\" Joan says that she would like not to have to take so many pills, and she worries that if her sister isn't around, she won't be able to get more tranquilizers from her. The PCP and Joan discuss several options, including a long-term taper from the benzodiazepines, and work together to fnd the best option for Joan. The PCP explains the tapering process and explains how Joan can manage anxiety and sleep problems as she tapers off the medication. Initially, Joan is a bit nervous about tapering off the medication but agrees to this option after the PCP reassures her that she will work closely with her to make sure the taper is adjusted correctly for her situation. The PCP then asks Joan whether she would be willing to talk to the clinic's social worker about connecting with age-friendly activities in the community and learning to manage her anxiety without medication. Joan says \"yes.\" The PCP walks Joan over to the social worker's offce and introduces Joan to her. They set up an appointment for an initial visit. The social worker is trained in CBT strategies to manage anxiety and introduces them to Joan at her initial visit. In their next session, the social worker discusses with Joan how the CBT is affecting her ability to manage anxiety. The social worker continues to see Joan weekly. Each week, Joan gets a structured, between-session assignment and a quick telephone reminder about practicing the exercise. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults CBT FOR ANXIETY AMONG OLDER ADULTS A review of psychosocial treatments for anxiety among older adults found that CBT had the strongest research support. 941 The authors reported that CBT could be even more useful for older adults when adapted to their needs. Some of these adaptations include: 942 Simpler CBT interventions. Between-session reminder phone calls. A weekly review of concepts discussed. At-home assignments. The social worker also helps Joan connect with social activities she enjoys. With support, Joan feels she can improve how she feels physically and emotionally. Her PCP is in contact with Joan's social worker and sees Joan on a regular basis to assess how well the taper is going and whether it needs adjustment. Clinical Scenario: Use of Opioids and Alcohol for Pain Management When older adults taking pain medication use alcohol, they can experience additional negative health effects. Older adults who live in retirement communities and long-term residential care facilities often fnd themselves in social situations where drinking is supported. 943 Visits to the PCP provide a chance to screen for alcohol misuse as well as offer new options for pain management. This scenario demonstrates screening thoroughly before prescribing additional pain medication, educating clients on the dangers of using alcohol with medication, and providing nonpharmacological pain management strategies. OUD and Alcohol Misuse: An older adult living in a retirement community who drinks to socialize becomes physically dependent on opioids after surgery. Treatment Setting: Outpatient healthcare clinic Providers: PCP; NP 152 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults Treatment Strategies: Screen for prescription drug and alcohol use; discuss current health status of the client; provide information on risks of using alcohol while taking opioids; perform initial brief interventions; suggest physical therapy and a tapering program; conduct multiple follow-up brief interventions and calls with the client. Louise is a 75-year-old retired middle school teacher who is married. She and her husband, a retired high school principal, just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. They have a son, a daughter, and three grandchildren. For the past 5 years, they have lived in a retirement community. They have made friends in the community and take part in activities, including golf, exercise classes, card games, and book clubs. Many of these events include alcohol. In addition, the community sponsors regular happy hour gatherings at the clubhouse that Louise and her husband also attend. One month ago, Louise had knee replacement surgery. She began taking opioids for pain in the hospital and was sent home with a prescription so that she could continue to use the medication during rehabilitation. She was still having pain during the day, with greater pain at night. To add to the effects of the opioids and make them \"go further,\" she drank wine at the usual get-togethers with friends and had additional drinks in the evening before bed. A neighbor, Pat, had prescription opioids from a past surgery. She offered them to Louise to help \"tide her over\" until she saw her doctor. Louise waited to make an appointment until she was almost out of her neighbor's opioid medication. Louise makes an appointment with her PCP to see whether she can get more pain medication. She tells her PCP that the pain is not going away, and that she is almost out of medication. The PCP talks with Louise about her pain and screens for amount and frequency of alcohol use and medication use. He discovers that she is drinking while taking the opioids and has been using more opioids than recommended. He then gives her nonjudgmental feedback about the results of the screens. He says, \"Based on your answers to my questions about your alcohol use and use of pain medication, it looks like you are at risk for some serious health problems if you continue drinking alcohol and taking medication in this way. We know that when people your age drink and take the kind of pain medication you are on, they can have problems with their breathing, ability to move around, or memory. Are any of those happening to you?\" Louise starts to become concerned and responds, \"You know, I have been getting more confused about things lately and feeling like I sometimes have a hard time breathing easily. But I am worried about the pain and how I will manage without pain medicine or extra alcohol.\" The PCP acknowledges her concerns by stating that maintaining her health and level of activity is important. The PCP asks whether she would be willing to work with him and an NP to come up with a plan to manage her pain while lowering the health risks she faces by drinking and using pain medication at the same time. Louise says, \"Well, what's most important to me is to get my knee in good shape again.\" The PCP supports Louise's goal and calls in the NP , who is trained in giving substance-related brief interventions and has worked with other clients to help them cut back on alcohol and reduce or stop their use of opioids. The NP schedules Louise for two face-to-face meetings and two follow-up phone calls between visits. She and Louise develop a treatment plan that includes Louise going to physical therapy and a rehabilitative exercise class in her community to help her knee heal and improve her range of motion so she can get back to golfng with her group. Louise also agrees to keep track of her alcohol use and to follow an opioid taper plan over the next month to get off the pain medication. Clinical Scenario: Screening, Assessment, and Referral to Addiction Treatment Older adults with a history of substance misuse have increased risk of return to substance use when they have additional stressors (e.g., injury, divorce, family confict). Heavy substance use also leads to many health problems; these are often the primary reason a client seeks treatment or winds up in the ED. A study found that SBIRT in an ED setting was a factor in reducing substance use at follow-up, suggesting that an ED visit for another medical Chapter 5 153 TIP 26 problem may be a \"turning point\" for many individuals with substance misuse concerns.944 This scenario shows the importance of the ED as a setting for screening, assessment, and referral; it also demonstrates strategies providers can use to take advantage of \"teachable moments\" with clients. Cannabis and Alcohol Misuse: An older adult with a long history of alcohol and cannabis misuse has co-occurring medical conditions. Treatment Setting: ED of a community hospital Provider: ED attending physician Treatment Strategies: Get the client medically stable; order a blood test screen for alcohol; order a urine screen for cannabis; discuss the current state of the client; provide information on the risks of using alcohol with cannabis; conduct a brief intervention; recommend short-stay, inpatient detoxifcation and treatment followed by outpatient care. Walter is 69 years old and divorced. He lives with his girlfriend. He has an adult son and a granddaughter. Walter likes to hunt and fsh with his male friends but has little other social contact. Walter had some problems with alcohol when he was younger, including being arrested for driving under the infuence. He cut back on drinking but started smoking cannabis daily. After he got married, he stopped using cannabis and drank only occasionally for several years. He started drinking heavily and smoking cannabis again after an on-the-job back injury in his early 50s. He divorced 10 years ago and retired the next year. He met Sally, his long-term girlfriend, 5 years ago. Walter drinks heavily and uses cannabis daily. In the past year, there have been many times when he did not remember what he did when he was intoxicated. His girlfriend used to enjoy smoking cannabis and drinking with him, but as he increased his use, she is no longer comfortable living with him and has threatened to move out if he keeps using. Walter has been having some health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and chronic back pain. He sometimes forgets to take his medications. He was stopped by the police for unsafe driving recently but was not arrested. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults In addition, he had a falling out with his son and daughter-in-law. They do not want him spending time with his granddaughter because he is often drunk and high. A week later, he starts drinking and smoking cannabis when he wakes in the morning and continues to use all day, passing out in the late afternoon. When he awakens a few hours later, he has chest pain, nausea, and sweating. Worried of a heart attack, his girlfriend takes him to the ED. The attending physician sees him immediately, takes a medical history, and orders lab tests to rule out a heart attack. However, a blood draw shows his blood alcohol level is 0.18. A urine screen is positive for cannabis. The ED physician then performs a more indepth screen and assessment of Walter's substance use history and, with Walter's permission, invites Sally to discuss the effects of Walter's drinking and cannabis use. Once Walter is less intoxicated, the ED physician talks with him about his medical status. In a nonjudgmental and nonconfrontational tone, he says, \"Walter, the good news is that you did not have a heart attack. Based on your other lab tests, your age, and other medical conditions and what you and Sally have told me about your drinking and cannabis use, I want you to think about a short stay at an inpatient treatment program so you can get a handle on your substance use.\" At frst, Walter is not sure, but then Sally supports him. He then says, \"I feel so sick, and thinking I was having a heart attack really scared me. I guess it's the best thing for me to do.\" The ED physician introduces Walter and Sally to the nurse care manager and assures them that she can answer any questions they have about the treatment process and will help transfer his care to the inpatient program. Clinical Scenario: Polysubstance Misuse With Co-Occurring Medical Conditions More and more older adults with a history of illicit drug use, particularly heroin and cocaine, are being admitted to inpatient addiction treatment programs. 945,946 Cocaine use in older adults is related to multiple medical problems, including higher rates of high blood pressure, breathing issues, heart attack, stroke, and cognitive 154 Chapter 5 TIP 26 Chapter 5\u2014Treating Drug Use and Prescription Medication Misuse in Older Adults impairment.947 Older adults with a long history of polysubstance misuse (misuse of multiple substances at the same time) and co-occurring medical conditions are at risk for return to substance use and lack of follow-up for medical conditions after inpatient treatment. This scenario demonstrates referral management and ongoing recovery support strategies for an older adult with a history of polysubstance misuse and co-occurring medical conditions. Polysubstance Misuse: An older adult has a history of misuse of heroin and cocaine. Treatment Setting: Inpatient detoxifcation and rehabilitation program Provider: Licensed alcohol and drug counselor (LADC) on a multidisciplinary treatment team Treatment Strategies: Offer referral and recovery management strategies before discharge. Hal is 74 years old and never married. He started using heroin as a soldier in the Vietnam War. After discharge from the service, he started using cocaine to stay awake during his night shift at the post offce. His drug use stayed about the same for many years but increased after he retired. He lives alone, and his social life includes playing poker with friends on Thursdays. During a recent game, Hal had numbness in his arm and slurred speech. One of his buddies brings him to the ED. Hal is having a mild stroke. After he is medically stabilized, Hal enters an extended-care inpatient SUD treatment program. After 8 weeks of treatment, Hal meets with his primary counselor to discuss his continuing care plan. ADAPTING RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS Because many older adults have problems getting around, upon admission to residential and inpatient programs, older adults can beneft from being paired with a \"senior buddy\" to help them learn the facility and move from one treatment activity to another. 948 The counselor opens the conversation by saying, \"Hal, you've done really well in treatment. You've participated fully in therapy and educational groups here and have a solid plan to keep yourself from relapsing and to help you cope with any triggers to use once you go home.\" Hal responds, \"Thanks. It's good to hear that you think I've been doing well. Frankly, I was kind of anxious when I was frst admitted to the program. It really helped that you paired me up with Bill to show me the ropes.\" The counselor says, \"Let's talk about your goals for ongoing recovery.\" Hal says he doesn't want to go back to using but worries that he has no recovery support back home. He says, \"My poker buddies all drink and smoke pot. Even though that wasn't my thing, I think that will be a trigger to use again. I liked the NA meetings a lot, but I live in a really small town, and there aren't any NA meetings nearby.\" Hal's counselor had already contacted the AA central service offce closest to Hal and gotten the names and contact information of an older AA volunteer who would be willing to help Hal get to meetings and act as a temporary sponsor. The counselor says, \"I already talked to Jerry. It turns out he is a Vietnam vet, too.\" Hal says that talking to someone who has \"been there\" would be a big help to him. Hal and his counselor talk about other recovery management options, like linking with a counselor and a continuing care group at an outpatient SUD treatment program nearby and getting Hal an appointment with a PCP who can provide medical care. The counselor tells Hal of a recovery checkup program with a peer recovery support specialist who will call him regularly to see how he is doing and whether he needs linkage to other community resources. The counselor will provide a \"warm handoff\" by introducing Hal to the specialist before discharge. Hal says, \"That sounds great. It will be nice to have that connection to the rehab.\" Hal and his counselor write down his continuing care plan and all contact information. His counselor says, \"Your homework is to call the AA contact and schedule a meeting after your discharge on Chapter 5 155 TIP 26 Thursday. Mine is to make referrals to the PCP and outpatient addiction counseling program.\" Hal is satisfed with the recovery plan and motivated to follow through and continue his recovery program. Summary Widespread screening, brief intervention, and referral and recovery management are essential to the successful treatment of drug use and prescription medication misuse, including drug use disorders, in older adults. Whatever specifc treatment method or strategy you use when working with older adults who have drug use disorders, make sure it is nonconfrontational and age sensitive. Ongoing recovery management strategies increase the chance that improvements will continue over time and not only help older adults reduce negative drug-related health and behavioral outcomes, but also improve the quality of their lives.

Screening for mental disorders that co-occur with substance misuse and can negatively affect cognition is very important. Doing such screening will help you quickly get clients the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, mental health services, and medical evaluation they need. Treatment should be offered as needed for the full scope of problems facing an older client. Treatment should address a client's substance misuse; co-occurring mental conditions, including depression or anxiety; and cognitive impairment. Chapter 6 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will most beneft providers. It will help them understand how to screen, diagnose, and treat older clients who misuse substances and have, or are at risk for, cognitive problems. Changes in how people think and how their brains work are normal parts of getting older and vary a lot from person to person. But some age-related cognitive changes are abnormal, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, for older adults who misuse substances, diffculties with cognition and other brain functions can be more serious. Older individuals are more sensitive than younger and middle-aged adults to the negative effects of drugs and alcohol on the brain. 949 This puts older people who misuse substances at increased risk for certain problems with thinking (also called cognitive impairment or cognitive disorders), such as dementia and delirium. Who Can Beneft From Chapter 6 of This TIP and How? Chapter 6 of TIP 26 is for behavioral health service, healthcare, and social service providers who provide care to older adults who misuse substances. Such providers include physicians and other healthcare professionals, psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, social workers, drug and alcohol counselors, and other behavioral health workers, such as peer recovery support specialists. Screening, diagnosis, and treatment of older clients who misuse substances and have cognitive problems may require help from many different types of providers. One type of provider may screen; another may make the diagnosis; yet another may treat the client or work with the client's caregiver. If you work with older adults in any setting, you are likely seeing more and more older clients who misuse substances. Chapter 6 will support you in decreasing your clients' chances of developing dementia and other cognitive problems by helping them address substance misuse and adopt healthier lifestyles. 950,951 Chapter 6 will help you: Teach older clients about risks of cognitive disorders related to substance misuse, such as dementia. Understand why you need to screen older clients who misuse substances for cognitive impairment, as well as conditions that co-occur with substance misuse and increase the risk for cognitive problems. These include depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 157 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Refer older clients with cognitive impairment for further cognitive testing and evaluation to make sure they receive the correct diagnosis. Offer treatments for SUDs, co-occurring mental disorders, and cognitive disorders, including education, drug and alcohol counseling, mental health services, referral for medication treatment, or a combination of these. Work with caregivers of older clients who misuse substances, have cognitive disorders, or both. Caregivers often need help improving their own coping and stress management skills. This is important because when caregivers suffer, the care they give can suffer too. Organization of Chapter 6 of This TIP Chapter 6 covers education, screening, assessment, and treatment of older adults who misuse substances and may also have, or be at risk for, cognitive impairment. The frst section of Chapter 6 discusses how common substance misuse is in older adults. Many people think substance misuse is \"just a young person's problem.\" But this is not true. This section will help you understand the importance of offering substance-related screening and treatments. The second section addresses whether substance misuse causes cognitive problems in older people. The fndings from research studies are not always clear. But what is clear is why you need to look for cognitive problems in older clients who misuse substances and how you can do that. EXHIBIT 6.1. Key Terms In the third section, you will learn more about mental disorders that commonly occur in older clients who misuse substances and can negatively affect their thinking. These include depression, anxiety, and PTSD. If untreated, these conditions can also make a client's substance misuse worse. Similarly, untreated SUDs can make these co-occurring mental disorders worse. The fourth section offers recommendations on how to help older clients who misuse substances reduce their chances of developing cognitive problems through screening, assessment, and treatment (or referral to treatment). Screening and assessment are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3 of this TIP (which includes many of the actual screening measures you can use in your program). The ffth section guides you in helping caregivers of older clients who misuse substances and have cognitive diffculties. Caregivers face many struggles and are often in great need of information and resources\u2014not only to help your older clients but also to help themselves. The fnal section offers resources to support your program and resources to share with your clients and their family members. More detailed resources are in Chapter 9 of this TIP . The Appendix presents two screening instruments: one for depression and another for PTSD. For defnitions of key terms you will fnd in Chapter 6 of this TIP , see Exhibit 6.1. Addiction*: The most severe form of SUD, associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). At-risk/high-risk drinking: Drinking alcohol in excessive amounts. This defnition encompasses both binge drinking and heavy drinking. Additionally, any alcohol consumption is considered risky when Continued on next page 158 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment Continued carried out by individuals with certain medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, those taking medicine that can interact harmfully with alcohol, those driving a car or engaged in other activities that require alertness, or people recovering from AUD. 952,953 Note that for purposes of this TIP, at-risk drinking and high-risk drinking are synonymous and either term is acceptable to describe an older adult's drinking patterns. AUD: The ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defnes this disorder. 954 An AUD diagnosis is given to people who use alcohol and meet at least 2 of the 11 DSM-5 symptoms in a 12-month period. Key aspects of AUD include tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control, and continued use despite negative consequences. AUD covers a range of severity and replaces what the previous edition of DSM termed alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Binge drinking: A drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. This usually takes place after four or more drinks for women and fve or more drinks for men. 955,956 However, older adults are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and treatment providers may need to lower these numbers when screening for alcohol misuse.957 Additionally, other factors such as weight, decrease in enzyme activity, and body composition (e.g., amount of muscle tissue present in the body) can also affect alcohol absorption rates. Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living (ADLs), including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 958 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Cognitive disorders: Problems in cognition that are not a normal part of aging. These problems include diffculties with memory, attention, using and understanding language, thinking and reacting quickly, solving diffcult problems, or a combination of these. Dementia and MCI are examples of cognitive disorders. Delirium tremens: A temporary state of confusion that can occur during alcohol withdrawal. If untreated, some symptoms, such as unstable heart rate and seizures, can be life threatening. Dementia: A brain disorder in which problems with cognition get worse over time. Problems with cognition are serious enough that people need help with activities of everyday living (e.g., bathing, getting dressed, and feeding themselves). In DSM-5, dementia is known as major neurocognitive disorder. Drug-drug interaction: The interaction of one substance (e.g., alcohol, medication, an illicit drug) with another substance. Drug-drug interactions may change the effectiveness of medications, introduce or alter the intensity of side effects, and increase a substance's toxicity or the concentration of that substance in a person's blood. Potentially serious interactions can also occur with certain foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. 959 Hazardous drinking: Alcohol use that increases the risk of future harm.960 Heavy drinking: Consuming fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women in one period on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days.961 Illicit substances: Illicit substances include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and prescription medications that are taken other than as prescribed (e.g., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives). MCI: A mild brain disorder that is similar to dementia. With MCI, problems with thinking are present but are not severe enough for people to need help with their everyday activities. In DSM-5, MCI is known as mild neurocognitive disorder. Moderate drinking: According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defned as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 962,963 However, the Continued on next page Chapter 6 159 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over several days.964 Additionally, individuals who don't metabolize alcohol well may need to consume even lower quantities. Some people, particularly those with certain alcohol-related illnesses or engaging in tasks requiring concentration, should not consume alcohol at all. The Dietary Guidelines stipulate that those who don't drink should not begin drinking for any reason. 965 Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches or peer recovery support specialists), mutual-help groups consist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no offcial connection to treatment programs. Most are self-supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are the most widespread and well researched type of mutual-help groups, other groups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affliated with a religion or church (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART [Self-Management and Recovery Training] Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Peer support: The use of peer recovery support specialists (e.g., someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training) to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Psychoactive substances: Substances that can alter mental processes (e.g., cognition or affect; in other words, the way one thinks or feels). Also called psychotropic drugs, such substances will not necessarily produce dependence, but they have the potential for misuse or abuse. 966 Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When those positive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder. DSM-5 defnes remission as present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving). 967 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to DSM-5, 968 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function and impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions of DSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerly called substance dependence. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction. surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). 160 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment Substance Misuse in Older Adults Substance misuse in older people is increasing,969 yet it is often overlooked and underaddressed by providers.970,971 Older clients may not feel comfortable telling you about their substance misuse or asking for help. This is problematic, as older people are more likely than younger or middle-aged people to experience negative effects from alcohol, drugs, and prescription medications. 972,973 Healthcare, behavioral health service, and social service providers can have diffculty noticing substance misuse in older clients. This is partly because most older adults who misuse substances do not meet all DSM-5 criteria for an SUD. For example, tolerance is a key diagnostic criterion of an SUD. But because of the aging process, older adults have a lower tolerance for alcohol and other substances than younger people. Thus, although tolerance in an older person is still a sign of substance dependence, it looks different in older adults than in younger individuals. Chapter 1 of this TIP provides information and statistics about overall substance misuse, misuse of specifc substances, and effects of substance misuse among older adults. The following sections in this chapter of the TIP provide a brief summary of this information. Alcohol Misuse Older adults use alcohol more than any other substance. 974,975 In 2019, 52.8 percent of people ages 60 to 64 years and 43.9 percent of people 65 and older were estimated to have used alcohol in the past month, 976 and 3.4 percent of adults 50 and older had AUD.977 Alcohol misuse differs between older men and older women. For example, women tend to feel the negative effects of alcohol after having fewer drinks than is the case for men. 978 They may be more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol misuse\u2014a concerning fact, given that drinking rates (including for binge drinking) are increasing more rapidly among older women than older men. 979 Misuse of Other Substances Although most older adults do not use illicit substances, some do. For example, according to data from 2019, 980 SUDs involving illegal drugs occurred in approximately 390,000 adults ages 50 to 54; 271,000 adults ages 55 to 59; 282,000 adults ages 60 to 64; and 227,000 adults ages 65 and older. Prescription medications are some of the most commonly misused substances among older adults in the United States. Prescription medication misuse involves taking a medication other than as prescribed, whether accidentally or on purpose. Some older adults use prescription medications to \"get high,\" but many misuse prescription medications by mistake to address sleep problems, chronic pain, or anxiety. Pain relievers are the most commonly misused prescription medication among older adults. 981 Exhibit 6.2 describes classes of prescription medication. EXHIBIT 6.2. Understanding Classes of Medications Most of your older clients will be taking at least one prescription medication. Many clients take more than one. Be sure you are familiar with the different types of medication classes. This will help you better understand the potential cognitive effects and drug-drug interactions related to the medications your clients are taking. Common medication classes include: 982 Sedative-hypnotics, which are often prescribed for sleep problems or anxiety. They include barbiturates (e.g., amobarbital, secobarbital) and benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, alprazolam). Sometimes the term \"tranquilizer\" is used to describe antianxiety medications such as benzodiazepines. Opioid analgesics, which are prescribed to treat pain. Opioid analgesics work by attaching on opioid receptors in the brain. Examples include oxycodone and hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Nonopioid analgesics, which people take to control pain. But these pain medications do not act on opioid receptors in the brain. Examples include aspirin and acetaminophen. Stimulants, which help people feel alert or full of energy. Examples include amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate. Chapter 6 161 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Between 11 and 18 percent of older adults, depending on age range, report using tobacco in the past month. 983 These numbers are troubling because, in adults ages 65 and older, smoking is associated with more than double the chances of binge drinking and triple the chances of illicit drug use or prescription medication misuse. 984 The true population rate for benzodiazepine misuse by older adults is unknown. The American Geriatrics Society notes that although at times prescribing benzodiazepines to older adults may be appropriate, these medications may be potentially inappropriate for some older individuals. These medications increase the risk of falls and fractures, car accidents, problems with cognition, substance misuse and dependence, and death. 985,986 It is unclear how many older adults use cannabis with a prescription, how many use it recreationally in areas where doing so is legal, and how many misuse it (whether through using recreationally in areas where it is illegal or by misusing prescription cannabis). Cannabis may seem harmless, but in some older adults it may be linked to memory and thinking problems, AUD and nicotine use disorder, and co-occurring mental disorders like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. 987,988 Efects of Substance Misuse Older adults are more likely than younger and middle-aged adults to feel the negative physical effects of medications, illicit drugs, and alcohol. In older people: 989 It takes longer for organs (e.g., liver, kidneys) to remove the alcohol and drugs from the body. With less lean body mass and total body water, older people can become intoxicated on even small amounts of a substance. The central nervous system is more sensitive to the effects of drugs and alcohol. Harmful drug-medication interactions are more likely. (See, for example, \"Resource Alert: Preventing Dangerous Alcohol-Medication Interactions.\") Older adults often take more than one medication. Harmful drug-medication interactions are associated with negative events such as: 990,991,992 -Injury (e.g., falls). -Internal bleeding. -Dangerous changes in blood pressure. -High or low blood sugar levels. -Overdose, which can be fatal. -Suicide and self-harm. Alcohol misuse can increase an older person's risk of injury, including those from: 993,994,995,996 -Falls. -Traumatic injury. frsthand. -Suicide and nonsuicidal self-injury. Binge drinking on 5 or more days in the past month can increase the risk of certain physical conditions and mental disorders or make them worse. Such conditions include: 997,998,999,1000 162 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment RESOURCE ALERT: PREVENTING DANGEROUS ALCOHOL-MEDICATION INTERACTIONS Older adults are at high risk for dangerous alcohol-medication interactions. Learn more about commonly used prescription and over-the-counter medications and how they interact with alcohol in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) publication Harmful Interactions (www.niaaa.nih.gov/ publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/harmful-interactions-mixing-alcohol-with-medicines). Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) publication Get Connected: Linking Older Adults with Resources on Medication, Alcohol, and Mental Health discusses the dangers of older adults misusing alcohol and prescription and over-the-counter drugs. It describes the signs of misuse and steps that older adults can take to prevent problems (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/ SMA03-3824). Links Between Substance Misuse and Cognitive Disorders You will note that this section addresses the cognitive effects of alcohol misuse in far greater depth than it does the cognitive effects of other substance misuse. This is because most research on substance misuse and cognitive disorders focuses on alcohol. Research on the relationship between cognitive disorders and other substances, such as cocaine and cannabis, is still new, somewhat mixed, and inconclusive. This section does address benzodiazepines and tobacco, but in less detail. The brain undergoes certain changes with age, like the shrinkage of white and gray matter tissue and decreased blood fow.1001,1002 Because of these alterations, people sometimes experience changes in thinking as they age. Examples of normal age-related changes in thinking include:1003 Having trouble recalling information without cues or reminders, such as not remembering what was on a shopping list when the list is not in front of the individual. Being unable to remember where a piece of information was heard or learned. Was it in the newspaper? Did someone mention it? Was it on television? Forgetting to perform activities, such as not remembering to turn off the kitchen light before going to bed. Having problems remembering the names of common objects. Remember that aging differs across individuals, and whether someone experiences age-related changes in cognition depends on many factors. Alcohol and Cognition The link between alcohol use and problems with cognition in later life is complex. The effects of alcohol on a person's health are infuenced by many factors, including how much and how often a person drinks, as well as by genetic and family-related factors. Social, cultural, and environmental factors can also affect a person's misuse of alcohol. These include such factors as: 1004 Exposure to alcohol consumption through television, movies, magazines, and social media. Experience of hardships related to immigration and cultural adjustment to life in the United States. Cultural norms related to drinking. Community environment, including level of violence, neighborhood housing conditions, and number of liquor stores in the community. Chapter 6 163 TIP 26 Involvement with family, friends, or peers who misuse alcohol, raising the potential for misuse as a \"learned behavior\" adopted through attempts to imitate the drinking patterns of others. Alcohol misuse is harmful to overall health 1005 and can increase the risk of dementia.1006 It can also negatively affect certain areas of cognition, like memory. 1007,1008 Drinking too much alcohol can damage the brain (as well as the liver, heart, and other organs). 1009,1010 Older adults may be more likely than younger adults to experience harm to the brain and body caused by heavy drinking: 1011,1012 Heavy alcohol use can damage older adults' ability to: 1013,1014 -Learn new information. -Recall information. -Speak and understand language. -Solve problems. -Think and react quickly. Heavy alcohol use can lead to negative physical changes in the brain. For instance, too much alcohol can cause brain cells and tissues to shrink or no longer work as they should. 1015 Even lower levels of alcohol use can sometimes harm the brain of middle-aged and older adults, 1016 including areas of the brain that control memory.1017 What amount of alcohol harms a person's thinking? There is no one right answer. The amount that is harmful can differ from person to person. Alcohol can affect a person's cognition, no matter how little they drink. Clients need not have a problem with alcohol for it to have signifcant effects on their thinking. Do not make the mistake of thinking only people with AUD are at risk for cognitive problems like dementia and MCI. Dementia and MCI Does alcohol misuse cause or increase the risk of dementia or MCI? The answer is unclear, especially for Alzheimer's disease. 1018 Part of the Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults problem is that different studies defne terms such as \"alcohol consumption,\" \"light to moderate drinking,\" and \"heavy or excessive drinking\" differently. Some studies have found a negative link between alcohol and cognitive disorders. For instance, research has found that: Heavy drinking can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. 1019 Heavy drinking, especially binge drinking, can increase risk of cognitive problems in later life. 1020,1021 Light-to-moderate drinking can increase the risk of MCI turning into dementia. 1022 Heavy drinking as a young adult can increase the risk of certain types of dementia later in life. 1023 Middle-aged adults who drink often (i.e., several times per month) may be more than twice as likely to have MCI in older adulthood as people who do not drink often (i.e., less than once per month). This risk appears to be even higher in people who have genes that increase their chances of developing Alzheimer's dementia (e.g., the APOE e4 gene). 1024 What happens when people who already have dementia, MCI, or other problems with cognition drink alcohol? It depends on how much they drink and other individual factors. For instance, which if any medications are they taking? Are they at risk for dementia because of their genetic background? Consider the following: Heavy alcohol use can be toxic to the brain. People with dementia or MCI are already struggling with their thinking. Adding alcohol to the situation can potentially worsen their cognitive problems. Alcohol use can worsen dementia symptoms (e.g., lack of interest in people or activities). 1025 Clients with cognitive problems may forget how much they drank, raising risk for drinking too much. What should you as a provider tell your older clients about alcohol misuse and their risk of cognitive problems? First, remember that defnitions, methods, and research questions differ 164 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment among studies. This makes it diffcult to know the true relationship between alcohol and risk of dementia or MCI. However, that does not mean that you should take this risk lightly. Here are some important points you can make when discussing with older clients their risk of developing cognitive problems because of alcohol misuse: Heavy alcohol use damages the brain, heart, liver, and other organs. 1026,1027 Older people are more likely than younger people to feel alcohol's negative effects. 1028,1029 So even light or moderate drinking can be more harmful to the brain. Drinking habits and biological factors differ from person to person. For instance, people who drink wine may be at less risk from light-to-moderate drinking than people drinking other alcoholic beverages. People who do not have genes that elevate their risk for dementia (such as the e4 allele of the APOE gene) may be at less risk from light-to-moderate drinking than others who are at high genetic risk for dementia. 1030 HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS \"HEALTHY\"? How \"safe\" or \"healthy\" is alcohol truly? A 2018 systematic analysis tried to answer this question by estimating the risk of alcohol consumption levels to health among people in 195 countries.1031 The study authors found that alcohol contributed greatly to disability and deaths, owing to its connection to conditions such as: Tuberculosis. Diabetes. Cancer. Accidental injuries. Cardiovascular disease. Self-harm. Stroke. Interpersonal violence. The study authors state that, based on their fndings, any amount of alcohol use, even minimal, can lead to loss of health. Although they found some benefcial effects of alcohol consumption for heart disease and diabetes among women, these benefts were outweighed by the health risks, especially those of cancer, infectious diseases, and injuries. \"The widely held view of the health benefts of alcohol needs revising,\" the authors write. \"Our results show that the safest level of drinking is none\" (p. 1026). The TIP consensus panel recommends that you counsel older clients on the possible dangers of alcohol misuse, especially heavy alcohol use and possible alcohol-medication interactions. If you screen a client for alcohol misuse, you should also screen him or her for cognitive impairment. Delirium Tremens People who drink heavily are at risk for a life-threatening condition called delirium tremens (or alcohol withdrawal delirium). Delirium tremens is different from delirium. Delirium is a cognitive disturbance in which people become confused and disoriented. Delirium can occur in older people who have recently undergone surgery or are taking multiple prescription medications, or who are experiencing common but serious medical conditions such as infections or dehydration. 1032,1033,1034 Delirium tremens is a serious and potentially deadly consequence of alcohol withdrawal. In fact, it is the most serious adverse effect of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms of delirium tremens could be mistaken for signs of dementia. Dangerous symptoms can include: 1035,1036 Hallucinations. Confusion (or disorientation). Chapter 6 165 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Rapid heart rate or high blood pressure. Sweating. Nausea or vomiting. Seizures and tremors. Behavioral health service and healthcare providers should stay alert for symptoms of delirium tremens when treating older clients with alcohol withdrawal. About 3 to 5 percent of people hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal have delirium tremens. 1037 Without treatment, delirium tremens can be deadly because of serious complications like heart arrhythmias. 1038 Thus, it often requires treatment in intensive care. Alcohol-Related Dementia Long-term heavy drinking can directly cause alcohol-related dementia (ARD). 1039 ARD occurs in up to a quarter of older people with AUD and is more likely to be diagnosed in men. 1040 Little scientifc evidence exists on the amount, length, and severity of alcohol use that leads to ARD. 1041 Some researchers believe that ARD develops because of a lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine) 1042 and the direct neurotoxic effects of ethanol.1043 To confrm a diagnosis of ARD, refer the client to a neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist for indepth cognitive testing. WERNICKE-KORSAKOFF SYNDROME (WKS) includes both Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome\u2014 two brain disorders linked to lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine). Heavy alcohol use is often the cause of WKS, but physical conditions, such as cancer, can also cause it. 1044 WKS is sometimes called alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder. Three main symptoms occur in WKS: problems with eye movement, confusion, and an inability to control muscle movements (also called ataxia), such as when walking. WKS is rare, occurring in about 1 percent of the general population. WKS is much more common in people with AUD, but prevalence rates vary widely. 1045 In some ways, WKS is similar to ARD. Both appear to be caused in part by a lack of vitamin B1. Both conditions can improve after clients stop using alcohol, start taking vitamin B1, or both. People with WKS can have such behavioral symptoms as loss of interest in all activities (called apathy) and restlessness, mood symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), and psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions). 1046 To confrm a diagnosis of WKS, you will need to refer the client to a neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist for cognitive testing. Benzodiazepines and Cognition Compared with older people who have never used benzodiazepines, older adults who have used them 1047 (ever, recently, previously, or for long periods of time) appear to have a higher risk of dementia. Older people with long-term use (i.e., greater than 3 months) of benzodiazepines may be 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop dementia as people who have not used them long term. 1048 The risk of dementia with benzodiazepine use appears to grow as the dose of benzodiazepine increases. 1049 Offer older clients who have taken benzodiazepines for a long time or have taken a high dose of these medications cognitive screening to assess problems in their thinking. (See Chapter 3 for cognitive screening measures.) Assessment of memory and cognitive functioning should be part of the annual exam of all older adults. High-dose or long-term use of benzodiazepines is an appropriate reason to perform cognitive screening, whether or not the older client asks for it, because older clients, especially those with cognitive impairment, may not realize that they need this screening. 166 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment The American Geriatrics Society cautions that benzodiazepines are potentially inappropriate in most older clients, but also notes that their use may be appropriate in certain limited circumstances, such as for seizure disorders. 1050 (See text box on the American Geriatrics Society 2019 Beers Criteria\u00ae for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults.) Consider whether older clients who take benzodiazepines need referral for a medication switch. Cognition may improve following the switch to alternative medications or with a gradual reduction in dosage of these medications. In addition to understanding the problems related to benzodiazepines, determine whether there have been any changes or additions to the client's medications. Medications contraindicated or causing adverse reactions and complications may temporarily impair cognition or exacerbate existing MCI. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria \u00ae list medications that are potentially inappropriate for older adults because the risks often outweigh the benefts. At the time of this publication, the 2019 Beers Criteria\u00ae are the most recent.1051 Clients taking medications in the brief list that follows (which is drawn from the full Beers Criteria\u00ae) should be referred to a healthcare provider to discuss possibly switching medications: Certain antidepressants medications (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) The 2019 Beers Criteria\u00ae also newly recommend avoiding concurrent use of benzodiazepines and prescription opioids, while stating that concerns about interactions should be weighed against the need to treat chronic pain. Note that the Beers Criteria \u00ae list medications that are potentially but not defnitely inappropriate. For more on how to properly apply the recommendations, see this editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.15766 . Tobacco and Cognition A recent study found that people who currently smoke cigarettes were much more likely to have dementia (any type) than people who had never smoked. 1052 Interestingly, people who formerly smoked had the same risk of dementia as people who never smoked. This means that stopping tobacco use could be powerful in reversing the risk of dementia. Research fndings from four large studies appear to confrm the harmful relationship between smoking and increased risk of dementia. 1053,1054,1055,1056 However, more research is needed to explore this relationship. That said, tobacco use is known to cause many serious negative health problems. You should counsel all clients who use tobacco to quit.

Chapter 6 167 TIP 26 Substance Misuse and Co-Occurring Mental Disorders That Afect Cognition Some older adults who have mental disorders also misuse substances.1057 For instance, in older adults, alcohol misuse often co-occurs with depression. 1058,1059 In older people, depression is associated with problems with reported memory, attention, problem-solving, and the ability to think and react quickly. 1060 According to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 1.7 million older adults (ages 50 and above) in the United States had a co-occurring mental disorder and SUD in 2019. 1061 Treatment rates for older people with co-occurring conditions are low. Estimates from 2019 showed that just 9.6 percent of people 50 and older with any mental illness and a past-year SUD received substance misuse services at an SUD treatment facility as well as mental health services. 1062 One reason for the undertreatment of co-occurring disorders (CODs) in older adults is that CODs tend to be overlooked and underdiagnosed. 1063 Older adults with CODs tend to use more behavioral health services than do older adults without CODs. Even so, they are at risk for negative health and psychosocial outcomes, including: 1064,1065 Thoughts of suicide and of death in general. Some medical issues (e.g., liver disease). Severe symptoms of depression. Being divorced, separated, or widowed. Substance misuse often makes the symptoms of a co-occurring mental disorder worse and harder to treat. For example, substance misuse can worsen cognitive symptoms of co-occurring mental disorders. Just like substance misuse, mental disorders can lead to diffculties with cognition. Cognitive symptoms can make it harder for older adults to recognize their substance misuse, 1066 which could reduce likelihood of seeking SUD treatment. Substance misuse, co-occurring mental disorders, and cognitive disorders are all related to one another. And they all have similar symptoms. If an older client has any one of these conditions, Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults screen for all three. (Screening measures for these conditions appear in Chapter 3 of this TIP .) Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often co-occur with substance misuse in older adults and negatively affect the brain. PTSD is less common in older people than MDD and GAD, but it does occur, especially in older military veterans. Be alert for these disorders in older clients who misuse substances and have cognitive diffculties. MDD and Depressive Symptoms MDD and depressive symptoms are both risk factors for and outcomes of substance misuse in older adults. In fact, MDD is one of the most commonly co-occurring mental disorders of older clients who misuse substances. 1067 A recent meta-analysis found that one in four people with dementia had clinically signifcant depressive symptoms. 1068 In a large sample of older adults with alcohol misuse, 29.7 percent reported having symptoms of depression. 1069 In this same study, rates of depression were especially high among older adults with two or more chronic health conditions (such as heart disease or diabetes). In these adults, alcohol misuse was fve times more common in those with depression than in those without depression. Whether MDD is a risk factor for dementia is unclear. It is also unknown whether having depression and substance misuse causes more cognitive problems than just having depression or substance misuse, but not both. 1070 Some research suggests that a relationship does exist between depression and cognitive disorders. 1071 For example: Adults with depression that starts earlier in life are at double the risk for dementia than adults who do not have depression. 1072 People with late-life depression are at a higher risk of certain types of dementia. 1073 Depression is not a normal part of aging. Do not ignore even mild symptoms of depression in older clients. 168 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment In one study, 70 percent of women ages 85 and older with depressive symptoms were diagnosed with MCI within 5 years, and 65 percent had dementia. 1074 Dementia risk seems higher in people with more frequent and severe depressive episodes. 1075 Anxiety Disorders About 10 to 15 percent of older adults meet criteria for an anxiety disorder. 1076,1077 Among the most common anxiety disorders in older people are GAD and specifc phobias. 1078 In Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), prevalence of any past-year anxiety disorder among adults ages 55 and older was 11.4 percent, that of GAD was 2.8 percent, and that of specifc phobias was 5.8 percent. 1079 Older adults with anxiety may be at an increased risk of substance misuse. 1080 Older adults living in the community, as well as those in SUD treatment, have higher rates of comorbid mental disorders, including anxiety, than older adults without substance misuse. 1081 In an analysis of data from Waves 1 and 2 of NESARC,1082 older adults with a past-year SUD had a signifcantly greater chance of also having persistent anxiety compared with older adults without an SUD. The risk of substance misuse in older people with anxiety may be even higher for older women. 1083 Anxiety symptoms in older adults can increase the risk of cognitive problems, especially with memory and learning. 1084 Anxiety disorders are also linked to other conditions that can affect cognition, including depression 1085 and substance misuse.1086 In a 2018 meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of clinically signifcant anxiety among people with dementia was 14 percent. 1087 Compared with depression, less is known about anxiety as a risk factor for dementia. Even so, the evidence shows: Among individuals newly diagnosed with dementia, about 31 percent previously had an anxiety diagnosis, compared with only 14 percent of older adults without dementia. 1088 An anxiety disorder almost triples the risk of dementia. 1089 People who have anxiety and depression are about 2.85 times more likely to have dementia. 1090 Anxiety appears to be a major predictor of cognitive problems in general and of dementia specifcally. 1091 This may be especially true for many older adults (ages 80 and older). When older adults with anxiety have cognitive problems, these problems are often with memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities. 1092 PTSD and Trauma Older people are at risk for PTSD and substance misuse, although the rate of PTSD in older people is low. For instance, in Wave 2 of NESARC, 3.5 percent of adults ages 55 and older were reported to have past-year PTSD. 1093 In another study that also looked at Wave 2 data from the same survey, about 22 percent of adults ages 60 and older who met some but not all criteria for PTSD had an SUD, and 27 percent of older adults who met full criteria for PTSD had an SUD. 1094 Older adults who met at least some criteria for PTSD had 1.6 times greater chances of having an SUD than older adults who met no PTSD criteria. It is unclear how common PTSD is in people with dementia. A meta-analysis examining rates of mental disorders among people with dementia noted a lack of research on PTSD specifcally. 1095 Based on very limited studies, the authors estimated the overall prevalence of PTSD in dementia to be 4.4 percent. Older adults who are military veterans also may be at risk for co-occurring PTSD and substance misuse. In a systematic literature review of studies about older veterans with PTSD, the prevalence of co-occurring SUDs ranged from about 1 percent to 11 percent. 1096 Take the time to learn whether older clients who misuse substances also have a history of trauma or abuse. (Please refer to \"Screening for PTSD, Trauma Symptoms, and Abuse\" in Chapter 3 of this TIP for additional information.) Also determine whether PTSD is present. A trauma-informed approach to the screening, assessment, and care of older clients who misuse substances can help Chapter 6 169 TIP 26 put clients at ease. It will create a setting in which clients are more likely to open up and share with you the details of their trauma. You can take a trauma-informed approach by: 1097,1098 Making sure clients feel safe in your program\u2014 both physically and mentally. Using a gentle and warm attitude. Staying open and nonjudgmental. This builds trust among providers, staff members, clients, and family members. Working with your clients in a cooperative, shared way to make treatment decisions together. This helps empower clients and reminds them that they have a voice in the care process. Letting clients know that it is normal and healthy to express emotions, whether positive or negative. This is especially useful with older clients because older adults may be more likely to shy away from discussing negative feelings or traumas. They may be more likely to talk about physical symptoms rather than emotional ones or to dismiss traumas as \"normal\" parts of life. 1099 Being responsive to racial, ethnic, and gender disparities that may affect your clients' health. Realize that clients may have specifc needs in these areas that can be addressed in the healing process. Offering peer support and referral to mutual-help programs. Working with someone who understands the lived experience of trauma and PTSD can be powerful for clients. Remembering to screen and assess clients for mental disorders and other conditions that co-occur with PTSD or trauma, such as depression and substance misuse. How Providers Can Help To help older adults with cognitive or co-occurring mental disorders related to substance misuse: Educate older clients and their caregivers about the defnitions and facts on co-occurring mental disorders and cognitive problems related to substance misuse. This includes making sure clients and caregivers understand that the \"safest\" level of alcohol use is none at all. No Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults amount of alcohol will be safe for older clients who take certain medications, have certain health conditions, or engage in certain activities (see Chapter 4). Screen older clients who misuse substances for co-occurring mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Screen older clients who misuse substances (especially alcohol) for co-occurring cognitive impairment. Older clients who take high doses of benzodiazepines or have been taking benzodiazepines long term also should be screened for cognitive problems. Interview clients, caregivers, and practitioners (with clients' permission) to determine whether changes in medications are leading to, or worsening, cognitive impairment. Offer clients drug and alcohol counseling, mental health services, or both, as appropriate. If your program does not offer these services, refer clients to a local program that does\u2014and, if possible, to one that is experienced in working with older clients who misuse substances. For clients who screen positive for cognitive problems, give referrals for full cognitive assessments, which should include indepth cognitive testing. Only behavioral health service providers with specifc training and experience can give these tests (a neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist). Offer resources and mental health services (or referrals for services) as needed to older clients who misuse substances, have cognitive disorders, or both; make such offers to their caregivers as well, if needed. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that healthcare providers screen for unhealthy alcohol use in adults ages 18 years or older and provide those who show risky or hazardous drinking with \"brief behavioral counseling interventions\" to reduce unhealthy alcohol use (www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryDraft/ unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions). 170 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment Screening for CODs and Cognitive Disorders Older clients in need of treatment or already in treatment for SUDs should be screened for disorders that co-occur with SUDs, such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as cognitive disorders. Screening Instruments This section discusses several screening measures for depression, anxiety, PTSD, trauma/abuse, and cognitive problems. Some age-appropriate measures appear in the Chapter 6 Appendix and the Chapter 3 Appendix. Consider your scope of practice before delivering these instruments. You may need training before you can give certain ones to clients. This is especially true for cognitive measures. Make sure you understand how to administer each instrument properly, how to interpret the score, and what follow-up is needed based on the score. If no one in your program can help you get the training you need, refer the client to another behavioral health service or healthcare provider who can perform the screening. Screening instrument for cognitive disorders For a client who may have cognitive impairment, use the Mini-Cog \u00a9. See Chapter 3 for a description of and link to this instrument. Screening instruments for depression Screen older clients who misuse substances, have cognitive disorders, or both for depression. Depression commonly co-occurs in older people who misuse substances. 1100,1101 This TIP discusses two well-researched depression screeners approved for use in older clients: The Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (15 item). The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Screening instruments for anxiety Older adults with anxiety are at increased risk for substance misuse, especially alcohol misuse and tobacco use. 1102 You can screen for anxiety using the: Geriatric Anxiety Scale. Penn State Worry Questionnaire. These measures have been approved for use with older adults. 1103,1104 Screening instruments for PTSD, trauma, and abuse PTSD or a history of trauma or abuse can increase the odds that an older person will misuse substances. 1105 In addition to asking older clients about their current and past history of trauma and abuse, use brief screening measures to further explore this area. For instance, you can use the: PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5. To screen for possible abuse, give the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index \u00a9. Interventions for Substance Misuse and Co-Occurring Mental/Cognitive Disorders Healthcare and behavioral health service providers have several options for helping older clients who misuse substances and have depression, anxiety, PTSD, or cognitive problems: Educate clients about substance misuse, its effects on older people, and what \"safe\" or \"nonrisky\" use means. For some older clients, education alone helps them end their substance misuse. Provide drug and alcohol counseling to help clients reduce or stop their use of substances. If your program cannot offer specialized addiction services, make a referral to another local program that can. (Learn more about AUD treatment and drug use disorder treatment for older adults in Chapters 4 and 5 of this TIP , respectively.) Brief counseling approaches, such as motivational interviewing, can help older adults reduce substance use. 1106 Brief approaches can be adapted to clients' level of cognitive impairment. 1107 Chapter 6 171 TIP 26 Find out whether your client has an interest in other nonmedication treatments, such as therapy that involves art, music, or animals. Some research suggests that these \"alternative\" therapies can help people with dementia reduce their anxiety, restlessness, and apathy. 1108,1109,1110 Help your clients live healthier lives. A healthy lifestyle may help slow the rate at which cognitive problems get worse over time. For instance, you can: 1111,1112 -Encourage clients to stay physically active through light exercise (e.g., walking, yoga, stretching programs). -Remind clients that mental activity is just as important as physical activity. Offer them ways to stay mentally active through reading, using computers/the Internet, or doing crossword puzzles and other \"brain games.\" -Offer behavioral techniques to help clients who are not getting enough quality sleep each night (like teaching good sleep hygiene and providing advice on reducing nighttime stimuli). 1113 -Encourage clients to spend time socializing with family, friends, and close others as well as develop social networks (for clients who do not already have or use them). -Teach clients the importance of a healthy diet that meets their nutritional needs. A healthy diet can improve other physical problems affecting cognition (e.g., high blood pressure, obesity). -Support clients' efforts to reduce or stop substance use; give information and interventions related to tobacco cessation. -Find out whether clients have hobbies or interests that remain enjoyable. If not, help them identify pleasant activities to try to improve their quality of life and lift their spirits. Make referrals to healthcare providers who can work with clients and their caregivers to decide whether medication treatment is needed. Medication treatment may be useful for certain types of SUDs, such as AUD, tobacco use disorder, and opioid use disorder. (See Chapters 4 and 5 for more information.) Medications may also be useful for cognitive problems. They Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults cannot cure dementia, but they may be able to help reduce some of its symptoms. 1114 Be supportive and positive for your clients. One way to do this is by referring them to peer recovery or mutual-help groups, such as Seniors in Sobriety. (See \"Chapter 6 Resources.\") These groups can increase clients' chances of achieving long-term abstinence, plus help keep clients socially active. Keep on hand a list of local peer recovery support programs to present to clients. Supply informational materials in your program's waiting room and meeting rooms (e.g., bulletin board or display case fyers, brochures, handouts) and offer these resources to your clients. Addressing Caregiver Concerns Many people provide unpaid care to older adults with whom they have a personal relationship. These caregivers, typically signifcant others like family members, friends, and neighbors, provide a wide range of services and supports to older adults, including: 1115,1116 Help with ADLs, such as bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring (in and out of a wheelchair, for instance). Help with instrumental ADLs, such as transportation, housework, food preparation, shopping, using communication devices, and managing fnances. Emotional and spiritual support. Financial help. Shared housing. Help with communication and advocacy with service providers. Help with navigating service systems. Help with decision making related to healthcare and fnancial matters. Monitoring of health problems. Medication administration and monitoring. Medical/nursing tasks, like injections, tube feeding, and care of catheters, colostomies, and wounds. 172 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment Caregivers may carry out these activities intermittently, part time, or full time, including from a distance. The physical, mental, emotional, and fnancial challenges of these caregiving responsibilities can result in \"caregiver burden.\" 1117 Caregiving for older adults who misuse substances, have cognitive disorders, or both can be very stressful. This stress can make it hard for caregivers to function well at work, maintain social relationships, and take care of themselves. 1118 Behavioral health service, healthcare, and social service providers need to be alert for caregiver stress. Stress can negatively affect the quality of attention the caregiver gives to your client. For instance, caregiver stress has been linked to a higher risk of elder abuse. 1119 Also, caregiver stress is associated with higher mortality.1120 And caregivers may themselves be at risk for developing chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and back pain. 1121 Caregiver stress may even lead to caregiver substance misuse. Caregivers who feel high levels of stress may need behavioral health services to build better coping skills, access resources, address their concerns, and improve their mood. Caregivers may not tell you outright that they are feeling stressed or frustrated. Make a point to ask caregivers directly about any diffculties they are having, including mental and physical symptoms. Here are some examples of questions you can ask to help caregivers open up: \"I know caring for your wife must be very diffcult. How are you holding up?\" \"What do you do for fun or to 'let off steam'?\" \"Who do you turn to when you need support?\" \"Have you spoken with other caregivers who care for someone with dementia? Many caregivers fnd it very helpful to talk to someone who really 'gets it.' May I give you some information about local caregiver support groups?\" \"Are you familiar with Al-Anon? Many adult children of people with alcohol addiction fnd their meetings useful. Would you like me to give you their contact information?\" Helping Caregivers of Clients Who Misuse Substances Caregivers may not always see the alcohol or drug use as a problem. They may feel guilty asking the person to stop using. Comments like the following are not unusual: \"My George has had a beer after work every night for 40 years. I'm not telling him to stop now.\" \"It's none of my business if she has a couple of glasses of wine. At her age, what's the harm, really?\" \"I feel bad asking my brother to stop smoking. His cigars are his one last pleasure in life.\" Many caregivers may think that substance use is harmless. But for aging adults, that is not necessarily true. You can help caregivers by: Sharing facts about alcohol or drug use in older adults and the importance of avoiding illicit drugs, prescription medication misuse, and harmful drug-drug interactions. Teaching them new coping skills and offering interventions. This could include: -Helping caregivers share their feelings of stress or concern with your older clients. Talking to older adults about their substance misuse can be hard. You can help caregivers learn how to express their thoughts and feelings in a way that is healthy and helpful. -Teaching caregivers better ways to handle your older clients' upsetting behaviors. Some older adults who misuse substances can \"act out,\" become angry, or behave in ways that are stressful to caregivers. Teach caregivers how to better manage these intense emotions and behaviors. -Offering caregivers mental health services or referral to treatment. Helping them fnd peer recovery support groups (e.g., caregiver support groups). Encouraging them to join support groups. Refer them to local mutual-help groups for family members of people who misuse substances, like Al-Anon and Adult Children of Alcoholics. Chapter 6 173 TIP 26 Helping Caregivers of Clients With Dementia Caring for individuals with dementia can have negative psychosocial and physical effects. For example, such caregiving can negatively affect sleep, blood pressure, mood, and social functioning. 1122 A caregiver may use alcohol or benzodiazepines to try to control an older adult's behavior. For instance, a caregiver may give alcohol to help the older adult sleep or to calm down the older adult when he or she is upset and angry. This is not recommended, is unsafe, and can worsen these behaviors. Tell caregivers not to use alcohol or benzodiazepines in this way. Supports for people caring for older adults with dementia can include: 1123,1124,1125 Education-based programs to help caregivers: -Learn about the disease. -See the importance of taking care of themselves and reducing their own stress. -Better handle the older adults' negative behaviors (e.g., acting \"out of control\"). Psychosocial services that provide: -Stress management skills. -Positive thinking strategies. -Tips on proper self-care (e.g., healthy eating, sound sleeping). -Chances for caregivers to share frustration, fear, sadness, and other negative feelings. -Problem-solving and other coping techniques. Participation in caregiver support groups\u2014 especially ones that focus on caregiving for someone with dementia. These groups let caregivers share common experiences and learn from one another; for instance, the Alzheimer's Association offers caregiver support groups (www.alz.org/events/ event_search?etid=2&cid=0). Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Helping Caregivers of Clients With Both Substance Misuse and Dementia Anecdotal reports give some indication of the needs and problems faced by people caring for older adults with both substance misuse and dementia. These caregivers likely face signifcant stressors. Greater levels of caregiver burden are present in caregivers of older adults with alcohol misuse who also have certain behavioral symptoms common in dementia\u2014disinhibition (or \"out of control\" behavior) and irritability\u2014 compared with caregivers of older adults with those same behavioral symptoms but no alcohol misuse. 1126 Research about the burden of caring for people with multiple, complex, chronic conditions is also telling. For instance, having more than one chronic illness is linked to: 1127 Being highly dependent on a caregiver. A higher risk of death. More time spent in the hospital. Poor quality of life. Greater healthcare costs. A caregiver of an older adult with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders may have unique challenges and special needs beyond those of caregivers of people with mental disorders only, including: 1128 Feeling unable to leave the older adult alone. Being more likely to fear the older adult will hurt himself or herself or others. Feeling less close to the older adult. Having more problems getting the older adult to take medications. Having more problems fnding treatment. Feeling a higher level of emotional stress related to caregiving. Feeling that caregiving threatens his or her health. Feeling lonely as a caregiver. Having trouble talking with others about the older adult's mental health needs. Wanting help from a care coordinator or care manager. Wanting legal assistance. 174 Chapter 6 TIP 26 Chapter 6\u2014Substance Misuse and Cognitive Impairment Because of these concerns, caregivers for clients such as these may be especially in need of your help and resources. Be sure to reach out to them! Summary Substance misuse in older adults can increase the chances of having cognitive problems. It also can increase the chances of having co-occurring mental disorders with symptoms similar to cognitive disorders or mental disorders that cause changes in cognition and could be mistaken for a cognitive disorder. These co-occurring mental disorders include depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Behavioral health service and healthcare providers need to be aware of these other conditions and use screening instruments wisely to ensure that all older adult clients receive the right diagnosis and timely treatment. Treatments can address clients' and caregivers' mood, cognition, and functioning. Positive changes through treatment are possible for older adults who are dealing with substance misuse, mental disorders, and cognitive decline.

Providers can help older adults develop and maintain a social network that promotes recovery and wellness. Older adults have to increase their health literacy to maintain recovery and prevent relapse. Providers need to engage older adults in illness management and relapse prevention activities specifc to substance misuse with a focus on health and wellness. Providers can help older adults feel more empowered by understanding the normal developmental challenges of aging and age-specifc strategies for promoting resilience and setting goals. Chapter 7 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will most beneft healthcare, behavioral health service, and social service providers who work with older adults (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, alcohol and drug counselors, and peer recovery support specialists). It explains how older adults who misuse substances can beneft from wellness strategies that support relapse prevention, ongoing recovery, and better overall health. The keys to wellness for this group are having strong social networks and participating in health and wellness activities that support recovery. The high prevalence of isolation in older adults who misuse substances can negatively affect cognitive functioning and reduce well-being. Older adults who lack family ties or social networks may fnd maintaining recovery from substance misuse diffcult. Healthcare, behavioral health service, and social service providers can help older adults who misuse substances reduce isolation and improve recovery outcomes by promoting broader social networks. Maintaining recovery from substance use can be harder for older adults who have trouble understanding and using health information. It may also be more diffcult for those with limited self-management skills (e.g., diffculty engaging in regular exercise, healthy eating, or medication adherence). Medical conditions common in later life can also reduce functioning. Providers can engage older clients in skill-building and wellness activities that will support resilience and overall health while also reducing the likelihood of a return to substance misuse. Organization of Chapter 7 of This TIP Chapter 7 addresses promoting social support and other health and wellness strategies relevant to older adults in recovery from substance misuse. The frst section of Chapter 7 describes the importance of social support in promoting and maintaining health, wellness, and recovery among older adults who misuse substances. Types of positive social support, the impact of social isolation on health and wellness, and strategies for promoting and maintaining social support are examined. 181 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults The second section addresses how to promote other wellness strategies for older adults. This section specifcally focuses on assessing and promoting health and wellness for older adults in recovery. It addresses health and wellness activities relevant to older adults, strategies for promoting health and wellness, illness self-management and relapse prevention approaches, and strategies for EXHIBIT 7.1. Key Terms promoting resilience and empowerment among older adults, including goal setting. The fnal section identifes targeted resources to support your practice, some of which appear in full in the Chapter 7 Appendix; additional resources appear in Chapter 9 of this TIP . Exhibit 7.1 provides defnitions for key terms that appear in Chapter 7. Addiction*: The most severe form of substance use disorder (SUD), associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Age-specifc: Treatment approaches and practices specifcally developed for older adults (e.g., an older adult specialty group in a mixed-age SUD treatment program). Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living (ADLs), including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 1134 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Health literacy: The ability to understand and use health information to make informed choices about health, wellness, and recovery. Illicit substances: Illicit substances include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, and prescription medications that are taken other than as prescribed (e.g., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives). Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches or peer recovery support specialists), mutual-help groups consist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no offcial connection to treatment programs. Most are self-supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) are the most widespread and well researched type of mutual-help groups, other groups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affliated with a religion or church (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART [Self-Management and Recovery Training] Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Peer recovery support specialist: Someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training. Peer recovery support specialists may be paid professionals or volunteers. They are distinguished from members of mutual-help groups because they maintain contact with treatment staff. They offer experiential knowledge that treatment staff often lack. Peer support: The use of peer recovery support specialists (e.g., someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training) to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Continued on next page 182 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults Continued Recovery*: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self- directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome them and regain health and social function. This is called remission. When those positive changes and values become part of a voluntarily adopted lifestyle, that is called being in recovery. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Relapse*: A return to substance use after a signifcant period of abstinence. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease or disorder. The ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defnes remission as present in people who previously met SUD criteria but no longer meet any SUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving). 1135 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Resilience: The ability to rebound from adversity, skillfully address age-specifc developmental tasks, and respond creatively to stress and grow from those experiences. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (e.g., underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to DSM-5, 1136 SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function and impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. A mild SUD is generally equivalent to what previous editions of DSM called substance abuse; a moderate or severe SUD is generally equivalent to what was formerly called substance dependence. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction. surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Social Support: The Key to Health, Wellness, and Recovery People with signifcant social support tend to have healthier lifestyles, engage in fewer behaviors that risk health (e.g., substance misuse), and be more active. Older adults in long-term recovery from substance misuse have better outcomes when their social supports promote abstinence. 1137,1138 Three major components of positive support for older adults are: Family and friends. Family members often provide most of an older adult's basic social support. Strong friendships and neighborhood supports can also be important to older adults. Friends often provide emotional support, and neighbors can offer immediate help in an emergency. Chapter 7 183 TIP 26 Mutual-help groups. Mutual-help groups such as AA and NA can support abstinence and foster new social connections, a sense of belonging, and healthy lifestyles. Religious or spiritual supports. Participation in religious or spiritual fellowships can decrease social isolation and is associated with health and wellness. 1139 In the 2015 World Values Survey, more than 75 percent of adults in the United States over age 60 responded that they considered themselves to be religious and sometimes or often contemplated the meaning of life (an indicator of a spiritual focus). 1140 Many religions discourage drug use and alcohol use or misuse.1141,1142 Involvement in religious and spiritual organizations can give older adults a sense of meaning, optimism, and self-esteem, lessening the impact of stressful life events like the death of a signifcant other. 1143 A sense of meaning and optimism can help maintain recovery from substance misuse. The quality and diversity of older adults' social networks matter more than size in promoting health, well-being, and recovery and in lowering risk of substance misuse. 1144,1145 For example, tense relationships with family members can increase stress, which can negatively affect older adults' health and avoidance of relapse. In addition, too much support from children, although well-meaning, may increase older adults' dependence and reduce their sense of self-effcacy and well-being. Conversely, work colleagues, social contacts at senior centers, and behavioral health service and healthcare providers can be additional sources of emotional support. Mutual-help groups such as AA and NA can provide older adults with a stable source of friendships and enhance the diversity of their social networks. The consensus panel recommends that you assess the number of social connections older adults have and also gauge the quality and diversity of those connections and how they promote wellness and recovery. (See the Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Chapter 7 Appendix for the Social Network Map for assessing and discussing social networks with older adults.) Social Isolation Social isolation, linked to loneliness, is common in older adults. Their social networks narrow because of retirement, decreased physical functioning, and deaths of spouses, intimate partners, and friends. 1146 A spouse or intimate partner is essential for many older adults' well-being. The death of a spouse puts older adults at high risk for social isolation, and may decrease life expectancy for men. 1147 Loneliness is linked with substance misuse in some older women.1148 ADDRESSING GRIEF Older adults may experience multiple losses in a short time. Grief is a highly individualized experience; coping strategies need to be fexible and adaptive as you help clients explore feelings of grief. Grief has no set timeframe. People do not \"get over\" the death of a loved one. Daily life continues as people integrate the experience of loss into their lived experience. As integration happens, the disorientation and disruption initially experienced after a death subsides, and older adults can open up to new possibilities. 1149 You can provide a safe and supportive environment for clients to explore their feelings, help them remember their loved one, offer information about the grief process, identify struggles with coping, encourage them to tap into their own strengths and wisdom, and help them integrate the loss. 1150 If clients experience prolonged or complicated grief that interferes substantially with daily functioning\u2014or if they have persistent suicidal ideation\u2014consider referral to psychiatric evaluation or to a trained grief counselor. Other factors that can add to social isolation for older adults include family members living far away, lack of transportation, cognitive decline, living alone or in unsafe neighborhoods, 1151 poverty, physical disability,1152 and disruption of existing social networks via relocation to long-term care facilities. 184 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults Social isolation in older adults has been linked to: Increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as alcohol misuse and smoking. 1153 Increased risk of depression.1154 Cognitive decline and risk for developing dementia. 1155 Poor overall health, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, sleep disturbances, and sedentary lifestyles. 1156,1157 Impairment in executive functioning, which makes it hard to engage in health-promoting physical activities 1158 or follow a relapse prevention plan. Increased risk for falls, rehospitalization, and death from all causes, including suicide among men. 1159 SOCIAL ISOLATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS IN METHADONE MAINTENANCE TREATMENT Older adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) may experience even more social isolation than older adults with other types of SUDs. Older adults who have used opioids for many years may have severed ties with family and friends and lost friends who overdosed. People who are in MMT also tend to be secretive about their history of opioid use and their status in treatment because of negative attitudes of friends, family, and society. Recent evidence suggests that people with a history of OUD tend to self-isolate because of: 1160 Past experiences of being taken advantage of. Fear of future loss. Desire to avoid depression/grief at death of friends/family. Past experiences of domestic violence. You may need to address these concerns before you can work collaboratively with clients to build a nonusing social network that supports MMT as a pathway of recovery for older adults. The consensus panel recommends that you screen older adults for social isolation and help them learn about the link between social isolation and substance misuse as part of your efforts to educate clients on health literacy. (See the Chapter 7 Appendix for a discussion of the Lubben Social Network Scale, a social isolation screening tool for older adults.) Promoting Social Support for Older Adults A lifespan perspective suggests that social networks change over a person's lifetime. One of the unique aspects of older adults' social networks is that those networks naturally shrink as people age and their close family members and friends die. This shrinkage may also occur because older adults become increasingly aware of the limits of time left in life and choose to focus on the most rewarding relationships. Doing so may help them emphasize emotional support while deemphasizing less satisfying relationships. 1161 A high degree of emotional closeness is associated with high levels of quality of life and well-being for older adults. 1162 Strategies for improving social support for older adults in recovery from substance misuse should focus on expanding network size, increasing network diversity, and deepening the emotional closeness of network connections. Interventions to decrease social isolation and improve well-being should be adaptable to older adults' needs and interests, include their input about what works for them, and actively versus passively engage them (e.g., playing cards with friends versus watching TV together). 1163 The consensus panel recommends the following interventions to promote social support for older adults who misuse substances. Engage family members and other caregivers in recovery support. Perhaps the most important social support for older adults is frequent contact with family members (or other caregivers) who support their recovery. Help foster positive social contact between family members and older adults who misuse substances by: Chapter 7 185 TIP 26 Involving family members and other caregivers in older adults' treatment (with express consent from clients). Educating clients, caregivers, and families about the importance of emotional and instrumental support for older adults' recovery. (An example of instrumental support is providing rides to appointments.) Educating caregivers about skillful ways to provide support. Educating family members about the importance of visiting the older adult when he or she is not misusing substances, rather than visiting only during substance-related crises (e.g., binge episodes). Recommending that family members and other caregivers participate in family support groups for caregivers and mutual-help groups for family members such as Al-Anon. When family members are not nearby geographically or older adults are homebound, explore the possibility of clients' connecting with family members regularly via phone or video calling services. Studies show that frequent contact between older adults and family members via online communication applications decreases loneliness and increases social contact for the older adults. 1164 See Chapter 4 of this TIP for more information about family and caregiver involvement. Enlist neighborhood supports. Social cohesion in neighborhoods is another factor that promotes the health and well-being of older adults. For example, when neighbors provide instrumental support for older men and emotional support for older women, the older adults attain better physical health and mental well-being. 1165 You can help older adults build up this support by: Asking which neighbors they are close to. Helping them identify which neighbors have provided which kinds of support to them in the past. Asking them which neighbors they think would be supportive of their recovery efforts. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Many communities have befriending programs that send \"friendly visitors\"\u2014who are trained volunteers\u2014to the homes of older adults who have no close ties to neighbors or nearby relatives, or who are homebound. Visitors spend an hour or two a week with older adults to provide companionship, friendship, and linkage to health and wellness resources. They can often identify signs of substance misuse in the older adults they visit and help link these older adults to treatment resources. Contact your local Area Agency on Aging (AAA; see Resource Alert) to fnd out whether it or another organization in your community has a friendly visitor program. RESOURCE ALERT: AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AAAs' mission is to help older adults age with independence and dignity at home and in the community through a coordinated system of services and supports (https://eldercare.acl. gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx). Established by the Older Americans Act (OAA) in 1973, AAAs now number 622 nationwide. The OAA was amended in 1978 to include services to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Each AAA provides core services that address nutrition, disease prevention, health promotion, caregiver services, and older adult rights. Many AAAs also provide Medicare counseling, transportation, fall prevention and gentle exercise classes, adult daycare programs, social/ recreational classes and groups, and other services geared to local community needs. AAAs are also a great place for older adults to volunteer. Many states have Aging and Disability Resource Centers, often associated with AAAs, which can also provide specifc community resources for services and supports to older adults and individuals with disabilities. Go to https://eldercare.acl.gov and put in your ZIP Code to fnd the AAA in your community. 186 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults In rare cases, friends and family members may commit elder abuse.1166 If you think such mistreatment is occurring, screen your older client for elder abuse (see Chapter 3 of this TIP). Link clients to social and behavioral health support groups. In addition to linking your older clients to mutual-help groups such as AA, NA, or SMART Recovery, which can provide social as well as recovery support, refer them to social and behavioral health support groups in the community. These can range from smoking cessation groups to walking clubs to depression support groups. Create a list of organizations that offer support groups for older adults and actively link your client to one or more groups that are appropriate, accessible, and acceptable to him or her. (See Chapter 4 of this TIP for more information on active linkage to community resources and referral management.) Agencies and organizations with support groups that may be helpful to older adults include: Recovery support organizations. Senior centers. Adult day health services. Community and private hospitals. Healthcare, behavioral health service, and social service programs for older adults. Veterans programs. Coalitions and advocacy groups for older adults. Assisted living facilities. Faith-based organizations. Community centers. Link clients to peer recovery support specialists. An important strategy for increasing social support for older adults in recovery is to link them to peer recovery support services. 1167,1168,1169 Peer recovery support specialists work in a variety of settings, including addiction treatment programs, faith-based institutions, and recovery community organizations (RCOs). 1170 (For information on RCOs, see www.recoveryanswers.org/resource/ recovery-community-centers.) Peer recovery support specialists offer four types of social support: emotional, instrumental, informational, and affliational (i.e., facilitating contact with others to strengthen social networks). 1171 Linking older adults to peer recovery support specialists can: Increase and diversify older adults' social networks. Introduce older adults to the culture of recovery. Facilitate engagement and active participation in community-based mutual-help groups. Prevent relapse by helping older adults stay connected to mutual-help groups. Peer recovery support specialists who work with older adults should have age-specifc training and a commitment to working with this age group. These specialists are often older adults who can share their own experiences with recovery at this stage of life. See Chapter 2 of this TIP for more information on key strategies for providing support to older adults. Educate clients about social media and online social networking support. Online technologies\u2014 including social media applications and social networking websites\u2014may be an important way for older adults to expand their support networks. Videoconferencing and use of social networking, educational and informational websites, and online discussion forums can reduce social isolation and improve social support, self-effcacy, and empowerment among older adults. 1172 In addition, information exchange about specifc issues\u2014such as substance misuse, recovery resources, chronic illness management, and health and wellness resources\u2014in online social networks and discussion forums can boost well-being for older adults. 1173 Many addiction-focused mutual-help groups offer online meetings through chat rooms, web-based forums, and telephone or videoconferencing applications. Many baby boomers already use smartphones and online technologies. About 42 percent of adults ages 65 and older own smartphones, up from 18 percent in 2013; 67 percent use the Internet. 1174 However, barriers to social media and mobile technology use include: 1175,1176,1177 Chapter 7 187 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults The cost of owning a computer, tablet, or cell phone and data or Internet access fees. Lack of broadband infrastructure in rural and tribal areas. Concerns about privacy and what happens to personal information once it is posted on the web. Decline in cognitive and physical functioning, which hinders use. For instance, older adults may have physical or cognitive barriers in reading webpages that do not have universal accessibility, or diffculties using features of the device, like buttons on a cell phone or touchscreens. Help older clients who are curious about or interested in trying online technologies for social support: Access basic information about using online technologies safely (e.g., protecting personal information, avoiding scams; for more information, see the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's [SAMHSA] TIP 60, Using Technology-Based Therapeutic Tools in Behavioral Health Services). Problem-solve ways to overcome access barriers (Chapter 4 offers problem-solving strategies). Learn about local and online resources that are appropriate and acceptable to them. For example, senior centers, libraries, community colleges, community centers, AARP , Senior.net learning centers, and adult learning programs are potential sources of free or low-cost educational programs to help older adults learn how to use a computer and social media websites and applications. Ask for support from family members or tech-savvy friends who can help set up a computer, tablet, or cell phone; teach them how to safely use social media and other apps; and provide ongoing support in their use of technologies. Specifc websites offering assistance with social media are listed in the folllowing Resource Alert. RESOURCE ALERT: CONNECTING OLDER ADULTS WITH SOCIAL MEDIA SUPPORTS The Staying Connected: Technology Options for Older Adults brochure from Eldercare Locator (https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/ Resources/Brochures/docs/N4A_Tech_Brochure_ P06_high.pdf ) introduces older adults to types of social media and their benefts. It includes basic information on how to set up a Facebook account and how to use free video calling services like Skype. Lifeline Support (www.lifelinesupport.org) provides information about a Federal Communications Commission program that offers eligible individuals fnancial assistance for Internet or cell phone services. Some older adults living in retirement communities or long-term care facilities have a built-in social network that facilitates drinking. 1178 Older adults in such settings may perceive drinking as a pleasurable or necessary aspect of socializing with their fellow residents. If you have older clients who misuse alcohol to ft in to their residential setting, help them learn to feel comfortable saying \"no\" to too much\u2014or any\u2014alcohol in social situations. If you have older clients who enjoy the social aspects of drinking in these settings but engage in alcohol misuse, educate them about the importance of reducing their alcohol intake. 1179 Promoting Wellness Strategies for Older Adults This section reviews the eight dimensions of wellness and how to explore wellness from a client-centered perspective. It then examines strategies for promoting wellness, illness self-management and relapse prevention approaches, and strategies for promoting resilience and empowerment relevant to older adults in recovery from substance misuse. 188 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults What Is Wellness for Older Adults in Recovery? Wellness is not simply abstinence from alcohol or drugs or the absence of illness or stress; it is being in good physical, emotional, and mental health. 1180 To better promote wellness and recovery in older adults, effective strategies should include a focus on illness self-management and relapse prevention and an emphasis on health potential. 1181 SAMHSA has identifed eight dimensions of wellness 1182 (Exhibit 7.2) that further a person's health, well-being, and recovery from substance misuse and mental disorders: Emotional\u2014Coping effectively with life and creating satisfying relationships Environmental\u2014Occupying pleasant, stimulating environments that support well-being Financial\u2014Being satisfed with current and future fnancial situations Intellectual\u2014Recognizing creative abilities and fnding ways to expand knowledge and skills Occupational\u2014Personal satisfaction and enrichment from one's work Physical\u2014Recognizing the need for physical activity, healthy foods, and sleep Social\u2014Developing a sense of connection, belonging, and a well-developed support system Spiritual\u2014Expanding a sense of purpose and meaning in life The consensus panel recommends that you explore all of these dimensions of wellness as a way to help older adults sustain their recovery from substance misuse. Talk with clients about their own wellness goals in each of the eight dimensions. (See \"Collaborative Goal Setting\" in this chapter for more information.) This will help you understand what wellness means to each client and open the conversation about ways to develop health and wellness in recovery. (See the Chapter 7 Appendix for the Health Enhancement Lifestyle tool to assess older adults' health and wellness.) For older adults in retirement, occupational wellness may be more about satisfaction and enrichment from nonpaid work such as volunteering in the community or a satisfying hobby like gardening or painting. EXHIBIT 7.2. SAMHSA Wellness Wheel Reprinted from material in the public domain. 1183 Promoting Health and Wellness in Recovery You can promote health and wellness among older adults in recovery from substance misuse by exploring obstacles to recovery, understanding their perspectives on health and wellness, and supporting their interest in and readiness to engage in activities that maximize health and wellness. The consensus panel recommends the strategies discussed below, which apply to diverse clinical and service settings, for promoting wellness among older adults in recovery. Chapter 7 189 TIP 26 General Wellness Promotion Strategies Reduce fear, shame, guilt, and defensiveness related to substance misuse. Older adults may feel shame and guilt about acknowledging that they misuse substances. The frst step in helping them achieve better health and wellness is to address their misconceptions about substance misuse and any fears they may have about treatment and the recovery process. One helpful strategy is to discuss substance misuse in a nonjudgmental way as a health issue like any other chronic illness (e.g., diabetes). Also express understanding and compassion to help older adults manage their fears and uncertainties Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults about recovery from substance misuse and ways to engage in wellness activities to improve their health and well-being. 1184 Identify wellness activities. Use the table in Exhibit 7.3 with clients to identify wellness activities that they fnd accessible, acceptable, and appropriate. Introduce the table by describing the eight dimensions of wellness and give some examples of activities in each domain. Then brainstorm with clients to identify specifc activities in each domain that ft their preferences and wellness goals. With express consent from clients, ask supportive family members for suggestions on activities. EXHIBIT 7.3. Identifying Wellness Activities DOMAINS EXAMPLES CLIENT IDEAS Emotional Join a recovery or other support group; engage in storytelling with family or friends; keep a life history journal. Environmental Make home modifcations to age in place; create a quiet space at home; plant a fower box; seek \"senior-friendly\" safe housing. Financial Organize fnancial documents; seek fnancial planning assistance. Intellectual Join a book club; take an adult education or senior college class; learn a new skill; mentor a youth; teach a course or workshop. Occupational Volunteer (e.g., become an AA or NA sponsor); get involved in advocacy initiatives; participate actively in a new or old hobby. Physical Exercise by walking, dancing, swimming, or doing yoga or tai chi; eat healthy foods; develop a healthy sleep routine. Social Go on group outings, such as to museums or historical sites; join a bridge club; take a cooking class. Spiritual Join a faith-based or spiritual fellowship; meditate or pray; read inspirational material. 190 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults Strategies To Increase Motivation Increase motivation to change health risk behaviors and participate in wellness activities through motivational interviewing (MI). MI is a nonconfrontational, respectful approach that can effectively help older adults resolve ambivalence about change and increase motivation to change a target behavior. 1185 MI strategies can help older adults reduce alcohol consumption and tobacco use, improve general health, increase physical activity and exercise, improve diet, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, lose weight, and prevent disease. 1186,1187 MI strategies can help older adults change health risk behaviors like intentional or unintentional misuse of prescription medications, and resolve ambivalence about participating in wellness activities. Use the following MI strategies to help older clients identify and plan for achieving target behaviors that reduce health risk, improve wellness, and sustain recovery from substance misuse: Identify a specifc target behavior that the client is willing to explore (e.g., attending an educational session about the health risks of medication misuse for older adults or calling the local senior center to fnd out about a tai chi class). The more specifc the target behavior, the more likely you and the older adult will be able to work together toward achieving the client's change goal. Apply MI communication skills (e.g., OARS\u2014 open questions, affrmations, refective listening, and summarization) to shape the conversation with clients to help them resolve ambivalence about change. (See the Chapter 7 Appendix for an example of using OARS.) Emphasize change talk through refective listening. Help the client create a change plan for each target behavior by writing down the change goal and a timeframe for achieving that goal. (The \"Collaborative Goal Setting\" section has more information.) Follow up with the client to see whether the change plan is working or needs adjustment. For more on MI, see SAMHSA's update of TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Use Disorder Treatment (https://store.samhsa. gov/product/TIP-35-Enhancing-Motivation-for - Change-in-Substance-Use-Disorder-Treatment/ PEP19-02-01-003). Educational Strategies To Address Nutrition, Exercise, and Fall Prevention Provide education on nutrition, exercise, and fall prevention. Access to health information, a key component of health literacy, enables people to better manage their health and sustain recovery. Three key elements of preventive care for older adults in recovery from substance misuse are nutrition, exercise, and fall prevention. You don't need to be an expert in nutrition or ftness to provide older adults with accurate information about health. Just knowing a few things about these elements of wellness for older adults can help you get the conversation started. Advise older clients to check with their healthcare provider before starting or dramatically changing their exercise routine or diet. Begin by educating yourself. Explore the resources listed in the Resource Alert below for information on nutrition, exercise, and fall prevention for older adults. Then take a client-centered approach to client education and information exchange using these strategies: Ask older clients what they know about nutrition, exercise, and fall prevention for people their age. Provide small chunks of information that are personally relevant to older clients; use visual aids. Ask clients what they think of this information and how it affects their level of interest in or readiness to engage in health promotion activities. Chapter 7 191 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Develop an individualized change plan. If the information has an impact and clients are ready to act, brainstorm activities that they think are fun, easy, accessible, and personally relevant. Follow up at the next visit. Ask clients what worked and did not work, and help them adjust the change plan while making progress toward change goals. Client education is a process of information exchange over time, not a single event. Information exchange can help you build a closer relationship with clients through a deeper understanding of their own experiences with making health behavior changes. RESOURCE ALERT: OLDER ADULT NUTRITION, EXERCISE, AND FALL PREVENTION The National Institute on Aging's (NIA) Health Topics A-Z webpage (www.nia.nih.gov/health/ topics) offers easy-to-read information specifc to older adults on a range of health topics, including healthy eating, exercise, and fall prevention. Engaging American Indian/Alaska Native Elders in Fall Prevention Programs (www.ncoa. org/resources/engaging-american-indianalaska-native-elders-falls-prevention-programs), a National Council on Aging tip sheet, offers culturally responsive, practical strategies for American Indian and Alaska Native elders on fall prevention. Strategies for Complementary Therapies, Spirituality, and Ancillary Services Encourage the informed use of complementary therapies and activities. Complementary and integrative medicine techniques can be categorized into three groups\u2014natural products (e.g., vitamins, herbal products), mind-body practices (e.g., meditation, yoga), and other health approaches (e.g., homeopathy, naturopathy). (See \"Resource Alert: Complementary and Integrative Health for Older Adults.\") Many complementary therapies and activities are appropriate for helping older adults maintain good health and well-being in ongoing recovery. For example, owning or interacting with a pet (e.g., in animal-assisted therapy) can increase physical activity, improve cardiovascular functioning, enhance socialization, lower blood pressure, and decrease loneliness in some older adults. 1188 Tai chi, a low-impact exercise and meditative movement, may prevent falls by improving balance, strength, mobility, and fexibility. 1189,1190 It may also help older adults sleep better.1191 Practicing mindfulness has many mental, emotional, spiritual, and health benefts that can enhance older adults' sense of well-being. Mindfulness has been widely adapted and studied in the United States as a strategy for stress reduction and healthy coping. Mindfulness helps people develop open, nonjudgmental attention to present-moment experience. Older adults can use mindfulness skills to cope with stresses like physical pain and fnancial worries. Mindfulness may also increase older adults' social support, well-being, and ability to regulate emotional states like depression, anger, and anxiety. 1192 You can incorporate mindfulness practices in work with older adults or refer your clients to local programs that teach mindfulness. For more on mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs, see the website of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at www. umassmed.edu/cfm. Other complementary therapies and wellness activities appropriate for older adults in recovery include: Gentle or senior-friendly yoga. Dance and movement therapy. Low-impact ftness programs. Swimming and water therapy. Meditation. The consensus panel recommends that you explore the benefts and potential downsides of complementary therapies with your older clients and work collaboratively with them to fnd the right ft based on cost, level of physical and cognitive functioning needed to participate successfully, age-specifc adaptations, and ease of access. 192 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults Explore the spiritual dimension of wellness and recovery. As mentioned previously, participation in religious or spiritual fellowship can expand the social dimension of wellness for older adults. For example, one recent study found that more frequent attendance at church among adults ages 50 and older is associated with a sense of belonging and greater spiritual support, which are in turn associated with a greater likelihood of positive self-report of health. 1193 Engagement in religious activities (e.g., praying, attending religious services) and spiritual practices (e.g., mindfulness, meditation), including the spiritual aspects of AA, are linked with better alcohol use outcomes, improved recovery from AUD, increased coping skills and ability to manage stress, decreased anxiety and depression, and improved cognition. 1194,1195 To explore the spiritual dimensions of wellness and recovery with older clients, you can: Acknowledge that spirituality or religious engagement may be important to your clients' well-being. Be open to exploring clients' spiritual or religious beliefs and practices and their potential impact on clients' health, wellness, and recovery. Do not insert your own beliefs into the conversation. Explore how your clients' understanding of spirituality relates to their overall well-being, experience of recovery, sense of meaning and purpose, health, and coping with loss, stress, or adversity. Encourage active participation in personally relevant religious or spiritual activities such as attending religious services, attending AA or NA 12-Step meetings, praying, engaging in mindfulness or meditation, or \"giving back\" by becoming an AA or NA sponsor or volunteering in the community. Actively link or refer older adults to ancillary services, such as: Health care provided by physicians with experience and training in geriatric medicine. Specialized pharmacy services. Health education programs. Disease prevention or wellness counseling services. Complementary therapies. Fitness programs for older adults. Active linkage includes contacting the service or program you are referring your client to, getting a release from your client, giving written instructions to your client about how to access the service (e.g., name of provider, appointment time), and following up with the ancillary service provider via phone, letter, or email. (Chapter 4 of this TIP has more information about active linkage and referral management.) RESOURCE ALERT: COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH FOR OLDER ADULTS These resources offer providers and consumers research-based information on some complementary and integrative medicine treatments for older adults: The American Society on Aging's blog post about mindfulness and older adults is easy to read and could serve as a useful one-page handout to clients (www.asaging.org/blog/be - here-now-and-age-mindfully). The American Geriatrics Society website GeriatricsCareOnline.org offers a useful summary of complementary and integrative medicine approaches. The site also includes a table of natural products and their interactions with prescribed medications as well as a summary of the evidence base for complementary and integrative medicine approaches as they relate to different health conditions common in aging (https:// geriatricscareonline.org/FullText/B030/B030_ VOL001_PART001_SEC002_CH012). Recognize and explore strengths. Older adults have a great deal of knowledge from their own experience, practical wisdom, and a wide range of skills and abilities. A strengths-based approach assumes that people do not simply survive diffcult life circumstances, including substance misuse and the aging process itself, but can thrive in recovery and achieve enhanced health and wellness. Exploring older adults' strengths Chapter 7 193 TIP 26 involves validating their interests, acknowledging and appreciating their successes, and inviting them to refect on future possibilities.1196 Clinical Scenario: A Strengths-Based Intervention Older adults in recovery from substance misuse who are widows or widowers may feel guilty about surviving and lose interest in life. The following scenario focuses on exploring an older adult's strengths to rekindle a sense of possibility about the future. AUD Recovery and Loss: An older adult in recovery from AUD drops out of AA after becoming a widower. Treatment Setting: Outpatient addiction treatment program Provider: Licensed alcohol and drug counselor Treatment Strategy: Strengths-based approach Harry is 79 years old. He has been in recovery from AUD for 3 years. He initially attended AA meetings, became actively involved in the program, and attended recovery-oriented social gatherings with his wife, Ginny. When Ginny died suddenly, Harry stopped going to AA and isolated himself from family and friends. His daughter became worried about him and convinced him to go see a counselor. At the initial interview, the provider acknowledges Harry for maintaining his abstinence through a very diffcult time. This acknowledgement helps Harry feel more comfortable talking about how he has lost interest in going to meetings or spending time with family and friends. He says, \"I just can't let myself have fun or feel joy anymore. It's like I would be betraying Ginny. I'm the alcoholic and she is the one who died too young. It should have been me.\" The provider offers Harry an affrmation and an open question that directs the conversation toward exploring Harry's strengths and an alternative story about his pulling back from life, \"I appreciate your efforts to honor Ginny's memory. It seems like you really respect and appreciate how other people have touched you and contributed so much to your life. Not everyone has that quality. How did you come by that ability?\" Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Harry begins to tell a story about how he learned about respecting others early in his life and how important being respectful is to him. This opens the door for the counselor to explore Harry's other strengths and abilities. \"What other abilities or talents would you say have contributed to your life?\" As the provider helps Harry identify his strengths, Harry starts to believe in himself again and gives himself permission to feel good. His story about honoring Ginny changes. He sees another way he can honor his wife: by getting back to living his own life. He decides to call his former AA sponsor about returning to his home group. Promoting Self-Management and Relapse Prevention Perhaps the most critical tasks for older adults who misuse substances are to achieve stability and maintain ongoing recovery. Sustaining recovery is challenging without a sense of health and well-being, especially for older adults with co-occurring mental disorders or multiple chronic illnesses. Relapse prevention planning is the key to helping older adults identify potential relapse triggers and build coping skills. Engaging older adults in chronic illness self-management programs, relapse prevention planning, continuing care, and ongoing recovery support can help them maintain long-term recovery. Chronic Illness Self-Management Chronic illnesses can increase isolation and interfere with substance misuse recovery efforts. Mental disorders like depression and anxiety are common in older adults. So are chronic health conditions: 80 percent of older adults have at least one chronic health condition, such as diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and chronic pain. 1197 Illness self-management programs are an important part of integrated and client-centered care. They improve health outcomes, help people maintain higher levels of health functioning, and enrich quality of life by helping people develop skills to manage their symptoms and change attitudes and behaviors. 1198 194 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults One such program, the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP),1199 is an evidence-based approach that has demonstrated effectiveness with older adults. CDSMP has helped people improve wellness across several dimensions, such as through improvements in exercise, cognitive symptom management, and self-reported general health; decreases in health distress, fatigue, and disability; and reduced hospitalizations. 1200 To help older clients develop and sustain chronic illness self-management plans, CDSMP: Explores with clients how having a chronic condition affects them and how, if not properly managed, the condition may interfere with recovery from substance misuse. Addresses depression and anxiety, often associated with substance misuse and chronic illnesses. Acknowledges the challenges and successes of daily self-management of symptoms. Addresses ways to build structure into daily routines to support clients' ability to manage symptoms while emphasizing recovery and wellness activities (e.g., take medication as scheduled, have lunch with a friend, attend AA meetings or other support groups). Provides information on and links clients to local or online CDSMP services. Supports clients in their efforts to sustain self-management of symptoms while actively participating in recovery and wellness activities. To fnd organizations that offer a licensed CDSMP , go to www.eblcprograms.org/evidence-based/ map-of-programs. Also check with the AAA or the Aging and Disability Resource Center (if available) for your community. The Self-Management Resource Center (www. selfmanagementresource.com) offers a variety of illness self-management programs, including an online program, originally developed by and housed at the Stanford Patient Education Research Center. The Self-Management Resource Center also provides information about training and licensing for organizations that would like to offer a CDSMP . Clinical Scenario: Promoting Chronic Illness Self-Management Older adults in recovery from substance misuse who have chronic medical conditions may feel ashamed of having an illness that limits their functioning and ability to engage in recovery activities. The following scenario focuses on an older adult's negative self-judgments about having a chronic medical condition. AUD Recovery and Chronic Medical Condition: An older adult in long-term recovery from AUD has a chronic medical condition. Treatment Setting: Hospital-based outpatient behavioral health program Provider: Licensed psychologist Treatment Strategies: Foster self-acceptance and promote chronic illness self-management activities. Ruth is 69 years old, is in long-term AUD recovery, and has attended AA for many years. She lives with her daughter and two grandchildren. Her daughter is divorced and works full time. Ruth watches her grandchildren after school. She became the General Service Representative of her home AA group and sponsored many members over the years. She smoked cigarettes for 20 years. Ruth frequently tells people that \"smoking is a bad habit I picked up at meetings.\" She recently stopped after she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ruth's pulmonologist referred her to counseling at the hospital's outpatient program given her score of 12 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, indicating moderate depression. (Chapter 3 of this TIP offers screening and assessment tools.) She also was not following instructions for managing her COPD. In counseling, Ruth discloses that she feels ashamed that she has COPD. She stopped going to AA meetings because she feels like a failure for having a chronic medical condition that she says she should have avoided. She also fnds it more and more diffcult to leave the house. Her energy is low, and she coughs all the time. She also states that she has recently felt like drinking after seeing alcohol commercials on TV. Chapter 7 195 TIP 26 The provider helps Ruth identify specifc self- judgments about COPD. Ruth says, \"I hate being sick all the time. I don't want another chronic illness. It's my fault for not taking care of myself. I really failed this time.\" The provider helps her reevaluate her perspective about what it means to have a chronic illness and how to manage it, using her experience in recovery as an analogy. The provider says, \"You told me that when you frst got into recovery, you felt a lot of shame. But you started to feel more accepting when other people talked about alcoholism as a disease that has no cure but can be managed a day at a time.\" Ruth tells the provider that she benefted from having a support group to help her learn about her disease, how to accept it, and ways to manage it. The provider asks Ruth how she quit smoking after 20 years and avoided drinking. She says that she got a nicotine patch and went to a quit smoking group at the hospital. The provider says, \"So it seems like you used some of the same tools you used to get sober to stop smoking and stay sober too.\" Ruth says, \"I guess I'm not such a failure. If I can stay sober for this long and quit smoking after 20 years, I can learn to manage the COPD.\" The provider then explores possible community COPD support resources, including a pulmonary rehabilitation program at the hospital that teaches people about COPD, how to manage their symptoms, and how to save their energy for other activities. Ruth agrees to sign up for the program. She says, \"If I can get this thing under control and I have more energy, I'm sure I can get back to my home group. I really miss everyone.\" Ruth and her provider agree to keep meeting while Ruth is in the pulmonary rehabilitation program to monitor her progress and explore any obstacles to returning to AA and staying focused on managing her COPD. Continuing Care and Relapse Prevention Continuing care in addiction treatment has traditionally consisted of short-term (e.g., 12-week) outpatient group counseling and passive referral to mutual-help groups. Current thinking about continuing care emphasizes interventions that are long term and fexible enough to adjust to the needs of clients as they move through different stages of recovery. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Staying longer in addiction treatment and having a social support system after treatment that reinforces abstinence from alcohol and illicit drugs are two of the most important factors associated with long-term recovery for older adults. 1201 Continuing care for older adults should emphasize: Retention in ongoing treatment and recovery support, including mutual-help group meetings. Relapse prevention planning. Use of in-home or telephone counseling as appropriate to strengthen retention and engagement. Active involvement (with the older adults' permission) of spouses and other family members, or other signifcant others who support the older adults' recovery. Active linkage to and follow-up with community-based resources, such as housing and employment services (when needed); senior centers; and ftness, health, and wellness services for older adults. Also, some individuals fnd treatment facility alumni programs helpful in supporting their recovery from SUDs. Alumni programs typically offer graduates of the same treatment facility ongoing support through organized activities, continued contact with treatment staff, and further addiction education. SOCIAL NETWORK COUNSELING Network Support is a counseling intervention that consists of 12 counseling sessions (some including a spouse or signifcant other) that emphasize AA as a mutual-help group where people can make new friends and engage in nondrinking social and recreational activities. This approach can change the social network of the participants to include more nondrinking friends, which in turn can increase self-effcacy and coping, leading to improvements in long-term drinking outcomes. 1202 A key to ongoing recovery for older adults is a social network that supports recovery. When talking with older adults about the benefts of AA, emphasize the social aspects of mutual-help group attendance, an important factor in sustaining long-term recovery. 196 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults Relapse prevention planning is an important part of treatment and continuing care. You can facilitate this process by understanding older adult-specifc relapse risk factors and strategies for reducing the risk of a return to substance misuse. Some factors that increase the risk of relapse for older adults who misuse substances 1203 include: Loneliness and isolation. Boredom. Chronic pain. Untreated mental disorders or symptoms of anxiety and depression. Complicated grief. Sleep problems. Lack of social support for recovery. Chronic medical problems. Unsafe or unsuitable living environment. Prolonged stress. Diffculty managing instrumental ADLs including fnances. Misunderstanding of relapse or lack of a relapse prevention plan. Support your older clients in maintaining ongoing recovery and reducing the risk of relapse by: 1204,1205,1206 Helping them develop meaningful leisure, social, or vocational activities. Working with them and their physicians on alternative pain management strategies. Addressing grief issues throughout treatment and referring for additional supportive services when needed. (See the grief resource in the Chapter 4 Appendix of this TIP .) Providing information about good sleep habits (e.g., give up a daytime nap if it interferes with sleep at night) and low-risk nonpharmacological ways to cope with sleep problems. Ensuring that co-occurring mental and physical disorders get addressed and treated. Ensuring that they are keeping medical appointments, taking medications as prescribed, and communicating changes in health status to their healthcare providers. Teaching them stress management and coping skills throughout treatment. Helping them develop or broaden social networks that support recovery. Developing relapse prevention plans tailored to their individual needs. Exploring the potential for a return to substance use, normalizing relapse without implying that it is inevitable, and reframing relapse as a learning opportunity. Reviewing their past success in managing triggers; discussing themes and triggers for past relapses. Developing plans for reengaging in treatment if they return to substance use before it becomes a full relapse to previous levels of use. Working with them to evaluate coping strategies and, if needed, retrain on existing strategies or develop new ones. If appropriate to your role and setting, sustaining long-term supportive contact with them, with the emphasis on helping them maintain stability in recovery and better health and wellness. Promoting Resilience and Empowerment in Recovery Interventions that promote resilience can support relapse prevention efforts.1207 Thinking of older adults as infexible or \"set in their ways\" is ageist and fails to acknowledge the skills, abilities, and wisdom they have acquired from years of experience. Instead, promote resilience and empower your older clients in recovery from substance misuse by: Learning about their unique life-course events and challenges. Tapping into their wisdom. Supporting them in refecting on successful resolutions to past challenges they have faced. Helping them build coping skills to meet the challenges of recovery from substance misuse. Chapter 7 197 TIP 26 Tasks and Challenges of Aging Developmental theory suggests that a person has unique, age-specifc tasks to master over the life course. The tasks of older adulthood can be challenging, yet rewarding, and include: Adjusting to decreasing physical health, strength, and cognitive functioning. Adjusting to retirement and reduced income. Trying new activities (e.g., creative hobbies limited earlier by career, job, or family responsibilities). Establishing safe housing and satisfactory living arrangements. Entering new social roles, including affliating with one's age group, caring for relatives (particularly relevant for women), and grandparenting. Adjusting to and accepting the death of a spouse, other family members, or friends. Finding meaning in life while facing the prospect of death. 1208 One way to think about the challenges of aging is to understand that with age comes a broad spectrum of losses and transitions that may be traumatic for the older adult. Work from a perspective of trauma-informed care, which assumes that older clients' presenting issues, behaviors, and emotional reactions may be adaptive responses to trauma or loss and not symptoms of pathology. The consensus panel recommends that you approach every older adult in SUD treatment or recovery from a trauma-informed and person-centered perspective that recognizes that the experiences of trauma, loss, and grief are highly individualized. See SAMHSA's TIP 57, Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services, for an indepth examination of a trauma-informed approach to the treatment and prevention of addiction and mental illness (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/ TIP-57-Trauma-Informed-Care-in-Behavioral-Health-Services/SMA14-4816). See also www. samhsa.gov/trauma-violence. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Despite age-related losses and limitations on physical and cognitive functioning, older adults can experience mental growth and maturation. 1209 Most older adults maintain a positive outlook, improve their emotional regulation over time, and express a high degree of life satisfaction. Many older adults rise to the challenge, rediscover themselves, and grow from traumatic or stressful experiences. You can support your older clients in recovery in addressing the tasks and challenges of aging by: Recognizing that loss and transition are a normal part of aging and helping your older clients identify the losses and transitions specifc to them. Recognizing that your older clients who have experienced the death of a spouse or intimate partner are at higher risk for starting or returning to alcohol misuse or drug use. Connecting your older clients with recovery supports when the urge to drink or use drugs arises. Recognizing that multiple losses may trigger trauma reactions in older adults with a history of depression, anxiety, or other mental disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder, and treating co-occurring mental disorders concurrently. Helping your older clients identify day-to-day coping strategies, including maintaining a regular schedule, which helps people structure activities and maintain participation in social activities. 1210 Helping your older clients accept supports and services needed to maximize functioning and independence. Aiding them in balancing distraction from negative emotions with acceptance and learning to tolerate intense emotions associated with trauma. Helping clients identify personally relevant strategies for coping with and making meaning of loss and managing normal feelings of grief. Exploring with them whether reconnecting to a faith community could provide meaning and purpose. 198 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults Linking clients in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals, assisted living) to mutual-help groups that provide meetings in such settings, if available. Helping clients build bridges to new sources of meaning and purpose. 1211 Exploring with clients the role adjustments they may face related to retirement; death of a spouse, other family members, friends, or a sponsor; a move to another geographic area; or taking on a parenting role for grandchildren. Helping clients build and strengthen their support networks. Encouraging them to explore creative ways to make amends, bring closure to a chapter in their life, celebrate past accomplishments and new developments in their life, or remember a signifcant other (e.g., creating personally meaningful rituals and ceremonies, writing therapeutic letters, creating memory books). Strategies for Strengthening Resilience To help your older clients foster resilience, encourage them to recognize that they can develop cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping skills that strengthen their ability to prevent relapse, manage stress, and rebound from adversity. Bolstering resilience in older adults helps promote healthy aging, improves responses to developmental tasks and challenges, and heightens quality of life. 1212 The ability to cope with stressful situations is a key factor in preventing relapse from SUDs (see Resource Alert). RESOURCE ALERT: STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING RESILIENCE1213 An American Psychological Association webpage (www.apa.org/topics/resilience) describes strategies people can use in supporting recovery from SUDs. Collaborative Goal Setting Collaborative goal setting draws on clients' strengths and focuses on developing attainable goals. This can promote a positive attitude toward changing substance misuse behaviors 1214 and create a sense of self-effcacy and hope for older adults in ongoing recovery. Goals should be personally relevant to your older clients, challenging but realistic, achievable, and specifc. 1215 As a provider, you can facilitate goal setting with your older clients by: Helping them identify emotionally meaningful goals that support recovery and improve health and wellness (e.g., spending more time with family and friends, maintaining independence or recovery support, aging in place). Targeting short-term, easily attainable goals that build toward larger goals. For example, to stop alcohol use, help clients identify activities to do instead of drinking (like going out to dinner with a nondrinking friend rather than staying home at night drinking). Collaborating with your clients to develop a SMART plan (Exhibit 7.4) for achieving the identifed substance misuse or wellness goal; the plan should specify a timeframe and any supports clients need to meet the goal. Monitoring progress toward meeting goals for reducing or stopping substance misuse or engaging in wellness activities. Helping clients modify goals as needed. Questions you can ask your older clients include: -Was your initial goal too easy or too hard? -Would accomplishing smaller tasks, like reducing your alcohol intake, make it easier to accomplish your ultimate goal of stopping completely? -What obstacles prevented you from achieving or maintaining abstinence? -What obstacles prevented you from starting the wellness activity (e.g., taking a walk every day)? -What are some of your strategies for overcoming these obstacles? -Is your goal still important to you, or is it time to move to a different goal? Chapter 7 199 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 7.4. Writing a SMART Goal Specifc: State the goal clearly. Ask the client to be specifc. For example, if the goal is \"I just want to be healthy,\" ask \"How will you know when you are 'healthy'?\" or \"What things will you be able to do when you are healthy that you can't do now?\" Measurable: Identify and quantify the observable markers of progress, such as pain levels or the number of days and amount of time the client walked each week. Invite the client to keep a log of these markers so you can discuss the client's progress. Attainable: Break the goal into smaller, actionable steps. Identify expected barriers and make a plan to address them. For example, if the goal is to get 8 hours of sleep each night, break the goal into smaller tasks, like turn all the lights in the bedroom off at 10 p.m. at least fve nights a week. Then ask, \"What might keep you from turning the lights off at 10 p.m.?\" Relevant: Make sure the goal refects what's personally relevant to the individual. Use MI to set the agenda and determine goals on which to focus. Link goals, such as blood pressure control, to the goal of staying healthy. Time-bound: Defne when the goal is to be attained. Help the client be specifc about the timeframe. Make it realistic and attainable, based on the client's subjective evaluation. Agree when to check progress.

TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults to map social networks of older adults and adults with SUDs.1218 The Social Network Map is a client- centered tool that collects information on the composition of older adults' networks, the extentto which network members provide different types of support, and the nature of relationships within the networks. 1219 The version depicted below is adapted for use with older adults in recovery. Chapter 7 Appendix Assessing Social Support The Social Network Map is a handy visual tool to help you and your clients identify members of their social network and the types of support they provide. 1217 It was developed as a clinical tool for assessing and broadening social support resources for families and has been used in studies SOCIAL NETWORK MAP FOR OLDER ADULTS IN RECOVERY Adapted from Tracy & Whittaker (1990).1220 Chapter 7 203 TIP 26 The following strategies1221 will help you and your older clients develop a social network map: Create a pie chart with the seven domains. Health, behavioral health service, social service, and peer recovery support providers may be part of the support network clients identify. Ask older clients to identify members of their social networks by frst name or initials only. Ask clients to describe how available (e.g., rarely, sometimes, often) each member of the network is to give emotional, instrumental, or informational support. Give examples and be specifc: -\"Who is available to give you emotional support like comforting you if you are upset or listening if you are stressed?\" \"How often does this person give you that kind of support?\" -\"Who is available to help you out in a concrete way like giving you a ride or helping with a chore?\" \"How often does this person give you that kind of support?\" -\"Who would give you information on how to do something new or help you make a big decision?\" \"How often does this person give you that kind of support?\" Note the type and frequency of support each person listed in each domain can offer. Ask clients to describe how close they are to each member of their network, how long they have known them, and how frequently they see them. Ask clients to review the map and identify types of support that may be lacking and strategies for adding new network members to beef up their social support. Assessing Isolation Assess older adults' level of social isolation and explore all possible sources of social support they have. The Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) is designed for use with older adults. It measures social isolation and focuses on the nature of older adults' relationships with family and friends. 1222 Older clients can easily complete the six-item Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults short version (LSNS-6), a self-report questionnaire. The LSNS-6 is available via www.bc.edu/content/ bc-web/schools/ssw/sites/lubben/description.html. For the LSNS-6, the total score (0-30) is an equally weighted sum of the scale's six items. A score below 12 indicates social isolation and need for further assessment. 1223 Low scores are associated with increased mortality, hospitalization for all causes, physical health problems, depression and other mental disorders, and low adherence to health-promoting activities. 1224 The Modifed LSNS-R, with a \"family of choice\" subscale, was developed for use with lesbian older adults. 1225 A screening tool like the LSNS-6 will give you an overall sense of the number of people in an older adult's life who provide support and the level of social isolation or social support the older adult is experiencing. The next step is to explore the kinds of social support older adults have or would like to have. This exploration will help you and your client generate strategies for increasing the diversity of social supports that promote health, wellness, and recovery. Three types of social support enhance the health of older adults: Emotional support (e.g., feeling heard and understood, having help with refecting on one's values, providing a sense that someone cares) Instrumental support (e.g., helping with fnances, transportation, medication adherence) Informational support (e.g., providing information about community resources or the benefts of wellness and recovery activities, problem-solving, giving advice when asked) 1226 Begin your conversation by describing the beneft of social support to people's health and well-being and give examples of the three types of support mentioned above. Then indicate that you would like to ask a few questions to see what kind of support your client already has. Screening Instruments and Other Tools The Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profle (HELP) is a validated assessment tool of older adults' habits and routines in health-promoting behaviors 204 Chapter 7 TIP 26 Chapter 7\u2014Social Support and Other Wellness Strategies for Older Adults in fve of the eight dimensions of wellness. It is administered as either a self-report questionnaire or a structured interview. 1227 The HELP screening tool is a short version of the comprehensive assessment. It is a 15-item questionnaire that asks for \"yes\" or \"no\" responses. It is quick and easy to understand when administered to older adults as a self-report review of health-related lifestyle and wellness factors. (See page 32 of www.csudh. edu/Assets/csudh-sites/ot/docs/3%20Health%20 Enhancement%20Lifestyle%20Profle%20(HELP)-Guide%20for%20Clinicians-2016.pdf for the screening tool.) The questions focus on exercise, nutrition, social support, recreational activities, and spirituality. If further exploration is needed, focus the conversation with the client on items marked \"no.\" For example, if the client marks \"no\" on the item about exercise, you might start with a nonjudgmental observation like \"I noticed that you normally don't exercise more than twice a week. Exercise can mean different things to different people. Tell me more about what you do for exercise.\" This will open a conversation about physical activity and the client's understanding of what exercise is. Build on what the client is already doing before providing information about recommended guidelines or jumping in with advice about how to improve in that area. The OARS approach is a person-centered communication approach used in motivational interviewing. 1228 You can use OARS throughout conversations with clients to help them feel relaxed, understood, and open to thinking about changing their pattern of substance misuse or engaging in wellness activities. Here are some examples of how to apply OARS to your discussions with older clients. CLINICAL SKILLS: USING OARS IN CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS ON SUBSTANCE MISUSE \"O\"\u2014Open-ended questions: These questions help you learn more about the client's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They are questions that cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" Some examples are: \"What do you think are some reasons for you to stop drinking?\" \"In what ways is not drinking important to you?\" \"How do you think your relationship with your daughter would be different if you were not using marijuana?\" \"A\"\u2014Affrmations: These statements show support for the older adult's efforts to make diffcult changes. Affrmations help the client build self-effcacy (a person's belief in his or her ability to do something, such as change a behavior). Examples of affrmations include: \"Your willingness to discuss the risks of taking more pain medication than prescribed by your doctor fts right in with your health goals. I appreciate your willingness to talk about something that might be uncomfortable for you.\" \"You are working hard to cut back on your drinking. When you set your mind to something you are determined to meet your goal.\" \"R\"\u2014Refective listening: Refective listening involves listening for the feelings or meaning of the client's statements and refecting that meaning back to the client using his or her own words or paraphrasing. This shows that you are paying attention and trying to understand the client's perspective. Refective listening also helps the client become more self-aware. You can use refective listening by: Simply repeating key words or phrases back to the client. Rephrasing what the client said using your own words. Continued on next page Chapter 7 205 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued Refecting the underlying meaning or feeling of the client's statement. Here is an example: -Client: \"I started drinking more after my wife died. It just made the pain go away for a while. But then I fell and broke my hip one night after I had a few.\" -Provider: \"Drinking helped you manage sadness temporarily, but then it started hurting your health.\" \"S\"\u2014Summarization: Summarizing is a form of refective listening that ensures that you understand what the client has told you. It also helps you move the conversation to the next stage of the MI process. You can summarize by saying things like: \"Let's review what we have talked about so far.\" \"We covered a lot of topics this afternoon. Here's what it sounds like you're telling me.\" \"You talked about your misuse of pain medications and how you have mixed feelings about that. You said that you are kind of scared to give them up completely, and the most important reason you can think of to taper off them is so you can have a better relationship with your grandson. Tell me a bit more about how important it is to have a better relationship with him and how getting off the medication will help you achieve that goal.\" 206 Chapter 7 TIP 26TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN OLDER ADULTS Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? KEY MESSAGES As you age, alcohol can affect you more because: -Your body does not process alcohol as well as it used to. -You're more likely to be taking medications that interact negatively with alcohol. -You're more likely to have health conditions that will get worse if you drink alcohol. If you drink too much, reducing or cutting back on your alcohol consumption can improve your health and well-being. Family members, caregivers, friends, and other people in your life can help you quit or cut back on drinking. If you need treatment for a drinking problem, a range of effective options are available to you. Have hope! Many older adults are able to change their drinking habits to improve health and well-being. Chapter 8 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) benefts older adults, caregivers, and family members. It discusses the effects of alcohol and recommended guidelines for drinking in older adults. It will help older adults fgure out whether they might have a drinking problem and how they can reduce or stop using alcohol. It will help families and friends recognize when an older adult in their lives is misusing alcohol and what they can do to support healthy changes in the older adult's drinking habits while also taking care of their own needs. Older adults use alcohol more than any other substance. 1229 Drinking carries more risks for older adults, and they are at risk even when they drink less than younger adults. Physical changes that come with age increase sensitivity to alcohol. Other common changes in later life\u2014like the death of a spouse or close friend, retirement, or a move to a different neighborhood or living situation\u2014can lead to unhealthy drinking. But don't be discouraged! Older adults in treatment can do as well as or even better than younger adults do. 1230,1231,1232 That said, many older adults cut back on or quit drinking without specialized treatment. 1233,1234,1235 Organization of Chapter 8 of This TIP Chapter 8 is for older adults who drink (including those who have questions about how much they should drink), their families, and their caregivers. It provides information about how alcohol can affect older adults' changing bodies, health, and life circumstances. The frst section of Chapter 8 discusses drinking guidelines specifc to older adults. It also lists reasons why some older adults misuse alcohol and lists some effects and warning signs of misuse. The second section describes alcohol's health effects and the ways alcohol and medication interact. The third section gives tips and cautions for addressing your drinking on your own. The fourth section describes treatment options. The ffth section educates older adults' families and caregivers about alcohol misuse. The fnal section lists some helpful resources. A more detailed resource guide is in Chapter 9 of this TIP . Exhibit 8.1 defnes some key terms you'll see as you read further. 207 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 8.1. Key Terms Addiction*: The most severe form of substance use disorder (SUD), associated with compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that has the potential for both recurrence (relapse) and recovery. Alcohol misuse: The use of alcohol in any harmful way, including heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). At-risk/high-risk drinking: Drinking alcohol in excessive amounts. This defnition encompasses both binge drinking and heavy drinking. Additionally, any alcohol consumption is considered risky when carried out by individuals with certain medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, those taking medicine that can interact harmfully with alcohol, those driving a car or engaged in other activities that require alertness, or people recovering from AUD. 1236,1237 Note that for purposes of this TIP, at-risk drinking and high-risk drinking are synonymous and either term is acceptable to describe an older adult's drinking patterns. AUD: A diagnosis that applies to people who have lost control of their drinking, continue to use alcohol despite negative consequences, and experience symptoms such as craving and withdrawal. Binge drinking: A drinking pattern that leads to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 grams per deciliter or greater. This usually takes place after four or more drinks for women and fve or more drinks for men. 1238,1239 However, older adults are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and treatment providers may need to lower these numbers when screening for alcohol misuse.1240 Additionally, other factors such as weight, decrease in enzyme activity, and body composition (e.g., amount of muscle tissue present in the body) can also affect alcohol absorption rates. Caregivers: Informal caregivers provide unpaid care. They assist others with activities of daily living, including health and medical tasks. Informal caregivers may be spouses, partners, family members, friends, neighbors, or others who have a signifcant personal relationship with the person who needs care. Formal caregivers are paid providers who offer care in one's home or in a facility. 1241 Most older adults do not need caregivers and are as able to address their own needs as younger adults, whether or not substance misuse is a factor in their lives. Heavy drinking: Consuming fve or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women in one period on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days.1242 Moderate drinking: According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defned as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 1243,1244 However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant as an average over several days. 1245 Additionally, individuals who don't metabolize alcohol well may need to consume even lower quantities. Some people, particularly those with certain alcohol-related illnesses or engaging in tasks requiring concentration, should not consume alcohol at all. The Dietary Guidelines stipulate that those who don't drink should not begin drinking for any reason. 1246 Peer support: The use of peer recovery support specialists (for example, someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training) to provide nonclinical (in other words, not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Screening: A process for evaluating the possible presence of a specifc problem. The outcome is normally a simple yes or no. Substance misuse*: The use of any substance in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to users or to those around them. For some substances or individuals, any use would constitute misuse (for example, underage drinking, injection drug use). Substance use disorder*: A medical illness caused by repeated misuse of a substance or substances. According to the ffth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 1247 Continued on next page 208 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? Continued SUDs are characterized by clinically signifcant impairments in health and social function and impaired control over substance use. They are diagnosed through assessing cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. SUDs range from mild to severe and from temporary to chronic. They typically develop gradually over time with repeated misuse, leading to changes in brain circuits governing incentive salience (the ability of substance-associated cues to trigger substance seeking), reward, stress, and executive functions like decision making and self-control. Multiple factors infuence whether and how rapidly a person will develop an SUD. These factors include the substance itself; the genetic vulnerability of the user; and the amount, frequency, and duration of the misuse. Note: A severe SUD is commonly called an addiction. * The defnitions of all terms marked with an asterisk correspond closely to those given in Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health. This resource provides a great deal of useful information about substance misuse and its impact on U.S. public health. The report is available online (https://addiction. surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/fles/surgeon-generals-report.pdf ). Drinking Guidelines and Alcohol Misuse in Older Adults What Is Moderate Drinking? The Dietary Guidelines defne moderate drinking as up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Importantly, these numbers apply to any given day and are not meant to be interpreted as averages over numerous days. 1248,1249,1250 To make sure that your drinking is not high risk, avoid binge drinking. Binge drinking means drinking more than three drinks (if you're a woman) or four drinks (if you're a man) per day. However, given the body's decreased ability to absorb alcohol with age, you may need to limit yourself to fewer drinks to avoid binge drinking. 1251 Don't drink when you will be driving a car or boat or doing other activities that require you to be coordinated and alert. Heavy or binge drinking at any age harms the brain. 1252 These patterns of drinking slow down communication among brain cells. Over time, heavy or binge drinking also shrinks the brain and changes it in other ways that negatively affect how it works. These changes can affect behavior; cause dementia; and worsen memory, coordination, and the ability to plan and learn. 1253,1254 For some older adults, any amount of alcohol is risky. 1255 Don't drink if you:1256,1257 Have a chronic medical condition that alcohol can worsen, like diabetes or heart disease. 1258,1259 Are recovering from AUD.1260 Take medications to help you worry less or sleep. People often take a type of prescription medication called benzodiazepines to treat anxiety or sleeplessness. 1261 Take opioid pain relievers, which healthcare providers may prescribe for severe or chronic pain. 1262 Take other prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications that interact negatively with alcohol\u2014that is, they may cause serious harmful effects if you take them and also drink alcohol. For more information about how various medications interact with alcohol, see the \"What Medications Interact With Alcohol?\" section. Why Do Experts Suggest Lower Limits for Older Adults? The two main reasons for lower drinking limits are: You're more likely than younger adults to experience harmful alcohol-medication interactions. As you age, your body responds differently to alcohol. Chapter 8 209 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults You may have already noticed that you feel the age-related changes affect how your body handles effects of alcohol sooner than you used to, even alcohol.1263,1264,1265 Exhibit 8.2 shows some of these if you don't take any medications. That's because age-related changes. EXHIBIT 8.2. How Aging Affects the Body's Response to Alcohol1266,1267,1268,1269,1270,1271 DOES ALCOHOL USE OR MISUSE AFFECT OLDER WOMEN DIFFERENTLY THAN IT AFFECTS OLDER MEN? If an older man and woman of about the same size and age drink the same amount of alcohol in the same amount of time, the woman will get drunk sooner. That's because the woman probably:1272,1273,1274 Has less body water to dilute the alcohol. Has less lean muscle mass to absorb the alcohol. Has less of the enzyme that breaks down alcohol. This means that older women who misuse alcohol over time are likely to have more alcohol-related health problems than older men who do so. These problems will likely appear sooner and be more severe. 1275 Compared with older men, older women are also more likely to:1276,1277,1278 Live alone longer, increasing their risk of drinking to cope with loneliness. Be less fnancially secure, increasing their risk of drinking to cope with fnancial worries. Take benzodiazepines, which have particularly harmful interactions with alcohol. (See the text box \"Benzodiazepine Alert: Cautions for Older Adults Who Drink.\") Nevertheless, research suggests that older women respond to alcohol treatment better than older men do.1279 210 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? What Counts as One Drink? To help you stay within the recommended limits, you need to know what counts as one drink.1280 It may be less than you think. In the United States, a standard drink contains 14 grams of pure alcohol, or about 0.6 fuid ounces. Exhibit 8.3 showsstandar d drink amounts by beverage type. EXHIBIT 8.3. What Is a Standard Drink? Image adapted from material in the public domain.1281 Alcohol content can vary by type of drink. Read container labels to see how much alcohol is in a serving. What if you have a cocktail or mixed drink that combines a few different kinds of alcohol? You can fgure out about how many standard drinks you're really consuming by using the Cocktail Content Calculator (www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa. nih.gov/Tools/Calculators/Cocktail-Calculator. aspx) on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) Rethinking Drinking website. The calculator gives the alcohol content and standard drink equivalent for several common mixed drinks. To keep track of your drinking, it helps to know the number of standard drinks in a bottle of wine or other type of alcohol container. NIAAA's Drink Size Calculator tells you how many standard servings are in many common kinds of beverage containers. It shows this information by type and strength of beverage (www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/ Tools/Calculators/Drink-Size-Calculator.aspx). Chapter 8 211 TIP 26 ACTIVITY: HOW MUCH ARE YOU REALLY DRINKING? For this activity, you'll need: Two glasses you typically use for drinking alcohol (the glasses must be identical). A measuring cup (make sure it's for liquids, not dry ingredients). The \"What Is a Standard Drink?\" diagram. Using water instead of alcohol, fll one glass with what you think of as a single serving. Find in Exhibit 8.3 the standard drink amount for your type of drink. Fill the measuring cup with that amount of water, then pour it into the second glass. Compare the amounts in the two glasses. What Can Cause Older Adults To Misuse Alcohol? Alcohol misuse can begin or resume at any age. People who misuse alcohol may not always realize they are doing so. Stressful life changes that may lead to alcohol misuse in older adults include: 1282,1283,1284,1285,1286,1287 The death of a spouse, partner, child, or close friend. Increasing isolation. Increasing disability or a chronic illness. Forced or unplanned retirement.1288 A change of residence. Increased fnancial strain.1289 Boredom; lack of meaningful activity. Physical separation from adult children. Spending time with people who drink is linked with alcohol misuse. For example, older adults may begin drinking too much after moving to a retirement community where drinking is a big part of socializing. 1290 If your drinking patterns worsen in response to a change in your life, take action. The sections \"How Can I Quit or Cut Back on My Own?\" and \"How Do I Talk to My Healthcare Provider About Alcohol Use?\" can help you. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Some older adults use alcohol to cope with physical or emotional problems. 1291 This is called self-medicating. Drinking to self-medicate can lead to alcohol misuse 1292 and can actually worsen the problem instead of helping. For example, drinking to cope with depression can make symptoms of depression worse. 1293 Similarly, drinking to cope with sleep problems can worsen sleep by reducing time spent in deep sleep and by causing snoring and other problems that interfere with sleep. 1294,1295 Also, what was low-risk drinking when you were a younger adult can become alcohol misuse as you age, simply because your body does not handle alcohol as well as it used to. Refer back to Exhibit 8.2. Healthcare providers sometimes mistake AUD for other conditions that are common in older adults. Some providers wrongly believe that older adults are not likely to develop AUD. These are good reasons for you to educate yourself about alcohol misuse in older adults. How Can I Tell Whether I'm Misusing Alcohol? Ask yourself whether any of these possible signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse apply to you: Cognitive symptoms: -Feeling confused after drinking1296 -Having you take medication that interacts negatively with alcohol -Continuing to drink even if you have a medical condition made worse by alcohol 212 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? Social symptoms: -Having relatives or friends who are concerned about your drinking1303 -Losing friends because of your drinking1304 Behavioral symptoms: -Bathing showering infrequently1305 -Taking less care of your appearance1306 -Taking less care of your living space1307 -Spending too much money on alcohol1308 -Skipping meals because of drinking1309 -Putting oneself in risky situations (like driving, having unsafe sex) while drinking 1310 If you have experienced or are experiencing any of these warning signs, consider speaking with your healthcare provider or an addiction specialist about your drinking. Also see \"What Should I Expect During My Medical Appointment?\" and \"What Are My Options for Specialized AUD Treatment?\" Contact your healthcare provider if you: Drink despite taking one or more medications that have severe interactions with alcohol. Have had symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. See the text box titled \"Warning Signs of Alcohol Withdrawal\" for more information. Alcohol's Efects on Older Adult Health Can Drinking Cause or Worsen Health Conditions? Alcohol misuse causes or increases your risk of developing more than 200 health conditions.1311 Drinking also worsens many health conditions common among older adults, including diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, pain, sleep problems, stroke, and urinary incontinence. 1312,1313,1314,1315,1316 Alcohol misuse can also make it harder for you to manage any chronic medical conditions you already have. For example, you may skip meals, forget to exercise, or mix up medications. Alcohol misuse may put you and others at risk of injuries and other harms, like HIV. Harms linked with alcohol misuse by older adults commonly result from falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicide attempts. 1317,1318,1319 Alcohol misuse can also lead to risky sexual behavior (such as having unprotected sex with a new partner), which can spread HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. 1320,1321,1322,1323 What About News Reports That Say Light or Moderate Drinking Is Healthy? Don't base decisions about drinking on news reports of alcohol's benefts. News stories don't always clarify whether a study found that alcohol causes or is simply associated with a health beneft. If a study shows that alcohol is only associated with a health beneft, other factors like genetics or income level may have also played a role. 1324 The report may ignore a study's limitations.1325 For example, the results of a study with only younger participants may not apply to older adults. You and your healthcare provider should weigh the possible benefts of light or moderate drinking with the known negative effects of alcohol use, especially if you: Take medication that interacts badly with alcohol. Have a history of alcohol misuse. Have, or are at risk for, a medical condition worsened by alcohol. Exhibit 8.4 presents just some of the health conditions linked to alcohol misuse. Chapter 8 213 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults EXHIBIT 8.4. Some Health Risks of Alcohol Misuse1326,1327,1328,1329,1330,1331,1332,1333,1334,1335 What Medications Interact With Alcohol? Many older adults who drink regularly take prescription medications that interact harmfully with alcohol. 1336,1337 Drinking makes some medications less effective and can make others more potent. The results can be unpleasant, dangerous, and even deadly. 1338 Alcohol and medication can make a dangerous mix, even if you do not consume them at the same time.1339 If you drink, ask your healthcare provider whether alcohol can interact harmfully with any of your medications. Negative interactions may occur even if you don't see signs or symptoms like vomiting or dizziness right away. Serious effects of alcohol-medication interactions, like liver damage, can develop \"silently\" over time. 1340 Dietary supplements (e.g., vitamins, herbal products) and OTC medications (like aspirin) can interact harmfully with alcohol. Talk to your healthcare provider if you take any of these products and drink. 1341 214 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? ACTIVITY: CHECK YOUR MEDICATIONS FOR ALCOHOL INTERACTIONS Check labels on prescription bottles for warnings about drinking while taking the medication. If the medication came with a printed \"Patient Package Insert\" or \"Medication Guide,\" check for additional warnings on alcohol use. If you have questions about your medication and alcohol use, talk to your pharmacist or healthcare provider. Check the \"Drug Facts\" labeling for your OTC medications: Look under \"Warnings\" for any mentions of alcohol. Information that comes with prescription and OTC medications usually does not include warnings specifcally for older adults. If you're unsure whether you can drink while taking a medication, be safe and don't drink. 1342 Exhibit 8.5 lists 12 medications that interact badly with alcohol. Many older adults take these and similar medications. This list is provided for illustration only. Other medications for the same condition may have different interactions, and many conditions are not included. For more comprehensive lists, see the entries under \"Alcohol and Medication Interactions\" in the \"Resources\" section at the end of this Chapter. EXHIBIT 8.5. Common Prescription Medication-Alcohol Interactions1343,1344 CONDITION MEDICATION EXAMPLE POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS WITH ALCOHOL Anxiety Clonazepam Increased dizziness, drowsiness, and memory problems; decreased coordination; increased risk of fatal overdose1345 Arthritis Naproxen Ulcers, stomach bleeding, liver damage Blood clots Warfarin Internal bleeding with occasional or heavy drinking; increased risk of blood clots, strokes, or heart attacks with heavy drinking Cough Depression Dextromethorphan Sertraline Drowsiness, dizziness, diffculty concentrating, 1346 higher overdose risk Increased depression, drowsiness, dizziness Diabetes Metformin Very low blood sugar (symptoms: dizziness, drowsiness, confusion), increased alcohol levels1347 High blood pressure Lisinopril Dizziness, drowsiness, fainting, weakness from low blood pressure, 1348 heart problems such as changes in the heart's normal rhythm High cholesterol Simvastatin Liver damage Insomnia Zolpidem Drowsiness, dizziness, sleepiness, slowed or diffcult breathing, loss of coordination, unusual behavior, memory problems Pain Ibuprofen Stomach bleeding and ulcers Pain (severe) Oxycodone Drowsiness, dizziness, slowed or diffcult breathing, loss of coordination, unusual behavior, memory problems, increased risk for fatal overdose Chapter 8 215 TIP 26 BENZODIAZEPINE ALERT: CAUTIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS WHO DRINK Prescription benzodiazepines mainly treat anxiety or insomnia.1349 while taking benzodiazepines puts you at great risk. Alcohol and benzodiazepines slow down critical bodily functions like breathing and heartbeat. Combining them can cause blackouts and even death. 1350,1351 If you drink alcohol at all and take benzodiazepines, tell your healthcare provider. Also ask whether you should try a different approach to treating the condition for which you take the benzodiazepines. If you and your healthcare provider decide you should keep taking the medication, even at a reduced dosage, that's a good reason for you to quit drinking. Don't change benzodiazepine use on your own. You need medical advice when stopping or reducing benzodiazepine use. Your healthcare provider should give you a schedule to slowly reduce (taper) your dosage. Tapering helps avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal. Tapering also makes it less likely that the symptoms the medication treated will return. 1352 Many older adults end or reduce benzodiazepine use through tapering alone, but you may also need counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to achieve this goal. 1353 Here are some more tips on avoiding negative interactions between alcohol and your medications: Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist whether a newly prescribed medication interacts harmfully with alcohol, even if you don't drink often. Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Never take prescription medication offered to you by a family member or a friend, especially if you drink. The medication was prescribed with someone else's medical situation in mind, not yours. Taking it could harm you. In some cases, sharing prescription medications is illegal. Check the ingredients of cough and cold medications and laxatives, which may contain alcohol. OPIOID ALERT: CAUTIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS WHO DRINK Prescription opioid medications mainly treat severe or ongoing pain. Common opioid medications include: If you take opioid pain relievers and also drink alcohol, you put yourself at especially high risk for overdose, confusion, unusual behavior, and serious injury. 1354,1355 Let your healthcare provider know immediately if you take opioid pain relievers and you drink, even just occasionally. You and the healthcare provider who prescribed the opioids should discuss whether to treat your pain in a different way. Keep in mind that many alternative pain medications also interact harmfully with alcohol. 1356 If only prescription opioids control your pain, you need to quit drinking while taking them. Talk with your provider about how to stop drinking safely. 216 Chapter 8 TIP Adult: What Do I Need To Know? Tips and Cautions for Addressing Drinking on Your Own Is Alcohol Withdrawal a Concern? If you drink more than is recommended for older adults\u2014especially if you drink heavily or have been drinking regularly for a long time\u2014don't sharply cut back on your drinking or suddenly quit on your own. Get medical advice frst. Your body may be dependent on alcohol, so you could experience withdrawal if you go without drinking for longer than usual. 1357 Severe alcohol withdrawal can be deadly if not treated right away in a hospital. 1358 ,1359 WARNING SIGNS OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL Symptoms may occur up to 7 days after your last drink. They may vary in severity1360 and include:1361,1362,1363,1364 Agitation. Increased pulse rate. Anxiety. Insomnia. Diarrhea. Nausea. Headache. Sweating. Raised blood Tremor. pressure. Delirium tremens (also known as DTs) is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal. 1365 It can be fatal and must be treated in a hospital. It can develop 2 to 10 days after the last drink. 1366 Possible symptoms include rapid heart rate, intense tremor, extreme agitation, confusion, fever, drenching sweats, and coma. 1367 How Can I Quit or Cut Back on My Own? Consider Why You Want To Change Your Drinking Habits Think about how drinking conficts with your top values\u2014values you want your life to refect, like independence, generosity, health, and honesty. Try these value-identifying exercises available online: www.smartrecovery.org/smart-recovery-toolbox/ values-and-goals-clarifcation https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/ SV_e35whN7tkXtvlHv (interactive) www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/values-clarifcation.pdf Feel free to add any of your own top values that you don't see listed in these exercises. Here are just a few possibilities: alertness, dependability, and empathy. The activity below will help you understand the relationship between drinking and your top values. ACTIVITY: DOES YOUR DRINKING CONFLICT WITH YOUR TOP VALUES? Think about your top values in life\u2014the principles, qualities, and beliefs most important to you that you want your life to refect. Does drinking confict with any of your top values? If so: Which values does drinking confict with? How does drinking confict with these values? How does this confict keep you from living out your top values in your daily life? Be as specifc as possible.

Consider frst reading Writing a plan for change (Exhibit 8.6) will help the \"How Can I Get Support From Family and you set and keep goals for cutting back or quitting Friends?\" section.drinking. Before making a plan, look at your EXHIBIT 8.6. Writing a Change Plan Goal (pick one): ____ I want to drink no more than ____ drink(s) per day and no more than ____ drink(s) per week. (See \"What Is Moderate Drinking?\" before flling out.) ____ I want to stop drinking. I will begin following my plan on this date: ________________________. My most important reasons for changing my drinking are:_________________________________________________ The situations where I may be most tempted to drink are:_________________________________________________ Some things I will do and say to handle these situations are:_______________________________________________ The people who can help me stick to my goal, and the ways they can help, are:____________________________ Adapted from material in the public domain.1368 Pace Yourself When You Drink Your main goal is to cut back and slow down your alcohol consumption when you drink. Try: 1369,1370,1371 Putting your drink down between sips. Holding something in your hand besides your drink between sips. Following an alcoholic drink with a nonalcoholic one. Eating something while you drink\u2014but avoid foods that make you thirsty. Track Your Drinking Using a drinking tracker card (Exhibit 8.7), write down how many drinks you have each day. This will help you keep better track of your drinking as you work to cut back or quit. 1372 218 Chapter 8 TIP 26 GOAL: No more than ____ drinks on any day and ____ per week. Week starting Su M T W Th F Sa Total ____/____ ____/____ ____/____ ____/____ Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? EXHIBIT 8.7. Four-Week Drinking Tracker Card Reprinted from material in the public domain.1373 Find Alternatives to Drinking You may drink out of habit, boredom, or loneliness, or when you're with friends who drink. Try to fnd other activities that appeal to you and ft your abilities and budget. Here are some ideas: Participate in recreation programs at your local community recreation center or senior center. (Be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before increasing your physical activity.) Put your experience and gifts to use by volunteering at a nonproft organization or a school. Join a book discussion group hosted by a local library or bookstore. Think about what your interests are and how you can make them a bigger part of your life. Have a Plan for Dealing With Challenging Situations Some occasions, like holiday parties or anniversaries of losses, may tempt you to drink or to drink too much. So may being around people or places that remind you of drinking. You can fght temptation better if you have a plan for handling such situations. 1374 For example, you could plan to spend the evening of a diffcult anniversary with an understanding friend. A written plan (Exhibit 8.6) can help you remember what steps to take to avoid temptation. Join a Mutual-Help Group Another action you can take is to join a mutual-help group. Members of these groups support each other in their recovery from the misuse of alcohol and other substances. Mutual-help groups meet regularly, are free, and usually take place in community spaces, such as houses of worship and schools. Some groups follow the 12-Step approach, which has abstinence as its goal. 1375 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was the frst 12-Step group. To fnd a meeting, go to www.aa.org/pages/en_US/ fnd-aa-resources or look in your local newspaper or community newsletter. Some communities have meetings designated as senior friendly. 1376 If you have diffculty getting around, you can check out AA's online and telephone meetings (https://aa-intergroup.org/directory.php). Chapter 8 219 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults For older adults-only meetings, look into Seniors In Sobriety (SIS), which is part of AA. The SIS website (www.seniorsinsobriety.com) provides a list of meetings. Alternatives to traditional 12-Step organizations include: SMART (Self-Management and Recovery Training) Recovery (www.smartrecovery.org). Women for Sobriety (https://womenforsobriety. org). Secular Organizations for Sobriety sossobriety.org). Moderation You can fnd faith-based organizations at www.recoverymonth.gov/resource-category/ faith-based. Consider dropping by a mutual-help group meeting to see whether it's a good ft for you. Call the local offce or contact person frst to make sure that the meeting is open to the public. If you want to attend a meeting but feel a little uncomfortable with the idea, think about going with a friend. MOBILE APPS If you have a smartphone or tablet, you have access to many free mobile apps that can help you overcome alcohol misuse, including addiction. Common features of these apps include: 1377,1378 Counters showing how long you've been alcohol free (some go down to the minute or second). Calculators showing how much money and time you've saved by not drinking. Support-meeting locators. Community forums for sharing information and support anonymously. Daily inspirational messages. Progress notifcations. Virtual rewards, like \"coins\" or \"trophies,\" for milestones achieved. Examples of such apps are I Am Sober (https:// iamsoberapp.com) and Nomo - Sobriety Clocks (https://saynomo.com). 1379 When It's Time To Get Help How Do I Talk to My Healthcare Provider About Alcohol Use? If you have questions about your alcohol use or think you need help addressing it, you may need to raise the subject with your healthcare provider yourself. That's because some healthcare providers: -Feel uncomfortable asking an older adult about his or her alcohol use. 1380 -May mistake an older adult's alcohol misuse for another health condition. 1381 -Believe there's no point in encouraging an older adult to stop or reduce drinking. 1382 Here are some ideas for starting the conversation: \"I'm on several medications, so is it a problem that I have a couple of drinks in the evening?\" \"It takes me awhile to fall asleep, so I have a nightcap. Is that okay, given my medical conditions?\" \"My wife says I drink too much at parties. I'd like to know what you think.\" Whether you raise the subject of alcohol use or your healthcare provider does, be honest about how much and how often you drink. Your health and even your life may depend on it. What Should I Expect During My Medical Appointment? Screening If you bring up alcohol concerns with your healthcare provider, he or she will likely ask you to answer a screening instrument or questionnaire. The most common alcohol screening instruments have just 1 to 10 questions. Your healthcare provider may ask you the questions directly, or you may answer them on paper or on a computer or tablet. Examples of alcohol screening questions are \"Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?\" and \"Do you usually take a drink to calm your nerves?\" 1383,1384 220 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? Screening helps your healthcare provider decide whether to look further into your alcohol use. It will also help you and your healthcare provider decide whether you may need specialized treatment to address alcohol misuse. Assessment If screening suggests that you misuse alcohol, your healthcare provider will probably do an \"assessment\" or refer you to a specialist who can do it. Whoever does the assessment will ask you more questions about how much and how often you drink. The assessment will help your healthcare provider understand any negative effects of your drinking, your drinking history, and any previous treatment you may have had for misuse of alcohol or other substances. Other assessment questions may focus on your living situation and degree of support from family and friends. 1385 You will likely have a physical exam, and you may also have lab tests to check for alcohol use and any resulting damage to your liver or other organs. What Typically Happens Next? During this or a follow-up visit, your healthcare provider should give you more information and feedback about your drinking. The feedback will help you understand the results of the assessment and lab tests. Any other information you receive may help explain the risks and health effects of your alcohol use. Your healthcare provider may diagnose you with AUD if you meet certain criteria. CAN MEDICATION TREAT AUD? The Food and Drug Administration has approved three medications for treating AUD.1386 All three require a prescription. If you receive a prescription for any of them, you'll need to take the medication for at least 3 months1387 and probably longer.1388 Although these medications don't work for everyone, they do appear to be as safe and effective for older adults as they are for younger adults.1389 Not all healthcare providers prescribe these medications. You may need to see an addiction specialist or psychiatrist if you want to explore this approach to treatment. Most people who take medication for AUD do better if they receive counseling too, especially early in treatment. 1390 Some people incorrectly regard taking medication for AUD as substituting one addiction for another. You may even encounter this attitude in certain addiction treatment programs. 1391 However, none of these medications is addictive. Using them is like taking medication for any other chronic illness, like diabetes or asthma. 1392 You may also receive a referral to an addiction specialist or an addiction treatment facility, depending on your level of alcohol use and health status. 1393 You should seek someone who specializes in addiction treatment with older adults who have been using alcohol for a long time or who have health conditions that could complicate treatment for alcohol misuse. Your healthcare provider may also refer you to a mutual-help group like AA. 1394 What Are My Options for Specialized AUD Treatment? If you receive specialized treatment for AUD, you may move from one setting to another as the treatment proceeds. Whatever the setting, you will usually get counseling and education about alcohol misuse. Personal preference, availability, and eligibility requirements can affect your decision on where to get treatment. Cost can also affect your decision. Check with your health insurer to see how much coverage it provides for the treatment option you seek. The following list describes the main specialized treatment options: Regular outpatient treatment typically consists of individual therapy, group therapy, or both, provided by a trained therapist. Additional services, such as family therapy and connection Chapter 8 221 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults RESOURCE ALERT: TREATMENT LOCATOR FOR VETERANS If you are a veteran or are covered by health benefts for veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can help you fnd VA services close to you. Use the VA SUD Program Locator at www. va.gov/directory/guide/SUD.asp for your search. to mutual-help groups, may be included.1395 Some outpatient treatment is provided by healthcare providers or addiction specialists. In addition to doing assessments and diagnosing AUD, these specialists may provide counseling and prescribe medications for AUD. Outpatient programs differ a lot in how long they last and how intensive they are. Medically supervised withdrawal is a process during which healthcare providers monitor you as your body clears itself of alcohol. This process is sometimes called detoxifcation, or \"detox.\" In medically supervised withdrawal, medical staff monitor and treat withdrawal symptoms and manage other health conditions as needed. 1396 Medically supervised withdrawal in an inpatient setting, such as a hospital, is normally recommended for older adults. 1397 If you undergo medically supervised withdrawal, you may receive referrals from the medical staff to addiction counselors or other behavioral health service providers for continuing treatment of AUD. If no referral is offered, you can ask for one or explore other options for continuing treatment or recovery support, such as attending AA meetings or using a treatment locator like FindTreatment.gov or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Helpline (1-800-662-HELP). Intensive outpatient programs typically provide services at least 3 days a week, for at least 2 or 3 hours each day (or evening). 1398 These services can include group and individual counseling, family therapy, medical and mental health evaluations, medication, and education about addiction and coping skills. 1399,1400 These programs may take place at hospitals, mental health clinics, or offce-based private practices. Partial hospitalization programs typically run 4 to 6 hours a day, 3 to 7 days a week. They are also called day treatment programs. As with intensive outpatient programs, you do not stay overnight for treatment. These programs often treat addiction and mental disorders at the same time. 1401 Specialized residential treatment facilities usually offer group and individual therapy, recreational activities, and mutual-help group meetings. Consider this type of facility if you would have diffculty getting to and from outpatient treatment or if you need more counseling, medical services, or ongoing guidance than an outpatient program would offer. WHAT ARE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES? These facilities range from small group homes or recovery houses with few staff and services to specialized facilities with intensive, highly structured programs that keep physicians and nurses on staff. People staying in group homes or recovery houses may get outpatient treatment at another facility. A residential facility may be a good option for you if you think you'd do better in treatment while away from your home or neighborhood. 1402 How Do I Pick a Treatment Program? NIAAA's Alcohol Treatment Navigator recommends 10 general questions to ask when looking for a quality alcohol treatment program. The Navigator is available online (https://alcoholtreatment. niaaa.nih.gov/how-to-fnd-alcohol-treatment/10-questions-for-alcohol-treatment-programs). 222 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? Think about the issues you most want help with in treatment. Ask the programs you're considering whether they address these issues. You may also want to ask: 1403 Does the program focus just on older adults or have a special track or groups for older adults? Does the program cover topics like grief, loss, and isolation? Can an older adult who uses a wheelchair/ walker/cane easily enter and move around the facility? What modifcations will the program make for older adults with vision/hearing problems? Do I need my own transportation to get there? If you can't fnd a program just for older adults even though that's what you want, consider one that mixes age groups. Research shows that older adults can also do well in these programs. 1404,1405 If possible, take tours of the facilities that you are considering. RESOURCE ALERT: SAMHSA'S FREE NATIONAL HELPLINE SAMHSA's free National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) can refer you to SUD treatment facilities that accept Medicare or Medicaid. If you are uninsured, check this SAMHSA directory for the agency in your state to contact about possible help with paying for addiction services: www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/fles/ssa-directory-01212020.pdf . COMMON TYPES OF THERAPY As part of inpatient or outpatient treatment, you'll likely participate in one or more forms of therapy to help you address the feelings and behaviors that led to your alcohol misuse. Some of the most common therapies are briefy described below. Often, two or more of these therapies are used together. 1406,1407 Acceptance and commitment therapy encourages people to live a satisfying life by accepting losses that are fnal, reconnecting with their values, and working toward goals that refect those values. 1408 Example: Through therapy, a man who began drinking heavily alone after his wife's death recognizes that drinking conficts with the value he places on being an involved grandfather. He could enter alcohol treatment with the goal of becoming abstinent so that he can spend more time with his granddaughter. Behavioral couples therapy (BCT) seeks to encourage abstinence in someone who misuses substances by improving his or her relationship with a spouse or partner through better communication, shared activities, and positive reinforcement. The spouse or partner also participates in the therapy. Example: Through BCT, a husband agrees to discuss his wife's drinking only during a set time each day, and both he and she agree to end the discussion with words of appreciation for each other. 1409 CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and change unhelpful thought processes that trigger alcohol misuse and to develop healthier behaviors to replace drinking.1410,1411 Example: A man worries that he won't ft in with his golf group if he stops drinking with them after games. After talking about his beliefs and thoughts with his therapist, he could experiment with having only nonalcoholic drinks after games and realize that he's not bothered by his golf partners' reactions. Continued on next page Chapter 8 223 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Continued Coping skills therapy focuses on dealing with diffcult thoughts (including cravings), emotions, and situations in ways that don't involve alcohol. Goals include learning how to manage anger and stress, become more assertive, and avoid people and places that encourage drinking. 1412 Example: A woman who drinks after phone calls with her argumentative brother might role-play with a therapist how to change the subject during an argument or limit the length of calls. Family therapy ideally involves the entire family of a person in treatment for AUD and seeks to improve how family members relate to each other. The goals are to support both the recovery of the individual in treatment and the family's well-being. 1413 Example: Through family therapy, a widow who had avoided interacting with her two adult children because of her secret alcohol misuse could work on repairing her relationships with them. They in turn could become more understanding by learning how she drank to cope with their father's death. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) is a group therapy approach that combines teaching mindful meditation practices and traditional relapse prevention techniques, such as how to refuse drinks. Mindfulness helps you accept awareness of impulses to drink and develop the ability not to act on them. 1414 Example: Through MBRP, a woman who used to unwind from her job by drinking heavily at home after work could instead use breathing techniques and guided meditations on audiotapes to calm her mind. Motivational interviewing is an approach for overcoming unhealthy habits in which the therapist helps the client explore and strengthen the desire for change, and then develop and act on a plan for change. 1415 Example: A man who takes heart medication and socializes mainly at his independent living facility's daily happy hour could, through motivational interviewing, decide that he doesn't want to risk a medication- alcohol interaction. He could do his socializing instead after the facility's nightly movie showing. Relapse prevention therapy helps people recognize and plan to respond constructively to high-risk situations for, or warning signs of, a return to alcohol use. Example: A woman at risk of drinking when alone at night could work with a therapist to fnd activities to do instead of drinking, such as coloring or scrapbooking. How Can I Get Support From Family and Friends? Don't be embarrassed or shy about involving supportive family members and friends in your effort to quit or cut back on drinking. They will probably want to help, especially if they have already told you they are concerned about your drinking. Consider asking them to: 1416,1417,1418 Avoid drinking in front of you. Offer you just nonalcoholic beverages. Join you in alcohol-free activities. Go along when you discuss your drinking with a healthcare professional, to help you take notes and to provide support. Accompany or drive you to mutual-help group meetings. Be available to talk to you if you get an urge to drink. Another way that family members can help is by participating in family therapy or BCT with you, if you are in treatment and your provider recommends such therapy. For more information, refer family members to SAMHSA's Family Therapy Can Help booklet, which is available at no cost (https://store.samhsa.gov/ product/Family-Therapy-Can-Help-For-People-in-Recovery-From-Mental-Illness-or-Addiction/ SMA15-4784). 1419 Also consider asking any family members that you live with to keep little or no alcohol at home. 1420 224 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? WHAT IF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE? What if you are uncomfortable asking those around you to actively support your abstinence, or you do ask but don't get a positive response? First, don't isolate yourself. 1421 Instead, consider joining a mutual-help group and/or working with a recovery coach or peer recovery support specialist. This individual, who often has personal experience with addiction, acts as a mentor and a motivator. He or she can also help you fnd alcohol treatment. Some are volunteers and some are paid by you or a third party. 1422 How Can I Encourage Myself? First, give yourself credit for realizing that you may need to do something about your drinking. Remember that many different treatment options are available for alcohol misuse. These options have enabled many older adults like you to stop or reduce their alcohol consumption. 1423 Congratulate yourself on any action you take to limit how much you drink. In addition, remind yourself that, no matter what your age, overcoming alcohol misuse can help you feel better and live longer. Information for Family and Caregivers What Can I Do as a Caregiver or Family Member? Know the Warning Signs of Alcohol Misuse If you think a family member may be misusing alcohol, review the list of warning signs in the \"How Can I Tell Whether I'm Misusing Alcohol?\" section. Other signs to look for include: 1424,1425 Hiding alcohol supplies. Denying or justifying drinking. Refusing to discuss drinking. Becoming annoyed when asked about drinking. 1426 Becoming aggressive or abusive. Displaying excessive mood swings. Having new problems with decision making.1427 Appearing sleepy during the day. Falling behind on bills. Having unexplained burns or bruises.1428 Having frequent car accidents. Talking about or attempting suicide. Suicide attempts and talk of suicide require immediate attention. Call 911 if your family member attempts or threatens suicide. Call your family member's healthcare professional or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) if you worry that he or she is thinking about suicide. Note that by July 2022, you will also be able to reach this hotline by dialing 988. CHALLENGES TO RECOGNIZING ALCOHOL MISUSE Alcohol misuse among older adults often goes unrecognized. These three examples illustrate the problem: A healthcare provider who cares for an older woman assumes that the broken capillaries on her face are the result of old age rather than her heavy drinking. An older man who drinks as much as he did in middle age does not realize that what was moderate drinking then is alcohol misuse now\u2014especially given that he's developed diabetes. A daughter does not know that her widowed father misuses alcohol because he drinks only when home alone. Know About Your Family Member's Medications Know what prescription and OTC medications your relative takes. The same advice applies to dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbal products. Review the \"Check Your Medications for Alcohol Interactions\" text box for tips on fnding out whether these products have harmful interactions with alcohol. Chapter 8 225 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults You may need written or verbal permission from your family member to discuss possible alcohol interactions with his or her healthcare provider or pharmacist. 1429 Even without such permission, you can still inform these healthcare providers of any concerns you have about interactions. Know How To Connect Your Family Member With Help See \"What Are My Options for Specialized AUD Treatment?\" for information on fnding treatment facilities and providers in your area. Look at the section \"Join a Mutual-Help Group\" for tips on fnding mutual-help group meetings, if this type of support would be appropriate for your family member. Know When and How To Talk About Getting Help Talking constructively with a family member about a drinking problem takes patience. But the payoff may be a greater willingness on his or her part to address the problem. Where you can, connect the conversation to your concerns about your family member's health. Here are some other tips: 1430,1431,1432 Don't bring up the topic when your family member is intoxicated. Use \"I\" messages that express your feelings and concern, not \"You\" messages that criticize or blame the older adult. For example, you can say, \"I worry that you'll have another bad fall if you don't cut back on your drinking\" instead of \"You drink so much that you get falling-down drunk!\" Don't use guilt, threats, or bribes to try to get your family member to stop drinking. Avoid using offensive terms like \"an alcoholic\" or \"an addict\" or \"a drunk.\" Make positive comments about your family member's strengths and personality. Adjust what you say and how much you say at one time to match his or her ability to understand. Remind the person how drinking interferes with his or her values, relationships, or favorite activities. Offer to drive or arrange transportation for treatment or a mutual-help group. Participate in Therapy Participating in therapy with your family member can support his or her treatment. Your relationship with your family member could also beneft because of your participation. See \"Family Therapy\" and \"Behavioral Couples Therapy\" in the \"Common Types of Therapy\" section for brief descriptions of these approaches. You can read more about family therapy in SAMHSA's Family Therapy Can Help booklet at https://store.samhsa. gov/product/Family-Therapy-Can-Help-For-People-in-Recovery-From-Mental-Illness-or-Addiction/ SMA15-4784. Don't Enable Drinking Sometimes it may seem easier just to pretend that a family member's drinking is not a problem. But doing so can be unhealthy for both of you. Also, if your family member has dementia, don't use alcohol to help him or her sleep or calm down. Doing so is unsafe and can worsen symptoms. Help Your Family Member Avoid Alcohol Withdrawal If your family member requires emergency hospitalization for any reason, tell the hospital staff immediately if he or she misuses alcohol. Otherwise, he or she may experience alcohol withdrawal, which the medical team could miss or mistake for another condition. The medical team involved in a planned hospitalization for your family member also needs to know in advance if he or she misuses alcohol. 1433 See the \"Is Alcohol Withdrawal a Concern?\" section for more information. Take Care of Yourself Sometimes you have to put yourself frst to continue to care for your family member. Accept offers of help and make time to socialize with others. Try to get enough sleep and exercise. Look after yourself by keeping medical appointments and not using alcohol or other substances to cope with stress or other diffcult emotions. 226 Chapter 8 TIP 26 Chapter 8\u2014Drinking as an Older Adult: What Do I Need To Know? WHAT IF I'M OVERWHELMED? If you are concerned about caregiving's effects on your health or behavior, consider taking the Caregiver Self-Assessment Questionnaire (CSAQ), originally developed and tested by the American Medical Association. This questionnaire is available online (www.healthinaging.org/ tools-and-tips/caregiver-self-assessment - questionnaire) without cost in interactive and downloadable versions. The CSAQ is meant as a guide only. Discuss any concerns you have about your results with your healthcare provider. 1434 Also consider talking with a therapist, especially one with experience with addiction issues. 1435 Join a Mutual-Help Group Al-Anon is a mutual-help group for people concerned about or affected by someone with alcohol misuse. If you cannot attend an in-person meeting, look into meetings that take place online or by phone. To learn more, call 1-888-425-2666 (toll-free) or go to the Al-Anon website (https:// al-anon.org). If your family member is in addiction treatment, fnd out whether the facility or individual provider runs support groups or programs for family members and friends. 1436 Other options are listed in the Resource Alert at the end of this section. What If My Family Member Won't Discuss Drinking? Your family member may refuse to discuss his or her drinking habits no matter what you say. Options for next steps include talking to and involving: 1437 Your family member's healthcare provider. An adult family member. A close family friend. A clergyperson. Your family member's case manager or social worker, if applicable. It may be easier for your family member to hear about his or her alcohol misuse from someone other than you. Getting another viewpoint may also help your family member see how serious the problem is. Also consider taking a facility tour, if possible, so that you can better discuss the treatment experience.

DSM-5 Criteria and Older Adults Who Drink DSM-5 CRITERIA FOR AUD1446 CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS1447,1448,1449 Criterion A1 Older adults may need less alcohol to feel physical effects. Cognitive impairment can make it hard for older adults to keep track of their drinking. Criterion A2 No special considerations for older adults. Criterion A3 Effects of alcohol can result from drinking even small amounts, so relatively less time may be spent getting and drinking alcohol and recovering from using it. Criterion A4 No special considerations for older adults. Criterion A5 Older adults may have different role responsibilities because of life-stage changes, such as retirement. Role responsibilities more common in older adulthood include caregiving for a spouse or another family member, such as a grandchild. Criterion A6 Older adults may not realize that social or interpersonal problems they are experiencing are connected to their alcohol use. Criterion A7 Older adults may take part in fewer activities generally, making it more diffcult to discover when drinking is causing them to withdraw from activities. Criterion A8 Older adults may not understand that their alcohol use is hazardous, especially when they are drinking the same as or less than before. In addition, older adults may not realize the physical dangers of drinking in certain situations (e.g., before using a step stool). Criterion A9 Older adults experiencing physical or psychological problems may not realize that drinking could be a factor. Criterion A10 Changes in tolerance occur because of increased sensitivity to alcohol with age. Previously manageable quantities of alcohol may cause greater impairment. Criterion A11 Withdrawal symptoms in older adults can last longer, be less obvious, or be mistaken for age-related illness.

Ask them to return it to you, and then discuss the results with them. A cutoff score of 5 means you need to assess further. 1454 Chapter 9 257 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Alcohol Use Disorders Identifcation Test-C (AUDIT-C) Resource summary: The AUDIT-C is a much shorter version of the AUDIT that can help you identify alcohol misuse in your clients. It contains only three questions, which add up to a total score of 0-12. A higher score usually means the client is engaging in more hazardous alcohol use. The AUDIT-C is scored as follows: For Questions 1 and 3, assign 0 points to response a, 1 point to response b, 2 points to response c, 3 points to response d, and 4 points to response e. For Question 2, assign 0 points to responses a and b, 1 point to response c, 2 points to response d, 3 points to response e, and 4 points to response f. A total score of 3 or higher for women and 4 or higher for men means problematic alcohol use. In such cases, you should assess further (or refer for formal assessment) to learn more about the client's drinking habits and determine whether AUD is present.

Items 1, 3, 8, 10, and 11 are reverse scored as follows: Very typical of me = 1 (circled 5 on the sheet) Circled 4 on the sheet = 2 Circled 3 on the sheet = 3 Circled 2 on the sheet = 4 Not at all typical of me = 5 (circled 1 on the sheet) The remaining items are scored regularly. The item scores are added to produce a total score ranging from 16 to 80, with higher scores refecting more worry. A score of 50 or higher by an older person could mean signifcant worries are present, but research on cutoff scores in older people is too limited to know for certain. 1471 Do not assume that an older client who scores below 50 does not have anxiety.

It is tested and approved for use with older clients. 1476 The screener is also useful for monitoring depression severity and treatment response in clients who have already screened positive for or been diagnosed with depression. A two-item version of the PHQ-9 is available (the PHQ-2) that includes only the frst two questions from the PHQ-9. However, compared with the PHQ-9, the PHQ-2 has a higher likelihood of giving older adults a false positive (that is, incorrectly rating a person as depressed when they are not). 1477 To get more reliable results, you should give the full PHQ-9. If you give the PHQ-2, be sure to give the full PHQ-9 to older adults who have a total score of 3 or higher. 1478 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Scoring: The total score for the PHQ-9 is derived by frst summing each column (e.g., each item chosen in column \"More than half the days\" = 2), then summing the column totals. Total scores range from 0 to 27 and indicate the following levels of depression severity: 0-4: None-minimal 5-9: Mild depression 10-14: Moderate depression 15-19: Moderately severe depression 20-27: Severe depression In addition to the total score, review responses to Question #9 (suicidality) and the unnumbered question below it (the effect of symptoms on the client's daily functioning) when determining whether to initiate or refer for further assessment and treatment. 1479,1480,1481 268 Chapter 9 TIP 26 Chapter 9\u2014Resources for Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults PTSD for for DSM-5 has been approved for use with older adults. 1482 The VA gives instructions on how to use the tool. A score of 50 often means PTSD is present.1483 However, in older clients a score of 50 may be too high and might not catch all older people with possible PTSD.1484 Because of this, a cutoff score of 34 is better for adults ages 50 to 64, and a cutoff score of 24 is better for adults ages 65 to 81. 1485 PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) Instructions: Below is a list of problems that people sometimes have in response to a very stressful experience.

It is approved for use in older adults, including those from diverse racial and ethnic populations. 1493 In the following instructions, say \"hurt\" or \"pain,\" whichever seems right for a particular client. \"These faces show how much something can hurt. This face [point to face on far left] shows no pain. The faces show more and more pain [point to each from left to right] up to this one [point to face on far right]\u2014it shows very much pain. Point to the face that shows how much you hurt [right now].\" Score the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right. Therefore, \"0\" = \"no pain\" and \"10\" = \"very much pain.\" Do not use words like \"happy\" or \"sad.\" This scale is intended to measure how a client feels inside, not how his or her face looks.

Functional Activities Questionnaire Resource summary: This tool is used for older adults with normal cognition; mild cognitive impairment; or mild, moderate, or advanced dementia. It is used to measure IADLs. 1500 The questionnaire should be completed by a person who knows the client well (usually a caregiver or adult family member), has observed his or her behavior, and can assess the client's ability to complete IADLs and how much assistance they need, if any. Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/ssw/sites/lubben/description.html Resource summary: The LSNS is designed for use with older adults. It is intended to gauge the level of a person's social support from family and friends and to determine whether that person's score indicates social isolation, which can contribute to increased mental and physical problems in older adults. Older clients can easily complete the six-item short version (LSNS-6), a self-report questionnaire available at the same website. Social Network Map www.researchgate.net/publication/232542443_The_Social_Network_Map_Assessing_Social_Support_in_ Clinical_Practice Resource summary: The Social Network Map is a client-centered tool that collects information on the composition of the older adult's social network, the extent to which network members provide different types of support, and the nature of relationships in the network. 1501 The version below is adapted for older adults in recovery. Social Network Map for Older Adults in Recovery Adapted from Tracy & Whittaker (1990).1502 Chapter 9 275 TIP 26 Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults The following strategies1503 will help you and your older clients develop a social network map: Create a pie chart with the seven domains. Health, behavioral health service, social service, and peer recovery support providers may be part of the support network clients identify. Ask older clients to identify members of their social networks by frst name or initials only. Ask clients to describe how available (e.g., rarely, sometimes, often) each member of the network is to give emotional, instrumental, or informational support. Give examples and be specifc: -\"Who is available to give you emotional support like comforting you if you are upset or listening if you are stressed?\" \"How often does this person give you that kind of support?\" -\"Who is available to help you out in a concrete way like giving you a ride or helping with a chore?\" \"How often does this person give you that kind of support?\" -\"Who would give you information on how to do something new or help you make a big decision?\" \"How often does this person give you that kind of support?\" Note the type and frequency of support each person listed in each domain can offer. Ask clients to describe how close they are to each member of their network, how long they have known them, and how frequently they see them. Ask clients to review the map and identify types of support that may be lacking and strategies for adding new network members to beef up their social support. Wellness Planning Tools Collaborative Goal Setting Using SMART www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/fles/nc-smart-goals-fact-sheet.pdf Resource summary: SMART goals are Specifc, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Use the following tips for writing SMART goals related to alcohol and drug use and to health and wellness. Writing a SMART Goal Specifc: State the goal clearly. Ask the client to be specifc. For example, if the goal is \"I just want to be healthy,\" ask \"How will you know when you are 'healthy'\"? or \"What things will you be able to do when you are healthy that you can't do now?\" Measurable: Identify and quantify the observable markers of progress, such as pain levels or the number of days and amount of time the client walked each week. Invite the client to keep a log of these markers so you can discuss the client's progress. Attainable: Break the goal into smaller, actionable steps. Identify expected barriers and make a plan to address them. For example, if the goal is to get 8 hours of sleep each night, break the goal into smaller tasks, like turn all the lights in the bedroom off at 10 p.m. at least fve nights a week. Then ask, \"What might keep you from turning the lights off at 10 p.m.?\" Relevant: Make sure the goal refects what's personally relevant to the individual. Use MI to set the agenda and determine goals on which to focus. Link goals, such as blood pressure control, to the goal of staying healthy. Time-bound: Defne when the goal is to be attained. Help the client be specifc about the timeframe. Make it realistic and attainable, based on the client's subjective evaluation. Agree when to check progress.

Large-Print Grief Handout What Is Grief? Grief is a natural response to loss. It's the emotional suffering you feel when something or someone you love is taken away. Whatever your loss, it's personal to you. Coping With Grief Although loss is a part of life that cannot be avoided, there are ways to help cope with the pain, come to terms with your grief, and eventually, fnd a way to move on with your life. This doesn't mean you will forget your loved one, but you can fnd a way to hold that individual in your heart and your memories while continuing to live your life. This includes: Acknowledging your pain. Accepting that grief can bring up many different and unexpected feelings. Understanding that your grieving process will be unique to you. Seeking out face-to-face support from people who care about you. Supporting yourself emotionally by taking care of yourself physically. Learning the difference between grief and depression.

Does Your Drinking Confict With Your Top Values? If you are considering quitting or cutting back on your alcohol intake, it may help to think about whether your drinking conficts with your top values. You may frst need to identify what those values are. Think of your top values as the principles, qualities, and beliefs that are most important to you and that you most want your life to refect. Examples of values include independence, generosity, and honesty. The Internet has many free exercises on identifying top values. These exercises differ in what values are listed and how you prioritize them, so you may want to look at more than one exercise. Some values exercises can be found at: www.smartrecovery.org/smart-recovery-toolbox/values-and-goals-clarifcation https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e35whN7tkXtvlHv www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/values-clarifcation.pdf Below are several questions to ask yourself about the relationship between your drinking and your top values. Does drinking confict with any of your top values? If so: Which values does drinking confict with? __________________________________________________________________ How does drinking confict with these values? ______________________________________________________________ How does this confict keep you from living out your top values in daily life? Be as specifc as possible. _______ 280 Chapter 9 TIP 26 Chapter 9\u2014Resources for Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults Drinking Logs: Many people fnd using drinking cards or logs helpful in reducing or quitting alcohol consumption.
