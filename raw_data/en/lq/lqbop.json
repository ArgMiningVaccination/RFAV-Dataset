They still live in small communities, fishing daily, hunting and relying on subsistence farming. They remain relatively isolated from the outside world. They still have large families and fall victim to parasites, worms and infectious diseases. And until a decade ago, few had contact with doctors. Yet [since 2002](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/27/science/a-doctor-s-journey-ancient-ways-harsh-terrain-and-many-bugs.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm), when the [Tsimane Health and Life History Project ](http://www.unm.edu/~tsimane/)was founded, the Tsimane (pronounced chee-MAH-nay) have become arguably the most intensely studied indigenous people in the Western Hemisphere, and perhaps the world. More than 50 Bolivian and American researchers, doctors and students have participated in the health project, generating an array of landmark studies. The population of 13,000, which stretches along the Maniqui River, has become the scientific community's 21st-century \"traditional man.\" Research on the Tsimane led to the finding in 2009 that cardiovascular disease is probably an ill of modern societies. Studies of the group also provided the most conclusive data supporting the idea that high levels of physical activity drastically reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Ongoing Tsimane research explores links between testosterone and infection, diet and the nutritional value of breast milk, and DNA and life span. There have been 42 studies with results published, and at least 33 more are under way. \"This is the most productive research site in anthropology today,\" Ray Hames, an anthropologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said. Samuel Bowles, of the behavioral sciences program at the Santa Fe Institute, said, \"The Tsimane will soon become a basic point of reference for everyone studying small-scale societies.\" [Michael Gurven](http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/gurven/), an anthropologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who is a founder and a director of the project, said the primary focus of the Tsimane studies was aging. \"We look at what's different and what's similar between the Tsimane and Western populations,\" he said. The Tsimane were chosen because of their numbers; of all Amazonian indigenous groups still living relatively traditionally, the Tsimane are one of the most numerous. \"Thirteen thousand is a better data pool than 800,\" Dr. Gurven said. The Tsimane also have the advantage of variety within that population, said [Hillard Kaplan](http://www.unm.edu/~hkaplan/), an anthropologist at the University of New Mexico and the project's other founder and director. A small number of the Tsimane live in or around San Borja, the area's only town; they own motorcycles and use cellphones. The farther up the Maniqui River from San Borja you go, the more traditional the way of life. In Puerto Yucumo, a village of thatched huts in plantain groves, women sit in groups at midday, their legs outstretched, attending to babies (the average family has nine children), cooking or weaving. They chatter in their native tongue; few speak Spanish and fewer have finished primary school. Their feet are flat, wide and thick, the sign of a lifetime spent barefoot. \"My people are tied to the land and their way of life,\" said Jorge A\u00f1ez, mayor of San Borja, the highest elected seat a Tsimane has held in Bolivia. The contrast to the modern world provides a fascinating basis for study, with \"real public health significance for us,\" said [John C. Haaga](http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2005/03_15_2005/story08.htm), a program officer at the National Institutes of Health, which has supported the Tsimane studies for years. The studies have required time and personnel. Thesis students live in communities for up to a year. A roving medical unit visits almost all 90 Tsimane villages at least once a year. The infiltration of doctors and anthropologists has had some effect on the culture, the researchers acknowledge, but not as much as might be expected. \"The world is changing around the Tsimane, and they are changing with it, regardless of our presence,\" said Dr. Kaplan. He said the Tsimane lifestyle was altered much more by government stipends for the children and the elderly, altering the subsistence economy. Nevertheless, the researchers had a threshold moment as they began the study. Could they, in good conscience, send doctors into the villages to study the population without also providing the Tsimane with basic medical care? They decided they could not. \"The depth of our science and the depth of our helping are two sides of the same coin,\" Dr. Kaplan said. His field team offers basic medical exams for anyone who shows up, provides free medicine for common ailments like stomach parasites, and does on-the-spot analysis of blood, urine and fecal samples. \"It would be unethical not to do this,\" [Jane Lancaster](http://www.unm.edu/~jlancas/), editor of the journal Human Nature, said. \"If you are performing research and bothering these people, the least you can do is provide medical care.\" Still, officials at one of the project's supporters, the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/), wondered: How can you study health conditions while simultaneously altering them? Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Gurven said they convinced the foundation and others that the kind of medical care they administer \u2014 sporadic treatment for parasites, ibuprofen for headaches, stitches for machete wounds \u2014 does not taint data on chronic, long-term disease. Indeed, far along the Maniqui River, it's clear that intermittent medical care goes only so far. \"Yesterday we had eight kids, now we have seven,\" said Damiana Vie Cari, 33, of the village of San Joaquin, whose 3-month-old baby had died after lying out in the field while she worked. \"Too much sun,\" she said. About 4 to 6 percent of the Tsimane die before age 1, according to the project's unpublished estimates. (That's down from 12 percent in 2002, when Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Gurven began their work; reductions in child and maternal mortality have been the team's most notable public health contribution.) About 15 percent die before age 5. And they still fall ill from parasites and worms, and infectious diseases like dengue, leishmaniasis and tuberculosis. Mr. A\u00f1ez, the mayor, said the Tsimane were appreciative of the free health care. Indeed, as soon as the roving medicos alight in a village, mothers with sickly children slung on their backs converge on the teams. Families go to the San Borja clinic aboard the project's shuttles, which are meant only to transport Tsimane adults age 40 and older for the full work-ups that are part of the studies, including echocardiograms, lung function tests, white blood cell counts, and lifestyle surveys. Dr. Gurven said the researchers repeatedly explain what they are doing. Every patient must give oral consent, and all are shown a video about where their blood goes for testing. Yet helping the Tsimane understand the groundbreaking medical findings they are assisting has not been easy. Melanie Martin, a doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, remembers returning excitedly to her research village to report her recent findings: Compared with breast milk produced by Western women, Tsimane women's milk is higher in omega-3 fatty acids, which are critical for brain development. She was met with \"a lot of blank stares,\" she said. \"So, do we need medicine?\" one villager asked. The researchers nevertheless believe that they are in a race for time. \"The Tsimane are not going to stay this "}
