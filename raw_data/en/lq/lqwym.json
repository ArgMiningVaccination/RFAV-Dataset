They are not just excellent health professionals at treating musculoskeletal related problems but they are also experts at providing their patients with overall wellness care and proper nutrition is a big part of that. Nutrition plays a big role in keeping the 'human frame' in top working condition and the human frame is what chiropractors specialize in. It is sad to say that most medical doctors do not study nutrition as part of their curriculum. This leads to a lot of misunderstanding when it comes to taking vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Many times the subject is simply not discussed because of the lack of knowledge of it, this does not help the patient in most cases. Chiropractors on the other hand study vitamins and other supplements which are both easily absorbed by the body and seem to have many nutritional health benefits too. Just like chiropractic therapy is an all-natural form of treatment, so are the supplements and vitamins that chiropractors refer to their patients. They do not advise their patients to use synthetic vitamins and other man made products but instead highly recommend what are known as 'food based vitamins and supplements'. These are vitamins and supplements that are in their natural state so it makes them 'bio-available' for optimal use by the cells in the human body. A lot of the vitamins that are found in a drug store are synthetically produced by big pharmaceutical companies. These same companies know there is far more profit to be gained from prescription drugs than dietary supplements so that is what the majority of their research money goes to. This results in a lot of poorly conceived vitamins lining the drugstore shelves across the country. What does your chiropractor know that other health professionals may not in terms of vitamins and supplements? How about such things as that a vitamin D deficiency can be the cause of some forms of back pain; imagine how lucky you would be if you had a chance to eliminate your back pain simply by taking vitamins or nutritional supplements. Or maybe you are taking vitamin B in a non B-complex form and the result is it's throwing off the entire balance of the B vitamins in your system. These are important things to know and Doctors of Chiropractic make it their business to stay up on the latest in nutritional guidance. Chiropractic education requires a year or more of nutrition to be a part of the core curriculum. Even maintaining a Doctor of chiropractic license requires taking continuing education courses and nutrition courses must be a part of that. Chiropractors are taught how the body is formed and takes in nutrition from the minute of conception; it is why they know the best forms of supplements and vitamins that are easily absorbed by your body and put to good use in it. So don't just think of your chiropractor as a practitioner of advanced treatments for musculoskeletal related problems but look at them also as the highly informed nutritionists that they are too. "}
