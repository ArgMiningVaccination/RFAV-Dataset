LIGHTWORKER HEALING PROTOCOL The Lightworker Healing Protocol is a vast, comprehensive advanced healing technology unlike anything else available. It works through Divine Partnership, using high level, scientific prayer requests to harness the highest level healing there is - the Divine Source itself. Through our requests, we unleash the full power and love of the God force, guided by our alignment and intention. (It is never us doing the healing but we play an important role.) .. LHP addresses the widest range of challenges for individuals, including emotional, physical, and spiritual issues of all kinds (see below). It also offers healing for humanity as a whole, for the planet, and beyond - with requests for specific actions to be taken by the Divine realm spanning the gamut from the most personal to the most cosmic. There's nothing it cannot address! .. LHP healing interventions include energy re-balancing; removal of all spirit attachments, dark energies and emotional/energetic attacks; karmic repair; clearing negative thought forms and energy cords, restoring soul fragments, dissolving curses, vows, and contracts; repairing connection with your higher self, as well as protection against spirit re-attachment, environmental hazards, and much much more, including the client's specific healing requests. .. LHP works with humans, animals, locations, and lost souls needing rescue. (Not sure if your loved ones who passed on have reached the light? I can tell you, and help them if they are stuck.) It also implements healing for the negative entities who afflict humanity in order to restore them to the light. This is its highest and most unique feature, for it is designed to help lift the energy of humanity as a whole, heal Gaia, and release humans from negative forces - but at the same time can address a client's most intimate personal issues regarding health, relationships, finances, career, etc. .. Whatever your issues are, LHP is the best first step in your healing journey, for it addresses not only your personal concerns, but many hazards you may not be aware of. .. Some of the most remarkable features of the protocol are that it is structured to repeat over and over, in perpetuity, and to include the healing energies of all light beings working together with us, so that the effect of the healing is exponentially amplified. .. When you receive an LHP session the efforts of the whole Divine team will continue until your healing is achieved. .. LHP is truly a unique, one-of-a-kind tool that goes far beyond treating personal complaints. In fact, we are told that this is the means by which humanity can finally be freed from our long history of suffering, since we prioritize healing the perpetrators who keep us suppressed. No other healing method I know of can make this claim! .. FEES: $150 as a stand-alone treatment with consultation and follow-up for one person (add $50 for each additional family member or pet) .. In case of financial need, please contact me privately. .. .. 2. DEEP SUBCONSCIOUS TRAUMA RESOLUTION Deep Subconscious Trauma Resolution is a powerful healing modality that goes deep into the roots of any issue troubling you - those roots that lie in your many past lifetimes. Done remotely, it works on the level of your deep subconscious mind (a level of mind deeper than the normal subconscious contacted in hypnoses, guided meditation, etc.) . . Do you know that anxiety and fear from past lives you're not even conscious of may be troubling you now - because your deep subconscious is aware of them? This can all be cleared! . . . Partnering with the Divine realm, we call up ALL your past lives that are related to the issues you want help with. (You are invited to submit three main issues, but we also ask Creator to discern the most important issues for you - including ones you may not even be aware of.) Each and every past life receives powerful healing for its traumas. All negative events are reframed and transformed so that the emotional signature is changed permanently in your Akashic Records, erasing the former painful imprints. The internalized limiting beliefs (that have been undermining your well-being to this day) are also transformed into positive, empowering, life-affirming ones. Dramatic changes often result, as a deep unconscious wound is healed, and a powerful transformation occurs. This session is recommended if you want maximum healing power but do not desire to know the details of your healing concern, past lives or any other information. This is especially powerful because you will be combining your own desired issues with requesting the divine to heal your most significant karma or healing blocks!
