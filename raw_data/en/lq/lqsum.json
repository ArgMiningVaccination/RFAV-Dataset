The clinic opened on March 1, near the beginning of the pandemic's third wave. \"The clinic provided the city of Mississauga with its first site for mass vaccination at precisely the point when it mattered most,\" says Alexandra Gillespie, vice-president and principal of U of T Mississauga. \"In the four months since then, the clinic has administered more than 215,000 vaccine doses. \"It's 20 per cent of the total doses administered across the entire Peel region to support the health of our local community that always gives so much to us. A few weeks later, [a second clinic opened on the St. George campus in downtown Toronto](/news/volunteers-step-forward-u-t-hosts-downtown-vaccine-clinic-st-george-campus), where the university worked with University Health Network and Sinai Health to transform an exam centre into a mass vaccination site. \"This is a great example of how we leverage our downtown Toronto location, as well as partnering with [our incredible faculty](/news/superstar-pharmacists-play-critical-role-vaccine-clinic-hosted-u-t-s-st-george-campus), staff and students to deliver vaccines to our community,\" says Ron Saporta, chief operating officer, property services and sustainability.
