Understanding the attitudes of medical students toward CAIM will be useful in understanding future integration of CAIM and allopathic medicine. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate an instrument and assess medical students' attitudes toward CAIM. The Complementary, Alternative and Integrative Medicine Attitudes Questionnaire (CAIMAQ) was developed by a panel of experts in CAIM, allopathic medicine, medical education and survey development. A total of 1770 CAIMAQ surveys (51% of US medical schools participated) were obtained in a national sample of medical students in 2007. Factor analysis of the CAIMAQ revealed five distinct attitudinal domains: desirability of CAIM therapies, progressive patient/physician health care roles, mind-body-spirit connection, principles of allostasis and a holistic understanding of disease.... Complementary Therapies in Medicine 1995 Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) includes herbal medicine, traditional therapies, mind-body intervention etc. As the use of CAM by patients is increasing, ignorance about this by future medical practitioners can cause a communication gap between them and their patients. There is paucity of information regarding the usage and acceptance of CAM by the medical students. To determine the knowledge, attitude and practice of CAM in medical students. A cross sectional, questionnaire based study conducted in 158 medical students of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Among the respondents 74.68 % had used meditation/yoga followed by spirituality (55.69 %), homeopathy (51.26 %), ayurveda (37.97 %). Maximum students (94.29 %) had positive, while 3.79% had negative attitudes towards CAM. The responses for CHBQ (CAM-Health Belief Questionnaire) statements were towards the higher end of the response scale but lower scores were found in reverse scaled statements. The highest mean item score was for 'Knowledge about CAM is important to me as a student/future practicing health professional.' The lowest mean item score was for 'Complementary therapies are a threat to public health'. Students are not ready to accept the therapies which are not tested scientifically. Female students were having significantly stronger positive attitudes toward CAM than their male counterparts. Majority of the respondents use CAM and would like to recommend it to their patients in future. They would prefer scientifically tested alternate medicines. Females were found to have significant stronger positive attitudes toward CAM than their male counterparts. Key words: conventional medicine, CAM, meditation, spirituality Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011 Context: An accelerated approach to popularize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in healthcare services has led to the need to assess medical students' knowledge of CAM. Furthermore, their attitude toward its efficacy and usage will determine its growing popularity in healthcare. Another key idea is to integrate CAM with conventional medical teaching to make it a part of the mainstream medical curriculum. The objectives were to assess the medical students' perceptions about integrating CAM with conventional medicine and to assess the attitude of prescribing different CAM modalities to patients presenting with a particular disease or health disorder. Settings and Design: This is a descriptive, institutional based study conducted on undergraduate 3 rd year medical students. Materials and Methods: Data were collected by a structured and pretested questionnaire to be filled in by the participants in the presence of the investigator. Statistical data were entered in SPSS software, and descriptive analysis was conducted. Results: Most of the students (74%) agreed that conventional and CAM therapy can be integrated to achieve a better health care outcome. Fortyeight percent of the participants were positive that knowledge of CAM is important since many patients still prefer this option, particularly for chronic illnesses. Conclusions: The students were receptive to the introduction of a new treatment method in their curriculum, which although unconventional, presents an alternative and traditional form of treatment even if it does not have major backing from the scientific community. The participants felt that more knowledge is required to make an informed opinion about its usefulness to the community as a whole. ... in Health and ... 2007 PURPOSE: To assess attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and its place in the medical school curriculum and medical practice among preclinical students at Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSOM), Washington, DC. METHOD: Two-hundred sixty-six first-year (n=111) and second-year (n=155) medical students rated their attitudes toward CAM and 15 CAM modalities in terms of personal use, inclusion in the curriculum, and use/utility in clinical practice. RESULTS: Nearly all (91%) students agreed that \"CAM includes ideas and methods from which Western medicine could benefit\"; more than 85% agreed that \"knowledge about CAM is important to me as a student/future practicing health professional\"; and more than 75% felt that CAM should be included in the curriculum. Among all students, the most frequently indicated level of desired training was \"sufficient to advise patients about use,\" for 11 of the 15 modalities. The greatest level of training was wanted for acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplements. The descriptions of CAM in future clinical practice that occurred most frequently were endorsement, referral, or provision of acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, nutritional supplements, prayer, and meditation. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in and enthusiasm about CAM modalities was high in this sample; personal experience was much less prevalent. Students were in favor of CAM training in the curriculum to the extent that they could provide advice to patients; the largest proportions of the sample planned to endorse, refer patients for, or provide 8 of the 15 modalities surveyed in their future practice.
