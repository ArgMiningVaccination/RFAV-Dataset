Taking account of modern medical knowledge and practice, and deeply versed in alchemical, Paracelsian, and naturopathic approaches, as well as homeopathy, aroma therapy, and other \"alternative\" therapies, Steiner demonstrates, on the basis of his own researches, how a truly integrated whole-person medicine is possibleone that understands the human as a being of body, soul, and spirit, a microcosm in the macrocosm, a mirror of the earth and of the heavens. Steiner's enthusiasm and familiarity with his subject are in evidence everywhere in this volume. The wealth of insights and the range of topics are staggeringfrom the meaning of sickness, polarities in the human organism, and the relation of therapy and pathology, to the nature of plant, mineral, and animal in relation to the human being. Specific organs (heart, lungs, bladder, kidney, liver, and nervous system) and specific diseases (including cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, and meningitis) are brought into extraordinary new relationships and interconnections. The whole question of diagnosis, health, and treatment is repeatedly viewed from various points of view. The result is an astounding new vision of medicineone that is practical, spiritual, psychological, and fully human. This is no abstract view of medicine; much of the material arose in direct response to the questions of practicing physicians.
