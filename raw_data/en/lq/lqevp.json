But a medical revolution is under way, showing us how to work with our bodies instead of against them to improve nutrition and ignite the natural fat-burning furnaces that lie dormant within us. Drawing on cutting-edge research about nutrigenomics\u2014the science of how food talks to our genes\u2014Dr. Hyman, author of bestsellers including The Blood Sugar Solution, The Ultra-Mind Solution, UltraPrevention, and The UltraSimple Diet has created a method for losing weight by eating the right foods to detox and manage food allergies. Food contains information and instructions for our bodies: eat the right foods and send instructions of weight loss and health; eat the wrong foods and send messages of weight gain and disease. After spending the last ten years conducting pioneering, hands-on research with over two thousand patients at Canyon Ranch, one of the world's leading health resorts, Dr. Hyman has discovered the seven fundamental causes of obesity. He has integrated his years of research into this groundbreaking approach to help you rebalance and stabilize your metabolism to maintain weight loss and enjoy lifelong health. This isn't a fad diet. Dr. Hyman explains how to customize your personal health and weight-loss program with a streamlined eight-week plan designed to help you lose weight based on your own unique genetic needs. Menus, recipes, and shopping lists, as well as recommendations for vitamins, supplements, and exercise will help you change your lifestyle and be healthy for years to come.
