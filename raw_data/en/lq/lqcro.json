The back is the scaffolding upon which the whole body rides. Because of this role, there is a harmonious correlation between the complex system of the back and the [astral body](https://www.distanceenergywork.com/encyclopedia/astral-body/). Healing back pain can be facilitated energetically. Just as the back is the scaffolding for the body, so the astral body manifests scaffolding for the field of consciousness. We find this in the form of Values - our belief systems, correlations, formulas and collective connections. These values are also related to the function of the back. For instance, the upper back supports the arms and hands which allow us to manipulate our world. So, the shoulders and upper back are the foundation upon which we connect and create in the relative field. We hold the sense of responsibility for our capabilities in the upper back and shoulders. The lower back has a dual purpose. It supports the weight of the torso, and is the point of origin for locomotion. From this position, it is natural to find ancestral connections in the lower back. The ancestors are the foundation upon which the current life rides. Additionally, past family achievements are a point of reference for progress into the future.

This means that it is a perfect place to store or hide discomfort, unprocessed emotions, and challenges which seem overwhelming.

Sometimes there are lessons which need to wait until we are ready to address them. In my practice, I have often found future lessons stored in the back.

When the back hurts, it means that you are ready to take an honest look at yourself. How do we access this hidden information? Attention is the key. Here is a protocol for healing back pain: - Close the eyes, settle the mind. If you can settle to Absolute Silence, this is best. If not, just settle as much as you easily can. - Put attention on the area which hurts. - If you would like to put your hands on the front of the body, across from the sore area this is also helpful.
