So, that meant that choosing the [ best CBD oil for pain](https://www.stltoday.com/brandavestudios/top-5-cbd-oil-for-pain-products-in-2023-its-benefits-for-pain-management-reviewed/article_82380626-97e7-523c-8128-286cdf873299.html) relief involved reading about and trying hundreds of different products. To narrow it down, we looked as these factors: Product descriptions We decided to first rule out CBD products based on their product descriptions and labels. We disqualified any oils if they were not lab-tested, and if the company did not include a detailed list of ingredients on the label and their website. Customer reviews Our next step was to read reviews. We looked specifically for reviews written by customers who mentioned acute or chronic pain. These customers tended to prefer certain CBD oil brands to others, and so we took a closer look at [those companies](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/03/13/best-cbd-brands-of-2023-7-companies-you-can-actually-trust/). What did customers say about the flavors? Did they get any other benefits from the CBD oil, such as stress relief or sleep support? Firsthand testing Our final step was to test the front-runners ourselves. For this step, we relied on a team of testers, all of whom had their own experiences with pain. Based on their experiences and reports, we were able to see how well each of these CBD products helped manage pain from arthritis, backaches, headaches, and more. We also gained some insights into which CBD products were the strongest, the most flavorful, and the fastest-acting. After compiling our testers' data, we were able to choose seven of the most reputable CBD brands to feature in this article. What Is CBD Oil? CBD itself is a substance made by the hemp plant. It can be removed from the hemp plant via various extraction methods. Over the years, CBD has been reported to have a number of health benefits. It can help manage anxiety and depression, relieve pain, and reduce inflammation. CBD oil is essentially an emulsion of CBD plus a carrier oil. The carrier oil is used to dilute the CBD to the desired strength. CBD companies often use MCT oil or coconut oil as a carrier oil, but you'll also see CBD products made with olive oil or hemp seed oil. CBD oil is usually taken orally. However, some formulas can also be applied topically. Benefits of CBD for Pain Management Why would someone use CBD for pain relief instead of relying on another remedy or medication? Here are some key benefits of CBD as a pain reliever: Naturally Substance Some people, after experiencing side effects from various pain relief medications, do not want to rely on other substances that have been artificially produced in a lab. CBD is not a lab-made chemical. It comes from natural hemp. Humans have been ingesting and using various hemp products for centuries. Widely Available You do not need a prescription to purchase and use CBD oils. You don't even have to visit a specialty store (although there are lots of great specialty CBD stores out there). You can find CBD oils online, at health food stores, and even at some grocery stores. Eases Stress and Insomnia Pain and stress often go hand-in-hand. Stress can make pain seem worse, and being in pain can stress you out. Pain can also make it difficult to sleep, and yet you may notice your pain more when your sleep quality is suffering. CBD not only addresses pain directly, but can also help reduce stress and promote better sleep. This holistic, multi-benefit approach makes it a balanced and effective choice for chronic pain management. Adjustable dosages You can modify your dose of CBD oil according to your needs at any particular time. If your joint pain is worse one day, you can take an extra dose of CBD. If you know you're about to be physically active, you can take some more as a preventative measure. This leads to better pain relief, and it also helps you feel more in-control of the way you're managing pain. How CBD Oil Works to Manage Pain The best way to use [CBD oil for pain](https://www.houstoniamag.com/sponsored/2022/06/best-cbd-oil-for-pain-2022-7-brands-for-comfort-relief-relaxtion) is usually sublingually. The word \"sublingual\" means \"under your tongue.\" Use a dropper or needleless syringe to squirt the CBD oil under your tongue. Let it sit there for about 30 seconds before swallowing. You can also take CBD by swallowing it right away. Either squirt it onto your tongue and swallow it immediately, or add it to your food or beverage. To get the best results from CBD oil for pain, take it every day. Some people even take it twice a day - morning and evening. You do not need to take CBD oil with a snack or drink. However, some people do find that it upsets their stomach to take CBD oil on its own. If this happens to you, try eating a small snack, like some cheese or a handful of nuts, before taking your CBD oil. How Long Does it Take for CBD Oil to Work? If you take CBD oil sublingually, you'll generally start feeling its effects in around 15 minutes. If you swallow it right away without letting it sit under your tongue, it will take closer to an hour to start working. Its stress-relieving benefits tend to appear shortly before the pain relief. Side Effects of CBD While most people do not develop side effects from CBD oils, some people do have mild reactions. These can include dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, and changes in appetite. Here are a few ways to reduce your risk of side effects if using CBD oil for pain: - Use the smallest effective dose - Take CBD oil with a small snack - Sip water to prevent or ease dry mouth - If full spectrum CBD oil makes you tired, try a broad spectrum CBD oil Your risk of side effects may be higher if you take CBD products with certain medications, such as antidepressants or anti-seizure medications. So, talk to your doctor before adding CBD oil to your routine if you're already using other medications, remedies, or herbal treatments for chronic pain. FAQs Will CBD make you high? No, taking CBD oil for pain will not cause you to feel high. It does have some effects on the mind. Namely, it can cause you to feel less anxious and more relaxed. However, CBD products are not intoxicating in the way that THC is intoxicating. You should be able to function, think clearly, and go about your day when using CBD. Can CBD help with rheumatoid arthritis symptoms? Yes, CBD products can be good remedies for rheumatoid arthritis. They're not a cure, but [studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7463000/) that they have anti-inflammatory properties and can relieve pain associated with this condition. If you are currently taking prescription medications for your rheumatoid arthritis, do not stop taking them without first checking with your doctor. Ask your doctor if it is safe to take CBD oils for pain in conjunction with your current medications. How much CBD should you take for pain? Everyone's body reacts to CBD differently. Even with the best CBD oils, your dose will depend on your weight, how well you absorb CBD, and the level of pain you are seeking to manage. Most CBD oils for pain have dosing instructions right on the bottle. This are a good starting point as you work on discovering your own ideal dose. It's common for people to start by taking about 10 to 20 mg of CBD per day. See how your body reacts and, if you are still in pain after a few days, increase your dose by another 5 mg. Keep increasing your dose a few milligrams at a time until your pain is under control. What is CBD isolate? CBD isolate is only CBD. Full spectrum CBD oils and broad spectrum CBD oils, which both contain terpenes and minor cannabinoids found in the hemp plant. Meanwhile, CBD isolate is pure CBD oil. The good news is that CBD isolate does have pain-relieving benefits. However, if you take an oil made with pure CBD, you may be missing out on additional benefits you could be getting from the terpenes and other hemp compounds. That's why many people believe full spectrum CBD oil and broad spectrum CBD oil are often better choices for pain relief. You may, however, want to take a CBD isolate product if you find full spectrum and broad spectrum products to be too strong or make you sleepy. Or if you're simply looking to avoid THC, you can be sure to do that by using a CBD isolate oil. Is CBD addictive? No, CBD is not known to have addictive properties. Its potential for addiction [has been studied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5361620/), and researchers found that it performed similarly to a placebo in terms of common markers for addiction. This is one advantage that CBD has over some other pain relievers. You can take it every day or as needed without the worry of dependence. If you miss a dose or decide to stop taking CBD, you should not experience any withdrawal symptoms, cravings, or other worrisome effects. Conclusion CBD oil is a non-addictive, non-intoxicating, all-natural substance that can provide pain relief and relaxation. Whether you struggle from frequent headaches, ongoing back issues, or joint pain due to arthritis, we suggest trying CBD oil for pain relief. There is a great variety of broad spectrum and full spectrum CBD oil formulas that can help with chronic pain. Above all else, we recommend looking for a brand that is lab-tested and made with clean, US-sourced ingredients. We're confident that we've found the very best CBD oils for every type of pain you may be dealing with. Summary of the Best CBD Oils for Pain 1.
