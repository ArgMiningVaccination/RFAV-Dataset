The structure of the WWAMI regional referral system puts us in the best position of any regional medical center to accomplish that goal.\" - Scott C. Manning, MD, is chief of the Division of Otolaryngology at Seattle Childrens Hospital and professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. He is a former president of the Northwest Academy of Otolaryngology and the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology. Dr. Manning earned his MD from Tulane Medical School, completed his residency at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and did a fellowship in pediatric otolaryngology in Pittsburgh. He served as chief of pediatric otolaryngology at Parkland Hospital and Dallas Childrens Hospital. His clinical interests are pediatric sinusitis, chronic ear disease and vascular anomalies. Dr. Manning devotes a large part of his practice to the growing problem of childhood thyroid tumors. He performs diagnostic fine needle biopsies of thyroid masses under local anesthesia in clinic and does thyroid surgery when indicated. He participates in both the Sinus and Vascular Anomaly specialty clinics and practices both at the Bellevue and Sand Point campuses. - - When my 4 year old son broke his nose we didn't have a specialist our small peninsula to fix his nose. After seeing several doctors we ended up making the 3 hour drive to see Dr. Manning at Children's Hospital. As soon as I met Dr. Manning I knew I made the right choice and my son was in the absolute best care. His confidence in repairing my son's nose was comforting, and has wonderful bedside manner. The day of my son's procedure we were nervous naturally. Dr. Manning came in to go over the procedure and he eased our worries, he and his team took excellent care of my son. I am very thankful to have crossed paths with Dr.Manning and I appreciate the great care he gave my son. Thank you very much. - When I lived in Washington state my 30 year old daughter and my 24 year old son scene Doctor Manny he had my son for 18 years you took great care of them my son had reflux but I had no idea what it was so when I seen then I can have them transferred up to Seattle doctor man and taught me a lot I would so highly recommend him for ears nose and throat and upper respiratory anyting very compassion my family just loved him - I recommend Dr. Manning because he did my ultrasound on my thyroid and he figured out my thyroid problem. - In 1988 Dr. Manning and a colleague ran past my wife and I as we stood outside the Children's Hospital ER room where our son was lying. He had stopped breathing, and not for the first time that night. At the time they thought it was for longer than 4 minutes, and they apparently called for Dr. Manning to rush down from wherever he was working at Parkland that night. Dr. Manning successfully intubated our son, and he was moved to the pediatric trauma center at Parkland Hospital. We were told it was Dr. Manning's last shift before moving on to the next stage of his career. My son will begin his residency at Johns Hopkins next year. - Dr. Manning is one of the most kindest doctors I have ever met for my daughter, Evelyn who has special needs. He performed my daughter's surgery in removing her tonsils and adenoids. He did a great job with her surgery because she healed up really well. He was terrific in checking up on my daughter when she had to stay overnight in the hospital. And he was really great on explaining a lot of things I needed to know about taking care of Evelyn as she needed to heal from surgery. I can assure you that your child is in great hands with Dr. Manning. And I would strongly recommend any child to go see Dr. Manning because he will definitely take good care of your child. - Dear Dr. Manning, Everything does happen for a reason. While I would never wish or dream what happened to Travis, our family, last summer, could ever happen it did. We were ripped from our normal quiet little lives into a hailstorm of emergency medicine that we didnt even know existed. Now that all the dust has settled, and in our opinion it has because of what you were able to tell us today.we have a bit more time to marvel at what has happened. We want you to know how incredibly grateful that we are that YOU made the choice you made, how many years ago, to pursue what is obviously your God given talent and passion. The way you respond to our questions, and treat us more like old friends than just a frequent flier patient with curious parents, means a tremendous amount to us. Thank you Dr. Manning for making the choices that you make and being Travis surgeon. You will always be a significant part of our journey in getting Travis back to being whole. You have our deepest gratitude and respect as a physician and a friend. Sincerely, Ken and Kim Anderson - Dr.Manning just happened to be at the hospital on the day we brought our then 5 month old baby to the emergency room at Children's Hospital. He had a growth in his right cheek that was growing rapidly. We were so lucky that Dr.Manning was there and within a few seconds had a diagnosis. Cavernous Hemangioma. We saw him and his team for about 4 months before the tumor was large enough that he recommended trying a medication called Propanolol. It was extremely effective and we could hardly see the tumor after just a week. Our son is now 3 years old and that year of time we spent at Children's making visits is a distant memory! It was life changing. I cannot say enough about Dr.Manning and his team. - Dr. Manning came out of surgery today after working on my 11 year old son and he had a big smile on his face. He said he was most excited about doing something that will make him feel immediately better and also doing something so interesting. As a mom, it made me feel great that he really cared about making my boy's life better and enjoyed the process. I am so grateful for multiple years of care by Dr. Manning. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Distinguished Service Award - American Academy Otolaryngology Head American Academy Otolaryngology Head Jan 1, 2009 Vice President Elect, Western Section Triological Society - Other Publications - Shinn JR | Purcell PL | Horn DL | Sie KC | Manning SCFirst branchial cleft anomalies: otologic manifestations and treatment outcomes.
