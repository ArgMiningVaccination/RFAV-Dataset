Book preview Evidence of Harm - David Kirby Introduction July 9, 2004 DOES MERCURY in vaccines cause autism in children? A definitive answer has proven elusive, and it remains so to this day. No one can say with certainty that thimerosal, the vaccine preservative made with 49.6 percent mercury, helped fuel an explosion in reported cases of autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), speech delay, and other disorders over the past decade. But no one can say for certain that it did not. On May 18, 2004, the respected Institute of Medicine issued a much heralded report stating that the bulk of evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal and autism.\u00b9 The independent panel, commissioned by the government to investigate alleged links between vaccines and autism, delivered a harsh blow to advocates of the thimerosalautism hypothesis. But despite its authoritative certainty, the report failed to close the books on this simmering medical controversy. Indeed, recently published animal and test tube studies provide compelling biological evidence of harm (though certainly not proof ) from thimerosal-containing vaccines. Exactly five years ago, the federal government disclosed in a Joint Statement that some American children were being exposed to levels of mercury in vaccines above one of the federal safety limits. Since then, officials have moved to phase out mercury from childhood vaccines, and to determine if thimerosal exposure in infants could cause autism and other neurological developmental disorders. To date, neither goal has been fully attained. Thimerosal has been removed from most routine vaccinations given to American children. But it is still found in the majority of flu shots, which the U.S. government now recommends for pregnant women and children between six months and twenty-three months of age.\u00b2 In 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declined to state a preference for mercury-free flu shots in infants.\u00b3 Mercury is also found in some tetanus, diphtheria-tetanus, pertusis, and meningitis vaccines, which are sometimes, though not routinely, given to children. It is also used in many over-the-counter products, including nasal sprays, ear and eye drops, and even a hemorrhoid treatment. Meanwhile, the CDC has been unable to definitively prove or disprove the theory that thimerosal causes autism, ADD, speech delays, or other disorders. Several studies funded or conducted by the agency have been published in the past year, all of them suggesting that there is no connection between the preservative and the disease. The CDC insists that it has looked into the matter thoroughly and found no evidence of harm from thimerosal in vaccines. But no evidence of harm is not the same as proof of safety. No evidence of harm is not a definitive answer; and this is a story that cries out for answers. Many have asked why a trusted health agency would allow a known neurotoxin to be injected into the bodies of small babies\u2014in amounts that exceed federal safety exposure levels for adults by up to fifty times per shot? It's a disturbing question, and there are no satisfying answers. But a small group of parents, aided by a handful of scientists, physicians, politicians, and legal activists, has spent the past five years searching for answers. Despite heavy resistance from the powerful public health lobby, these parents never abandoned their ambition to prove that mercury in vaccines is what pushed their children, most of them boys, into a hellish, lost world of autism. Of course, there are two sides to every good story, and this one is no exception. For every shred of evidence the parents and other researchers have unearthed linking thimerosal to autism, public health authorities have produced forceful data to the contrary. The parents and their allies accuse public health officials and the pharmaceutical industry of negligence and incompetence, at best, and malfeasance and collusion at worst. On the other hand, the mercury-autism proponents have been greeted with contempt and counterattack by many in the American health establishment, which understandably has an interest in proving the unpleasant theory wrong. Each side accuses the other of being irrational, overzealous, blind to evidence they find inconvenient, and subject to professional, financial, or emotional conflicts of interest that cloud their judgment. In some ways, both sides are right. Some children with autism were never exposed to thimerosal, and the vast majority of people who received mercury in vaccines show no evidence of harm whatsoever. But if thimerosal is not responsible for the apparent autism epidemic in the United States, then it is incumbent upon public health officials to mount a full-scale quest to identify the actual cause. At the very least, the thimerosal debate has compelled the scientific community, however reluctantly, to consider an environmental component to the disorder, rather than looking for a purely genetic explanation. Autism, by most accounts, is epidemic. And there is no such thing as a genetic epidemic. Something in our modern world is apparently pushing a certain number of susceptible kids over the neurological limit and into a befuddling life of autism and other brain disorders. Several potential culprits beside thimerosal have been mentioned, though there is no hard evidence to link any of them to autism. Possible environmental triggers include: mercury in fish, pesticides, PCBs, flame retardants, jet fuel, live viruses in vaccines or some as-yet unidentified virus, and even rampant cell phone use. It is plausible that any combination of the above, with or without thimerosal exposure added into the mix, might cause harm to some fetuses and infant children. But so far, thimerosal exposure has received the most studies (though the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or MMR, has also been studied). This book looks at evidence presented on both sides of the thimerosal controversy, but told from the parents' admittedly subjective point of view. Perhaps this story will be told one day from the opposing view, that of the doctors, bureaucrats, and drug company reps who claim nothing more than the laudable desire to save kids from the ravages of childhood disease. But many of the public health officials who discount the thimerosal theory were unwilling to be interviewed for this book (or prohibited from speaking by superiors). Readers are invited to reach their own conclusions on the evidence. Did the injection of organic mercury directly into the developing systems of small children cause irreparable harm? It's a plausible proposition, and a hugely important question. If the answer is affirmative, someone will have to pay to pick up the pieces. Why did the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allow mercury exposures from childhood vaccines to more than double between 1988 and 1992 without bothering to calculate cumulative totals and their potential risks? Why, for that matter, was there a corresponding spike in reported cases of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)? Why did autism grow from a relatively rare incidence of 1 in every 10,000 births in the 1980s to 1 in 500 in the late 1990s? Why did it continue to increase to 1 in 250 in 2000 and then 1 in 166 today? Why are rates of ADD, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speech delay, and other childhood disorders also rising, and why does 1 in every 6 American children have a developmental disorder or behavioral problem? And why does autism affect boys at a 4-to-1 ratio over girls? Autism has traditionally been a disease of industrialized nations, at least until recent years. But not all Western countries have autism epidemics. Autism spectrum disorder in the United States, with 60 per 10,000 (1 in 166) kids now affected, is much more prevalent than it is in northern European countries such as Denmark, which removed thimerosal from vaccines in 1992 and now reports just 7.7 per 10,000 children (or 1 in 1,300). The UK, meanwhile, which just announced that it would remove mercury from vaccines in September 2004, reports exactly the same prevalence of ASD\u20141 in 166 children\u2014as the United States. This is not an antivaccine book. Childhood immunization was perhaps one of the greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century, and vaccines will continue to play a crucial role in our lives as we enter an uncertain age of emerging diseases and potential bioterrorism. Some parents, fearing harmful effects, have been tempted not to vaccinate their children. Most people would agree that this is foolhardy and dangerous. Few of us are old enough to remember the great epidemics of influenza, pertussis, smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and measles that once swept entire populations\u2014until the advent of vaccines reduced those maladies to abstract, unthreatening concepts, at least in America. These diseases, all of them preventable, can kill children. When vaccination rates fall, disease rates rise. Neither should this book be viewed as partisan in nature. While some named in this book raise harsh criticisms of the Bush administration or Republicans in the Senate, two of the leading protagonists\u2014from these parents' point of view\u2014are among the most conservative members of Congress. Moreover, it is important to remember that much of the story takes place during the administration of President Bill Clinton. Parental fear of vaccines has threatened the viability of the U.S. National Immunization Program. But if scientists prove that mercury in vaccines was at least partly to blame for much of the autism epidemic\u2014and that the culprit has been largely (or one day entirely) removed\u2014then confidence in childhood immunization should return to comfortable levels. But most health officials insist that mercury in vaccines is harmless, even as warnings go off about the toxic effects on infants and fetuses from mercury in fish. This mixed message is doing nothing to bolster faith in the immunization program. Most vaccines come in multidose vials and cannot be sold without a preservative, such as thimerosal. Because of its mercury content, thimerosal prevents bacterial and fungal contamination in vials that undergo repeated puncturing of the seal by needles. Thimerosal is not required for single-dose vials, nor is it found in vaccine preparations, including MMR, that contain live organisms. Thimerosal was marketed for vaccines in the 1930s and remained the preservative of choice in the United States throughout the twentieth century. Mercury-free preservatives were developed, but never widely used. The main reason is thought to be economic. Developing alternative preservatives and having them tested and approved by the FDA is a costly proposition. Switching to single-dose vials, another option, is feasible, but it is also expensive and more cumbersome for transportation and storage. Finally, thimerosal is often used in vaccine manufacturing itself, to preserve sterility in the production process. Since it was already in vaccines, it didn't make much sense to seek out an alternative. And at any rate, the FDA and CDC never said that thimerosal might be hazardous. Curiously, the first case of autism was not recorded until the early 1940s, a few years after thimerosal was introduced in vaccines. It was described by psychiatrists Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, who independently coined the terms autism and autistic respectively. The term comes from the Greek word for self, autos. In the late 1940s, Austrian-born psychologist Bruno Bettelheim proposed that autistic children came from backgrounds of aloof mothering by women who could not or would not provide the warmth and emotional support needed for the normal development of a child. He labeled these women refrigerator mothers, a term that stuck until the 1960s. In 1964, Bernard Rimland, a psychologist and father of an autistic son, wrote a groundbreaking book called Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior. The book is widely credited with debunking the refrigerator mother theory, which today seems both laughable and insulting to many parents. The book helped convince the psychiatric community that autism was not an emotional problem at all, but rather a biological one. In the 1980s, suspicions began to surface among some parents of autistic children that vaccines were somehow involved in the disorder. In 1985, Barbara Loe Fisher, cofounder of the National Vaccine Information Center, coauthored a book (with H. L. Coulter) called A Shot in the Dark. In the course of her research she found many children who developed brain damage after a reaction to the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) shot. Vaccines continued to remain on autism's radar screen, and were raised to new notoriety when a young English doctor named Andrew Wakefield said that the MMR live-virus vaccine (which does not contain thimerosal) might be contributing to regressive autism in children. Then in July 1999 came the U.S. government announcement\u2014the Joint Statement\u2014about mercury levels in childhood vaccines. Now the stakes could not be higher. Perhaps billions of dollars in legal claims are pending against drug companies involved in vaccine production. The deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry has extended its financial largesse to politicians and scientists around the country, in open pursuit of indemnity against lawsuits and, some charge, in a darker effort to suppress evidence of thimerosal's toxicity. Meanwhile, the reputation of American public health is on the line. The jury is still out on thimerosal, but deliberations are well under way. One side will emerge vindicated, and the other will earn eternal scorn in the medical history books. In November 2003, the father of an autistic boy in North Carolina, an antithimerosal activist and a believer, approached a well-known pediatrician after the doctor had delivered a lecture on the safety of vaccines in general, and thimerosal in particular. You know something, Doctor? the father said. \"If it turns out that you are right, then I will personally come down to your office and apologize to you with every fiber of my being. But if it turns out that you are wrong, he added, then you are going to hell. Prologue LYN REDWOOD got the call from a lawyer friend only an hour before the vote. The prospects were bad, he told her. It was too late to do much about it now. The news came like a kick in the gut. Lyn almost dropped the phone into a pot of pasta on the stove. Damn! she shouted. Her cry was loud enough to startle her eight-year-old, Will, who sat quietly at the kitchen table in the Redwoods' expansive house south of Atlanta. The boy nearly burst into tears. It was the evening of November 13, 2002, and the House of Representatives was about to approve the historic Homeland Security Act. Lyn was all for security in this age of Al Qaeda. But she never dreamed it would come with such a price tag. The lawyer told Lyn that some unnamed agent had secretly inserted a last-minute provision into the bill, adding two brief paragraphs onto the massive document before the roll call. The provision would dismiss hundreds of civil suits filed by parents against Eli Lilly and other drug companies for allegedly allowing dangerous levels of mercury into their kids' vaccines. Very few members of Congress knew it was there. The stealth rider would change everything, wiping out years of struggle that Lyn and many others had endured to get their day in court. Will Redwood had autism, and Lyn blamed it on the mercury in his shots. The toxic heavy metal was used as a vaccine preservative called thimerosal. Thimerosal had been developed by Eli Lilly & Company in the 1920s, though Lilly no longer made the product. But the company still licensed it to other producers, reportedly earning a profit in the bargain. Lyn and her husband, Tommy, had filed a thimerosal lawsuit in Georgia state civil court. The Redwoods and other parents had spent three years compiling evidence of mercury poisoning in their children. Many were preparing to present this evidence in individual and class-action lawsuits filed in courts of law across the country. But now, with the stroke of a computer keyboard, all those lawsuits would be thrown out. The Redwoods and others would be left in the legal lurch, without due process or any further recourse. Now there would be no day in court. The surreptitious rider essentially funneled all thimerosal lawsuits into a little-known federal claims court that had been created by Congress in 1986 to compensate damages for vaccine injuries or death. The Vaccine Court, as it is known, shields drugmakers from liability by having awards paid out of a taxpayer-funded account, rather than by the companies themselves. But there was one hitch. The Vaccine Court had a statute of limitations of three years. If your child had been injured by a vaccine before that period, as was the case with Will Redwood and tens of thousands of other autistic children, you were plain out of luck. You could not enter the federal compensation program. For this reason, the Redwoods had brought their claim to civil court. Here, the burden of proof was higher, but so were the potential payouts. Parents of autistic children were facing lifelong bills estimated at over two million dollars per child. The families were neither greedy nor litigious, as some politicians had charged. They were desperate. And now the only door left open\u2014civil court\u2014was being slammed shut, perversely, by an antiterrorism bill. The irony was punishing. Congress was approving a colossal reorganization of the bureaucracy to fortify the nation in the perilous post-9/11 world. It was all being done in the name of liberty, as President Bush had said. But what liberty was there, Lyn thought, when greedy hands blithely rewrote laws and slapped justice in the face? The language in the rider dismissing the lawsuits was nothing new. It had been drafted the year before\u2014written as part of a larger vaccine injury bill crafted by a senator from Tennessee named Bill Frist, a conservative Republican with strong ties to the drug industry, and the only M.D. to serve in the upper chamber. Lyn Redwood and many other parents had fought ferociously all summer against the Frist vaccine bill. Their Democratic allies, who controlled the Senate at the time, had prevailed. It was one more battle in the ongoing thimerosal war, but at least the parents had won this round. Or so they thought. But Republicans had just swept the midterm elections on November 5, 2002, and recaptured control of the Senate. Someone in the party, it is safe to assume, was feeling cocky and confident enough to pull this off. But they hadn't reckoned with the wave of outrage they were about to unleash. Lyn Redwood ran to the computer in her large comfortable home and fired off an urgent communiqu\u00e9 to several comrades across the country: good friends like Liz Birt, an attorney from Chicago with an autistic son, Matthew; and Sallie Bernard, a successful marketing executive out in Aspen, Colorado, with an afflicted boy of her own, named Bill. For three years, since the government had admitted that most American kids vaccinated between 1990 and 2000 were exposed to mercury levels in excess of federal safety limits, Lyn, Liz, and Sallie had been drawn to each other in common cause. They grew united in the belief that thimerosal had damaged their kids and hurled them into the shuttered hell of autism. They had formed an influential advocacy and research group called the Coalition for Safe Minds (Sensible Action for Ending Mercury-Induced Neurological Disorders). Largely self-taught in the complexities of biochemistry, toxicology, and epidemiology, the three mothers and dozens of their allies had taken on science, business, and government with their radical new mercury-autism hypothesis. Many parents of autistic children applauded the women and bestowed on them an affectionate nickname, the Mercury Moms. But on the other side of the equation, within the inner circles of their powerful opponents, the women had earned themselves ridicule and scorn. Well, it looks like they caught us unaware, Lyn wrote to Liz, Sallie, and a handful of other parents that evening. I just received a phone call that parts of the Frist bill dealing with thimerosal are being added to the Homeland Security Bill that is being voted on tonight! Please, if possible, try to contact your local representative by e-mail and ask that they specifically exclude anything related to the vaccine compensation bill being included in Homeland Security. Everyone who got the message tried desperately to do something to alert lawmakers. But it was too late, of course. Even some of the parents' staunchest allies were about to vote away their rights, however unwittingly, in the name of freedom. One of the people most devastated by the news was Laura Bono, the mother of a twelve-year-old boy, Jackson, who had been diagnosed not only with severe autism, but also with mercury poisoning. Laura and her husband, Scott, an insurance salesman in Durham, North Carolina, were about to file a civil suit of their own. It had been several years since Jackson's diagnosis, and they were ineligible to file in Vaccine Court. Jackson's medical and educational care had already cost over seven hundred thousand dollars, and much of it was not covered by insurance. The Bonos had depleted their savings simply struggling to provide for their very sick boy. Scott and Laura Bono had fought side by side with other parents against the Frist bill, and were ardent believers in the mercury-autism connection. And the Bonos had connections in Washington. Scott had known since high school a bright, conservative young woman named Beth Clay. In recent years, Beth had gone to work on the Republican staff of the House Committee on Government Reform. By chance, the committee's colorful chairman was the controversial Republican congressman Dan Burton of Indiana\u2014a man with his own suspicions of thimerosal. Burton, it turned out, has a grandson named Christian, who had become desperately ill after receiving multiple vaccinations against nine different childhood diseases in one day. Most of them contained thimerosal. Within days, Christian became completely unaware of his surroundings. He would run aimlessly around the house, screaming indiscriminately, flapping his arms and banging his head against the walls. Doctors diagnosed autism. Dan Burton blamed thimerosal. When Laura Bono got Lyn Redwood's e-mail, she called Beth Clay on her cell phone. Beth, they've stuck a rider in to protect Lilly from lawsuits, Laura said. You have to alert Burton. Beth leapt to action. She knew that the congressman, had he known about the Lilly rider, would have gone ballistic and scrambled to the House floor to raise hellfire among his colleagues. But Beth was unable to reach Burton before he cast his lot to protect the homeland. The next day, Dan Burton was fuming. There was only one person in Washington, he thought, who wielded the power, and had the gall, to commit such an act. It was the Republican Majority Leader, Richard Armey, who was set to resign at the end of the year. Burton and a few staffers marched over to Armey's office and confronted the politically powerful Texan with the slow, folksy drawl. I'm told the two of them almost got in a fistfight, Beth told Scott Bono later that day. I have never seen the chairman so angry in my life. And believe me, I have seen him pretty damned steamed before. But nothing like this. If only I had gotten to him, maybe we could have stopped this. But what did he say? Scott asked anxiously. Armey, I mean. What did he say about the Lilly rider? Armey did it, Beth said. He said the request came from the White House. It would be weeks, however, before Dick Armey would admit\u2014and then deny\u2014the legislative mischief. In the meantime, the mystery over who had inserted the controversial provisions (three other unrelated riders were also clandestinely stapled to the bill) had become, as the New York Times put it, A Washington whodunit worthy of Agatha Christie. On Capitol Hill, Congressional aides-turned-detectives have traced the emergence of the provision to the Veterans Day weekend, wrote the Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg. Flush from their party's victories on Election Day, and with a mandate from President Bush to pass a domestic security bill, Republican negotiators in the House and Senate holed up for three days in the Capitol to hammer out the details. One aide told the paper that the language mysteriously appeared in the House version of the bill in entirely different type than the rest of the measure, as though someone had clipped it out of Mr. Frist's legislation and simply pasted it in. All the negotiators apparently supported the move, but no one would say who was responsible. Critics of the provision, the Times noted, were quick to point out that the White House has close ties to Lilly. The first President Bush sat on the Lilly board in the late 1970's. The White House budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., is a former Lilly executive. The company's chairman and chief executive, Sidney Taurel, was appointed in June by President Bush to serve on a presidential council that will advise Mr. Bush on domestic security. The White House denied having any hand in the rider. So did Eli Lilly. 'I personally had no involvement whatsoever with these provisions,' Mitch Daniels protested. 'I spoke to no one, either inside the administration or outside the administration. I did not have any communications with anyone from Eli Lilly regarding the issue. Indeed, I had not even heard of thimerosal until [now], which is not surprising because Eli Lilly stopped making thimerosal a decade before I began working there.'\u00b9 To many observers, what seemed surprising was that Daniels, who had been Lilly's senior vice president for corporate strategy, had not known about a product that was licensed by his own company. Lilly executives also feigned ignorance. 'We made absolutely no contact with Mitch or anyone in his office about this,' company spokesman Rob Smith said at the time. 'It's a mystery to us how it got in there.'\u00b9\u00b9 On November 18, Dan Burton went to the House floor and demanded that the rider be removed before the Senate voted on the act. These provisions don't belong in this bill, he said. This is not a homeland security issue. This is a fairness issue. We have an epidemic on our hands, Burton warned in a statement released the same day. More and more parents believe that the autism affecting their children is related to a mercury preservative used in numerous vaccines given to their children. These provisions in the Homeland Security Bill will cut off their recourse to the courts, and that's just wrong. Instead of passing legislation to take away the rights of families with vaccine-injured children, we should be passing legislation to try to help them.\u00b9\u00b2 Senate Democrats agreed, and offered a motion to kill the Lilly rider before voting on the legislation. The move was opposed by none other than Senator Bill Frist. We are a nation at risk, Frist intoned gravely in the Senate. The threat of liability should not become a barrier to the protection of the American people. \u00b9\u00b3 The implication was that thimerosal liability protection was essential if companies were going to develop vaccines against bioterrorism weapons like smallpox and anthrax. But Frist failed to mention that these vaccines contain no thimerosal whatsoever. Lyn Redwood's phone was ringing off the hook. Good Morning America wanted to talk to her, and so did Bob Herbert, columnist for the New York Times.\u00b9 Herbert went on the offensive against the Lilly rider. Buried in this massive bill, he wrote, snuck into it in the dark of night by persons unknown (actually, it's fair to say by Republican persons unknown), was a provision that\u2014incredibly\u2014will protect Eli Lilly and a few other big pharmaceutical outfits from lawsuits by parents who believe their children were harmed by thimerosal ... . There's a real bad smell here. Eli Lilly will benefit greatly as both class-action and individual lawsuits are derailed. But there are no fingerprints in sight. No one will own up to a legislative deed that is both cynical and shameful. The politicians with their hands out and the fat cats with plenty of green to spread around have carried the day. Nothing is too serious to exploit, not even the defense of the homeland during a time of terror. As for Lyn Redwood and the Safe Minds advocacy group, Herbert wrote, They're at a slight disadvantage, wielding a popgun against the nuclear-powered influence of an Eli Lilly. The effort to kill the rider failed, despite intense lobbying by parents and their allies on Capitol Hill. The next day, the Senate passed the House version of the bill in its entirety. The same day, Bush administration lawyers quietly filed a motion in the federal Vaccine Court to permanently seal the records on all thimerosal-related material handed over by the government. But the furtive move was also a blessing in disguise, Lyn thought. So many people had dismissed the mercury-autism theory as pure nonsense. Despite all their efforts to connect the scientific dots between thimerosal and neurological disorders, the parents had been unable to gain much attention, let alone support. Now that was changing. If government and industry had nothing to fear from thimerosal lawsuits, many observers were asking, what was the need for all this secret maneuvering and rush to liability protection? 1. Mothers on a Mission LYN REDWOOD KNEW she was pregnant at the first sip of white Zinfandel. In her previous two pregnancies, the taste of alcohol had taken on an unpalatable, almost metallic quality, and now, here it was again. Lyn gagged and set down the frosty wineglass. Her husband, Tommy, looked at her with a slight note of alarm. But Lyn just closed her eyes and waited for the nausea to subside. Then she stood up and smiled. I'm fine, she said quietly to Tommy. Everything is just fine. It was Memorial Day Weekend, 1993, and the couple had driven from their home outside Atlanta across the steamy deep South to the hamlet of Columbus, Mississippi, for a visit to Tommy's parents. On the five-hour ride home, Lyn could think of nothing but the taste of that wine. She was excited, but wanted to make sure before saying anything to Tommy. Lyn smiled at the prospect of a new child. She knew that Tommy adored her children, Drew and Hanna, from her previous marriage. But she also knew that it must be difficult at times to raise someone else's kids. When they got home, Lyn ran upstairs to the master bathroom where she kept some pregnancy tests. The Zinfandel had not deceived her. She really was pregnant. Lyn went downstairs to tell Tommy the news. He was overjoyed. Now he would have a child who would call him Dad instead of Tommy. The new baby would complete the happy picture. Lyn was an attractive woman with cocoa-colored hair and soft, almost catlike brown eyes. She met Tommy in 1986, in Birmingham, Alabama, where she was completing her MS in nursing and he was a young med student from the University of Mississippi with a handsome smile, dark hair, and an athletic physique. The two were married in 1987, and Tommy wholeheartedly accepted Lyn's children, Hanna and Drew, as his own. In 1991, the young family moved to Atlanta, where Lyn began work as a family nurse practitioner, and Tommy got a job in the ER at Newnan Hospital, outside Atlanta. The past six years had been almost dreamlike for the Redwoods. They had recently put the finishing touches on a three-story, wood and stone contemporary home on nine acres of hardwood forest in tiny Tyrone, Georgia, thirty minutes south of Atlanta. A rural small town, Tyrone looks a lot like Mayberry from the Andy Griffith Show (except for the Confederate symbol on the old Georgia state flag that still flutters above the American Legion hall). The kids had never been happier. Hanna and Drew were excelling in the gifted program of the local school, where Drew entered kindergarten at the third-grade reading level. Life was sweet in the new house, with its free-form pool and flat stone terraces, its hiking trails through Georgia pines and open pastures, and the covered wooden bridge that Lyn and Tommy built over Trickum Creek, which meanders lazily across their land. Lyn's third pregnancy was perfectly normal, by all measurements. The only thing to set it apart from the first two was that Lyn, whose blood type is RH-NEGATIVE, was given two injections of Gamalin brand Anti-Rho(D) globulin, at fourteen weeks and twenty-eight weeks of gestation. About 15 percent of all women have an RH-negative blood type and, if the fetus is RH-positive, as was the case with Will, the mother could produce antibodies against the child's blood type. This in turn could create potentially deadly complications in subsequent pregnancies. Anti-Rho(D) globulin staves off that disaster. (Lyn received a third injection immediately after Will was born, in case there had been any undetected mix of blood during delivery.) In Lyn's third trimester, she was told the pregnancy was breech. When she entered labor, in February 1994, a baby boy appeared with two feet sticking out. It was Groundhog Day, and the Redwoods would later joke that their son had seen his shadow and tried to run back in. The doctors ordered a C-section and the procedure went well. A beaming baby boy, named Will Redwood, arrived into the world happy and healthy. Will, with his brown hair and cool, gray-blue eyes, was an exceedingly good baby. Rarely fussy and almost always smiling, he seemed alert and engaged in his new world. Will chuckled and grinned whenever Lyn tickled him, and he loved to play tag with the family cat, crawling around the living room and squealing with delight whenever he caught the kitty. He was an unusually inquisitive and adventurous boy. At eight months, he learned to use his baby walker, and wandered around the ground floor of the house exploring every corner he could get into. Will breast-fed without trouble and met, or exceeded, normal developmental landmarks. He began speaking right on schedule, and learned new words like mama, daddy, and kitty cat almost daily. By twelve months, he could play Little Tykes basketball with his brother, Drew. Lyn and Tommy watched in awe as Will toddled to the hoop and slam-dunked the ball home. Each time, he turned to his parents, clapped his little hands, and cried, Yea!! Lyn, the experienced nurse, made sure that Will received every vaccination on the U.S. Childhood Immunization Schedule. She couldn't help but notice that kids were getting a lot more shots now than Hanna and Drew had received in the 1980s. At two months, four months, six months, and one year, Will was brought in for a well-baby visit, each time receiving multiple injections against dangerous diseases like hepatitis-B, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), or diphtheria-tetanus (DT). Shortly after Will's one-year visit, he developed strep throat, which is rare in young infants. Then he developed rotavirus, a gastrointestinal bug that can cause severe pain and discomfort in a child. One Saturday, while Lyn had a good friend visiting for the weekend, Will vomited on the living room floor. Lyn didn't think too much about it, but a few hours later Will vomited again, and it quickly got to the point where he couldn't keep food down at all. Worried, Lyn called her pediatrician, who prescribed an antinausea suppository. The pediatrician said that rotavirus was fairly common in children. He was not unduly alarmed. The next day, the diarrhea began. It quickly got so bad it would fill the toddler's diapers and run down his legs in burning, acidic streams. But there was no treatment for rotavirus, and the only remedy Lyn could think of was to give Will rice-and-glucose water every hour or two, to replace the electrolytes he was losing. The diarrhea drained from him like foul floodwaters and the vomiting wracked his small body. Even though the worst symptoms abated after a week or so, Will never really made a recovery to full health. He ran periodic and unexplained fevers. He seemed under the weather all the time. At around seventeen months, Will developed an upper respiratory infection, like a very bad cold, and began wheezing uncontrollably. The Redwoods rushed him to Peachtree Regional Hospital, where he was immediately admitted and given IV antibiotics, steroids, and other medications. Lyn stayed with her son for two days, sleeping with Will inside his misty respirator tent. Will also lost an alarming amount of weight. He had, for all practical purposes, stopped eating. Lyn put him on a strict regimen of vitamins and supplemental nutritional treatments. And even though she had weaned him from the bottle, she found it was now the only way to get real food (in the guise of meal-replacement shakes) inside the boy. Once spritely and impish, Will now sat motionless in his infant seat, gazing at videos in dogged, unnerving repetition. And there was something else, something ominous that transpired during this period\u2014something that Lyn and Tommy noticed only gradually, and didn't pay much mind to because Will had been so darned sick. But there was no denying it. Will had stopped talking. Oh, don't worry about that, Lyn was told by friends and family. Boys always talk late. Tommy, for instance, hadn't started speaking until he was three, and he turned out to be a skilled physician. Lyn's first son, Drew, hadn't been a late talker. So maybe it was something in Tommy's genes. There were other signs of trouble, of course, signs that Lyn only realized several years later. One weekday morning, when Will was in his infant seat, staring at space, Lyn walked directly in front of him, bending down until her face met his, her deep brown eyes just inches from Will's. She smiled, she waved. But Will just sat there, looking straight through his mother. My, she marveled. You have incredibly intense concentration! Years later, Lyn would scoff at her own na\u00efvet\u00e9. Loss of speech and lack of eye contact are classic symptoms of autism. But the disorder, still so rare at the time, was way off her maternal radar screen. Despite her medical background, Lyn had never met an autistic kid in her life. AUTISM CONTINUED to be the last thing on their minds as Lyn and Tommy witnessed Will's increasingly baffling behavior. He grew acutely sensitive to sound, and would cover his ears and yelp in pain if the TV were turned up. Going to Drew's basketball games was always an ordeal. When the buzzer went off, Will threw his hands to his ears and screamed loudly enough to pierce the crowd's roar. Lyn learned to watch the timer and cover Will's ears in advance. Then there was the incident at the Little League game. One muggy evening in Tyrone, the Redwoods were at the local ballpark taking in one of Drew's games. Will, the restless toddler, kept trying to get up and wander around the bleacher area. Finally, after several attempts at trailing her son and returning him to his seat, Lyn decided to let Will go, just to see what would happen. I'm going to just sit here and see how far he goes before he realizes he's out of the ten-foot radius or so, she said to Tommy. Will just kept wandering aimlessly away, far from the stadium lights. He was a good fifty feet away from his parents, heading nowhere into the night, before she ran to fetch him. At that point the Redwoods knew: if they didn't keep an eye on him every second of the day, Will would be gone. Will's hearing continued to deteriorate. In September 1995 he was referred to a pediatric ear-nose-and-throat specialist at Emory University, who poked and prodded the boy like some pet science project. He said fluid had accumulated behind Will's eardrums, and the pressure was causing severe hearing loss. Will would need tympanostomy tubes surgically implanted in his eardrums in order to drain the fluid, relieve the pressure, and restore hearing. On the morning of the operation, Lyn arrived at 5:00 A.M. with a very nervous, hyperactive little boy. The nurses slipped Will into a pale blue gown and Lyn let them walk him up and down the hall. Even at that early hour, Will could not sit still. The procedure went well. But the doctor remarked on how little fluid he found behind the eardrums. It perplexed him. The surgery might not have been enough to address Will's difficulties, he said. Perhaps Will's problems were not related directly to hearing. There might be a deeper problem with his communication abilities. Will would need speech therapy immediately. In October 1995 an assessment confirmed that Will's language skills were exceedingly low. At the time, all he could do was make baby sounds. He could verbalize, but none of it made any sense. It came out all garbled. His speech and language skills at twenty months were those of a six-month-old. On expressive language, he scored at the level of a five-month-old. Will was examined by a neurologist, who ordered an MRI, EEG, and chromosome studies, all of which returned normal. But the boy was not making any real progress. No one had any idea what was wrong. Mostly, the Redwoods felt relieved. Their biggest fear had been that a brain tumor or some other type of malignancy had caused Will's regression. But nothing was wrong. There were no brain abnormalities, no damaged chromosomes that might cause mental retardation. Will's speech delay was just a fluke, an easily denied sign of things to come. When Will was two, Lyn enrolled him in a new nursery school program run out of the local New Hope Baptist church. She assumed that leaving him in a classroom with other toddlers would naturally help his speech develop. But when she took Will in on the first day, she discovered that most of the other kids in the program weren't talking, either. My God, Lyn muttered sadly under her breath. What on earth is going on around here? So many kids who aren't talking. Is there something in the water? Lyn never found out what was wrong with the kids, but seeing children who were not unlike Will, for the first time ever, left her with an odd, slightly guilty sense of comfort. When Will was three, in 1997, he entered a special program run by the local county school system for kids with advanced developmental disorders. It was held in a public elementary school, a modern, clean, brick-and-steel affair that had been built just two years before, where the typical kids went. There were six kids in Will's classroom, all of them with developmental disorders. One afternoon, about a week into school, Lyn came by to pick up Will. She'd arrived early and decided to peek through the window. What she saw horrified her. A teacher had strapped Will into a wooden chair with plywood panels going up the sides. It looked like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lyn thought. She had no idea that such contraptions existed. She rushed into the school to hear Will's spine-chilling screech echoing from the walls. She tore down the hallway and burst into the classroom, fuming. What are you doing!? I don't want him in that chair! Get him out, right now. But Mrs. Redwood, the teacher sputtered. He won't sit still for circle time. Fine, she snapped. I will come and hold him, every day if need be. He can sit on my lap. Lyn was working weekend shifts in order to free up time to look after Will. For the next several months, she came to school every day for circle time. One day while collecting Will at class, Lyn struck up a conversation with the mother of another boy enrolled in the program. The woman regarded Will intently, one eyebrow arched. You know something? she said, wary but kindly. Will looks and behaves very much like my son. He has the same demeanor. Lyn was intrigued, even a bit heartened. Perhaps this mother knew the secret to unlocking Will's locked-in world. Really. And do you know what's wrong with your son? Sure, the woman said, matter-of-factly. He has autism. THERE WAS NO WAY that Will had autism, Lyn still believed. He didn't flap his arms, didn't run in circles or bang his head on the walls like the autistic kids she had seen in some of the more graphic news programs. But the mother at Will's school gently persisted. She told Lyn that a new behavioral therapy was helping children with developmental disorders. There's this really great program on the north side of Atlanta, she informed Lyn. They're doing amazing things with our kids. You really have to come see for yourself. Lyn agreed to go. She was so desperate by now, she would do anything for an effective therapy, even if her son didn't have autism. The program employed a treatment method called Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which was developed by Dr. Ivar Lovaas in the 1980s. Based on the revolutionary theory that autism is treatable, ABA has shown remarkable success in children with autism and severe developmental disorders. Some of the children treated with this method go on to achieve normal intellectual and cognitive functioning. Lyn went to sit in on an ABA session being held in the private home of an Atlanta mother with an autistic son. He was two years older than Will, and seemed to be doing extraordinarily well. Lyn watched, dumbfounded, as the boy recited his ABCs and read aloud from a storybook. Proper ABA therapy requires a team of experts to work one-on-one with the affected child for hours at a time. The treatment is rigorous, exhausting, and prohibitively expensive; the cost for one year can reach a hundred thousand dollars. The Lovaas method uses behavior modification principles to encourage good and appropriate behavior\u2014proper language, communication, and play skills; better observation; and outward affection\u2014while repressing and discouraging problematic behavior like withdrawal, aggression, inattention, and temper tantrums. ABA therapists then break down each desired skill into small, discrete steps. This discrete trial training systematically drills each step into the child's psyche through endless hours of painstaking, repetitive conditioning. Teachers warmly reward children for good behavior, ignore them when they exhibit bad behavior, and remove them to time-out when things get out of hand. The method is not without its critics, who say it is little better than training a dog. But many parents have claimed complete success with ABA therapy, and it is the only nonmedical autism treatment endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General. Lyn was now genuinely excited, for perhaps the first time since Will got sick. She returned home and immediately called the woman in her school district who handled special services, to request that they provide ABA therapy to Will. Well, the woman said, we can only do that for children with autism. But, but ... Lyn interjected. Don't worry. Will's eligible. What do you mean? Lyn asked. You're saying he's autistic? Mrs. Redwood, to be honest, we have sort of thought that all along. Lyn was stunned. Why didn't you tell me? As teachers, we can't diagnose, the woman said. The children must be diagnosed by the school psychologist, but they don't do exams until the kids are five. You know, Lyn said, this is like someone having cancer, but no one wants to tell you because they don't want to upset you. \"I know, Mrs. Redwood. I'm sorry. But Will is eligible.\" In November, the school met with Will and Lyn. All the specialists were brought in: Will's speech and language pathologist, his two teachers, the school district's autism coordinator, its director of special education services, and the principal. Mrs. Redwood, what are your goals for your son? the director asked. I want him to know his name, she replied. That is my first goal. And your second goal? By the time he starts kindergarten, she said, smiling, I want him to be indistinguishable from his peers. Heavy sighs broke the silence, but Lyn held fast. Her son did not have an official diagnosis, and she was going to cling to her faith that his dire condition might only be temporary. The group agreed that the school would provide ABA therapy to Will, and train some of its teachers in the unfamiliar method. Within weeks, Lyn began delivering Will to school an hour early every day for intensive one-on-one therapy with teachers. He received another hour of ABA at school after class, then came home, ate, and completed another two hours of therapy. By this time, Lyn's denial about Will's autism was beginning to crumble. Lyn and Tommy purchased a copy of a Lovaas handbook written by Catherine Maurice, who also wrote the groundbreaking book Let Me Hear Your Voice, in which she detailed the amazing story of curing not one, but two of her children with autistic disorders. Lyn would later come to refer to the handbook as her autism bible. Lyn learned that parents aren't always the most suitable ABA therapists for their own children, though some parents have tried. So the Redwoods used the manual to train two other people to take on the task, a local unemployed college graduate and a teacher's aide at a school for children with developmental disabilities. For Lyn, it was often difficult to watch. Will wasn't always the best student. He does some of it for a while very well, she told Tommy, but he needs it to be very fast-paced, and he needs the rewards all the time. When that didn't happen, Will would wail like a trapped animal. Will began to log modest progress with his ABA home-style therapy. During the next few years, he would learn his name, as Lyn had hoped. Eventually he started to learn his colors, and then the alphabet. And just as slowly, Lyn and Tommy came to accept that their son was afflicted with some form of autism. Despite all the experts who had examined him, ultimately it was the medically trained Redwoods who diagnosed Will themselves. One night in mid-1998, they got out the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2014Vol. 4) and compared Will's symptoms with those listed in the book of mental maladies. Lyn and Tommy concluded that Will had pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), a moderately severe neurological illness that lies within a constellation of diseases known as autism spectrum disorder, or ASD. ASD, which includes classic full-blown autism, PDD-NOS, Rett syndrome, and Asperger's syndrome (the so-called Idiot Savant malady popularized in the film Rain Man), is a neurodevelopmental disorder that emerges early in life. Children with ASD exhibit an assemblage of seemingly unrelated features, with wide variation in symptoms and severity. In the most notable cases of classic autism, children flap their arms, bang their heads, walk on their toes, line things up in rows, or spin in endless circles. Will showed none of those traits. But many ASD symptoms described him well, such as severe social impairment, verbal and nonverbal communication problems, repetitive behaviors, movement disorder, sensory dysfunction, and cognitive impairments. In many children, and Will was no exception, there are also unusual gastrointestinal difficulties and immune abnormalities. Onset of the disorder, as in Will's case, occurs before thirty-six months of age. Some children are clearly autistic from birth. But today, most cases appear only after a year or more of normal development\u2014followed by clear regression or failure to progress. Autism was long thought to be purely genetic in origin. But there is now an emerging belief that many cases are the product of an interaction between some type of genetic predisposition and early exposure to environmental triggers, called insults. Like most Americans at the time, the Redwoods assumed that autism was an extremely rare disease. Lyn was soon to learn otherwise, however. From the 1940s, when autism was first described in the literature, until the late 1970s, it had indeed been rare. The U.S. incidence was just 1 to 3 births per 10,000. But by 1998 the figure had climbed to 20 to 40 births per 10,000. Today, there are accounts of 60 to 80 cases per 10,000 children (or 1 in 166) reported in some states, including New Jersey and California, making it more common than multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, or childhood cancer.\u00b9 Could there have been something in the water, as Lyn had joked to herself back at the Baptist church, or was there something else at play? Had some other insult damaged Will and so many other kids? SALLIE MCCONNELL met Thomas Bernard in 1975 when they were freshmen at Harvard. The Bernards married in 1979 and eventually settled into a loftlike apartment on East Twenty-third Street in Manhattan. Tom landed a handsomely paid job on Wall Street, at Salomon Brothers, while Sallie got work with TMP Worldwide, an ad agency that specialized in regional Yellow Page directories. The Bernards were on their way to building significant wealth. In 1986, Sallie took her business skills and started a market research firm, Advertising Research Corporation, now called ARC. Based in Cranford, New Jersey, the twelve-employee operation manages a network of focus groups, telephone studies, shopping mall questionnaires, and surveys through the mail and on the Internet. In 1987, Sallie learned she was pregnant\u2014with triplets. The Bernards went shopping for a real house outside the city, with trees and a lawn and a garden for the new arrivals. They purchased a large Tudor in the affluent suburb of Summit, New Jersey. The triplets were born five weeks premature in September 1987, at Manhattan's Lenox Hill Hospital. All three were underweight, but Bill was born perilously so. Fred weighed in at 5\u00be pounds, and Jamie was 4\u00be pounds, but Bill tipped the scale at just 3 pounds. Healthy Fred went home right away. Jamie, who needed to gain just a few more ounces before release, stayed a couple of days longer. Bill was less fortunate. Diagnosed with anemia, he was given a blood transfusion and remained in the hospital for nearly four weeks. It was a trying time for Sallie; even with hired household help, the young mother and businesswoman found herself torn between the clamors for attention from two babies at home, demanding clients at work, and a very sick boy in the hospital. When all three sons were safely at home, Sallie began to notice that Bill was developing a bit more slowly than Fred and Jamie. She kept track of the boys' milestones. Fred and Jamie vied to be the first to raise his head up, first to roll over, first to stand up, and first to fall down. It was always within days of each other, remembered Sallie, who retains a youthful freshness, with sea-green eyes and honey-colored hair. But Bill was always at least two weeks behind the other boys. He couldn't seem to catch up. By the time the Bernard triplets turned two, they were beginning to speak, and Sallie kept track of the exciting progress. But as usual, Bill lagged behind his brothers. In one typical week, Fred would log in twelve new words, and Jamie would learn maybe eleven. But Bill, though he was learning, typically would have a new word list of five. Sallie also made sure the boys completed their well-baby visits, and had their full range of required vaccinations. But given their small birth weights, the pediatrician decided to push back the first round of shots, from two months to four months. Over the Christmas holidays in 1989, when the boys were around two and a half, Tom's parents flew to New Jersey for a visit. On a snowy night when the extended family was enjoying a roaring fire in the large living room, Tom's father, Fred, was horsing around with the triplets. Jamie and little Fred were squealing with glee, but Bill seemed distant, losing interest. Later, when Sallie got out the Tinker Toys to settle the boys down, Bill had a tough time inserting the sticks into the wooden wheels. He grew inconsolable until one of his brothers came to help him out. I must tell you, Fred confided in Tom and Sallie later that evening, after the boys went to bed, I think something might be wrong with Bill. He's a little different than the other boys. He doesn't play with the same intensity they do. The young couple brushed aside Fred's concerns, having convinced themselves that Bill would eventually catch up with his siblings. He just needed some time, that's all. Bill would be fine. But Bill wasn't at all fine. By New Years, 1990, he began to withdraw from the world. He began screaming and tearing around the house as if he'd been set on fire. He quickly went downhill from "}
