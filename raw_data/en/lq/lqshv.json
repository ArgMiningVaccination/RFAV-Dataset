About the author Shuang Wang conducted her doctoral study in the University of Passau in Germany, where she graduated with Master of Laws (LL.M.) in 2010. Her research interest focuses on family law from a comparative perspective, especially on parental custody after separation or divorce. About the book Different from the traditional legislation in family issues which focused on marriage and divorce, current legislation in Germany has come to highlight the relationship between parents and children. The book focuses on parental custody after separation or divorce in Germany and China before a legal comparison is drawn. Furthermore, the book explores possible legal reforms in this field in the two legal systems. This eBook can be cited This edition of the eBook can be cited.

[8] [Acknowledgements] There are several people to be particularly acknowledged here for their contribution in the completion of my dissertation in which all the cited literature, laws and regulations are before 30 September 2019. First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Hau who provided me the opportunity to pursue my doctoral study in Passau University. Without his guidance and encouragement, this thesis could not be completed. In addition, my gratitude goes to Prof. Dr. Dennis Solomon who is the second supervisor of my thesis and Prof. Dr. Nina Dethloff from University of Bonn who sent her works and articles in family law to me. My thanks and appreciation go to all the other people who helped me in any respect during the completion of the dissertation, especially Prof. Dr. Florian Eichel who allowed the chance to co-lead the seminar in the winter semester 2016/2017, Ms. Sabine Cichon who is always kind, patient and helpful, and Mr. Andreas Bernrieder who generously provides help and shares knowledge with me. Furthermore, I sincerely thank Chinese Scholarship Council for having funded my research work for two years. It is really hoped that this dissertation could slightly contribute to improvement of the legislation regarding parental custody after divorce or separation of parents and to promotion of rights of the children born out of wedlock in China. Finally, I would like to show my eternal thankfulness to my parents Ms. Huaqin Zhang and Mr. Jiuda Wang for their unconditional love and support, and I thank my husband Mr. Longhui Shi who has made available his support in a number of ways.
