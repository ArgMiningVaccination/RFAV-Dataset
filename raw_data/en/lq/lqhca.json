The odds are definitely in the parasites' favor. We come into contact with parasites on a regular basis. We can get them from our pets, from contaminated food (like undercooked meat) and water, from the soil, from bug bites, from close contact with an infected person... You can even inhale microscopic parasite eggs from the air. The good news is that parasitic infections are rarely deadly in the United States.

These natural ingredients cleanse parasites from your body There are several anti-parasitic drugs available to treat various types of parasite infections.

I prefer treating \u2014 and preventing \u2014 parasite infections in a more natural way. Lucky for us, Mother Nature has a treasure trove of herbal remedies that are very effective at wiping out common parasites. Here are a few that work well: 1. Coconut oil Coconuts have been used for centuries in India to treat tapeworm infections and other intestinal worms. Coconut oil is also effective at treating giardia infections, which causes terrible cramps, bloating and diarrhea, killing off these single-celled parasites before they can establish their life cycle inside your digestive tract. Take one teaspoon twice a day, either alone or mix in food. 2. Food-grade diatomaceous earth It's a long complicated name, but diatomaceous earth is just the fossilized remains of a tiny aquatic organism called a diatom. It's one of the most effective parasite cleanses available. It's believed to work by dehydrating the parasites. It's available in powder form. Many natural health practitioners recommend taking one teaspoon daily, mixed with water. 3. Garlic Don't underestimate this common herb. Garlic has been shown to have antimicrobial, antibacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral and anti-parasitic effects. One of the most potent anti-parasitic properties in garlic is a compound called allicin. You have to crush or chop the garlic in order to get the most effect. Start with one clove per day. 4. Black walnut hulls, wormwood and cloves This powerful anti-parasite trio works well to kill a variety of parasites and parasitic worms. Black walnut hulls kill adult parasites, wormwood kills parasites in the larval stages, and cloves kill parasite eggs. You can also buy anti-parasite cleanse supplements online or at your local health food store. Look for cleanse supplements that contain the ingredients listed above. Other great anti-parasitic natural treatments include pumpkin seeds, papaya seeds, grapefruit seed extract, oregano oil and apple cider vinegar. Key takeaway: Coconut oil, food-grade diatomaceous earth, garlic and the anti-parasite trio of black walnut hulls, wormwood and cloves are among the most effective natural parasite supplements.
