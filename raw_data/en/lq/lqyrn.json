Eat what your grandma was feeding your papa!. Seriously, those were the days of unrefined, unprocessed foods that were grown in natural conditions, lots of fruits, vegetables and grains grown without chemicals.

( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/835483/)) I have only love to the Americans. Good on them that they are rapidly adopting Yoga, spirituality and healthy lifestyle these days. 2. Include garlic. Include 2 - 4 garlic cloves in your daily diet. It is known to reduce bad cholesterol effectively( [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23590705/)). There are many garlic capsule or tablets in the market, but why take the tablet when you have the natural garlic. 3. If you are a vegetarian, do not go non-vegetarian. In a study, vegetarians who transitioned to non vegetarian food increased the risk of heart disease by 146% ( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24847857/)) 4. Have sour foods. Amlo hrudyAnAm - declares Acharya Vagbhata. Sour foods are naturally cardio-protective. A little bit of tamarind, amla, or any other natural sour ingredient of your choice will provide you with Vitamin C, which is an anti-oxidant. Sour foods like cherries also keep the blood thin and avoid atherosclerosis (cholesterol, clot deposition in heart arteries). ( [6](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/00346650810891414/full/html?queryID=44%2F5410107)) Sour buttermilk, sour curds, sour pomegranate, lemons are also good food choices. 5.
