[Patient Chanin Leewanun Chanin Leewanun is a highly experienced physician in integrative and anti-aging medicine. Apart from his clinical background, Dr. Chanin focuses on integrative treatment with precedence, guided by the Four Noble Truths, which contain an essence of spiritual contentment, life balance, healing pathways, and self-actualization. He strongly believes that good health happens when the body and mind are balanced. The correct treatment can cure an illness when the root cause is found. Alleviating only the symptoms is not effective. Many times, symptoms occur because of lifestyle. Therefore, treatment should be made more specific through deeper understanding and integration of knowledge and approach. Treatment from the Heart Dr. Chanin Leewanun was named after his parents' favorite movie, \"Dr. Chanin, the Wizard.\" This film has been his family's passion since 2010, and it became a career when Dr. Chanin became a physician (not the wizard, of course). We can, without a doubt, influence everything that happens in our lives, just as Dr. Chanin did. He was the master of his own destiny. He chose what best suited him as a person. He was brave enough to investigate and learn about the time's renowned bio-organic diet, and he discovered that it was healthy. As a result, he used it to guide his career as a doctor until it led him to anti-aging medicine, which became his passion. Many people thought of anti-aging doctors in the same way they thought of masseuses or physiotherapists at the time. Dr. Chanin, on the other hand, saw right through it and concentrated on the advantages. Right now, physicians in this field are in high demand, with many medical institutions looking for them. Dr. Chanin then concentrated on complementary medicine, which included acupuncture, traditional Thai massage, vitamins, chelation, and anti-aging treatment pathways. He was first introduced to integrative medicine the day he arrived at Absolute Health, a modern technique that incorporates alternative treatments and is fully supported by medical research. Dr. Chanin's distinguishing characteristics are his eagerness to learn and willingness to experiment with new medical techniques. He has successfully treated a large number of patients for more than two decades, many of whom return on a regular basis for long-term medical management or a boost in their health. Dr. Chanin is not only a doctor, but also a lecturer at a prestigious Thai medical facility. When he teaches, he incorporates not only textbooks and academic papers, but also practicality and real-life case studies to ensure that his students grasp the true essence of medicine. Dr. Chanin is a caring physician who always gives his all. Combining his experience and knowledge Dr. Chanin sees the majority of his patients for knee arthrosis, osteoarthritis, and arthralgia because he is a specialist in treating these conditions without surgery, combining his knowledge with integrated medicine. His treatment is based on the \"Four Noble Truths Medicine\" philosophy, which states that sickness is suffering. Physicians must first determine the cause of a sickness (suffering) before determining how to cure the condition, as this is the only way to remove the source of pain. Unlike many conventional treatments, which are unable to pinpoint the source of an illness, integrative medicine treatments use a rational treatment approach that focuses on the root cause of the illness, which can help heal the suffering. The \"giving\" physician Dr. Chanin believes that if patients understand health, they will be able to care for themselves. The key is for patients to be educated. It is because lifestyle causes 80% of today's illnesses, which means that if patients can take 70-80% of their own care and the doctor takes the other 20%-30%, the result is a 100% recovery. In contrast, standard treatment does not educate patients and instead relies solely on the treatment. As a result, the outcome of general treatment is solely determined by the treatment component. Every doctor, including Dr. Chanin, wishes for the recovery of his or her patients. He does not just want patients to be able to use their bodies properly and have a good quality of life after they recover; he also wants them to be able to use their bodies properly and have a good quality of life after they recover. What is proposed is not just theory; it is put into practice by the doctor. This includes self-care, family time, exercise 3-4 days per week, neighborhood jogging 1-2 days per week, and attending a spiritual retreat. Dr. Chanin regularly attends intense spiritual retreats. For example, he attended a spiritual retreat in India in early 2018, which had a profound impact on him. To care for himself and his family, he uses all of his clinical treatment as well as his spiritual practice. As the saying goes, Dr. Chanin \"teaches what he practices and practices what he teaches.\" Techniques to good health Even if you are not sick, preventive care is essential. They should learn more about dharma, organic foods, exercise techniques (such as aerobic exercise for blood circulation, muscle building, body flexibility, cell nourishment, and other advantages), detoxification, and eating nutritious food. Dr. Chanin recommends that patients who are experiencing health issues bring their medical report, which includes their treatment and medication history, with them when they visit the doctor for the first time. Always be truthful with your doctor, as the advice given is always in the best interests of the patient. Diversity in clinical and integrative medicine Dr. Chanin, as previously stated, has extensive clinical experience. He believes that it is critical to continually expand one's knowledge. As a result, he completed the following studies and credentials in addition to his medical qualifications: - Certified in Thai Traditional Massage from Wat Phra Chetuphon (Wat Pho). - Certified in Acupuncture 10th Batch from Hua Chiew Hospotal, Ministry of Public Health, and Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. - Short-term course training in cellulite treatment hosted by Institute of Thai Traditional Medicine, Thai Traditional Medical Development Foundation and Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. - Certificate of Attendance in the 11th World Congress on Pain, Sydney 2005. - Certificate of Attendance in Integrative Medicine Asia 06 (IMAsia 06), Singapore, October 20-22, 2006. - Certificate for The 1st International Bangkok Congress on Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine (BCAARM), Millennium Hilton "}
