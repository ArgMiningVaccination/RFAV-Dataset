A healing crisis typically occurs after a focused period of inner work, therapy, or counseling. It can also occur right after an energy treatment or very intense healing session. In rare cases, a healing crisis can even be precipitated as the result of significantly shifting your beliefs or seeing yourself and the world in a new way. Even though in the moment it feels like, well, a crisis (as the name implies!), a healing crisis is actually a great sign that you are transforming yourself in profound ways. Though, as a caveat: if you don't experience a healing crisis, that doesn't mean you're not healing! Since you're here, reading this, chances are you've been on the spiritual path for a while and you have experienced \u2014 or are currently experiencing \u2014 your own healing crisis. If you *think* you might be going through a healing crisis but you're not sure, here's a list of very common symptoms: - fatigue, tiredness, sleepiness, lethargy (even after a full night's rest) - lack of motivation or desire to do anything - inability to focus - dizziness, vertigo, headaches - old aches & pains returning out of the blue - crying for \"no reason\" - a sense of sadness, grief, or loss - a sense of confusion or lack of direction - things \"falling apart\" all around you (to make space for the new) - not finding enjoyment in past interests, activities, hobbies (because you're shifting to a new consciousness) - feeling extremely sensitive and emotional (more so than usual) - feeling intense emotions (i.e., anger, frustration, grief) for \"no reason\" - feeling irritable and craving high-sugar & fatty foods (your body's attempt to ground itself) - alternatively, a lack of appetite and disinterest in food *Important: please remember to get checked out by a doctor if any of the above symptoms appear very suddenly and/or worsen over time. If this is a true healing crisis, your symptoms will get progressively less intense and then disappear. Anything that lingers or gets worse is probably something else \u2014 so don't ignore it! When we deepen our soul work and inner development work, a spiritual healing crisis of some sort is almost inevitable. Even though it can be so uncomfortable and even disconcerting while it's happening, it's an external sign that your internal landscape is shifting in positive ways. Here are 7 strategies you can use to lessen the intensity and duration of a healing crisis, and to support yourself as you go through it. Because, truly, you can only get out of it by going through it! The most important thing to remember is that you're not alone, you're doing good work, and you WILL come out the other side. 1. Back off on the intense inner work (for a while). The first strategy you can try is to hold off on doing any further inner work or energy work until after the healing crisis has passed. Sometimes, doing more work helps you get through the crisis faster \u2014 but sometimes that can backfire and make things even more uncomfortable. Rest assured that if you stop your self-development work for a little while, you're not going to regress. By \"self-development work\" I mean more intense types of inner work, such as shadow work, dreamwork, counseling, psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, past life work, and so on. I do NOT mean lighter forms of inner work like meditation and journaling, which you should definitely keep up to help you navigate the crisis (see #2 below). 2. Step up the meditation, yoga, and other *light* forms of self-care. If you've been putting off your daily meditation or yoga, or only engaging in these practices for 5 minutes here and there, it's time to incorporate them consistently into your schedule. Making more room for meditation, yoga, very light exercise, and other forms of physical self-care (like naps!) is critical during a healing crisis. These practices will help integrate the transformations that are occurring within you and they will also open, balance, and heal your chakras and energy field. 3. Detox baths. Draw a warm bath, pour a cup of Epsom salts + 1/2 cup of baking soda, and soak for at least 20 minutes. The Epsom salts draw toxins out of your skin and give you a magnesium boost, which helps relax your muscles. The baking soda also helps with detox and makes your skin baby smooth. If you need to cry, this is a perfect opportunity to do so \u2014 release your physical and emotional toxins all at once, into the bath. 4. Take a day off. Call out from work (if you can), get a babysitter, send everyone on errands and out of the house. Make sure you can take a day, or at least half a day, to just rest and recover. Use the day to nap, take your detox bath, read, watch your favorite shows, eat comforting foods, and be responsible for nothing and no one. Absolutely no work of any kind on this day \u2014 even better if you can shut off your phone. You need this time for yourself. 5. Call a friend or mentor. If you have a friend who's been going through the same stuff or a mentor you really trust, give them a call. Let them know what you're experiencing and ask them if they've had any similar symptoms. This can open up an illuminating dialogue about spiritual ascension (which we are all going through) and inner work. But, more importantly, it will help you see you're not alone and you're not a freak. What you're going through is normal, natural, and even expected on the spiritual path. 6. Clear your schedule / take things off your plate. If you happen to be someone who's always on the go, always over-scheduling yourself, always taking on more than you can realistically accomplish \u2014 start to pare things down. Look at your calendar. What can be moved, delayed, cancelled, or delegated? Clearing some space in your schedule can be extremely helpful to recharge and get some breathing room. 7. Use your spiritual tools. A healing crisis is the perfect time to reach for your Tarot deck, Oracle deck, Angel cards, runes, pendulums, and crystals. Also, your journal! Use your skills and spiritual tools to ask questions about what's going on with you. A good question to ask your deck would be: \"if this is truly a healing crisis, what am I meant to learn from it?\" You might also ask: \"what am I currently processing? Is there anything I can do to support myself better through this?\" Write down any insights and ideas that come to you, and journal about the experience. Sometimes getting your thoughts down on paper helps to clear your energy and get things moving faster.
