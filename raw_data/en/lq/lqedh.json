QUALITY OF EVIDENCE MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 1966 to May 2008 combining the key words hypertension or blood pressure with acupuncture, chocolate, cocoa, coenzyme Q10, ubiquinone, melatonin, vitamin D, meditation, and stress reduction. Clinical trials, prospective studies, and relevant references were included. MAIN MESSAGE Evidence from systematic reviews supports the blood pressure-lowering effects of coenzyme Q10, polyphenol-rich dark chocolate, Qigong, slow breathing, and transcendental meditation. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular risk; supplementation lowered blood pressure in 2 trials. Acupuncture reduced blood pressure in 3 trials; in 1 of these it was no better than an invasive placebo. Melatonin was effective in 2 small trials, but caution is warranted in patients taking pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSION Several complementary and alternative medicine therapies can be considered as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of hypertension. The potential benefit of these interventions warrants further research using cardiovascular outcomes.", "sitename": "The College of Family Physicians of Canada", "date": "2008-11-01", "cleaned_text": "Jump to comment: - Published on: (29 January 2009) [Page navigation anchor for Medical Aromatherapy](/)Medical Aromatherapy Dear Editor: Dr. Nahas is commended for the informative review of complementary and alternative approaches to blood pressure control.1 Noticeably absent from the review was an analysis of clinical studies regarding medical aromatherapy\u2014the therapeutic use of distilled plant essential oils.
