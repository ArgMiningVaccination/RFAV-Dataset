Fluad\u00ae Quad contains the active ingredient influenza virus haemagglutinin. Fluad\u00ae Quad is an adjuvanted vaccine used to help prevent certain types of influenza or \"flu\". It is for use in people aged 65 years and older only. Influenza is a sudden respiratory infection caused by the 'flu' virus. It is very contagious. It is usually spread from one person to another by small droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus enters the nose or throat and may spread to the lungs. Influenza infection can lead to serious illness. Vaccination with Fluad\u00ae Quad helps prevent infection with influenza and to control the spread of the disease. Influenza strains can change every year therefore previous influenza vaccinations are unlikely to give you protection against the current strains most common this year. You will therefore need to receive a vaccine against flu every year to lower the chance of catching the 'flu', especially if you are at risk. Influenza vaccination is in particular recommended for people aged 65 years and older. Fluad\u00ae Quad works by causing your body to produce its own protection against the four types of influenza virus from which it is made. It does this by making substances called antibodies in the blood that fight the influenza virus. Your body usually takes 2-3 weeks after vaccination to develop protection against influenza. Most people will produce enough antibodies against the influenza virus. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. An influenza vaccine will only protect you against the types of influenza virus used to make it. It will not protect you from other types of influenza virus or from infections with other agents causing flu-like symptoms (such as the common cold). The virus in Fluad\u00ae Quad has been killed therefore the vaccine cannot 'give' you the flu. 2. What should I know before being given Fluad\u00ae Quad?
