These include traveling merchants who cannot sell their products, workers who got laid off or affected by unpaid leave, traveling satay sellers in the villages, bricklayers, art performance ticket sellers, taxi drivers, and more. Currently, there is no fixed date to open the island for tourism again, so this condition of those families will not change in the near future. So far, USD 1785 have been raised and used to create care packages that have been delivered to 64 families. With 35$ you can help to feed a Balinese family for two weeks.

It is one of the most exciting projects in the region, with an emphasis on long term economic benefits for some of Bali's poorest people. Although Bali seems incredibly lush and vibrant, there are huge tracts of the island, specifically in the East, that suffer from extreme dryness and as a result, little to no vegetation. Due to these conditions, the communities inhabited in these damaged areas are of the poorest in Bali. BaliSpirit Festival and Yayasan Kryasta Guna partnered with the Environmental Bamboo Foundation (EBF) in an effort to help poor communities in Desa Songan, East Bali since 2011. That is how Bali ReGreen was created. At BaliSpirit and Bali ReGreen, we believe regreening is more than looking after and giving back to the earth; it is also about looking after its people.
