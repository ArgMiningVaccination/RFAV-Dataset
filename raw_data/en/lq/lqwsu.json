Funded through a Strategic Seed grant, LionPulse works to support the University's strategic plan in the following ways: Designed by Freepik Enhancing Health: The LionPulse network provides resources for departments to implement health-conscious practices and policies. Constituent Outreach and Engagement: LionPulse fosters intercampus relationships through its creation of a stakeholder advisory board consisting of faculty, staff, students and outside organizations. Infrastructure and Support: LionPulse enhances initiatives between students and employees by expanding services to both with minimal effort. Organizational Processes: The LionPulse network has brought together many wellness programs that were previously in silos. Engaging our Students: Students play a pivotal role in this project by supplying invaluable information regarding what initiatives are of most interest and what issues are of greatest concern. PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 3 THE PROCESS: Stakeholder Advisory Board Penn State PRO Wellness created a cross-functional stakeholder advisory board, comprised of 14 employee health experts, physicians, students and representation from insurance companies. Stakeholders met quarterly to advise all aspects of the LionPulse project including the assessments, program selection and evaluation.

Campuses worked to implement evidence-based wellness policies and practices on their campus. PRO Wellness facilitated monthly virtual meetings to network the health champions together and offer wellness trainings such as: Wellness committee formation Identifying evidence-based practices Gaining leadership support Wellness promotion Wellness engagement Vaping Mental health Opioid abuse disorder Campus gardens Exercise is Medicine Mindfulness-based stress reduction Program sustainability Community partnerships PSU Healthy Ambassador Program MONTHLY Health Champion CALLS Designed by Freepik monthly meeetings from January 2019 - October 2019(averaging > 55% participation)PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 5MONTHLY Health Champion CALLS WELLNESS COMMITTEES To receive local assistance and support, PRO Wellness trained each Health Champion to create a campus wellness committee. PRO Wellness recommended that each health champion include key players from their campus such as facilities personnel, marketing staff, human resources, faculty, staff and students. Having a diversified wellness committee helped strengthen campus wellness programs.WELLNESS ASSESSMENTS After Health Champions formed wellness committees, each wellness committee conducted high-level campus wellness assessments via the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Worksite Scorecard. Aside from the CDC assessment, most campuses also sent out an additional survey to individuals (n=1,416) to determine wellness initiatives of most interest to Penn Staters. ASSESSMENT RESULTS The CDC Worksite Health Scorecard assessed different facets of wellness including physical activity, nutrition, tobacco control, stress management, depression, diabetes, heart health, lactation and organizational support services. Through the CDC Worksite Health Scorecard, PRO Wellness discovered that Penn State campuses were scoring well below the national average for large organizations CDC WORKSITE SCORECARD OVERVIEW LARGE ORGANIZATION AVERAGE MEDIUM ORGANIZATION AVERAGE SMALL ORGANIZATION AVERAGE CAMPUS 1 CAMPUS 2 CAMPUS 3 CAMPUS 4 CAMPUS 5 CAMPUS 6 CAMPUS 7 CAMPUS 8 CAMPUS 9 CAMPUS 10 CAMPUS 11 LIONPULSE CAMPUS TOTALS LIONPULSE AVERAGE20406080100120140160180CAMPUS RESULTS Through the individual survey, campuses also discovered that: of Penn State students and 17.5% of employees are FOOD INSECURE .

These new trails, which were accessible to employees, students and the public, connected to the existing campus labyrinth - a serene spot on campus that was underutilized. Given that 53 percent of Berks' students and employees indicated that they were interested in mindfulness breaks (along with safe, accessible walking routes), the labyrinth was the perfect stopping place along the new path. With the creation of these new trails, the wellness committee implemented walking activities and challenges, such as a \"Berks Walk to the Moon\" challenge, which encouraged departments to increase their step counts for fun prizes. The campus-wide goal was to walk 477,714,000 steps (240k miles), which was the number of steps it takes to reach the moon. Furthermore, these paths were a valuable asset to those who participated in the daily \"WWAKs - Walk with A Kinesiologist\", which is run by the Kinesiology Department as part of their Exercise is Medicine global health initiative. Building upon the trail momentum, the Berks wellness committee envisions a future walking trail to connect with fellow campus, e.g. Penn State Health St. Joseph Medical Center. This connection would allow the two campuses to further collaborate and even compete with one another in wellness competitions. This campus story was highlighted in Penn State News on Aug. 13, 2019. of Berks' students and employees indicated interested in mindfulness breaks (along with safe, accessible walking routes). THE LABYRINTH serves as the perfect serene spot along the new path. 53% PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 9SUCCESS STORIES A recent Penn State LionPulse survey found that at least 30 percent of Penn state employees and students are unsure of where to go for wellness initiatives and additional information and another 20 percent turn to Google for help. As a result, LionPulse Hershey's goal is to create a greater wellness environment by addressing the issue of awareness and striving to educate employees and students on the existing wellness benefits, health resources and opportunities that Penn State Health offers. The passionate individuals behind the initiative were Health Champion and exercise physiologist, Deborah Tregea and the LionPulse Hershey wellness committee. Together, the team decided to use LionPulse funds to promote the existing Penn State Health wellness programs via three different efforts: Roadshow events - Delivering wellness information at various events on campus to display wellness opportunities to students, faculty and staff. Information stations - Providing interested departments with materials to create a wellness information station in breakrooms, hallways or offices. Bringing Wellness to You - Supplying interested departments with a choice of a healthy food basket or a one- hour stretch/yoga break with wellness resources. To date, the Bringing Wellness to You initiative has been well- received, with successfully offering 30 healthy snack baskets/activity breaks to more than 1,000 students and employees at both the main hospital campus and surrounding clinics and offices. The initiative efforts received many positive comments. One attendee shared that \"[The yoga stretch break] was awesome! I'm more flexible now. We should do this again.\" Others raved about the yoga instructor, \"It was AMAZING! Marisa was absolutely fantastic!\" Others in attendance were just happy for an opportunity to participate in a team-building activity. \"Our whole group loved it and now everyone is set and ready for our educational summit. Thanks again for offering this amazing experience!\" Seven information stations were established in different departments to help guide employees with where to find wellness information. The LionPulse Hershey wellness committee also attended three tabling events to promote current wellness offerings, impacting nearly 525 individuals. Most recently, the LionPulse Hershey team added trail signs along the Hershey campus' retaining pond. The trail signs highlight two trails, one that is half a mile long and the other which is about one mile. The wellness committee hopes that the signs will encourage employees to get active during breaks with a quick 10 or 25-minute walk. Be sure to check out the new signs that include a map of the walking routes to help students, employees and patients with a quick active break! This campus story was highlighted in Penn State News Hershey Edition on Aug. 8, 2019. 10 | PENN STATE LIONPULSE SUCCESS STORIES After surveying students, campus nurse and Health Champion, Jill Betton, found that many individuals felt overly anxious and stressed. To help people relax, the DuBois wellness committee implemented an eight-week evidenced-based series designed to provide information on wellness while also providing engaging activities and thought-provoking tasks. The ultimate goal was to educate students and employees on how to find and maintain balance in life. The Mind, Body and Spirit: Finding Balance in Life series ran from February - April 2019. Each week, students and employees had the opportunity to hear from a presenter on wellness topics, engage in fun activities and partake in a yoga session. As an incentive, participants were awarded giveaways, such as stress kits, water bottles, relationship bookmarks, journals and pens. The DuBois wellness committee found that individuals developed an understanding of wellness principles, as evidenced in weekly assessment results. Betton also found that by the end of the psychoeducational programs, the overall stress scores of 55 participants decreased by 62.5%; with the highest being a 23% decrease overall in perceived stress.Topics in this series included: Week 1: Dealing with Stress Week 2: Art Therapy Week 3: Healthy Decision-Making Week 4: Nutrition Week 5: Aroma Therapy Week 6: Vitamins & Supplements Week 7: The Importance of Sleep Week 8: Relationship Health overall STRESS scores Designed by peoplecreations / Freepikof consistent participants DECREASED STRESS LEVELS 62.5%PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 11SUCCESS STORIES After surveying the Harrisburg campus, Campus nurse and Health Champion, Andrea Mull and the Harrisburg wellness committee found that fitness and nutrition are among the top areas of interest. Mull decided to allocate a portion of LionPulse funds towards expanding the services offered at the campus's Center for Fitness and Wellness (CFW) because of the survey's findings. The CFW utilizes the Exercise is Medicine model to offer fitness assessments and physical activity consultations to students and employees, this model is also applied at University Park. The consultations include an initial assessment followed by recommendations for a specific exercise regimen to enhance an individual's overall health. Additionally, with the help of LionPulse, the CFW is able to offer new nutrition sessions to individuals upon request. Currently, more than 50 students and three staff members have participated in the new program. In addition to the great strides made at the CFW, the wellness committee has hosted four popular events featuring the Penn State LionPulse smoothie bike, impacting more than 2,275 participants! The smoothie bike, a stationary bicycle with a blender attached, allows participants to pedal for a delicious treat. Even the famous Penn State Nittany Lion took it for a spin during Harrisburg's annual wellness party in April! Nearly 700 attendees enjoyed the annual wellness party and they were able to partake in pet therapy, massages and fitness challenges, along with the smoothie bike. The successful event brought forth many positive remarks from participants stating \"Can't wait for next year's event!\" On June 24-25, Harrisburg campus also celebrated National Hydration Day (June 23) and Sunglasses Day (June 27). During their activities, 90 bottles of water were distributed for free to accompany information about the benefits of hydration and the importance of eye protection. The campus' success with implementing healthy initiatives has energized the Harrisburg wellness committee, according to their team they have \"no intention of stopping anytime soon!\" Future ideas include establishing yoga and Zumba classes, creating a walking club, making a stress-free zone as well as implementing fresh fruit days! This campus story was highlighted in Penn State News on Nov. 7, 2019. smoothie bike events at Harrisburg campus IMPACTING7 2,275 TOTAL PARTICIPANTS12 | PENN STATE LIONPULSE SUCCESS STORIES With assistance from Penn State LionPulse, Mont Alto has made significant strides in improving health and wellness initiatives for students, staff and faculty. Since January 2019, campus nurse and Health Champion, Danielle Werner, has worked with the campus wellness committee to implement nutrition and stress management initiatives. To date, these events have reached more than 100 members of the Mont Alto community. In March of 2019, the wellness committee promoted nutrition at a smoothie bike event. Werner utilized the smoothie bike, which can be borrowed through Penn State LionPulse, to show students and employees how fun partaking in an active lifestyle can be. The unique spin on a nutritious snack became a popular scene on campus, with more than 50 participants of all ages utilized the smoothie bike for a refreshing reward. Since receiving LionPulse funding in January 2019, Werner and the wellness committee also launched a popular \"Wellness Wednesday\" series. This series hosted events that encourage healthier environments and promote healthy living on the last Wednesday of each month. Werner's Wellness Wednesday kick- off day alone impacted over 40 students and employees! Werner also used funds to help over 100 individuals destress during one of the most stressful times of the semester: finals week. Finals week can be challenging, and for this reason, she offered a campus spa, yoga sessions, nature walks and time with a service dog to help others navigate the stressful times. The smoothie bike was back by popular demand to help students exercise their stress away and indulge with a nutritious smoothie.During the fall 2019 semester, the wellness committee also hosted a series of events and seminars, some of which included: Exercise is Medicine, Nutrition is Medicine, Friendship is Medicine and Sleep is Medicine. The smoothie bike returned two more times throughout the fall semester. This campus story was highlighted in Penn State Today and Penn State News Hershey Edition on May 2, 2019. PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 13SUCCESS STORIES Cindy Ebling, a passionate campus nurse, is the Health Champion for Schuylkill campus. In the fall of 2018, the Schuylkill wellness committee reviewed their campus wellness scorecard and discovered that nutrition was lacking. After realizing students' lack of knowledge regarding safe cooking temperatures, which sent many individuals to Ebling's office with symptoms of foodborne illnesses, hands-on food safety education became a wellness committee priority. Chef Penny, the Schuylkill campus chef, hosted a healthy Valentine's Day cooking demonstration for students and staff. As a participating campus in the Penn State LionPulse initiative, Ebling, Chef Penny and Assistant Director of Food Services, Linda Macduff, borrowed the new LionPulse mobile kitchen for a Valentine's Day demonstration. Their presentation showcased proper cooking techniques to educate attendees about delicious and healthy meals that students can easily recreate in a college apartment. The meal consisted of herbed chicken, roasted potatoes and a healthy dark chocolate dessert. In addition to enjoying delicious treats, attendees received a meat thermometer with instructions on how to properly calibrate and use it. The evening ended with prize drawings for gift cards to local grocery stores. According to Ebling, the wellness committee thinks the Valentine's Day cooking demonstration was the most rewarding event to date. She was very pleased to see how excited and engaged participants were during the presentation. Some of the positive compliments received include: \"Great presentation!\" and \"Chef Penny was awesome, she is a great cook!\" Ebling even had students stop by her office to let her know how much better their chicken tasted now that they knew how to correctly cook it! The campus wellness committee also implemented monthly nutrition events, such as a fruit of the month giveaway, which impacted over 150 students and employees as well as a brown bag lunch and power walk event that brought together over 35 individuals. Additionally, the new series of nutrition education classes has also received an excellent response, with one class bringing together 35 student-athletes and teaching them about the importance of healthy nutritional habits and exercise. More than 200 students, faculty and staff have participated in Penn State Schuylkill's LionPulse events overall! This campus story was highlighted in Penn State Today and Penn State News on April 4, 2019. 14 | PENN STATE LIONPULSE SUCCESS STORIES Scranton campus counselor and Health Champion, Katharine Stefanelli, and her wellness committee utilized LionPulse funds to provide weekly wellness classes to students, faculty and staff. After their first initial wellness committee meeting, Stefanelli saw an interest in classes that involved fitness, yoga, meditation and better sleep. Therefore, the wellness committee hired a Certified Yoga Instructor and Certified Meditation and Health Coach from the Kripalu Institute. Together, they implemented weekly yoga classes as well as an eight-week meditation program. The goal was to leave participants feeling more centered and focused while providing them with information on improved sleep and how to release restless thoughts. The wellness committee offered incentives to participants such as yoga mats and a sports bottle to allow individuals to destress at home. Although they started small, Stefanelli found that classes grew each week with an average of eight individuals per class. After each class, participants completed a survey, seeking information on what workshops and types of classes they would be interested in. In the fall of 2019, the wellness committee implemented a staff/faculty \"Passport\" to encourage preventive care actions, such as visits to primary care physicians, dentists and eye care providers, as well as living tobacco-free lives. In the future, Penn State Scranton hopes to borrow the smoothie bike and implement walking challenges and fitness classes such as dance, Zumba and self-defense.

Even though stress may be inevitable, it doesn't have to dominate your life. Addressing stress in a healthy way and having the right resources to help individuals cope is both essential and crucial to a person's well-being and academic success. Fortunately, through participation in the Penn State LionPulse initiative, Penn State Shenango now offers a stress-free zone for students and employees! Campus counselor and health champion, Tony Paglia, is leading this initiative in collaboration with the Shenango wellness committee. Paglia works as a campus counselor and understands the need for mental and physical relaxation. Students also echoed Paglia's thoughts about the necessity for a mental health initiative, with 66 percent of survey respondents expressing an interest in stress management. Additionally, students shared that a busy schedule prevents them from achieving a positive mental health, survey results ranked this factor as one of students' highest barriers. Therefore, Paglia and the Shenango wellness committee are focusing their efforts on increasing campus' mental well-being. The walk-in space now allows students and employees on- campus to partake in self-care throughout a busy day. The stress-free zone helps individuals release stress and gain a renewed sense of energy and clarity.

Campus Health Champions, Laura Welliver (Grants and Special Projects Officer) and Monica Rush (Director of Rehabilitation Services), wanted to not only promote current wellness offerings, but pilot new programs to gauge interest and impact. One of the new pilot programs included their InBody Challenge, a national program that allows companies to partner with a local fitness center to help create a program that inspires employees to improve their health. The initial cost of this program was $75; however, with the help of LionPulse funds, participants were able to participate for only $50. After signing up, participants worked with a local gym, Alliance Fitness, to help reach their individual goals. At the end of the eight-week program, a combined total of 109 pounds (97 pounds of fat) were lost amongst the 75 participants! The wellness committee selected the top three winners by percentage change from initial assessment to final assessment in the categories of body fat (loss) and lean body mass/muscle (gained). As noted by the first-place winner, \"I NEVER expected to be in the winner circle. The year membership to Alliance Fitness will certainly help me keep this commitment!\" Other participants commented \"Words can't express how much I needed this challenge to jump start my health journey. I am so grateful it was offered at just the right time for me! The group 101 classes were my absolute favorite and the variety of exercises was different each time, which I loved!\" The success of the InBody Challenge was spotlighted by The Reading Eagle, a local news outlet, which published \"Fitness challenge helps Penn State Health St. Joseph employees boost their physical and mental health\" on May 2, 2019. Additionally, the challenge was featured in Penn State Health's BeWell Summer 2019 edition newsletter, within both Penn State Today and Penn State Health News on Sept. 10, 2019 and in Penn State News on Sept. 4, 2019. In addition to the InBody Challenge, Monica and her team also implemented a family yoga series during the summer of 2019. Over 50 employees and their families took advantage of these free classes offered in the healing garden at Penn State Health St. Joseph. They also implemented the \"Roar into Fitness Wellness Challenge,\" in the fall of 2019. This program offered participants wellness screenings and education about the importance of working out and eating right. PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 17SUCCESS STORIES With its LionPulse partnership, Penn State University Park hosted wellness retreats. Linda LaSalle and Erin Raupers, Health Promotion and Wellness employees and Health Champions, lead this initiative with the University Park wellness committee. A national survey by the American College Health Association found that nearly 31 percent of University Park students indicated that stress has affected their academic performance (i.e. received a lower grade on an exam or course, received an incomplete or dropped out of a course, or experienced disruption in a thesis, research or practicum work). Further, more than 86 percent of students reported feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities. Through this data, it was clear that students experience high levels of stress and would most likely benefit from programming initiatives that teach stress management strategies. With the help of LionPulse, the University Park Wellness Committee led half-day wellness retreats. These aligned perfectly with the Health Promotion and Wellness (HPW)'s mission to improve the academic success of students by enhancing health behaviors and decreasing the overall stress and anxiety of students. The purpose of the retreats was to help students develop stress management skills, by: increasing knowledge about stress reduction strategies; increasing self-efficacy to practice stress reduction strategies; and decreasing stress levels. The first wellness retreat kicked- off in January 2019 and continued monthly throughout the spring semester, impacting a total of 50 individuals. Sessions included information on meditation, yoga, art, mindfulness and intuitive eating. Students enjoyed the retreats, \"Once they get to the program and dive in, they walk away satisfied with [the] knowledge to help them cope with stress,\" said Raupers. Additionally, students themselves reported \"It was relaxing and I learned a lot about myself and what I can do to control my stressors throughout the day\" as well as \"It really helped me to relieve a lot of built-up stress that I had coming into this retreat.\" In the end, there was a 100 percent satisfaction rate, with an overall 10 percent reduction of perceived stress and a 10 percent increase in general self-efficacy amongst the attendees. This campus story was highlighted in Penn State News and Penn State News Hershey Edition on July 11, 2019. 18 | PENN STATE LIONPULSE SUCCESS STORIES Since the beginning of their LionPulse partnership, Penn State Wilkes-Barre has prioritized the health and wellness of campus members. Suzanne Attanasio, campus nurse and LionPulse Health Champion, lead this initiative with the Wilkes-Barre campus wellness committee. In March 2019, Wilkes-Barre hosted a LionPulse wellness challenge, where 41 participants competed to see who could walk the farthest and if collectively they could walk the entire span of a virtual version of Route 66. To help walkers keep track of their steps, the LionPulse wellness committee purchased pedometers and asked walkers to record their steps at the end of each week. The wellness committee gave participants a map and information about various sites that they would see while virtually walking the iconic route. For four weeks, fourteen teams of students, faculty and staff competed. Attanasio stated, \"We had some very active walkers and hikers that walked a significantly higher number of miles than perhaps an 'average' person.\" The winning team walked 799 miles in four weeks! Overall, participants walked a total of 4,738 miles, which is over two lengths of the Appalachian Trail! After the competition, top walkers gathered for a celebratory lunch where each person received gift cards to local sporting goods stores. Attanasio stated, \"[In the future,] we would like to compete against another Penn State Campus.\" In addition to the walking challenge, 51 students, faculty and staff attended a free healthy breakfast, which consisted of homemade oatmeal with toppings and fresh fruit. Attendees learned about the importance of a healthy breakfast and the MyPlate eating method. LionPulse wellness events have helped to create a sense of camaraderie between students, faculty and staff. After the healthy breakfast event, one student said, \"Not only did I have a good breakfast, but I met someone new and learned something.\" On April 1, 2019, the wellness committee hosted a \"Focus on Fruit\" day in the student commons. The event's goal was to help encourage employees and students to continue making healthier decisions. During the healthy food awareness event, three different varieties of apples along with bananas, oranges and mangos were distributed to 54 individuals!

In addition to expanding to Penn State Health sites, it is critical for the University to consider expanding future efforts to include all campuses, which is necessary to ensure a consistent platform of health across the commonwealth, enhance recruitment and retention and support the growth of the University. Additionally, this initiative will allow Health Champions to continue participating in an initiative that spans across the University, creating unity across campuses. Specifically, based on our work over the past year, future funds would best be allocated to: The facilitation of the network of Health Champions, where wellness best-practices are shared across the network Maintenance and continual promotion of the LionPulse website, the one-stop-shop for wellness happenings across Penn State Expansion of the program to make it available to all Penn State University campuses PENN STATE LIONPULSE | 23Penn State PRO Wellness would like to thank the following organizations and individuals for making this project possible: The Pennsylvania University Enhancing Health Strategic Planning Committee LionPulse Campus Health Champions Lisa Weaver, Education Program Associate, Penn State Berks Deborah Tregea, Exercise Physiologist, Penn State College of Medicine Jill Betton, Coordinator of Health Services and Nurse, Penn State DuBois Andrea Mull, Associate Director and Nurse, Penn State Harrisburg Danielle Werner, Nurse, Penn State Mont Alto Cynthia Ebling, Nurse, Penn State Schuylkill Katherine Stefanelli, Counselor, Penn State Scranton Tony Paglia, Counselor and Disability Coordinator, Penn State Shenango Laura Welliver, Grants and Special Projects Officer, Penn State Health St. Joseph Monica Rush, Director of Rehabilitation Services, Penn State Health St. Joseph Linda LaSalle, Director of Health Promotion and Wellness, University Park Erin Raupers, Assistant Director of Health Promotion and Wellness, University Park Suzanne Attanasio, Nurse, Penn State Wilkes-Barre The project described was supported (or supported in part) by Penn State Clinical & Translational Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University CTSA, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through Grant UL1 TR000127 and UL1 TR002014.
