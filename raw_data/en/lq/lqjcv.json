Those sneaky germs have one job, and they are fighting hard to get it done. Fight harder with these pro-tips from one of our wellness specialists, Joel Hall. Cold Prevention Optimize D3 levels (2,000-4,000 IU) - Our genetic code contains approximately 3,000 genes and Vitamin D affects around 3,000! Don't let the winter blues put you at risk of a Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin C 1,000 mgs daily - This notorious cold combatant gives your body the antioxidant boost it needs to fight off free radicals and bacteria. Minimize Refined Sugar intake - Glucose and Vitamin C compete with each other in the human body, therefore, more sugar means less Vitamin C. Adequate Rest - Need an excuse to take a nap? Well, here it is. Poor sleep lowers T-cells, which are a number one line of defense against viruses. Adults should aim for at least 7 hours, while toddlers and teens need anywhere from 8-10 hours. Regular Exercise - We aren't necessarily talking about a boot camp class, though that wouldn't hurt! Moderate intensity is sufficient enough to increase white blood cell production, which lowers your risk of infection. A 30 min jaunt on your lunch break is a great place to start! Cleanliness is Next to Coldlessness Practice good cold season hygiene! - Wash your hands with hot water for at least 20 seconds, before and after eating (and all of the other obvious times). - Cough or sneeze into your sleeve, not your hands. - If you're sick, avoid contact with people, especially the elderly and infants. You may want to stay home during the days you are coughing and sneezing most. - Wear a mask if you go to the doctor. We need our healthcare providers to stay healthy. - If you're not sick, avoid contact with those who are and feel free to offer them an extra shirt to sneeze into. - Clean frequently touched surfaces often. Feel the sniffles coming on? One dose of Vitamin D3 25,000 IU, followed by 2,000-4,000 daily thereafter. - An initial mega-dose of Vitamin D3 could slash the lifespan of your nasty virus in half! 2,000 mgs of Vitamin C in divided doses (500-1000 mg each) - Fear you'll forget to take your vitamins? Hit the grocery store for some dark leafy greens, red peppers, kiwi, broccoli, papaya or berries. Start your day with a smoothie, and let the blender do the work! Andrographis 300-600 mg, 2-3x a day - Popular in Traditional Chinese Medicine, this herb is proving to be effective at knocking out your cold when symptoms first hit. Native to India and Sri Lanka, the flowers and leaves of this plant can stimulate the immune system when taken for the first 3-5 days of symptoms.
