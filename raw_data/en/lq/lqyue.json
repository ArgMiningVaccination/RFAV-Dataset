The mean\u00b1standard deviation of the total number, weights and production rates of eggs, New Castle's disease serum were calculated for each group and compared using a Duncan Multiple Comparison test. A significant difference was established as p<0.05 and a very significant difference was p<0.01. The egg numbers and production rate, serum antibody titers for NDV and SOD levels were significantly or very significantly higher and the MDA levels significantly lower in Groups 1-3 compared to Group 4 (Control group). Group 1 (0.5% CHM) had best overall effect on egg production and Group 3 (2% CHM) had best effect on vaccine response. The addition of CHM to the feed had significant positive effects on egg production, immune function and oxidative stress indicators and may be an effective replacement for conventional drugs in poultry production Did you previously purchase this document?
