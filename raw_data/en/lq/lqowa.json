In September 20 15, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poli omyelitis Eradication (GCC) declared that worldwide eradication of wild type 2 poliovirus (WPV2) had be en achieved. However, continued use of live attenua ted Sabin type 2 poliovirus contained in the trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) posed an ongoing risk of in a globally coordinated move in Apr il/May 2016, all 155 countries and territories usin g tOPV switched to the bivalent oral polio vaccine (b OPV) for routine immunization and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). Surveillance was im proved to detect any occurrence of type 2 polioviru s (wild, vaccine-derived or Sabin) in any human or en vironmental sample. At present, any case or isolate of vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus (VDPV2) is consid ered a potential global public health threat that r equires a rapid, coordinated response involving the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and national an d subnational public health agencies. This response may include rapid mass vaccination wi th monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2). However, use of this vaccine also reintroduces live attenuated type 2 poliovirus into populations and the environment, and therefore poses a risk of emergenc e of a new VDPV2. Thus, where the use of mOPV2 is essential to stop a type 2 poliovirus outbreak, and in order to mitiga te the risk of emergence of VDPV2, the strictest vaccine m anagement protocols must be enforced. The geographical extent of the vaccination campaign wil l be confined to defined outbreak zones. The criteria for mOPV2 use following a detection of type 2 poliovirus are described in the GPEI's Stan dard Operating Procedures (SOP) for responding to a poli ovirus event and outbreak 1, in particular part two. Before the EOMG Advisory Group on mOPV2 provision ( the Advisory Group) recommends the use of mOPV2, the following criteria must be met: positive laboratory result from an accredited Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) laboratory; a risk assess ment of further poliovirus transmission, and the proposed immunization response plan. Ultimately, th e decision to release mOPV2 from global or national stocks is under the authority of the WHO Director-G eneral. The purpose of this guidance note is to outline the best practice for (1) mOPV2 management in the field, during and betwe en SIA rounds, and (2) validating removal of residual mOPV2 stocks fro m all subnational levels for safe storage centrally . Inactivation and safe disposal of mOPV2 once recomm ended by the Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) team will take place at all levels of the co untry health of the mOPV2 vaccine mOPV2 has the same operational characteristics as bOPV 2: WHO-prequalified Licensed by the national regulatory authority (NRA) in the producing country. Administered orally - 1 dose = 2 drops Presented in 20-dose vials with a vaccine vial moni tor (VVM) on the label. Requires storage volume of 0.48 cm 3 per dose, including secondary packaging containing 100 vials of 20 doses each. Keep at -20 Celsius or between 2 and 8 Celsius, i f freezer is not available. Heat sensitive - always check the VVM has not reach ed the discard point before using the vaccine 2. Protocol for release of mOPV2 and its use in countr ies The mOPV2 vaccine used in response to an event or o utbreak is released from the global stock pile of mOPV2 under a strict protocol and supplied to countries by the UNICEF Supply Div ision only upon release authorization from the WHO Director-General through the Advisory Group on mOPV2 provision. Self-producing countries with a national stock of mOPV2 must also obtain authorization from the WHO Director-General before they can use this vaccine i n the target population. Countries that require mOPV2 vaccine in response to a confirmed event or an outbreak must receive approval by the Advisory Group following a review o f their response plan and vaccine requirements. An event is described as detection of poliovirus wi th no evidence of transmission; an outbreak has occ urred when there is evidence of transmission. An event co uld be reclassified as an outbreak once there is evidence of transmission. This is further described in the document SOP: Responding to a poliovirus event and outbreak, Part 1: General SOPs 3. The Advisory Group will take into account the quali ty of any previous campaigns, vaccine stock balance in the country and the country immunization plan, whic h includes a risk analysis, to endorse further deli very of mOPV2. Approval of the WHO Director-General is r equired only once for the response, but approval of the Advisory Group is required for each subsequent delivery of mOPV2. Countries that have residual mOPV2 supplies after a n outbreak or an event response will require authorization from the Advisory Group if they under take any new, additional or expanded activities, or if they target any populations or regions outside the scope of their original response plan. Vaccine request form for mOPV2 vaccine is available on GPEI mOPV2 vial 5 3. Handling of mOPV2 in response to a type 2 polioviru s event or outbreak Stringent monitoring of the storage, distribution, usage and destruction of mOPV2 is critical for ensu ring that the vaccine is not mixed up with or mistaken f or another vaccine (or vaccines) and that no vials are left within the country once the SIA rounds are complete d and the Outbreak Response Assessment team (OBRA ) recommends mOPV2 destruction. Key considerations in managing the deployment of mOPV2 and monitoring its usage are outlined below. Managing deployment of mOPV2 in a country When a VDPV2 event or outbreak is notified, there a re no mOPV2 stocks in countries. In most cases, immunization response with mOPV2 must start within 2 weeks following laboratory confirmation of type 2 poliovirus. Complete the vaccine arrival report (VAR) and provide to the UNICEF country office wit hin 24 hours of the arrival of the vaccine consignment (within 7 2 hours for other vaccines). Label the vaccine clearly to be easily identifiable. Store and transport separately from other vaccines in the cold chain. Deploy mOPV2 only to the outbreak-affected areas per the immunizatio n plan and the terms and conditions in the mOPV2 request form. Supply mOPV2 to outbreak zones in separate, clearly identified cold chain containers prepared with frozen icepacks . At the end of each SIA round, return all open (fully or partially used) and unopened vials to the health facility . o Promptly inactivate and safely destroy all open vials (fully or partially used) at the health facility. If this cannot be done at the heal th facility, send open vials to the district level. See Annex 1 guidance notes for the inactivat ion and safe destruction of mOPV2. o Safely store all unopened vials at the health facility if the cold chain is reliable, or return for storage to the district-level facility where th e cold chain is reliable. At the end of the last SIA round, return all unopened vials of mOPV2 to the central-level facility , and ensure they are safely stored, labelled and ide ntified, until the MOH, in line with the advice from the OBRA team, instructs further use or destru ction. If destruction is recommended, inactivate and safely dispose of all unopened vacci ne vials in order to return to zero stock throughout the cold chain. Provide full documentation of the number of mOPV2 vials used , including the final stock balance, to the EPI/immunization programme for monitoring pu rposes. Ensure final validation of mOPV2 removal from the c ountry is endorsed by the body entrusted with that responsibility. 6 4. Important deadlines for the collection and reportin g of mOPV2 Listed below are timelines for the collection and r eporting of mOPV2 stocks and stock balances followi ng completion of an SIA round. Figure 2: Timelines for the collection and reportin g of mOPV2 stocks and stock balances following completion of an SIA round 5. Monitoring of mOPV2 distribution Most countries have an established vaccine distribu tion and stock monitoring system involving batch ca rds and vaccine stock recording books. However, because of the traceability of mOPV2 vials and their speci fic handling, destruction and disposal requirements, it is important to establish a recording/reporting sy stem similar to that used for the switch from tOPV to bO PV. This can facilitate and ensure accurate account ability of the mOPV2 vials. Figure 3 depicts the cold chain infrastructure with the flow of unopened and opened (partially or full y used) vials from the national level down to subnational v accine stores. It also illustrates the flow of retu rned vials back to the supply chain between SIA rounds and at the end of the outbreak response. Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7 Within 2 days , quantities of all remaining vaccine vials, both used (opened) and unused (unopened), must be reported to the district-level facility. Within 5 days , unopened vials must be retrieved from the health facility or district-level cold store (depending on cold chain reliability) Within 1 week , the head of the district-level cold store must report mOPV2 stock levels to the national EPI manager. Supplies to the district for the next mOPV2 SIA round must be adjusted against these available stocks. Following completion of all SIA rounds, countries m ust report their remaining mOPV2 stocks to the WHO and UNICEF within a maximum of 2 weeks. Once an OBRA team recommends the destruction of mOP V2 , all unopened vials of mOPV2 will be inactivated and safely dispo sed in order to return to zero stock of mOPV2 throughout the cold chain. OBRA 7 Figure 3: Supply and cold chain infrastructure for the monitoring of mOPV2 distribution A tracking system must be put in place to: 1. manage deployment of mOPV2 to the outbreak-affected area; 2. ensure that all vials of mOPV2 from the central sto re are properly distributed through the supply chain to the immunization points; 3. monitor utilization patterns and stock balances at each level; 4. ensure that all opened (fully or partially used) vi als are returned from immunization sites to health facilities or the district level; 5. ensure that all opened vials are inactivated and sa fely destroyed in compliance with national regulations for medical waste management 6. monitor mOPV2 stock at regional and national level pending recommendation from the OBRA team on further strategic use and destruction 7. validate the removal of all mOPV2 vials from the co ld chain following completion of all SIA rounds and recommendation from an OBRA to destroy remainin g unopened mOPV2 vials 8 6. Handling of mOPV2 from national stores to vaccinati on sites Every country has a set of procedures to be followe d when importing and distributing a vaccine. The following factors are critical for proper handling of mOPV2 across the supply chain, from its arrival to its administration: clear labelling and marking of vaccine containers a t each level of the cold chain; separate storage/packaging of mOPV2 from other vacc ines (); and clear reporting and tracking, at each level, of all doses and vials used, with unopened and partially used vials returned to district stores af ter each SIA round and all unopened vials returned to the central store after completing all SIA rounds. National vaccine store The customs authority of the receiving country must have the authorization to clear the vaccine for import and use in the outbreak-affected areas w ithin the country. The immunization programme should ensure there is adequate provision for any custom fees required for clearance of the vaccine. The NRA or designated authority must check the cons ignment for compliance with vaccine specifications. The national EPI manager or designated authority mu st complete the vaccine arrival report (VAR) and submit it the UNICEF country office withi n 24 hours. The national cold chain officer (or designated staf f) is responsible for ensuring the transfer of the vaccine to the central (or regional, if applica ble) storage facility. Prior to the arrival of the vaccine consignment in the receiving country, the national cold chain officer responsible should ensure there is enough s torage space 4. The boxes of mOPV2 must be separated and clearly ma rked using labels, coloured scotch tape or markers to avoid any confusion and ensure they a re not mistaken for other vaccines in the cold/freezer room. Labelling must be repeated at every step within the cold chain system when there is a change in packaging, from the insulated containers used fo r transport to the secondary packaging (boxes of 100 vials), and so on. Upon arrival of each vaccine consignment, specific details such as the quantity, batch number, and so on, are recorded as required in the vaccine stock book. For mOPV2, some of these data should also be recorded in a separate form. In Annex 2 , a sample intermediate reporting form (named Form A ) is provided for reporting to EPI manager and nation al polio partners, UNICEF and WHO after completion of each SIA round. The for m can be used at each level: central, regional/district and the health facility. The national cold chain manager or staff responsibl e should have the distribution plan that was provided along with the vaccine request form; prior to dispatch of mOPV2, they must inform the provincial/district cold chain responsible of t he space requirements and the expected arrival date. When all SIA rounds have been completed, all opened and unopened vials of mOPV2 must be retrieved. Once the OBRA team recommends the destru ction of mOPV2, the unopened vials will be inactivated and safely destroyed at the nat ional level as per the national regulations for medical waste disposal. See Annex 1 for guidance on mOPV2 destruction procedures. The national cold chain responsible should report on va ccine utilization and remaining stock of unopened mOPV2 vials to the national EPI manager, w ho in turn should report to the WHO and UNICEF country offices within a maximum of 2 weeks following the last SIA round. 4 The vaccine is packed in insulated containers, eac h containing 1600 vials of 20 doses (32 000 doses i n total). The size of each insulated container is 51 cm x 39 cm x 62 cm. If th e insulated containers are stored in the cold room, the space requirement must be calculated with a volume of 3.85 cm 3 per dose (instead of 0,48 cm 3). 9 Subnational vaccine stores (regional and district) At the subnational level, the vaccines should be un packed from insulated containers and the vaccine carton 5 placed preferably in a cold/freezer room (if avail able) or in a dedicated refrigerator. The vaccine boxes must be clearly lab elled, for example: ' mOPV2 FOR POLIO OUTBREAK ONLY' . If separate dedicated cold chain equipment is ava ilable, a similar notice should be placed on the refrigerator door, and addi tional steps may be taken to make the mOPV2 stocks easily identifiable and thus minimize the risk of confusion. In all cases, the vaccine and the box that contains the vaccine vials must be clearly and visibly marked as 'mOPV2 FOR POLIO OUTBREAK ONLY' . The quantity of mOPV2 and all other required inform ation about the vaccine should be recorded in the vaccine stock book at regional and district levels, including the date when the vaccines were dispatched and received, the quantiti es dispatched and received, and the location or source that the vaccines were dispatche d from. Form A, provided in Annex 2, can be used to report to the upper level on vaccine stocks and utilization. The district/regional stores should retrieve all mO PV2 vials within 5 days of completion of each SIA round, and report to the national level within 7 days. At the end of all SIA rounds, the subnational store s - at the provincial and district levels - should report to the central level within 7 days. Health facility (vaccination site) Because the vaccine is taken out of the manufacture r's packaging, there is a greater risk of inadvertently administering mOPV2 . The person responsible for administering the vacci ne must prepare the containers or plastic bags to keep all mOPV2 vials together in the refrigerator with a label on the box or a plastic bag clearly bearing the marking 'mOPV2 FOR POLIO OUTBREAK ONLY'. The person preparing the vaccine carrier should rec ord for each vaccinator the number of vials provided, the SIA round and the date. The vaccinato rs must return all unopened vials as well as fully or partially used vials to the health facilit y at the end of each day. The number of all opened vials (partially or fully used) and the remaining stock balance (unopened vials) should be reported to the district level within 2 days following completion of each SIA round. The proposed Form A in Annex 2 , which is commonly used for each level of the cold chain infrastructure, could be used to report to the district on the number of vials used and in stock. After each SIA round, the remaining opened vials (p artially or fully used) of mOPV2 must be taken out of the cold chain, inactivated and secure ly destroyed at the health-facility level in accordance with the guidelines issued for vaccine d estruction and disposal in Annex 1. If the health facilities do not have the capacity to inact ivate and safely destroy partially and fully used mOPV2 vials, the vials should be sent to the distri ct level. The reverse cold chain The balance of unused vials with mOPV2 may be used for mop up activities in poorly covered areas, or f or another SIA. It is therefore critical to maintain t he highest quality. Storage and transport of mOPV2 through the reverse cold chain should meet the same standards applied t o the distribution of tOPV or bOPV. Because mOPV2 is not damaged by repeated freezing a nd thawing, storage in a freezer will extend its li fe time. 5 To estimate the storage space at this level, a vol ume of 0.48 cm per dose will be used. For example, 10 000 vials will represent a volume of 96 000 cm 3 or 100 litres (10 000 vials x 20 doses each x 0.48 cm 3 per dose = 96 000 cm 3 or 96 litres). 10 Upon return of the vaccine at central level, the st ore manager needs to check the vials: VVM status; Are the labels still readable; Any sign of damage that may have compromised the qu ality of the vaccine inside. Any vial not meeting the standards should be dispos ed of after correction of the stock records. Vaccine utilization record (VUR) 6: Vaccine utilization in the SIA rounds should be re corded rigorously. SIA reports from all levels of service delivery and the supply chain should include the number of vaccine doses used as well as the number of children immunized. T his will enable the national programme to compile t he vaccine utilization record (VUR) as per the standar d operating procedures for vaccine stock management , in accordance with the usual reporting protocols for a ll vaccines used in any polio SIA and also using st andard reporting tools. The flow of reporting and the timelines are illustr ated in figure 4. Figure 4: mOPV2 vaccine utilisation and stock repor ting timelines and validation of mOPV2 removal To minimize the risk of mOPV2 remaining in the cold chain, the absence of mOPV2 must be validated. Thi s does not include validation of mOPV2 inactivation o r destruction, nor does it include validation of th e presence of mOPV2 or type 2 poliovirus in laborator ies or manufacturing facilities. Many elements of the validation process, such as tr aining, microplanning, selection of staff, and so o n, are similar to the monitoring process undertaken during the switch from tOPV to bOPV 7, or the independent monitoring process undertaken during SIA rounds. Th is chapter therefore does not provide an exhaustive overview of the validation process, but instead foc uses on those operational elements that are specifi c to mOPV2 removal after a response campaign. 7.1. The main steps The key steps of the validation strategy are to: 1) nominate the National Certification Committee, or a ny other independent national body, to validate the absence of mOPV2 stocks following the response campaigns; 2) develop a national plan with details on where and w hen to monitor, what to do in case mOPV2 is found, and so on; 3) select and train independent monitors; 4) conduct site visits at all cold chain stores, including private stores, from the national to the regional and district levels, and selected service delivery points (health facilities) below the district area; 5) take corrective action to remove any mOPV2 stocks f ound in the cold chain and mark these stocks for destruction; and 6) obtain validation, from the National Certification Committee or the nominated independent national body, of the absence of mOPV2 stocks based on the reports from the monitors. Because of the urgent need for the timely removal, inactivation and destruction of mOPV2, the outbreak OBRAs 8 will in most cases not follow the same timeframe. The first OBRA has the responsibility to formulate clear recommendations as to what should happen with the balance of mOPV2 after the last planned round. Each successive OBRA refreshes the recommendations on basis of an assessment of the current situation. This may include the recommendation, not to wait u ntil close of outbreak for the destruction of the mOPV2b alance . . The figure above outlines the various deadlines for vaccine removal, inactivation, destruction and dis posal. 7 http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyeli tis/endgame_objective2/oral_polio_vaccine/monitorin g/en/ 8 The first OBRA takes place 3 months after the firs t case of VDPV2. 12 7.2. Identification of facilities for monitoring Although it is expected that larger quantities of m OPV2 will be present at national, regional and dist rict- level stores after a response campaign, the risk of inadvertently using mOPV2 is higher at the health- centre level. This is why a specified percentage of servic e points need to be checked. The sampling method used is a combination of random and risk-based purposive sampling, similar to the sampling method that was used during the switch fro m tOPV to bOPV. The total number of service points to be visited sh ould be at least 25% of the service points randomly selected in each district, plus districts with one or more specific risk factors, as mentioned below. The steps of the sampling process are as follows (s ee Annex 3 for a summary of the whole process): 1. Preparation a. Generate a line-list of national, regional and dist rict cold chain stores. In the outbreak area, monitors should visit all of these stores. b. Generate a line-list of the service points used for distribution of mOPV2 to the vaccination teams during the campaign. These may be private cli nics, regular health centres with an active cold chain or temporary distribution points supplied with the vaccine in a cold box. c. Have the following data available: independent moni toring data of previous SIA rounds, routine immunization data, stock management reports from previous SIA rounds, VDPV2 history, and so on. d. Depending of the role of the private sector, these facilities should be informed and visited. 2. Sampling a. Within the outbreak area , select all district and regional vaccine stores. b. At the regional level , determine which districts are at risk of having m OPV2 stocks remaining, using one or more of the risk factors li sted below. In these districts, all service points should be visited: i. 15% of children missed during the previous SIA rou nd; ii. DPT3 (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine coverag e <85%; iii. absent or incomplete stock reports during previous immunization rounds; iv. a history of non-compliance with immunization progr amme policies; v. management issues (low scores on the latest vaccine management assessment); vi. variable and unpredictable access due to security i ssues; and vii. other high-risk characteristics. c. For all other districts, select all service points with any of the risk characteristics listed above, and randomly select additional service point s to reach a total of 25% of facilities to be visited. The final number of facilities sampled should compr ise all regional and district vaccine stores, all s ervice points in high-risk districts, all service points a t risk in lower-risk districts, and 25% of randomly selected service points in remaining districts. 13 7.3. Supervision There should be roughly one supervisor for five urb an monitors and one for three rural monitors. Their tasks consist of: Support the selection and training of the monitors; Facilitate the work of the monitors for transport, availability of tools (paper, pens, etc.) Selection of facilities to be visited; Summarize monitor's reports and transmit them to hi gher levels; Ensure the need for sweep operations are correctly communicated with the authorities in the areas concerned. 7.4. Determining the number of monitors and supervi sors The only task of the monitors should be to verify t he absence of mOPV2 in the places they visit. Altho ugh there can be exceptions, a reasonable workload of a monitor is eight visits per day in an urban settin g and five in a rural setting. The number of monitors should be calculated as foll ows: Total monitors = urban monitors + rural monitors Urban monitors = %urban pop x N nd nsp urban Rural monitors = %rural pop x N nd nsp rural N = number of sites to be visited %urban or rural pop = Proportion of urban or rural population nd = number of monitoring days nsp urban or rural = number of service points per day in a urban or r ural area Reminder: Supervisors should plan for - one supervisor per five monitors in urban setting s - one supervisor per three monitors in rural settin gs. 7.5. Implementation As illustrated in figure 5, the field work or data collection phase of the validation process should f ollow certain procedures to minimize the risk of missing mOPV2 vials. The selected monitors must commence their work imme diately after the day the service points send the remaining unopened vials to the designated medical waste disposal sites. 14 At the end of the first phase, there are three poss ibilities: 1. No monitors report having found partially used or u nused vials. The report is sent to the appropriate authorities at the central level. 2. One of the monitors reports having found mOPV2 in p artially used or unused vials in one district. This has the following consequences: a. the entire district should be swept 9, meaning that all service points must be visited; and b. other districts should check an additional 10% of s ervice points. If additional mOPV2 vials are detected anywhere in the region, the entire region must be swept. 3. Feedback from monitors indicates the presence of le ftover mOPV2 vials in several districts. In this ca se, the whole region should be swept, including distric t stores as well as service points. Figure 5: Decision making flowchart for mOPV2 vacci ne monitors * Intensified monitoring of all other health facili ties in the district with involvement of staff from the regional level or higher. 9 A sweep operation, targeting all facilities in an area, should be done under the guidance of the moni tors, but with the support of the regular health staff. Sweep the region Report and validate Report and validate Sweep* the district and check another 25% of the sample size in the other districts of the same region Sweep the region Report and validate Report and valid ate What: presence of fully or partially filled mOPV2 vials. When: After the last day of recovering mOPV2 from pereph ery to agreed storage points, Where: central, regional and district levels all vaccine stores, as well as high risk districts and 25% of the other districts. No mOPV2 found No mOPV2 found No mOPV2 found No mOPV2 found mOPV2 found in one district in a region mOPV2 found in more than one district in a region. mOPV2 found 15 7.6. The timeline The timeline in figure 6 indicates the various phas es of field work during the validation process, rat her than the exact cut-off points, which the Ministry of Hea lth (MOH) will share in due course . The timeline starts after submission of form A, 15 days after the last SIA round. Figure 6: Proposed timeline for field work phases d uring the mOPV2 removal validation process 7.7. The validation forms Forms for monitoring mOPV2 removal are provided in Annex 4. 1. Form 1 is used to collect data at the lowest level of the cold chain: the service points (health centres and outreach sites with temporary storage). It must be completed by the validation monitor on-site. 2. Form 2 is intended for subregional, regional and central- level stores. Each store will aggregate data from the lower level or structure. Day 1 after SIA Districts have retrieved mOPV from service points and private sector Monitors start visiting service points Day 5 Evaluation 1st phase and decision on next steps Day 7 2nd verification phase and sweep Day 10 Monitors submit final report to the MOH Day 14 16 Annex 1: Safe destruction and disposal of mOPV2 mOPV2 destruction and disposal guidelines are adapt ed from the guidelines used for tOPV disposal in conjunction with the global switch from tOPV to bOP V. Destruction of mOPV2 In the event that mOPV2 is deployed in a country, t hese guidelines are to be followed for the destruct ion and subsequent disposal of used and partially used mOPV2 vials between SIA rounds, and for the destruction and subsequent disposal of used, partia lly used and unopened mOPV2 vials after the final S IA round. Several options for the inactivation and destructio n of residual mOPV2 stocks are described below. Countries should adapt these guidelines according t o their medical waste disposal and containment regulations. Basic principles The VDPV2 event or outbreak response plan should in clude a detailed mOPV2 collection and destruction plan for the country, both between SIA rounds and after the final SIA round. Destruction of mOPV2 should be in accordance with n ational regulations. If the national regulations do not provide clear guidance, refer to the approac hes for mOPV2 destruction discussed below. mOPV2 should be inactivated prior to destruction. T he following are the recommended methods for inactivation, destruction and subsequent dispos al of mOPV2: Inactivation by autoclaving, boiling, chemical inac tivation, encapsulation or incineration Destruction and disposal by transporting to the was te facility or burying. Steps for destruction The inactivation and destruction of mOPV2 can be su mmarized as follows: Step 1: Evaluate the total volume of mOPV2 vials to be destroyed. Step 2: Determine the composition of the mOPV2 vial s to be destroyed. Step 3: Choose an appropriate method to inactivate mOPV2. Step 4: Destroy and dispose of the inactivated mOPV 2 vials. Step 1: Assess the total volume of mOPV2 vials to b e destroyed Estimating volume of mOPV2 vials to be destroyed (estimates should be validate estimates by physical stock count): /checkbld If the number of mOPV2 vials for litres) = (mOPV2 v ials*10) / 1000 /checkbld If only target population known: mOPV2 volume for litres)=(target po pulation*wastage rounds*0.5)/1000 Assumptions: mOPV2 will be supplied in 20-dose vial s and the cold-chain storage space is 0.48 cm per dose when the vials are in box of 100 vials 17 Step 2: Determine the composition of the mOPV2 via ls to be destroyed At present, WHO-prequalified mOPV2 supplied by UNIC EF will be in glass vials. Ideally, a temperature of >1100 \u00b0C is needed for sa fe destruction of glass vials containing mOPV2 (for example, using rotary-kiln incinerators and industrial furnaces). Step 3: Choose an appropriate method to inactivate mOPV2 mOPV2 can be inactivated by autoclaving, boiling, c hemical inactivation, encapsulation or incineration of the mOPV2 waste. Each method of inactivation is des cribed below, with its pros and cons. The country a nd context will determine which method is used at each level. Methods for inactivation of mOPV2 , and their associated pros and cons: /head2right Autoclaving: Autoclaving uses high-temperature steam. It is the most environmentally friendly method. Unopened glass vials full of liquid should be loosened before autoclaving to avoid rupture, unless the autoclave has an integrated shredder. Ho wever, glass vials that contain little liquid do not need to be opened. After autoclaving, vials wil l be sterile but must still be destroyed in accordance with national or local waste management guidelines for municipal waste. /head2right Boiling: Boiling involves immersing vials in boiling water for approximately 30 minutes, which destroys pathogenic microorganisms. Glass vials can be safely boiled, and do not need to be opened prior to boiling. After boiling, the inactiv ated vials should be destroyed in accordance with national or local waste management guidelines. /head2right Chemical inactivation: Chemical inactivation of mOPV2 involves opening an d immersing mOPV2 vials in 0.5% chlorine solution for at least 30 min utes. The solution should be nine parts clear water to one part household bleach. Immersing 20 vials in 4 litres of solution will safely inactivate mOPV2. After this treatment, vials and leftover chlorine s olution must both be destroyed in accordance with national or local waste management guidelines. /head2right Incineration (inactivation and destruction): Incineration should be carried out at a temperatur e of 1100 \u00b0C for safe destruction of glass vials contai ning mOPV2 (for example, using rotary-kiln incinerators and industrial furnaces). o It is important to note that the temperatures reach ed in the primary waste chamber of the incinerator can vary. For instance, low-temperature burning (<800 \u00b0C) using single-chamber cement or brick-covered incinerators is not recomme nded because this is environmentally o Additionally, medium-temperature burning (800-1100 \u00b0C) using dual-chamber incinerators may cause glass vials to explode or partially melt, and is also not recommended. o Co-incineration in industrial furnaces (such as cem ent kilns) will both inactivate and destroy mOPV2 vials and can be done in partnership with an industrial facility. o The resulting ash and any other post-incineration r esidue must be treated as toxic waste and destroyed in accordance with national or local waste management guidelines. /head2right Encapsulation (sequestration and destruction): Encapsulation destroys mOPV2 without immediate inactivation (and without opening the vials) but ma kes it inaccessible and unusable. This method involves filling containers three-quarters full wit h mOPV2 vials, adding an immobilizing material (such as sand, cement or clay) and sealing and bury ing the containers. The encapsulated waste must be destroyed in accordance with national or lo cal waste management guidelines. 18 Step 4: Destroy the inactivated mOPV2 vials After mOPV2 has been inactivated, the waste (follow ing one of the above methods, except for encapsulation) must be destroyed using either of th e following two recommended approaches: transport the waste materials to a waste facility ( for example, a sanitary landfill, municipal dump, industrial waste site or another facility mee ting national and local waste guidelines); or bury the waste materials onsite in a secured and fe nced-off burial site. The following special precautions should be applied : Environmental considerations related to waste management Universal standards precautions for health care workers http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/EPR_A M2_E7.pdf http://www.who.int/injection_safety/toolbox/en/AM_H CW_Safety_EN.pdf To be noted: Glass vials may shatter and harm the operator, or t hey may melt and cause damage to the incinerators. Sealed vials may explode under pressure (during inc ineration and autoclaving) and endanger the operator. Opened mOPV2 vials can be safely inactivated by any method. 19 Annex 2: Intermediate reporting form (Form A) Form A: End of round mOPV2 vial distribution and ut ilization report Name and title of reporting programme manager: ___ ______________ _______________Signature:___________ _____ SIA Round #:_____; starting date: ____/____/___; ending date:____/____/_____ Please tick the type of administrative level (i.e. national, regional; district or health facility) yo u are reporting from and enter the address Name of National ; Regional ; District ; facility : ____________________________ Address____________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _ Reporting date: ____/___/____ mOPV2 vials received and distributed at the end of each round # of vials in stock at the beginning of the round* # of vials received to conduct the SIA round # of vials distributed for the SIA round # of open ed vials received from lower level at the end of the SIA round # of unopened vials received from lower level at the end of the SIA round # of unopened vials returned to higher level at the end of the SIA round Physical inventory balance of usable, unopened vials in stock at the end of the SIA round** Destruction/disposal of open vials at the end of th e SIA round # of partially or fully used vials safely destroyed at the site of the facility Date vials were destroyed If partially or fully used vials were not destroyed at the site, name and type of facility where vials were sent # of vials sent for final destruction Date vials were sent for final destruction Instructions to report on utilization of mOPV2 vials at the end of each SIA round Vaccine: *mOPV2 is a vaccine used exclusively to respond to an outbreak of type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (V DPV2). This vaccine should not be available in the country before SIA. Type 2 poliovirus is an eradicated pathogen and so it is critical to have very precise counts of mOPV2 vaccine vials at each level of the health infrastructure. Once all SIA rounds are completed, all unopened via ls must be returned to the national vaccine store a nd no mOPV2 vial should remain at any level of the health infrastructure. Stock reporting: Form A should be used to report on mOPV2 stock leve ls from all administrative areas conducting mOPV2 S IAs. Vaccine quantities should be recorded as vials rath er than doses. The vaccine cold chain responsible should fill the form to be reviewed by the immunization programme m anager. The immunization officer responsible at the facilit y level should report to the district level within 2 days following completion of each SIA round. The immunization officer responsible at the distric t/regional level should retrieve all mOPV2 vials (o pened and unopened) within 5 days following the completion of each SIA round and repo rt to the upper level within 7 days. **All unopened vials at the end of each round shoul d be physically counted and their VVM status checke d. Destruction and disposal: At the end of each round, all opened vials of mOPV2 (partially or fully used) should be inactivated by boiling, chemical inactivation (by soaking in bleach) or autoclaving (if there is a de dicated autoclave for hospital waste). Methods for destruction and final disposal include incineration, encapsulation, crushing and burying i n compliance with national regulations for hospital waste disposal. If there is no capacity at the health facility to i nactivate opened vials and safely destroy them, the vials can be packed in sealed plastic bags and sent to the upper level where such facilities a re available. 20 Annex 3: Summary of the mOPV2 removal validation pr ocess Objectives of mOPV2 validation 10 Ensure and confirm withdrawal of mOPV2 from the col d chain Sites visited during validation From national stores down to the district level: /checkbld Independent monitors should verify that mOPV2 has been removed from the cold chain in all vaccine cold chain stores from the national to the district leve l within 2 weeks after the last mOPV2 SIA round. Service delivery points: /checkbld Owing to the large number of service points, combin ing risk-based purposive sampling with random sampling is recommended for independent monitoring. If mOPV2 is found at a primary, subnational or lowe st distribution level store: mOPV2 should be removed from the cold chain immedia tely. Partially used vials of mOPV2 should be destroyed a s soon as possible in the health center; unopened vials should be sent to the district or na tional as per instructions from the MOH. The monitor should ensure that mOPV2 has been remov ed from the cold chain and report findings to their supervisor. As all stores at the primary, subnational and lowes t distribution level are being visited anyway, finding mOPV2 at one of them should not affect moni toring of others. It is of utmost importance to ensure that stores at the primary, subnational and lowest distribution level do not have mOPV2 in the cold chain after the mOPV2 campaign has ended. Sweep operations, where all facilities in an area a re visited, should be done in each district where mOPV2 was found. It should be done in the whole reg ion if mOPV2 is found in more than one district. 10 Parallel to but distinct from the certification of type 2 poliovirus containment at laboratories and v accine production facilities. mOPV2 destruction and disposal The focus of mOPV2 removal validation is not to monitor the destruction and disposal of mOPV2. Disposal of mOPV2 is likely to take longer than its withdrawal from the cold chain, so it should ideally be completed within 1 month of the last SIA round. 21 Roles and responsibilities related to monitoring, s upervision and validation: Reporting findings of mOPV2 withdrawal validation Monitoring the private sector Private sector facilities with mOPV2 can be potenti ally identified with help from: manufacturers, wholesalers, professional groups, regulators and th e national immunization programme. mOPV2 manufacturers and wholesalers should be inclu ded in monitoring, but private health-care providers can usually be omitted from this process owing to their small stocks. Roles of independent monitors and monitoring coordi nators/supervisors *The National committee for mOPV2 removal should be a body independent from implementation activities. If a national certification committee (NCC) exists, it c an be used for the purpose. Assess the cold chain stores and service delivery p oints via questionnaires Report to the coordinator if leftover mOPV2 is foun d Remove any mOPV2 found (if practical) Submit data and report any issues to monitoring coo rdinators Independent monitors Select sites to be visited Develop micro-plans Develop and provide training material Facilitate logistics for the training and transport ation of independent monitors Facilitate reproduction and distribution of questio nnaires and guidelines for monitors Determine whether to select additional sites or swe ep Monitoring coordinators (and supervisors) 22 Annex 4: Validations forms Name of Monitor: Name of supervisor Signature of moni tor Region/State/Province Date of Monitoring Date of supervision Signature of supervisor Number of service points with mOPV2 Name of service point Date of visit Date the service point should have destroyed or sent away remaining mOPV2 Are all mOPV2 vials labelled as per instructions (Yes = 1 No = 0) # partially used vials destroyed at time of monitoring # unopened vials sent for destruction Number of vials at start of this last round: balance + received Destruction method (Multiple codes okay)** Corrective actions*** (Multiple codes okay) Date of revisit if required Signature of person in charge of health centre # Partially used # unopened A B C D E F G H I J K L M 1 2 3 4 Total # sites = # vials = # vials = # yes = # vials = # vials = # vials = # 1 = # 2 = # 1 = # dates = # 3 = # 4 = # 2 = # 5 = # 6 = # 3 = # 7 = # 4 = # partially used or unopened vials of mOPV2 found in the centre If vials found, go to next question; If not, go to question i *Codes for Officials at higher ad ministrative level notified (4): Other (please spec ify) *** Partially used does not apply to completely use d vials, with a few drops left.
