Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a devastating disease with extensive genetic, cellular and epigenetic complexity. For example, an average human lung tumor has over 200 non-synonymous mutations and can contain cells that have markers of several different lung lineages. The lineage relationship and epigenetic differences between the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, namely lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are unclear. The mammalian lung is a complex organ containing numerous stem/progenitor cell populations, any of which may serve as cells-of-origin for lung carcinomas in various genetic and microenvironmental contexts. Our lab is directly testing cell-of-origin fitness by isolating lung stem and progenitor cells and introducing specific genetic events into the isolated populations. During the transformation process, we culture the cells in 3-dimensional organoid culture systems. Once genetically modulated organoids are established, they are then implanted into immunocompomised mice to assess malignancy and tumor subtype. Using this system, the epigenetic changes that cells undergo during transformation will be assessed. Understanding which epigenetic states are permissive for lung cancer initiation, and in which microenvironmental contexts, will help us to target the root causes of the disease. In addition, studying the earliest stages of disease may suggest new methods of early detection for lung cancer. While our cell-or-origin approaches will give valuable insight into the early stages of lung tumorigenesis, more clinically important is finding methods to incorporate epigenetic inhibitors to treat established lung tumors. Therefore, our lab uses primary tumors from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung cancer to explore the effects of epigenetic inhibitors on tumor cell growth, differentiation and response to other chemotherapies. While many lung cancer cells cannot grow as 2-dimensional cultures, we can grow cells of diverse genotypes, including KRASG12D, KRASG12D/Lkb1-null, EGFRT790M/L858R and Lkb1-null/Pten-null in 3-dimensional cultures. Using these cultures, our main focus is to link the genotype and subtype of the lung tumor cells to efficacy of the epigenetic inhibitors. To validate our findings in human tumors, we are also establishing several patient-derived organoid models of lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinomas tend to arise in more distal alveolar space and have glandular features and markers consistent with distal lung, including surfactant protein C (SPC) and the transcription factor TTF1. Lung squamous cell carcinomas arise in the more proximal airway and are characterized by fully stratified squamous epithelial layers of cells. Many questions exist about these two types of non-small cell lung cancer, and our laboratory aims to address these questions. After isolation by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), the genetics of the normal lung cells are modulated and the cells are grown in 3-dimensional organoid culture systems. In these cultures, cells grow in Matrigel that is exposed to air from above and liquid media below. This air-liquid-interface type culture, along with the specialized media and support cells that we use in the cultures, allow the cells to retain lung specification. We have successfully transformed several lung cell types, as judged by growth of tumors after cell implantation into immunocompromised mouse lungs. Our current studies are interrogating the epigenetic changes that take place during the transformation process. Wiggle plots and micrographs are for illustrations purposes only. Primary tumor cells of known genotypes are isolated from GEMMs and cultured in 3-dimensional culture systems. Epigenetic inhibitors are applied to cultures during serially passaging. Therapies that work well to inhibit tumor organoid growth will be further explored for mechanism of efficacy and in vivo efficacy. Our goal is to identify epigenetic therapies that target specific genotypes and subtypes on non-small cell lung cancer, with the end goal of finding new precision medicine options for patients.
