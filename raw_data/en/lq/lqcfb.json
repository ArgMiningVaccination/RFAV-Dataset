It's a safe, natural remedy for so many common ailments and conditions, and goes hand-in-hand with other holistic forms of treatment, such as acupuncture. At [Phoenix Eastern Medicine Center](https://thepemc.com/alternative-medicine/), you must undergo a consultation with a licensed herbologist before receiving a prescription. During this consultation, which involves both a verbal and physical assessment, our herbologist will select types of herbs and dosages. The price of the consultation is waived if you end up purchasing Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine from us. Chinese Herbal Medicine Store at PEMC Traditional Chinese medicine is thousands of years old, and we've combined it with modern medical principles to provide remedies that truly benefit our patients' health. Capsule Form Only Honestly, Traditional Chinese Herbs don't smell or taste particularly good. Traditionally, healers steeped herbs in tea or cooked into wine due to the unpleasant smell and raw taste. We offer our Herbs in capsule form for a pleasant and palatable experience. Prescriptions Mandatory Herbs are potent. They're not something to experiment with. We only sell Herbal Supplements to customers who have received a prescription after consulting with one of the [Doctors at Phoenix Eastern Medicine Center](https://thepemc.com/alternative-medicine/). Herbs are used in conjunction with Western Medicine and not as a substitute. Supplementary Medicine Rest assured that we do not ask you to substitute Herbal Medicine for Western Medicine, but to use our services as a holistic supplement. *Always consult with your physician when taking any new supplements or herbal formulas.
