We often eat on the go during the work week because we are crunched for time. A lot of times eating at a fast food restaurant is also driven by financial convenience. In this episode, we want to lay out all of the convenient fast food establishments in your area and talk about which ones to stay away from and which ones are okay, as well as which options are healthiest at these select establishments. If you don't have these places accessible to you during the work day, we are also going to give you practical and easy food ideas to grab on the go daily that are healthy. --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/bbz-hwh/support - [What Fuels You: coffee, energy drinks, supplements?](https://podcasts.apple.com/it/podcast/what-fuels-you-coffee-energy-drinks-supplements/id1535402723?i=1000510053769) What Fuels You: coffee, energy drinks, supplements? Today we skim the surface on how we get our energy in our day to day lives. Obviously, getting energy the \"natural\" way is always the way to go, but that isn't always practical, convenient, or realistic. With countless caffeine options to choose from, we share the truth about what to stay away from completely and what can be a healthier and more effective solution for daily use. We hope you enjoy it. Stay energized! --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/bbz-hwh/support - [The Power of Water](https://podcasts.apple.com/it/podcast/the-power-of-water/id1535402723?i=1000508103314) The Power of Water We all know that we should be getting plenty of water each day, but we may not know why its so important and even if we do, we don't know how much water is enough and when the best time to drink water is. Furthermore, is the type of water we are drinking more harmful than good? Today we tackle all of these questions and more, while providing practical solutions for you to start living healthier today in order to live a longer life. In summary it is important to track how much water you drink and its source. Today our sources of fresh water are contaminated and contain organic and inorganic chemicals that can be extremely harmful at certain levels but even trace levels can bioaccumulate and lead to negative side affects. We suggest avoiding bottled water, determining contaminants in your tap water, and selecting a filter that specifically treats those contaminates. A great list of water filters can be found here: https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/water-filters.htm While we tried to summarize, there is so much to learn about water and we implore you as always to do your own due diligence. Some of our favorite sources of water information are from Heal Thyself, Hydrate, and Darin Olien podcasts. --- Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/bbz-hwh/support - [Creating lifelong habits through goal setting with Alex Judd](https://podcasts.apple.com/it/podcast/creating-lifelong-habits-through-goal-setting-with/id1535402723?i=1000507131310) Creating lifelong habits through goal setting with Alex Judd Today we have a very insightful and energized conversation with Alex Judd, the founder and CEO of Path for Growth.
