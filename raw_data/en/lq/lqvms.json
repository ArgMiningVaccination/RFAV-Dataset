Revision Comm'n Reports 563 (2019).2019] 565 STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION c/o UC Davis School of Law Davis, CA 95616 VICTOR KING, Chairperson CRYSTAL MILLER-O'BRIEN, Vice-Chairperson DIANE F. BOYER-VINE DAVID A. CARRILLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ED CHAU ANA CUBAS JANE MCALLISTER SENATOR RICHARD ROTH RICHARD RUBIN RICHARD SIMPSON November 21, 2019 To: The Honorable Gavin Newsom Governor of California, and The Legislature of California 1 At the request of the Legislature, the Law Revision Commission 2 prepared a recommendation that proposes to recodify the 3 California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") in a more user-friendly 4 manner without changing its substantive effect. 5 To facilitate logical reorganization of the CPRA, the proposed 6 recodification would relocate the CPRA in a new division 7 (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. That would 8 entail renumbering the entire CPRA. 9 Hundreds of provisions throughout the codes cross-refer to the 10 CPRA, in whole or in part. If the recodification is enacted, those 11 provisions will need to be revised to conform to the new 12 numbering scheme. 13 This recommendation proposes the necessary conforming 14 revisions. 15 16 566 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 CONFORMING REVISIONS This recommendation was prepared pursuant to Resolution 1 Chapter 158 of the Statutes of 2018. 2 Respectfully submitted, Victor King Chairperson 3 2019] 567 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP: CONFORMING REVISIONS In 2016, the Legislature directed the Law Revision Commission 1 to conduct a strictly nonsubstantive clean-up of the California 2 Public Records Act (\"CPRA\")1 and related provisions.2 The goal is 3 to make the CPRA easier for the public to use and understand.3 4 As requested, the Commission prepared a proposed 5 recodification of the CPRA.4 To facilitate sound reorganization, 6 the proposed recodification would relocate the CPRA to a new 7 division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. Every 8 existing code section would be renumbered,5 some of those 9 sections (particularly the long ones) would be split into two or 10 more new sections, and substantively similar provisions would be 11 placed together in a logical order. 12 Literally hundreds of provisions throughout the codes cross-refer 13 to the CPRA, in whole or in part. If the recodification is enacted, 14 those provisions will need to be revised to conform to the new 15 numbering scheme. 16 This recommendation proposes the necessary conforming 17 revisions. In general, they are quite straightforward. A few key 18 points are explained below. 19 1. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48. 2. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 3. See, e.g., Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3; Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 138 (June 14, 2016), p. 4. 4. California Public Records Act Clean-Up, 46 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 207 (hereafter, \"CPRA Recodification\"). 5. The CPRA would be recodified as Government Code Sections 7920.000-7930.215. 568 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP: [Vol. 46 CONFORMING REVISIONS Nonsubstantive Reform 1 In directing the Commission to study the CPRA, the Legislature 2 said that the Commission's recommended legislation should 3 \"[c]learly express legislative intent without any change in the 4 substantive provisions\" and \"[n]either expand nor contract the 5 scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are 6 open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public 7 Records Act.\"6 The Commission was very careful to adhere to that 8 limitation in preparing its proposed recodification of the CPRA.7 9 The Commission took similar care in preparing the conforming 10 revisions presented in this recommendation. In particular, the 11 proposed legislation would only update the cross-references to the 12 CPRA and make other minor technical revisions, such as: 13 Correction of spelling8 and typographical errors.9 14 Correction of grammatical and punctuation errors, 15 especially improper usage of \"which\" instead of 16 \"that.\"10 17 Elimination of gendered pronouns.11 18 6. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (emphasis added). 7. For a description of specific measures the Commission took to prevent any substantive change, see CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 217-25. 8. Educ. Code \u00a7 44438 infra (\"subdivison\" instead of \"subdivision\"); Safety Code \u00a7 25214.8.5 infra (\"fourth\" instead of \"forth\"). of Gov't Code \u00a7 6204.1 infra; proposed amendment of Health & Safety Code \u00a7 110845 infra. 10.

Code \u00a7 40629 2019] RECOMMENDATION 569 Insertion of subdivision or paragraph labels (where 1 this would not create any ambiguity or necessitate 2 additional conforming revisions).12 3 Other revisions to conform to legislative drafting 4 conventions.13 5 Correction of erroneous cross-references. Each such 6 correction is explained in the accompanying 7 comment.14 8 A few miscellaneous technical revisions.15 9 Consistent with the limited scope of its legislative mandate, the 10 Commission did not consider, and is not proposing, any other 11 12. See, e.g., proposed amendment of Penal Code \u00a7 5058 infra; proposed amendment of Pub. Res. Code \u00a7 proposed amendment of Pub. Util. Code \u00a7 92946 infra. For an example of a situation where the Commission deliberately refrained from inserting labels, see proposed amendment of Penal Code \u00a7 13300 infra (especially Penal Code \u00a7 13300(c)(11), which consists of four unlabeled paragraphs, some of which refer to \"this paragraph\"). 13. See, e.g., proposed amendment of Gov't Code \u00a7 12894.5 infra (deleting phrase \"of the Government Code,\" which is not necessary when cross-referring to provision in same code); proposed amendment of Pub. Res. Code \u00a7 41821.6 infra (replacing word \"such,\" which is disfavored in legislative drafting except in phrase \"such as\"); proposed amendment of Veh. Code \u00a7 12801.9 (replacing \"Internet Web site\" with \"internet website,\" which is current preferred usage). 14. See proposed amendment of Fish & Game Code \u00a7 2584 & Comment infra; 101848.2, 101848.9, 101850, Ins. Code \u00a7 12921.2 & Comment infra; proposed amendments of Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 7443, 13519.4 & Comments infra; proposed amendments of Rev. & Tax.

Regardless of whether they are in a separate 6 bill, the Commission will make sure that they are statutorily 7 defined to be part of the \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020.\"17 8 That is important, because the proposed recodification includes 9 the following provision: 10 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 11 2020 is intended to substantively change the law relating to 12 inspection of public records. The act is intended to be 13 entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this 14 division and every other provision of this act, including, 15 without limitation, every cross-reference in every provision 16 of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 17 nonsubstantive intent of the act.18 18 This provision underscores the nonsubstantive nature of the 19 recodification as a whole and the updated cross-references in 20 particular. It will help to ensure that the courts and others interpret 21 the recodification accordingly. 22 Contingent Operation 23 On the assumption that the conforming revisions will be 24 introduced as a separate bill, the proposed legislation includes an 25 uncodified provision that would make the conforming revisions 26 operative only if the recodification bill is enacted and becomes 27 16. Accordingly, readers should not infer that the Commission has evaluated and approved language that would not be changed by this recommendation. 17. \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\" is defined in proposed Government Code Section 7920.005. See CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 251. 18. CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 251 (emphasis added). 2019] RECOMMENDATION 571 operative.19 The Commission will insert the appropriate bill 1 number in that uncodified provision after the recodification bill is 2 introduced. 3 Subordination Clause 4 The proposed legislation also includes a subordination clause, in 5 case one or more of the code provisions with a conforming 6 revision is also amended in a substantive manner by another bill.20 7 The subordination clause would ensure that the substantive reform 8 overrides the conforming revision, regardless of which bill is 9 chaptered first. Although the conforming revision would be 10 nullified by the substantive reform, it could be reintroduced the 11 following year and a stopgap provision in the proposed 12 recodification would make the outdated cross-reference workable 13 in the interim.21 14 Legislation Enacted in 2019 15 Some of the code provisions that cross-refer to the CPRA were 16 amended in 2019.22 In preparing conforming revisions of those 17 19. See proposed uncodified provision on contingent operation (at end of proposed legislation) infra. 20. See proposed uncodified subordination clause (at end of proposed legislation) infra. 21. See proposed 7920.105(b) in CPRA Recodification, supra note 4, at 252 (\"A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and continued in this division, or in any other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the restatement and continuation.\"). 22.
