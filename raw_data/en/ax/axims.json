But to introducing a new vaccine accompanies loads of resources and time. It is also undeniable that the vaccines available today are not free fro m adverse effects. In contrast, the eternal science of Ayurveda has herbs, minerals, procedures that help in building immunity without any adverse effects. Thus, instead of constantly in- jecting vaccines to achieve artificial immunity, various Ayurvedic formulations, herbs, or processes can be used to enhance natural immunity. Various research has demonstrated that Ayurveda pharmaceuticals are more effective for preventative and therapeutic purposes with fewer side effects than Contemporary science drugs . Various texts including Samhitas , Modern science textbooks, Web -search, PubMed, and UGC indexed peer -reviewed journals were referred to collect the data. This article gives a glimpse of holistic ways of Ayurveda which will build im- munity and help in lead ing a disease -free life. Keywords : Ayu Pratirakshak, Immunity, Swarnprashan INTRODUCTION Ayurveda is an eternal Science of Aimful life that gave us ways of prevention and treatment of prevail- ing diseases, as in the concept of Ayurveda \"Swasthasya Swasthya Rakshanam Aturashayavikara prashamanmch1\" is the very 1st law of Ayurveda , modern science too fol lows this rule as they use vac- INTERNATIONAL AYURVEDIC MEDICAL JOURNAL Rajguru & Om Prakash Gupta: Ayu - Pratirakshak: The Natural Immunity Boosters doi:10.46607/iamj 3610072022 | IAMJ JU LY 2022 | www. iamj .in 1851 cines as a mode of prevention for and non-communicable diseases. As per Ayurvedic clas- sics, OJUS is the essence present in every Dhatu (Tissue) and is considered as Sara (Extract) of all the Seven Dhatus starting from Rasa to Shukra . This OJUS is responsible for life, immunity, vitality, and strength of our body. Ayurveda has many formula- tions, herbs, and procedures that help to increase our Immunity to provide a disease -free life, much more than vaccines do. WHAT IS A VACCINE? Vaccines are biological preparations that are pro- duced from living organisms that enhance immunity against Diseases. Either it prevents (Prophylactic) or in some case, treat disease (Therapeutic). The vaccin e can be divided into a number of different types but ultimately works on the same principle to stimulate the immune response to recognize a pathogen. VACCINE -RELATED QUESTIONS We can now see the vast and rampant prevalence of viruses on Earth as it exists now. Is it feasible to pre- vent all invading germs and viruses using contempo- rary vaccines? If so, consider the costs, effort, and time needed in research. We all know that developing a smallpox vaccine took over a century, a lot of mon- ey, and many hours o f research from scientists all across the world. It's concerning that a particular vac- cination protects against only one illness, but the real worry is what it does to the body as a side effect. Doctors now concur that the danger of a vaccination response is greater than the chance of contracting smallpox or contracting Covid. What happens to man's natural immunity after this, or is there a natural vaccine? Mumps vaccinations, like flu vaccines, are made with eggs, therefore anyone who has severe egg allerg ies should avoid them. In Australia and New Zealand, routine typhoid immunization is not advised. Unfor- tunately, the vaccination is only approximately 50% effective and does not prevent the disease from spreading2. In terms of vaccinations and protection, India is reliant on Western biomedical sciences. De- spite the availability of vaccinations and our aggres- sive \"Universal Immunization Program,\" however, we have not been able to prevent death and disability. Why can't we utilize Ayurvedic Pratirakshak (Vac- cines) for prophylactic and preventative purposes? We have so many Ayurvedic preparations that have substantial advantages over contemporary vaccina- tions, with low side effects, that they need to be popularized based on science. AYURVEDA AND IMMUNITY OJUS is responsible for practically everything in the human body. It is found in every cell and circulates throughout the body in order to maintain homeosta- sis. BALA is a phrase used to describe the body's im- munity. BALA, OJUS , and as synonyms in Ayurveda3. OJUS has been de- fined as the body's resistance to deterioration and de- generation. This BALA or OJUS stands for 3 types of Sahaj (Innate) strives to boost OJUS is also known as Bala and Pra- kritsleshma3. Bala is referred to as Vyadhikshama- tava by Acharya Chakrapani. Vyadhikshamatva re- fers to fight di sease at its source5. Dif- ferent treatments, protocols, and specialized herbal drugs are used to create or sustain OJUS in the body. 1. Swarnaprashana : In the present climate of com- municable and infectious illnesses, it is critical to boosting children's fi rst line of defense from the mo- ment they are born. Bala, or immunity, is required at all times for surviv- al, whether in the womb of a mother or on the first day of life. The human age has been separated into three distinct ages: BALA, YUVA, and JARA , each with its own routine for general personality develop- ment. Samskar is the name given to these special adoptions, which also teaches us the value of life. Samsakar is a type of immunity -building instruction and practice. Acharya Kashyapa Mentioned of Swarnaprashana as lehan karma . It can be used to improve Bala (Immunity & Physical), Medha, Agni, Ayu and to prevent a child from differ- ent diseases,6,7. According to recent research, gold particles are encapsulated by honey, ghrita, and herbs in Swarnprashna , which aids in the formation of var- ied sizes, shapes, charges, and compositions.

Pathogens, in general, undergo multiple mutations, either spontane- ously or as a result of human intervention. As a re- sult, the human system that develops non -specific immunity w ill be able to defend against any pathogen or inflammatory agent that enters the body8. Swarna Prashana did not interfere with the normal growth of the infants. As evident by NNT, it showed immuno- modulatory activity and was tolerated by the infants with no adverse effects during the trial or follow -up period.9 We can test novel versions of Swarnaprashana in the lab to see how they work and how hazardous they are. Swarnaprashana gold nano- particles can be used to treat and prevent illnesses such as cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, and other im- munological disorders. For many site -based malig- nancies, we can create Ayurvedic vaccines like gold, silver, or other metallic nano particles. 2. Samsakara and Immunity - Varying religious texts have different numbers of Samsakara , such as 13 in Manusmriti and 40 in Gautam Grihyasootra. However, there are currently 16 Samsakaras that are suitable. Garbhadan, Pumsavana, Simantonayana are the Samsa karas done during the prenatal stage Samsakara performed during postnatal periods are - A) During the Neonatal period - (1st four weeks) Jatakarma,10,11 Namakaran12,13 B) During Nishakraman14 Upveshtan16 Karnvedhan22 Phalaprashana/annaprashana16 years) Chudakramana/ Mundan Upanayansamsakar Vedarambha23 Only Samsakaras relating to immunity strengthening will be discussed here. 1) Garbha samsakaram is performed to ensure that our child has excellent health, good attributes, strength, and the greatest potential traits in our child with BALA physical strength. 2) Jatakarma Samsakara - Give grita and honey combined with a mantra to the baby. This stimul ates the stomach's intrinsic nerve plexus. This aids in passing the meconium as quickly as possible. It also aids in the early immunization process. 3) Swarnaprashanaa Samsakara : As previously said, all of these samsakara are important life events or rituals. Always follow the correct samsakara for the child's chronological age. It will aid in the child's growth, development, and immunity. Samsakara Al- so helps a child in adjusting to the external environ- ment and also plays an important role in a child's psycho logical development and final personality. Samsakara Also helps in the assessment of early de- tection of growth and development disorders.15 (3) Rasayan Charaka and Sharanghdhara for improving OJUS/BALA or Immunity for long -life span, intellectuality, and disease -free existence25. OJUS 's quality is Similar to milk and ghee, which are referred to as Nitya Rasayana. Rasayana therapy can be used for both prevention and treatment. Rasayana nourishes the wh ole Dhatu system and im- proves natural resistance to illness by boosting im- munity. a) Acharya Sharangdhara defined the Rasayana in terms of decade -by-decade aging. b) Ayurvedic Texts describe particular Rasayans for distinct Tissues26. c) Various Rasayan for specific channels - Bodily Systems26. d) Rasayan for diverse body constitutions26. discuss Aachara Rasayanas . positive behaviour. The majority of the Aachara Rasayana is concerned with excellent manners and behaviour. A person must be truthful in the circumstances, free of wrath, free of drink and sex indulgence, free of violence, and a per- son who routinely prays to God, instructors, and the elderly. According to Rituc harya , a person devoid of Rajguru & Om Prakash Gupta: Ayu - Pratirakshak: The Natural Immunity Boosters doi:10.46607/iamj 3610072022 | IAMJ JU LY 2022 | www. iamj .in 1853 Barbarian acts has a regular and on -time resting and waking schedule. Must consume Ghrita and milk on a regular basis, must not be narrow -minded, desire to study spiritual knowledge, good sense organs, and self-control; if you pos sess all of these traits and ad- here to them, this entire process will have a Rasayana impact on you. Rasayana herbs exhibit non -specific immunity, which may not be attributable to specifici- ty; however, individual studies of the Rasayana have shown activity against SARS -CoV-2 in various ex- perimental settings19. Withania somnifera was not found inferior to HCQ and its efficacy was within the 15 % non -inferiority margin set a priority . WS as an immunomodulator has other clinical benefits including reducing mental stress.17 According to Ayurveda , therapeutics are of two types: 1. Swasthasyorjaskara -which promotes strength (immunity) in the healthy, and 2. Roganut -which al- leviates disorders. Both of these gr oups perform both of these functions, but Rasayana and Vajikarana are mostly used for promotive treatment (C.S.Chi. 1:1/4 - 8). Ayush Kwath has both immune promoting and disease alleviating properties which can be achieved by various treatment modalities (food) : After oxygen and water, food is the third most crucial aspect of existence. The 1st Up- sthambha of life is Ahara. Ahara is metabolized and absorbed in the body after Pachana , according to Samhita and Ayurvedic texts. From this Ahara ras, Sara with Mala Bhag is derived. As a result, Sara will supply sustenance to all dhatus . OJUS is the Dhatus's sara. Thus, if all Dhatus are well -nourished, the body's OJUS will be well -nourished. We should consume Ahara as Aaharvidhi Vidhan be consumed. Food consu med in accordance with Aharavidhi will promote OJUS and bodily balance, as well as aid in the prevention of disease. All the nutrients come from food. The im- mune impairments associated with nutritional inade-quacy increase susceptibility to infection and pe rmit infections to become more severe, even fatal. The adverse impact of poor nutrition on the immune sys- tem, including its inflammatory component, may be one of the explanations for the higher risk of more severe outcomes from infection with SARS -CoV-2 seen in older people and those living with obesity.20 So Ahara is the most important part of life to be tak- en according to Aharavidhividhana. Acharya Chara- ka also said Ahara produces : Yoga , according Acharya method of . \"The individual who follows Hitakar Ahara (healthy eating) and Vihar (regimens), goes into action after careful consideration, is unattached to sensual pleasure, donates, respects equality, is truthful , for bearing, and is devoid of authoritative figures, becomes disease -free.\" Yoga increased the number of antibodies cortisol, SOD, leukocyte, monocytes, CD56 and stimulate - 10, IL and sTNF -RII.21 He who is equipped with great intellect, speech, and acts that result in joyful outcomes, as well as a well -controlled mind, clear understanding, knowledge, penance, and continua l effort in Yoga , never succumbs to sick- ness28. In Yoga , there are several also mentioned in Hathyoga Siddhi lakshana. Asana29: Asana is the first step in the practise of yo- ga, and it produces a sense of lightness in our bodies while also increasing strength and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Pranayama29: If Prayanama is practiced in a proper way, it is capable of curing all diseases. Pranayam provides Nadisuddhi and features of Nadisuddhi are Agnideepan (6) Balavridhikara Bhavas30:- are known as Balavridhikara Bhavas , which include things like place of birth and time, genetic quantity, good favorable weather (Visarga kala ), good food, good quality of ovum and Beeja ), good quality of uterus ( Kshetra ), good physique, good tolerance power, good mental status, Rajguru & Om Prakash Gupta: Ayu - Pratirakshak: The Natural Immunity Boosters doi:10.46607/iamj 3610072022 | IAMJ JU LY 2022 | www. iamj .in 1854 From conception to death, all of these factors con- tribute to our increased immunity. (7) Ritucharya and Dinacharya : Body Bala is ideal at the beginning of Aadana Kala and the end of Visarga Kala31. We may improve our immunity and avoid sickness by practicing the Ritucharaya. Snanakarma is Vrishaya, Ayushay , clo thing is Ayur- vardhak Aromatic medicine lepan and wearing aromatic flower garlands induce Vrishyata and Ayushaya , which is why we greet our visitors with flower garlands. OJUS and Ayuvardhan are caused by wearing Ratana and other jewels. Ayuvardhana is caused by cleaning the foot and Malamargas. Ayuvardhak also includes hair cutting, shaving, and nail cutting. A person's OJUS/BALA or Ayu increases if all of these Ritucharaya and Dinacharya are strictly maintained. (8) Ayurvedic concept of active immunity : Prior sensitization of the body by taking medications or rasayana treatment on a regular basis in order to pre- vent any ailment caused by Virudhahara . It's a notion referred to as active immunity33. Ayush kwatha and single herbs like Guduchi Aswagandha powder (3 -5gm), and Haridra milk/gargling recommended as Ayurveda immunity Boosters by the Ministry AYUSH are safe and effec- tive for prevention and cure of COVID -19 with suffi- cient preclinical and some Nidana Parivarjana : Nidana factor, risk factors, and etiological fac- tors are the first step to preserving health. So, this can also be a Pratirakshak (Vaccine). CONC LUSION Therefore, all these concepts and methods as de- scribed in Ayurveda can act as Pratirakshak (vac- cine). By following all these regimes, we can prevent thousands of occurring diseases from viruses. OJUS is Bala and Prakrit Sleshma which provides strength to fight against diseases. Therefore, we have to in- crease OJUS as much as possible. OJUS Vridhi doesn't cause any disease, it provides satisfaction, strength, happiness, and nutrition to the body34, and helps to achieve Poornayu . 8, 2022) 2. Nanal VR.
