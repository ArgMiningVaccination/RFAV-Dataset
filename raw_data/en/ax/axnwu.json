THANK YOU PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, STUDY OF VESTIBULAR/MIGRAINE/BALANCE/FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. I've had personal experience of mixed vestibular disorders diagnosis, two separate episodes in ten years. I have since made great strides in homeopathy (and adjunctive therapies - nutrigenomics, herbs etc) for those who suffer from vestibular and central balance disorders - vertigo, vestibular migraine, tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus, associated sensory like photophobia, and eye/vision problems. Brain- vision- vestibular balance problems. I decided to put all my research and writing to good use and focus on those with similar issues in my practice. (Have had success in the past, but stepped up more intense focus in recent years). I am now a listed practitioner member of the Vestibular Disorders Association (US). Link to some of my personal experience, is in my professional practitioner listing here : [https://vestibular.org/members/annesash-homeopathgmail-com/?origin=healthcare-directory%3F_name%3DAnne%20sash](https://vestibular.org/members/annesash-homeopathgmail-com/?origin=healthcare-directory%3F_name%3DAnne%20sash) Please EMAIL me if you have any questions, or to arrange a consultation (Mainly via Zoom. If you are close by in Melbourne, you can ask to be seen in person. ). Otherwise please phone/SMS between 12pm and 7pm weekdays Melbourne AEST/AEDT thank you. LIZ LALOR FERTILITY PROGRAM Studying under the mentorship Of Liz, who with this specialised program of homeopathy for fertility which she has developed over the past two decades, has had as of 2019 : 397 Babies Born - 54 failures - Success Speaks for itself - Please contact me via email if you are interested. We can have a 15 minute phone chat to decide if this program is for you. Ideally, you would have a full case taking and ongoing homeopathic care before beginning this program, for the best outcome. Logic. HUMAN CHEMISTRY HOMEOPATHY AND NATURAL BALANCING THERAPY I have been training since 2020 (and continue to do so), with Ton Jansen of The Netherlands. Ton's new and progressive methods and remedies are compatible with my long practice in homeopathy, and my great interest in the use of homeopathics from organ sarcodes, hormones, medications etc. ( n.b. These are potentised remedies which don't contain the original substance, only prompt the body into responding to normalise function) This involves endocrine hormones and neurotransmitters rebalancing. Dealing with long term effects of past medications. Assistance with medications withdrawal, where allowed (some under medical supervision only). Removing these obstacles to health, from medications dependence and so called \"side effects\". Slowing or stopping progression of metabolic disorders, neurological etc. New homeopathic remedies with greater scope in conditions such as : Pain management. Panic attacks. Fertility. Blood sugar problems. Cholesterol. Blood pressure. Leaky gut. Addictions. TOO MANY MEDICATIONS, AND HEALTH IS WORSENING. We go back as far in the patient history as possible, to undo the lasting effects of these influences which can adversely affect a person for life. Always, adjust homeopathy to the individual. I am not a blind follower of protocols for conditions. Rather, taking what is relevant for the person, to get the best possible result. Ton's teaching has greatly enhanced my practice, in addition to classical homeopathy when indicated. I THEREFORE COMBINE TON'S NEW METHODS WITH MY EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE, TRAININGS WITH PROMINENT WORLD RENOWNED HOMEOPATHS, OVER A QUARTER CENTURY IN PRACTICE. It can be very helpful to send me copies of your blood tests and other pathology reports. Having these ordered through your GP or specialist usually means costs are covered. When extra tests such as Thyroid - extensive are not offered, I can arrange these after our consultation if you are willing to cover the cost yourself. (Australia only) Please be aware that there are MANY tests available, some are really expensive. It's my aim to avoid unnecessary expenses for you as far as possible. Sometimes the results that come from tests don't point to a satisfactory answer to your problems. They must serve a purpose for YOU, and be worth the outlay. Bear in mind, that homeopathy can often help very much where an allergy, or pathogenic cause is unknown. Having said that, sometimes we can have unusual and not so expensive tests which can make a profound difference to homeopathic treatment (nagalase, for example) Some tests are very specific to the new remedies of Ton Jansen (hormones, neurotransmitters, body substances), and my continuing personal research in what other new remedies can be made (by a lab) as homeopathics. So. After our consultation you can create an account at Nutripath Pathology Services (button, or link below) to purchase a test kit to be delivered to you. Testing is available by appointment at Melbourne Pathology sites. I will receive the results, and it is YOUR information to keep. n.b. I receive NO payment from Nutripath.

[https://yourhealthbasket.co.uk/prac/Anne%20Sash%20Homeopath/](https://yourhealthbasket.co.uk/prac/Anne%20Sash%20Homeopath/) \"The patient, not the disease\". Homeopathy is professionally prescribed according to Traditional indications and principles, as documented by founder Dr Christian Samuel Hahnemann. Homeopathy treats the whole patient, mind and body, based on the principle of \"Like cures like\". It is helpful in chronic and acute conditions, when carefully chosen according to the unique indications of the patient. The aim is to assist you in self healing of body and mind, to the greatest degree possible. Homeopathic professional prescribing is aimed at reducing the need for medication over time, building resilience and wellbeing. If you need a medical diagnosis, please see your doctor and have any necessary tests. This is not a medical practice. Having said that, homeopathy can often help where there are symptoms but a diagnosis can not be made. Homeopathy will not clash with prescribed pharmaceutical medication. For more information, you can read my blog posts on this site, and subscribe if you wish. Homeopathics supplied within the consultation are normally dispensed as sucrose pilules. N.B. I do not use radionics or bioresonance. Remedies are sourced which are made the traditional Hahnemannian way, as far as possible. How to take -These are very easy to take, for all ages and abilities (with help) as they are dissolved in the mouth. Do not swallow immediately. Do not take with food and drink, rather with a clean mouth. Rinse first with water if necessary. Avoid handling the pilules, and do not replace in vial if they have been dropped. Storage - store your remedies preferably in a dark place, room temperature, not near electrical appliances (not in the fridge, especially). Not with mobile phone (however, remedies have worked in emergencies despite this). Do not store with anything with a strong odour, or wear strong perfume as this may stop the remedy action. Homeobotanicals are formulations of homeopathically indicated herbs, used as \"drainage\" for organ systems (liver, kidney, urinary, skin, respiratory etc). A combination is chosen in consultation, as needed. These are made as liquid drops. Herbs - (tablets for zero alcohol content) and other supplements (vegan formulations available) which are practitioner only products, can be ordered and delivered directly to you, as needed. In Australia I have accounts with Martin and Pleasance, and Brauer homeopathic labs, so there is a possibility for you to order kits or remedies during covid restrictions with my script, if pick up here is not possible.

Now working on writing up resolved cases for publication, and a webinar course and/or book for practitioners. I am especially interested in the Fabaceae (legumes) plant family of remedies in homeopathy, with relevance to neurological disorders. These remedies have a definite pattern of Sensations (ref : Rajan Sankaran), and specific language/expressions of the patient which guides us to the correct remedy.

I AM ALSO PLANNING A KIT FOR MY US AND OVERSEAS CLIENTS, WITH CLASSICAL, NOSODES AND SARCODE REMEDIES INCLUDED - ONLY WITH COMPLEX INITIAL CONSULTATION) Some of you are very familiar with homeopathy in the home, and just want an acute remedy refill. e.g. ARNICA, ACONITE, HYPERICUM, ARS ALB, OSCILLOCOCCINUM, NUX VOMICA, CARBO VEG, ETC. Tell me if this is the case. Ask me. Remember, homeopathy works when you consider \"The patient, not the disease\".

All of the usual privacy rights apply. Photo credit Christina@wocintechchat 49 Phillip st, Dallas, VIC 3047, AU Today By Appointment ATMS accredited practitioner for a quarter century in 2020. It's important to find a practitioner who belongs to a legitimate professional practitioner association. In any case, one who keeps up with developments in professional practice, and ongoing education. ATMS lets us choose appropriate education activities to our homeopathy practice. I came to homeopathy finishing my studies in 1994, as a way to try to resolve my chronic asthma which came on after pneumonia some years earlier. A reason to give up singing. (See photo, Bell Street Rock in 1987). I subsequently achieved this with two remedies. Quite a feat, as we have at the present time over 7000 homeopathic remedies to choose from, and we are treating \"The patient, not the disease\". In fact, my first chosen remedy (Calcarea fluor) was not listed anywhere as far as I knew for \"asthma\". I had been to several practitioners, had several remedies but only had a huge result after this one. Later, I needed Lycopodium for the ineffectual yawning from air hunger. The process was complete. after some occasional doses over the next couple of years. I have had many other remedies in the interim, and got myself out of some very difficult allergic/autoimmune conditions. When I had a relapse of chronic asthma after a virus more than 2 decades later, only the Calcarea fluor made a difference. The right remedy, for the individual, at the right time. So, this is how we do it. A consultation lasts typically an hour and a half, and I listen to your whole story. How your complaint(s) came about, and what your unique feelings, sensations, reactions in disease are. Its most important to match the condition of the patient, to the homeopathic remedy which can cause a similar state in the healthy. That is what makes it \"homeopathic\" , by what condition is brought out in a healthy individual by that substance. \"Like cures like\". The testing in healthy volunteers for what a remedy may cause, is called a homeopathic proving. Sometimes we use sarcodes, homeopathically potentised healthy organ tissues, to stimulate normal functioning of that organ. I have been using sarcodes in practice for a long time, but I have recently completed some extra continuing professional education in this area. I am indebted to my teachers in this, Dr Joe Rozencwajg (a homeopath and integrative practitioner), and Hilery Dorrian. I am also indebted to Liz Lalor for her mentoring and as an author of books on homeopathy, focusing on mental and emotional qualities of remedies. Adjuncts to homeopathy - I also use Homeobotanicals drainage remedies where practicable. These are on the cusp of homeopathy and herbal medicine. Herbs, I use occasionally. It's good to know the greater range of action of herbs, as a homeopath. We know that small doses have often a rather different action to the standard herbalist's dosing, and we must respect those differences. I am looking now at moving into Gemmotherapics also. Sometimes supplements are supplied via patient ordering. Care is taken to rule out contraindications for these. As much as possible, we do not over complicate things. Where we can do more, with less supplements, we do. The aim is to be efficient in improving health, not to send anyone bankrupt. That is why I chose homeopathy - to do the best in the first place for myself, and then to help others toward long term health in the most efficient way. To look for the causes of an individual being unwell, and to find what is best for them in homeopathy to give a stimulus toward healing, rather than trying to fit them into a futile medical condition box and sell products. So, when I needed to find a way to resolve my own long list of chronic problems, I knew I had a choice which modality to study. I know a quarter century later, that I made the right choice in HOMEOPATHY. I hope that you will also. Kind regards always, Anne An initial homeopathic consultation takes about one and a half hours. It's best to see your GP for any medical diagnosis and tests, but then we can talk about YOU. What is bothering you the most right now, what lead up to it, what is your past history? What is your unique reaction in disease, because that's how homeopathy works - when it matches you as a person, rather than specific remedies for disease conditions. For example, many people with a headache will each receive a different remedy, according to their individual characteristics in a complaint. Examples : What makes the problem better or worse, how did it start? How is it different to the usual symptoms of a condition? How are you in your character and energy when you are unwell? Is there a particular recurrent situation which throws you off balance, diminishes your health and wellbeing? Is your focus on family, work, relationships, performing in public? How to cope with the outside world with sensitivities and vulnerabilities? Too easily having reactions to foods, or temperature changes and weather, or anything at all? Do you have difficulties with others, or with being unwell since a certain event like an injury (head injuries especially), an infection, medication (antibiotics, the contraceptive pill, cortisone etc). Grief, loss, abuse? Of 7000+ remedies in homeopathy to date, we need the right one at the right moment. Usually, one to three homeopathic remedies are given, included in the cost of the consultation. (Any Hbt drops, herbs or supplements are extra, but the main focus is homeopathy, for a deep and lasting change). Homeopathy is applicable in almost all acute and chronic disturbance of health. \"The patient, not the disease\", for deep and lasting improvements through all stages of life.
