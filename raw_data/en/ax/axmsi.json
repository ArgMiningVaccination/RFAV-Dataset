Therefore Hoag's Maternal Child Health Departments will be providing the Hepatitis B vaccine for your newborn at birth and also offering new mothers the Tdap and Influenza (during flu season) vaccines. Types - Tdap Vaccine: Immunizes for Pertussis, also known as whooping cough. It is a highly contagious bacterial illness spread by coughing and sneezing. People sick with pertussis have severe coughing attacks that can last for months. In response to the high levels of disease and death from pertussis in California during 2010, CDPH is recommending that all Californians make sure that they are immunized against pertussis, especially if they are in contact with infants, which are at higher risk. - Seasonal Influenza: Offered during the flu season, receiving an influenza vaccine each year is the single best way to protect mothers from the flu. - Hepatitis B Vaccine: Protects against a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver. The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure and death. It's important to discuss vaccinations with your physician, prior to your delivery, so you are prepared to make a decision upon arrival at Hoag. Patient Resources To further assist you, we have provided additional information via a helpful booklet on immunizations from the CDC. "}
