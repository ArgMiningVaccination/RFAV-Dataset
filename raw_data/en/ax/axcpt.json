The good news is, that supplementing is easy, especially when you know how to make the best organic magnesium lotion recipe. A simple magnesium cream recipe It almost seems like magic - rub this lotion on, and incredible things happen: deep restful sleep, balanced hormones, and relief from headaches, pain, and anxiety. Isn't it great that we can make this easy DIY magnesium lotion at home? I won't go into a ton of detail now, but in [another blog post, which you can check out here, I talk about my experience with the many incredible benefits of magnesium lotion](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/magnesium-lotion-benefits-for-sleep-anxiety-hormones-and-more/). I also have other blog posts where I talk about [how magnesium helps me with sleep](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/magnesium-and-sleep-naturally-get-deep-restful-sleep/) and [anxiety](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/magnesium-for-anxiety-natural-anxiety-relief/). The wonderful thing about magnesium lotion is that when we use magnesium on the skin, we can achieve balance very quickly. This means fast relief from the symptoms of magnesium deficiency ( [source](https://www.ancient-minerals.com/transdermal-magnesium/)).

No irritation, please You can spray straight magnesium brine right on the skin, and you can get great transdermal magnesium therapy benefits that way. But, straight magnesium brine on the skin can be drying, tingly, and itchy. When magnesium brine is combined with skin moisturizing oils and butter, we get the great benefits of magnesium through the skin, without drying and irritation. Yay! Ingredients for my new and improved organic magnesium lotion recipe [I do have an early blog post on how to make magnesium lotion](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/how-to-make-magnesium-lotion-for-sleep-stress-and-more/). This recipe is similar to that one, but it has been updated and made even better. My other magnesium lotion recipe is still quite nice. But, it does tend to have a bit of a softer consistency. This new, best organic magnesium lotion recipe has [organic shea butter](https://amzn.to/2zoUwH8), which helps give the lotion a thicker consistency, which makes it easier to apply. I've also bumped up the beeswax a little, to help with thickness.

Using transdermal magnesium I've found that when I'm correcting a magnesium deficiency, it's good to take it both internally, and through the skin. That way, I get all the benefits of magnesium. Applying magnesium to the skin is also called transdermal magnesium therapy, and it works much faster than an internal supplement ( [source](https://www.ancient-minerals.com/transdermal-magnesium/)). Magnesium enters the bloodstream immediately, where the body can use it right away. Also, the body can use exactly the amount it needs. Overdose and digestive upset are avoided. This organic magnesium lotion works perfectly for this. For internal magnesium, I like this [Magnesium Calm powder supplement](https://amzn.to/2NOa4fV). [Magnesium glycinate](https://amzn.to/2Lex9qx) is another good choice I sometimes use. Taking magnesium internally helps to ensure that my magnesium levels stay healthy long term. How much magnesium is in homemade magnesium lotion and body butter? According to my research, 1 teaspoon of this organic magnesium lotion delivers approximately 280 mg of elemental magnesium. I usually use about 1-2 teaspoons at a time when I use it. The best brine for homemade magnesium lotion When I make this magnesium lotion recipe, I like to use a very high-quality, ultra-pure magnesium brine. My favorite is [ this one from Ancient Minerals](https://amzn.to/30mJgWN). It comes from the Ancient Zechstein Sea in The Netherlands and is extremely pure and high quality. You can [make your own magnesium brine from magnesium flakes](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/how-to-make-magnesium-oil-flakes/). But, the brine made that way isn't as pure. It can also be more irritating to the skin. Does magnesium lotion need a preservative? While most homemade lotion recipes do need a preservative, I've found that this magnesium lotion is just fine without one. The magnesium chloride brine acts similar to the way that salt does as a natural preservative. So, as long as you're applying it with clean hands, and it's used up within about a year, it should stay nice and fresh. Just like when you make any body care product at home, you want to be very careful to use super clean equipment. I recommend washing everything you'll be using in a weak bleach solution, and then letting it air dry. That will help avoid any unwanted bacteria ending up in the finished lotion. Essential oils for organic magnesium lotion You can keep magnesium lotion unscented, or you can enhance the already wonderful relaxing and sleep-enhancing properties of magnesium lotion by adding certain essential oils. These ones are great choices: I like to add essential oils in a 1% dilution. For this magnesium lotion recipe, which makes about 16 oz. of lotion, you'll add 96 drops of essential oils. Simple and easy magnesium oil lotion recipe I've gotten various questions about how I make magnesium lotion, so I wanted to cover those here. There is definitely a wide variety of ingredients you can use when you make homemade lotions. There are emulsifying waxes and stabilizers. I personally like to keep my skincare products as simple pure and natural as possible, with wholesome, easy-to-recognize ingredients. I use [organic beeswax](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/nutrient-dense-smoothies/) for the emulsifier, and it works great. The emulsifying waxes that are commercially available are made from synthetic ingredients, and beeswax is much more pure and natural. Stabilizers for lotion making aren't so pure and natural, either. They're made with processed ingredients and I prefer to skip them altogether. I am really happy with the consistency when I keep it super pure and natural like this. I really do think this is the best organic magnesium lotion recipe.
