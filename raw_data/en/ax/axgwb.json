THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY,INC Inc 13-5644916 Form 990, Part III, Line 4a - First Accomplishment A) RESEARCH PROGRAMS: At LLS, we are pushing boundaries toward powerful new therapies. We propel groundbreaking cancer treatments through all phases of the drug approval process and are proud that our support has been key to advancing 75% of the almost 100 blood cancer treatment approvals over the last five years. As we continued to support the search for lifesaving and less toxic treatments in 2021, we invested in exciting research frontiers, including precision medicine, immunotherapy, and links between mutations and blood cancer-advancements that are changing the paradigm of cancer treatment. In the process, we propelled several novel science initiatives to new heights-many of which hardly seemed possible just a short time ago. With advisory input from recognized biomedical research experts, LLS funds exemplary projects across the entire research continuum relevant to improve outcomes for blood cancer patients, from basic laboratory science through clinical trials, and from investigator-initiated research to private-sector drug development alliances. LLS is deliberate and purposeful in finding and supporting research that is most likely to help patients as soon as possible. To date, LLS has invested over $1.5 billion in research aimed at helping all blood cancer patients live better, longer lives. In fiscal year 2021, LLS supported research in the U.S., Canada and 6 other countries with a total research disbursement of approximately $33.9 million. Research funding was distributed across all blood cancers.LLS990 02/02/2022 11:59 AMDAAPage 2 Schedule O (Form 990 or 990-EZ) 2020 DAASchedule O (Form 13-5644916 IMPACT RESEARCH GRANTS To address unequal representation of underserved populations in clinical trials, in May we introduced IMPACT (Influential Medicine Providing Access to Clinical Trials) research grants. An initial five-year investment of $3.75 million was allocated to Mayo Clinic, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. The IMPACT grants will help these major cancer centers expand clinical trial access to local community-based hospitals and clinics with substantial underserved populations. The goal is to increase trial enrollment among traditionally underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, and individuals with low income, to at least 20%, thereby expanding access to state-of-the-art therapies to a broader swath of newly diagnosed blood cancer patients. THERAPY ACCELERATION PROGRAM\u00ae (TAP) Since 2007, our innovative venture philanthropy initiative, the LLS Therapy Acceleration Program\u00ae (TAP), has partnered with biotechnology companies and academic researchers to extend the therapeutic landscape in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In 2021, we made six new investments in companies developing new immunotherapies including \"off the shelf\" CAR T-cell therapy, \"in vivo\" therapy that generates cancer-fighting CAR cells inside the body, two first-in-class antibodies targeting novel checkpoints, to release the brakes and activate immune cells so they can fight cancer, and CAR- macrophage (CAR-M) therapy to treat cancers where checkpoint inhibitors tend to be less effective. NATIONAL PATIENT REGISTRY COVID INFORMATION The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic engendered a host of fears and questions for Page 1 of 9LLS990 02/02/2022 11:59 AMDAAPage 2 Schedule O (Form 990 or 990-EZ) 2020 DAASchedule O (Form 13-5644916 the blood cancer community. When patient concerns arose about whether the new vaccines would protect them, LLS stepped in to find answers. In February 2021, LLS activated the LLS National Patient Registry, a project supported by Ethel and Bernard Garil in memory of their son, Michael, who succumbed to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. More than 10,000 blood cancer patients answered the call to join the registry as \"citizen scientists.\" This allowed us to generate the largest data set reported to date on vaccine safety and efficacy(including boosters) across all major blood cancer and treatment types. This information has helped patients, healthcare providers, and public health officials make more informed choices about COVID-19 prevention. CLINICAL TRIALS BEAT AML MASTER TRIAL Beginning November 2016, LLS launched the Beat AML Master Trial, a collaborative clinical trial testing several novel targeted therapies for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) designed to facilitate FDA approval of new drugs and change the treatment paradigm for patients diagnosed with AML by developing more individualized, effective treatment approaches. The Master Trial involves collaborations with multiple medical institutions, drug companies, a genomic provider, a clinical research organization, and the FDA, all of whom have committed to working collaboratively. In fiscal year 2021, up to 35 patients participated in Clinical Trials under the Beat AML Master Trial.

The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) offers an array of free, comprehensive resources to blood cancer patients, caregivers, families and friends of patients, advocates, healthcare professionals and the public. LLS is committed to providing the most accurate and up-to-date blood cancer information. Professional volunteer clinical advisors work with LLS staff to review all of the information LLS provides through healthcare professional and patient education programs, publications and the LLS website. Support services are provided by professionals or rigorously trained peer volunteers. All resources are provided through a variety of media - print, online, by phone, and face-to-face in communities. A number of resources are available in Spanish for patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Our financial assistance programs aim to lessen the economic toll on patients and families to help patients afford life-saving treatments. To counter continually rising drug prices and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19, we provided more than 45,000 patients with over $241M in total grants, a 70% increase over last year. The lion's share-over $234 million- supported patients' insurance premiums and treatment-related co-pay and co-insurance out of pocket costs through our Co-Pay Assistance Program. In keeping with our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, LLS recognizes that need exists throughout all geographic regions and within all patient populations, including those traditionally underrepresented. In 2021, financial assistance was provided to patients who resided in 55% of all U.S. counties and 51% of the counties across the U.S. with the highest poverty rates.
