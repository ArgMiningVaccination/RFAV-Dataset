When working with clients, we take into consideration how race, class, gender, sexuality, and other social systems intersect to shape people's experiences. As a result, we practice psychotherapy, consultation, and training that affirms the value of difference. Our clinical and educational practice is not limited to a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Rather, we incorporate multiple modalities including mind/body therapies, cognitive-behavioral treatment, expressive therapies, relational and psychodynamic therapies. Art, music, meditation, and movement are incorporated into sessions when appropriate. Our role as therapists is to help our clients recover their true sense of self by learning to make healthier choices and improving relationships with themselves and others. We believe that therapy can be an empowering, fulfilling experience. To achieve this, we create a judgment-free environment where open dialogue and positive change can happen. lgbtqia + sex-positive and people of color inclusive specialization A brief list of what Balance Psychotherapy specializes in: anxiety - depression - perinatal mood disorders - fertility - life transitions - relationship issues - trauma- shame recovery, grief and loss - racial identity exploration "}
