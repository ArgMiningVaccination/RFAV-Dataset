There is a lack of infor mation available for children to learn about the simple herbal remedies used by their ancestor s even though herbal remedies are commonly used in this country. These plant remedies are both culturally and medically significa nt. People use herbal medicine to a great extent without consulting medical professionals. Therefore, a research based herbal ABC book would be a significant addition to children's literature in this coun try, both as infor mation for children and adults, and as a conversation starter in the medical practitioner's office. 4 Table of Contents Chapte r 1 Introduction 6 Folk Medicin e Overview 7 A Brief Chronology of Herbals and Herbal Healing Construed from Barbara Griggs' 1991 Book, Green Pharmacy: The History and Evolution of Western Herbal Medicine 8 Old Ways and New 19 Old Ways Beco me New 19 The Significance of Relearn ing Our Traditions 21 Simple and Natural 23 A Propo sal 24 Problem State ment 25 Assu mptions and Li mitations 25 Definitions 25 Significance of Project 27 Chapte r 2 Revie w of Literature 28 Herbs are Commonly Used 28 Reliable Research and Better Education 36 Folk Re medies a re Val uable Cult urally and Medically 40 Summary 44 5 Contents Chapter 3 Procedures 47 Proble m/Purpose 47 Audience 48 Tools 48 Procedures 49 Chapter 4 Project (acco mpanies paper) 51 Chapter 5 Conclusions and Recom mendations 52 Summary 52 Conclusions 55 Recommendations for further study 56 Reference List 57 v 6 Chapter 1 Introducti on The Evolution of Modern Medicine (as imagined and adapted by Jim Duke from Internet surf castings) 8,000,000 years ag o: One chi mp to have a tummy his tumm y). chimpanzeze) years ag ag o: \"Here, Ho mo, eat t hese bitter herbs a nd leave so me for the Leakeys to find!\" (in humanoid sign language) 2500 B.C.: \"Here, Man, eat these bitter , etc.) A.D. 0: \"The savior is borne!

Here, eat these bitter s. And pray they will help you (95 7 percent of A mericans, but only 33 pe rcent of psychologists are reported to pray)\" (Duke, 1999, p.vi). Dr. James Duke, in his witty way, ill uminates the evolution of herbal medicine from the dawn of man through modern ti mes. Along the way, herbal medicine has morphed from standard practice to amusing folklore appeari ng in various folktales back -to-basics heali ng. Folklore - the traditional belie fs, myths, tales, and practices of a people, trans mitted orally (The American Heritage College Dictionary, 2007, p. 538). Folk medicine - traditional medicine as practiced by nonprofessional healers or embodied in local custom or lore, generally involvin g the use of natural and especially herbal remedies (The American Heritage College Dictionary, 2007, p. 538). Folk tales continue to be so popular that the American popula r cultur e has not only written them down, but major movie studios have made billions of dollars as a result of depicting these stories on the silver screen, both ani mated and live action (Petit, retrieved February 2, 2008). Folk dance is kept alive through active clubs devoted to specifi c genre s such as squar e dancing , Native American dancing, and ballroom dancing . Folk music has been flourishing since long before the invention of vinyl allowed for recording of music, although its popularity ebbs and flows with ti me. Folk medicine has seen an incredible resurgence as people look to return to a more natural way of living and desire to have a more active part in their own healt h and well-being (Pela , 2003 , p. 55). Folk Medicine Overview Most hi storians make little mention of folk medicine pr actices as part of medic al history. They trace the beginnings of orthodox or conventional medicine to the practices 8 of officia l medicin e, or medicine practiced by those with for mal university training, neglecting to reflect that the beginning of all medicinal practice was man using that which he found in nature to heal his ailments and keep him healthy (Hatfield, 2004, p. xvii). Folk medicine is a part of the history of both medicine and of people. The healing traditions included in t he folk medicine of North A merica e ncompass those that long ago traveled here from Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as those that originated on the contine nt as Native American traditions. In ancient ti mes, healing was handled either by a village healer or at ho me with methods known to every homemaker. Much of this healing used the plants that grew around villages or ho mes. Once upon a ti me, this knowledge was passed down through generations from healer to healer or si mply from parent to child. The origins of many existing folk re medies are difficult to trace, as cultures mingled and exchanged info rmation as years we nt by. The traditio nal kn owledge that these forefathers brought were shared, borrowed, stolen and eventually blurred (Hatfield, 2004, p. xix). This knowledge then was passed down through the generation s to the local healer, be it a shaman, curandero, granny healer, or witch doctor . But the everyda y aches and pains of f amily members and ne ighbors were still tended to by the people the mselves. A Brief Chronology of Herbals and Herbal Healing Const rued from Green Pharmacy: The History and Evolution of West ern Herba l Medic ine (Griggs, 1991). A grave of a Neanderthal man of 60,000 years ago is found with medicinal herb remnants surrounding the body. Seven of these eight plants are still used medicinally today. In almost all primitive trib es both ant hropologic ally and li ving in remote are as 9 today, a medicine -man or wo man held the medical knowledge in secrecy, to be passed down to a successor when his/her death w as near. Everyday ailments, however, were remedied with plants whose effects were common knowledge th roughout the tribe. An herbal mate rial medica was slowly built by each tribe or civilization o ver the years based on local plants. Eventua lly, this knowledge surfaced as part of various medieval herbals (Griggs, 1991, p. 5-10) In 2800 B.C. the Pen Ts'ao of Chinese herbalist Shen Nung lists 366 plant drugs. By 1500 B. C. ancient temple carvings showed medicinal plants being brought back to Egypt from Syria. The first known herbal, dated from the fourth centu ry B.C., was written when oral tradition could no longer be relied upon. From ancient Greece, it was called the Rhizotomika of Diocle s of Carystius , who was a pupil of Aristotle. Hippocrates (468-377 B.C.) emphasized a balanced and holistic approach to healing, such as the medical traditions in Ancient China, India and Egypt (Griggs, p. 14, 1991; Hoff man, 2003, p. 6). Crataeus, the personal physician of Mithridates V1 Eupator, King of Pontus, wrote an herbal in the first centur y B.C. and included illustrations of the healing plants. Also in the first centur y B.C. Dioscorides, an army surgeon from Asia Minor, wrote an herbal bringing together all the current medical information on plants and other drugs available and putting them in one work, called Peri hulas iatrike s, better known by the Latin na me De Materia Medica . This also include d illustrat ions and descriptions of each plant so almost anyone could recognize them even without botanical training. Galen (A.D. 131 -200), a successful physician schooled in medicine in Alexandria and personal physician to the E mperor Marc us Aurelius, used the Hippocratic teaching of 10 four humours to create a rigid system of medicine, which was used faithfully in European medical practices for the next 150 years. He wrote Peri krateos kai dunameos ton naplon pharmakon , an herbal material medica that classified plants according to their impact on the four humours. Thus began a g reat d ivide between professional physicians who ascri bed to Galen's teachings, and the traditional healers, whose p lant remedies wo rked gently and thoroughly, but not always quick ly. Purging and blood -letting became popular with professional physicians, to quickl y achiev e chang e and affect bodily processes. Traditional knowledge of plants in Britain was common before the Roman invasion, and after the last of the Ro man culture died out, Angles, Saxons and Danes overran the country. By the sixth centur y A.D., a school of physicians developed at Myddfai in Wales with a rational rather than a priestly approach to medicine. Then Christianity arrived in England, with traditions of monks as the keepers of medicinal knowledge. These monks studied and kept medicinal knowledge alive throughout the Dark Ages, as th eir duty was to ca re for the sick as skillfully as possi ble. Until the eleventh and twelfth centuries, monasteries w ere the only training places for physicians. King Alfred (870-899) of England encouraged medical texts to be translated into English such as the fifth century Herbariu m by Apuleius Platonic us during his reign. He imported scholars to his country to help establish the schools and monasteries where theses translations occurred. These were used by mistresses of households and leeches, which was the term for a doctor at that time. In the ea rly tenth century t he Leech Bo ok of Bald was written, and included the best of Greek and Ro man medical literature. The holistic approach of the Myddfai physicians in Wales was passed down throug h a particularl y skille d doctorin g family for over a thousand years, from the eighth 11 until the eighteenth ce ntury. Their approach to medicine was similar to the plain country style of the people, using infusions and poultices of single, simple herbs found in abundance in the countryside. Avicenna (980-1037), a highl y respecte d Arab practitioner from Baghdad, wrote the As-Qanum , or Canon of Medicin e. He had studied the works of Dioscori des, Galen and Hippocrates and with his mental acuity and passion for order, became thought of as the supre me authority in medical knowledge. The medieva l physician s who were trained at universities subscribing to his theories were known as mouthing -doctors, as opposed to surgeons, who were referred to as wound -doctors. Arabs contributed greatly to the field of material medica because they were so skilled at making and compounding medicines, which were then sold in apothecaries (Griggs, 1991, p. 24-25). In the small southern Italian town of Salerno, also in the tenth centur y, a book of preventive medicine and hygiene was written in the tradition of Hippocrates called Regimen Sanitatis (Griggs, 1991, p. 22 -23). Nicolaus of Byzantiu m, compiled the Antidot arium Magnum, full of directions for co mpounding elaborate spiced concoctions that soon became standardized through out Europe. Animal and mineral substances were often included in compounds in Medieval Europe, drawing from European folk -medicine, as well as Egyptian, Babylonian and Arab pract ices. These ela borate medicines were very profitable for the apothecaries, as opposed to the simple plant remedies t hat grew wild and were available to everyone. The physi cians profite d too, since these intricate formulas were much too co mplex for the mere layman to handle (Griggs, 1991, p. 27). 12 The Black Death that fell upon Europe in 1348 leveled the playing field between highly -trained physicians and uneducated p easant healers. Neither was able to competently treat or c ure this disea se. Herbal bo oks were steadily circ ulated at t his time, mainly in wealthy households where the lady of the manor would use them to guide her in her household duty of providing first aid and simple doctoring for her fa mily and the villag e poor (Griggs , 26-31). King Henry VIII (1491 -1547 ) of England was keenly interested in medicine. Commonly, the housewives of the kingdom made medicines with herbs as p art of their necessary c hores. In 1512, Parlia ment passed the first of several acts to regulate the practice of medicine. In 1518 , the College of Physicians was set up as a formal regulatory body. Because of the bickering between the Physicia ns, Surgeons, Surgeon -Barbers, and apothecaries a law was enacted to legalize a new class of practitioner. This act is known as the Quack's Charter by doctors and as the Herbalist's Charter by modern herbalists. Physicians during this ti me were highly trained in classical studies and theory, with a degree from Oxford or Ca mbridge taking up to fourteen years to attain. It was quite irritating to them that amate ur doctors ar med with herbals of simple remedies could call themselves doctors (Griggs, 1991, Chapter 5). Though many libraries possessed Latin h erbals, the first English one, the Grete Herbal, came out in 1526. In the early sixteenth century, a French physician, John Ruellius produced a t hree volu me reference work called De natur a stirpium , based on the texts of Dioscorides. But it became obvious that many plants existed that Dioscorides had never seen, and so the writing of a co mplete herbal was a daunting, if not i mpossible, task to undertake. The Vertuose Boke of Distyllacion was published in 1527 in Ger many by 13 Hierony mus Brunschwig. This was a manual of instructions about distillin g wate r from herbs, insects, and bits of animals for medicinal use. As a result, by the end of the century, every house that could afford one had a still room where house wives could distill their own curing waters. Conra d Gesne r produce d The Treasure of Euonymus in England in 1559 . He theorized that the use of chemistry in medicine was respectable and could be traced back to the Greeks. This meant using minerals mixed with herbs and distilling these poisons to a harmless but medically effective state. In 1597 Herbal or General Histori e of Plante s was publishe d in Englan d by Master -Surgeon John Gerard. Most physicians in the sixtee nth and seventeenth centuries had no interest in investigating the actions of si mple plants for the mselves, and thus relied on the co mpounds produced by apothecaries. The seventeent h centur y saw the average housewife using a distillery to make perfu mes, medicines and lotions. She also was expected to cook, brew, weave and preser ve, since the nearest apot hecary may have been a day's ride away. Women in the seventeenth century treated their healing remedy recipes like their cookery recipes. Written down on scraps of papers kept in a box, traded with friends, these, along with a basic herbal were standard items in a household. Some wo men took this role as healer very seriou sly and thus beca me the medical consulta nt for t he community when an illness struck. The most popular herbal by far was Gerard's. Do mestic books beca me all the rage, and Gervase Markha m's The English House -wife was published and successfu l in , 64-65). 14 The College of Physicians felt very possessive about their secrets of medicine, so often their professional works were published in Latin, a language in which the lay person was rarely fluent. The London Pharmacopoeia is an example of this. Nicholas C ulpeper (1616 -1654) followed his Cambridge education by setting up an apothecary in a deca ying slum in London. While there, he translated the Latin London Pharmacopoeia into English as the Physicall Director y. He also criticiz ed the work for not using the English na mes for plants in an attempt to keep the information away from common folk. Two years later, he produce the legendary work English Physician which contained methods and practices for man to use when he is sick and used only plants that grew in England, since they were most appropriate for English bodies. This body of work has forty -one editions listed in the British Library and a facsi mile edition was publis hed as recentl y as 1979 (Griggs , 1991 , Chapte r 8; Culpeper, 1990 reprint from 1814 edition). The settlers in New England brought their herbals and even so me seeds and plants with them from England. They im mediately noticed the robust health of the native peoples on this new continent, and observed that their material medica was al most entirely her bal. The In dians used the se plants singly and si mply in decoctions, infusions, poultices or ointments. The arrogance of the few Englis h physician s who travele d to New England disallowed any real exchanging of medical knowledge with the natives whom they thought were savages and irrational with their healing ceremonies and their view that nature, mind, body and spirit were insepar able. Those in the large settle ments had very li mited contact with Indians, but the pioneers who live d on the outskirts learned from the Indians about the plants that grew around them, and housewives eagerly added these remedies to their collections. In 1663 John Josselyn ca me to the New World with 15 the intention of discovering rarities in natural and physical things. After years of observing the Indian use of herbs, he published New Englands Rarities Discovered (Grigg s 1991 , Chapte r 9). The seventeent h centur y in England was notorious for bad health. Doctors' reputations were at an all time low as treatments were quite unpleasa nt and disease was rampant. The fees they charged, however, were still high. Apothecaries made high profits from selling expensive compounds instead of simple herbal remedies, and also gave out plenty of medical advice. The Plague hit, and confidence in doctors became almost zero. In these circu mstances, charlat ans and quacks flourished, as well as serious fo rms of what we now call alternative medicine. The sixteenth , seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw a very lucrati ve and flourishing import export business in plant -drugs . Exoti c cures were all the rage, though folk-medicine traditions were still vigorous all over Europ e. The professional looked with scorn on these ho megrown re medies. In 1772 the first American herbal appeared. It was act ually a smaller, v egetable section of a larger materia medica writte n by Dr. Samuel Stearn s of Massachusetts . In the late eighteenth century America opened its first regular medical school in Philadelphia. People mostly sought treatment from their apothecaries, of which there were plenty. These apothecaries sold mostly imported medici nes, but later would use English contai ners and fill them with A merican medicine. William Withering (1741 -1799 ) published A Botanical Arrangement of all the Vegetables Naturally Growing in Great Britain with Descriptions of the Genera and Species according to Linnaeus in 1776 . A botanic work rather than an herbal, this to me is 16 noted for its brevity of comments on medicinal values of plants, although he wrote enthusiastically about foxglove and its possibilities. In 1785 he publishe d Account of Foxglove. A diuretic, emetic, and sedative, this plant seemed to help the sympto ms of heart disease, though dosage was a proble m, and many died (Griggs, 1991, Chapter 13). John Wesley (1703 -1791 ) of England, the founder of Methodis m, wrote Primitive Physic or An Easy and Natural Way of Curing Most Diseases in 1747 . Dr. William Buchan from Scotland published Domestic Medicine in 1769. Both of these were meant for the common people to use in their personal healing practices. The A merican War for Independence showca sed to colonists the incon venience of relying on imported drugs. The Napoleonic Wars in Europe brought this fact home overseas as well, and also affected American sources of medicine. Dr. Johann David Schopf stayed in A merica after serving with German troops for the British during the Revolutionary War to embark on a plant hunti ng tour of A merica. He wrote the first Materia Medica Americana cataloging over 400 native medicinal plants in 1783 ( Griggs, 1991, p. 152) . Samuel Tho mson (1769 -1843) of New H ampshire saw the decline of an already minimal use of roots and herbs in medicine, as the heroic practices of blood -lettin g and purging took hold. He eventually patented a System of Practice that include d four separate Course s of Medicin e and called it Thomson's Improved System of Botanic Practice of Medicine (1822 ). His i dea was to a ppoint an a gent in each city to pro mote his syste m, and sell Famil y Right s for use of it for twenty doll ars, which would also allow the purchaser to beco me a me mber of the Friendly Botanic Societ y. This was very appealing 17 to the common people, but Tho mson wanted to appea l to the educated , and sophisticated in society, too. This did not occur (Griggs, 1992, Chapter 15). Peter S mith published The Indian Doctor's Dispensatory in 1813 . In 1814 Samuel Henry produced the New and Complete American Medical Family Herbal in New York. These were very popular with the westward pioneers. In 1817 William Barton pu blished Vegetable Materia Medica of the United States. In 1832 Dr. William Woodville wrote a five-volume book called Medical Botan y, which was the last proper herbal to be written in England for the next one hundred and fifty years. Dr. Alber t Isaiah Coffi n (1791 -1866) from America studied heroic medicine but was converted to botanical re medies when he was cured of a devastating illness by a Native A merican wo man selling hand -made b askets. Suffering from tuberculosis, Coffin was lying in his bed as a boy when the Seneca I ndian wo man stopped at his ho me to ask for a drink of cider. She saw the sic kly child and offered to cure him for a gallon of cider. His mother agreed, and the woman reappeared with an apronfu l of herbs . He recovered, and immediately began applying his considerable medical talents to natural healing practices (Griggs, 1991, p. 198-204). He travele d to Europ e and ended up in England, touting herbal remedies as the best method of treatment for people and publishing the very popula r Coffin's B otanical Jo urnal monthly from 1847 to 1859 . It eventually boasted a readership of 10,000 and its success showed herbal medicine was beco ming mainstream once again. The conventional p ractitioners took aim at him through their professional journal, The Lancet (Griggs, 1991, Chapter 18). The Industrial Revolution made its way into the medical world, and materia medicas soon were filled with orga nic compounds artificially prepared. In 1847 in 18 Philadelphia, the American Medical Assoc iation was established. The regular medical profession was alarmed by the repeals of legis lation restrictin g medical practice to those officially licensed. This came about as a result of the influx of Tho msonian practice and its use of purgatives and emetics, al ong with Ecl ectic practices focusing on healing with any beneficial substance one chooses, and Homeopathy with its philo soph y of like curing like when given in minute, diluted amounts. Pasteur's discovery of the role of microorganis ms in fe rmentation and spoila ge, as well as his develop ment of vaccines to isolate and weaken germs in 1881 revolutionize d medicine. In 1910 the Flexner Report revealed atrocious conditions in many American medical schools to the public. This report, in effect , close d down medical schools of sect beliefs such as eclecticism and homeopathy, and rendered botany unnecessary to pharmaceutical studies (Griggs, p. 250). In 1928 Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, and its use during World War II s aved countless soldiers from succu mbing to venereal disease. In 1931 in London, Hilda Leyel publis hed A Moder n Herba l, based on the encyclopedic knowledge of plants gathered and reported in pamphlets by Mary Grieve. In her introduction, Leyel la ments t he lack of new herbals and describes the need of an herba l that include s both the traditional lore about the plants and their properties, as well as the modern use of standardized extracts and tinctures (Leyel, 1931, p. xiii) In 1976 a scientific com mittee in England ca me out with a compilation called the British Her bal Pharmacopoei a, in respons e to new Ministr y of Health require ments that herbal remedies may be considered legal if they appeared in a standard reference book with monographs and a history of usage without ill-effect. 19 Old Ways and New For a time, traditional practices and official medicine exi sted togeth er. With the advent of t he vacci nation and the di scovery of penicillin, ho wever, official medicine exploded with new laboratory -made concoctions that were powerful and effective. These synthetic medicines, often based on plant constit uents, were considered so much better than the gentler, slower results achieved through traditional remedies that conventio nal practitioners ceased usi ng the whole plants altogether. (Griggs, 1991, p. 261-263, p. 247- 251). Even while this new conventional medicine and its proponents atte mpted to dista nce itself from the si mple re medies of the common people, the people the mselves kept this traditional knowledge and continued to quietly use the re medies they trusted and knew (Gladstar, 1993, p. 20 -21). As ti me went on, however, medicine beca me largely a realm for the official doctors, and the knowledge of the traditional ways was mostly lost. Old Ways Become New Today, the re mnant of folk healing tradit ions has come to be known as alternative medicine, or Co mplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and alternative medicine has beco me mainstream (Gevitz, 1988, p. viii). Many magazine and newspapers offer articles about various alternative therapi es including herbal remedies, meditation, yoga, aromatherapy, ho meopathy, massage, and ac upuncture . Referenc e book s are produce d by reliable publishers and appear in public and academic library collectio ns. Research is being done, albeit sparsely, on the effecti veness of so me of the more widely known traditional remedies. Unfortunately, the scienti fic methods used to research effectiveness of plants cannot, by definition, recreate the environ ment where these methods have been shown to be successful through anecdotal evidenc e (Pela, 2003 , p. 62). Scientists 20 inevitably remove the constituent of the plant thought to be active in healing, standardize it, isolate it, and te st it on individ uals while attempting to c ontrol other variables. Traditionally, these plants are used in their whole fo rm, either decocted into tea form or macerated into an alco hol or gl ycerin based extract. Those who use these herbal remedies successfully state that t he effective ness of the a ctive co nstituent is o ften based on the other constituents in the plant. The whole plant contains properties t hat may preve nt the active constituent from beco ming toxic, or may boost the healing that takes place (Balch, 2002, p. 8). People concerned with their health are beco ming more educated about various options of treat ment and prevention of disea se. Whether motivated by cost savings , or the desire to feel more in control of their own health, many are t urning to natural remedies to aid in their seeking of health and wellness. So me people are weary of being treated as a disease and not a whole person. The idea of treating the whole person, or holistic medicine, is another attractive feature of herbal medicine (Navarra, 2004, p. xviii). Herbal practitio ners are overwhel mingly holistic practitioners. They see the connecti on of body, mind and spirit and to the natural world, as did the Native A merican culture during colonial times. Doctors are more often acce pting, and reco mmend natural therapies for their patients as alter natives or complements to the phar maceuticals t hat are routinely prescribed (Associated Press, 2005, http://www. msnbc.c om/id/8048627/print/1/ display mode/1098/). People are intrigued by t hese new age therap ies. They may resonate on some deep, ancestral level. Most people in this country are descendents of immigrants. The folklore of their families has b een larg ely lost as past generations tried so hard to beco me Americanized and modernized. Even Native A mericans have lost much of their 21 stories as ti me has marched forward. They are reaching s olidly for more natur al, self- empowering solutio ns to their health issues, and a connection to the larger world. These traditional healing ways, though not openly used for awhile, never completely went away. The gap between grandparents, or great -grandparents and this generatio n is filled, albeit sparsely, by infor mation written do wn by herbalists and maintained through the years. The Signifi cance of Rel earning Our Traditions The folk tradition of healing passed down from our ancestors has become a new age medicine of our cutting edge future. From home remedy to alternati ve medicine - the name has changed, but the idea is the same; using natural, plant based products to assist in health and wellness. People are looking for simple, natural ways to cope with symptoms of everyday disease and brought on by daily life. Newsp apers and magazines continue to report on the use and effectiveness of alternative medicine in this country. According to the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, more than half of Americans are using so me sort of alter native therapy; most often herb supple ments (Mayo Clinic Staff, 20 07, http:/ /www .mayoclinic.co m/health/alternative - medicine/PN00001). Even so, alternative medicines have yet to find their way into infor mational literature for elementary or even high school students. More and more medical schools are requiring classes in what they term Comple mentary and Alternative Medicine, or CAM for their students as they realize th at pati ents are using them with or without a physician's consent or approv al (Associate d Press, 2005 , http://www .msnbc. com/id/8048627/print/1/display mode/1098/). 22 The effectiveness of herbal re medies continues to be disputed by so me medical researchers, yet all indications are that they are not going away this time. A lung cancer patient who has been through six separate and physically devastating chemo -therapy regimens may, appropriately, question the effec tiveness of t hese pre scribed and medically accepted p harmaceuticals, even while pay ing th ousands of dollars f or each dose; especially when the end result is continued growth of cancer cells, and continued expensive attempts at conventional thera pies. Yet these therapies are approved and sanctioned by our medical experts. It may not be appropriate, then, for these experts to dismiss herbal therapies as ineffe ctive or contra -indicated for a condition. There is a gap between the co mputer age and the ancestral folklore of herbal healing. This country is continually passing legislation and for ming com mittees to study how to better educate children. Techno logy undergoes changes and arguably, i mproves swiftly with no apologies to those left behind . The school s try valiantl y to keep up with trends, popular learning theories and political agendas. In the continued efforts to keep up with changes, curriculu ms may have left behind so me important educational opportunities for our children. The parents of t hese children use herbal re medies or so me other form of complementary and/or alternative medicine frequently (Navarra, 2004, p. xix). According to a study done for the National Center for Complementary and Altern ative Medi cine at the Natio nal Institutes of Health, over one h alf of peopl e in the United States use co mplementary and alter nativ e medicin e (May http://www. mayoclinic.co m/health/alternative -medicine/PN00001). These re medies have once again gained popularity in co mmon culture. Medical schools are including CAM classes in their curricul um (Associated Press, 2005). People are getting fed up with rising 23 health care costs and the feelings of helplessness acco mpanied by many conventional treatments. People find info rmation on various alternative h ealth modalities from a variety of popular media sources. There are per iodicals devoted entirely to the subjec t of natural health care an d/or CAM's, s uch as Self, Natural Health, Preventi on and Body & Soul. Simple and Natural Life see ms, in many w ays, not to be si mple. People awaken, rush to get themselves and their loved ones ready for the day, catch buses and get in cars to go to jobs and school where life depends on perfo rmance and ac hievement, then back in to the modes of transportation to rush off to sports e vents, club and social activities, grab a bite to eat so mewhere, and rush ho me to do the work necessary to get ready for the next day, where one repeats the process. It's no wond er that people are looking for a simpler, more natur al way of life, or at least to infuse some naturalness into their lives. The simple, commonsense approach of herbal medicine speaks to this desire of gettin g back to nature and feeling more in control of one's life. It responds to the desir e of peopl e to be treated as a physical, spiritual and thoughtful being, not just a symptom. Peopl e recogniz e the connection between the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of their beings, and are seeking more holistic modes of healing and wellness. Herbal remedies, with their connection to nature and their multi -layered healing aspects, are beco ming more popular and offer ing people an opportunity to not only heal themselves, but to heal the earth as well. Plants need good soil, sunshine and clean water to thrive, as do humans. Plants learn to adapt to their surroundings, and thrive where they are planted. Plants contain the knowledge of their ancestors, which allows them to secure 24 a place in t he future. Plants contain a myriad of components that protect them and help them survive in this ever changing world. These same components are available for people to use in their o wn healing. All that is needed is the knowledge of the plants' medicinal action and the desire to make holistic health a priority. A Proposal The knowledge of traditional herbal remedies is important both from an historical perspective and as a current, legitimate form of co mplementary and alter native thera py. People no longer take the ir children out into the woods and fields and point out the plants that help with every day ailments. Even if people had the knowledge, many do not have the ti me. Adults have the advantage of learning a little about herbal remedies from their popular magazines. Many adults, however, would benefit from a lifelong awareness of these si mple medicines. The knowledge of simple plant remedies, though buried and hidden for so long, is c oming back. This knowledge can beco me com monplace once again. Our children can grow up learning about simple herbal re medies from plants that grow around them, or are readily available in health food stores. Children learn by doing, and they learn by watching, and they learn by reading. An herbal remedy ABC book would be a way for children to learn not only the alphabet, but about so me simple, traditional healing plants that grow around them and might help them feel better one day. At least, children can be made aware that there are alternatives to conventional medicine. Perhaps parents will benefit as well. 25 Problem St ateme nt There is a lack of information available for children to learn about the simple herbal remedies used by their ancestors even though herbal remedies are commonly used in this country. Assumptio ns and Limitations The assu mption made for this research p roject is that children, as well as their parents, would be interested in readi ng a simple book about herbal remedies. The complementary and alternative medicines will be limited to herbs, other plants, and the substanc es used to make si mple herbal medicines and will n ot include other alter native methods such as meditation, yoga, aro matherapy, ho meopathy, massage, or acupuncture. This project is limited to the common plants that grow or are used abundantly in this country, and also by the traditional medicinal u ses that can be found in published herbals. Definitions alternative medicine - any of various syste ms of healing or treating disease (such as chiropractic, ho meopathy, faith healing) not inc luded in the traditional medical curricula taugh t in the U.S. and Britia n (Merria m-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition [M. -W.

These plant remedies are both culturally and medically significant. People use herbal medicine to a great exte nt without c onsulting medical profes sionals. Therefore, a re search based her bal ABC book would be a significa nt addition to the children's literat ure in this country. Children will have a little background as they grow up in a culture of significant complementary and alternative medicine use. 28 Chapter 2 Review of Liter ature Research has been conducted to deter mine the extent of the use of herbs and the demographics of users. Much of the research is based on data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a survey of general health practices conducted annually since 1957. Studies indicate that complementary and alternative medicine, and herbal remedies in particular, are commonly used in this country. Health care practitioners must be learned in t hese modalities to b etter serve and protect their p atients. Re searchers must continue to update and standar dize methods of validating herbal efficacy, and acknowledge that infor mation in historical texts have significance in helping find cures and sy mptom relief from botanical medicines . Further , folk remedies are still significant as a means of self care and cult ural history to many people in this country as well as having valuable infor mation for researchers and doctors to use. Reliable information about common herbal remedies should be availab le to all people. Research related to this premise fall into t hree categories: use of herbs, research efforts to validate the use of herbs and the value of herbal alternatives. Herbs are Commonly Used The commo n use in this countr y of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been documented by Eisenberg, Davis, Ettner, Appel, Wilkey, Ro mpay, and Kessler in their 1998 follow -up to the data gathered from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in 1990. The NHIS is a nationally representative household survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population. This pu blic use survey is considered to be the most comprehensive source of population data on health in the U.S. and allows 29 researchers to calc ulate nation al representative estimates of key health indicators. This surve y consiste d of face-to -face interview s with one member of each household studied, and the interviewer used a hand -held computer to code conditional responses and perform real-time consiste ncy checks. The purpose of the Eisenberg survey was to docu ment trends in alternative medicine use in the United States from 1990 to 1997, in light of the results of a prior survey in 1990 which clearly docu mented high prevalence in alternative medicine use. Esti mated costs of th erapies and patient disclosure of alternative therapy use to physicians was also measured. Telephone surveys were conducted in 1991 to 1539 adults and in 1997 to 2055 adults (1998, p. 1569 -1570). Survey methods were approved by the Beth Israel Deac oness In stitutional Review Board in Boston, Mas sachusetts. The sociode mographic characteristics of the survey sample were si milar to t he natio nal population distributions published by the US Bureau of Census. So me of the patterns that Eisenberg et al. found included increases in use by the general population from 1990 to 1997 (p. 1571) . Alternative therapy use was more common a mong wo men than men, among people aged 35 to 49 than among other ages, higher by those with some college education than those with less and more common among tho se with annual inco mes over $50,000 than those with lower inco mes. The percentage of people using alternative therapies jumped from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997 . The largest increases were in herbal medicine usage, massage, megavita mins, self -help groups, folk re medies, energy healing and homeopathy (p. 1572). The estimated expenditure of A mericans on alternative therapy practit ioners in 1990 was $14.6 billion and increased to $21.2 billion by 1997 (p. 1573). Despite the dramatic increase in usage and expenditures by American on alternative therapies, the rate of patient disclosure to physicians re mains 30 low. Eisenberg, et al. suggested that this current status quo of don't ask, don't tell must be abandoned and strategies for dialogue in this area must be develop ed so that physicians are b etter able to tre at patients and a void p ossible dangerous interactions between drugs and herbs. They concluded that a more proactive posture must be adopted by federal agencies, acade mic institutions, priva te corporations and foundations concerning research, educatio nal curricula, and referral guidelines for comple mentary and alternative therapies (p. 1575). Saydah and Eberhardt (2006) conducted a study to deter mine the extent of use of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM) among adults diagnosed with chronic diseases. The data from the 2 002 National He alth Intervie w Surve y (NHIS ) were used by the authors to co mpare the use of CAM by people with co mmon chronic disease to use by those who did not report having a chronic illness. The interviews were conducted in person, and the response rate was 74.3%. This survey included a series of questions specifically related to CAM use as a supple ment to the survey at large. If a respondent answered affirmatively to the query as to whether they ha ve ever used CAM, then t he interviewe rs continued with the supplemental questions. For purposes of this survey CAM is divide d into four categories : (1) biologically based practices such as herb use, diets, vitamins; (2) complete syste ms of theory a nd practice s uch as acup uncture or Ayurveda; (3) mind-body medicine such as meditation and guided i magery; and (4) manipulative practices such as chiropractic or massage (2006, p. 806). The results of this study showed that adults with chronic disease were more likely to report having used CAM than those report ing no chronic disease and t hat the use of biologically based CAMs was most frequ ently reported followed by mind-body and 31 manipulative, then complete syste ms (2006, p. 809). The authors ' findings indicated that CAM use in this country, particularly b iologicall y based therapies , was commo n and more lik ely to be used by those with chronic illness. A report ed low level of communication with healthcare providers about this use was seen as a notable factor. Kennedy (2005) also investigated the level of use of herbal and dietary supple ments in the United States in his study . The researcher was particularly interested in analyzing the data by gender, national origin, age, region of residence, education level, and income level. Health status and usage were also looked at. The data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of households in the United States were used in this study. Kennedy perfor med a second ary analysis of the complementary and alternative (CAM) supple ment to this survey (2005, p. 1847). Thirty -one thousand forty -four adults representing a cross -section of the national civilian, u ninstit utionalized population were surveyed. Of these, 632 were o mitted due to incomplete survey infor mation. A total of 5,787 adults reported using natural herbs during the past 12 months when this study was perfor med. This extrapolates to ~38.2 million adults in t he United States or about 18. 9% of the population (2 005, p. 1847). The first part of Kennedy's study showed the num bers of individuals using each of 35 herb or nutritional supple ments. It also showed whether the respondent used one, two three, four, or more than four of the listed supple ments. The top four herbs were echinacea, ginseng, gingko and garlic supple ments. About 48% of those surveyed used 2 or more of the herbs listed (2005, p. 1850). A second part of the study addressed the sociodemographic and socioecono mic factors associated with herb and supplemental use. Statistically, wo men were more likely 32 to use herbs than men, middle -aged people more likely than other ages, with older adults being least likely to use herbs. Racially, multiple race, Asian, American Indian, Alask an native and white respondents had relatively high use rates, and black s were slightl y less likely to use herbs. Hispanics were less likely to use them than non Hispanics. Geographically the West and Northeast saw a high use co mpared to the S outh. The Midwest averaged a little less than 18% usage. Herb use was positi vely correlated with level of education and level of income (2005, p. 1851). The third analysis of the data showe d an associatio n betwee n herb use and good health and positive health behaviors. Responden ts were asked if they had seen an herbal practitioner in the past 12 months, and if they had seen and/or infor med a conventional medical professional about their herb use. While most users considered herb use to be important or so mewhat important (57.5%) on ly about 5.5 % of all respondents consulted a CAM provider, and only about 33.4% of t he total infor med a conventional medical provider about their herb use (2005, p. 1852). Finally, the study addressed whether or not people used herbs to treat specific conditions, and what conditions were treated. It also showed the degree to which the person felt they were helped by the herb, and why they used herbal treatment. Extrapolated results sh owed that ~ 21.4 million adults use herbal or natural products to treat one or more than one specific medical condition. The two most common conditions treated were head and chest c olds and sto mach or intestinal illness; 36.6% said that herbs helped a great deal and 36.5% said they provided at least some help (2005, p. 1853). From these statistics Kennedy concluded t hat greater communicat ion between physicians and patients about herbs and natural products should be a priority in this country. 33 Also in 2005 , Klein , Sesselberg , Gray , Yussman and teenage views regarding co mplementary and alterna tive medicine. The purpose of this study was to explore adolescents' knowledge of and beliefs about co mplementary and alternative medicines including herbs, dietary supple ments, and over -the-counter medications (200 5, p. 409.e1). Eighty -one adolesc ents ranging in age from 14 to 24 from Monroe County, New York , were divide d into 18 focus groups . A trained moderator facilitated the groups, a research assistant took notes, and all groups were audio taped and the tapes were transcribed. Groups were separated into older and younger groups and by gender. Subjects included those from urban and suburban environ ments, and were of white, black, or Hispanic ethnicity. Half the par ticipants were female, and three different chronic illness groups were represented and two groups had identified CAM users (p. 409.e1 -409.e2). The discussions resulted in so me interesting findings. Many teens were unfamiliar with the term alternative medicin e. However, most were familiar with herbal medicine , herbal remedie s, and nutritiona l supplements . Even those participants who were patients of alternative medicine providers were unc lear about the term alternati ve medicine . Generally, adolescents who had experience with herbs and supple ments found them to be effective, and those who did not use them tended to have negative opinions about the m. Although participants generally b elieved that it was important to tell their health care providers about CAM use, no clinician had asked them about it, excep t those with eating disorders, and then they were only asked about weight loss supple ment use. Some of the adolescents stated that they would not tell their physi cian abou t CAM use if 34 the teens believed that the doctor s woul d say they shou ld not be taking them (2005, p. 409.e3). Klein et al. concluded that knowledge and beliefs about CAM, especially home remedies, varied by ethnicity. Adol escents with chronic illnesses were more likely to be familiar with CAM therapies. An important is sue noted w as the lack of communication between health care provide rs and adolesce nts concerning CAM use. The attitude of the adolescents was that health care providers were not educated in or interested in CAM use, and they woul d be reluctant to tell the provider about their CAM use (2005, p. 409.e5 - 409.e6). Ambrose and S amuels (2004) contribu ted to the studies on herbal use by investigati ng the extent to which college students reported use and on attitudes of health care practitioners toward herbal medicine s. The twofol d purpos e of this researc h was to gain insight into the extent to which colle ge students used herbal medici nes as well as to examine the attitudes of health care professionals about herbal use (2004, p. 167). Both student s and practitioner s were given questionnaires. E ighteen hundred students at Rutgers University in New Jersey responded to this 18 question, anonymous survey through self -administration. So me questions w ere multiple -choice; some used the L ikert- like scales of a one -to-five range from strong ly agree to strongly disagree; two required lists to be written. The questions focused on demographics, herbal use, and general health. Forty health care practitioners from the Rutgers health service s responde d to eight questions a bout pra ctices and belie fs regar ding h erb use, so me multipl e-choice and s ome in the one -to-five range scale mode (p. 167 -168). 35 Overall, 51% of the college students used herbal medicines. Demographically, the median age was 21 years, with more wo men responding to the survey than men, and more wo men using herbs than men. Ethnically over 50% of whites, Asian A mericans, and African Americans used herbs, and slightly less than 50% of Hispanics and all other ethnic groups used the m. Of those students who used herbs, 34.2% could not name the herb they were using. Family and friends were cited as the greatest source for these students on advice about herb usage. Sixty -three point three percent of st udents who expected general health improvement reported experiencing that res ult. Ninety-two p oint two percent of students who expected sy mptom relief experienced that result. Sixty four point four percent achieved their goal of physical or e motional well -being; 21.1% reported no change and 3.8% of users had undes ired side effects. Users were more likely to rate their health as good than non -users (2004, p. 169). Forty of the 70 practitio ners approached filled o ut the survey for a respo nse rate of 57%. The health care practitioners (HCP who included registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians, phar macists and mental health counselors) reported asking their patients about herb use some to most of the time. They advised herb use so metimes or rarely. The HCP used herbs themselves only so metimes or rarely. Of the 28 HCPs who reported recom mending herbal therapy as part of a patient 's treat ment plan, 52.5% of the insta nces were in order to treat specific symptoms. Other were nty- five percent of HCPs responded positively when asked if they would like more professional education when it ca me to herbal medication (2004, p. 171 -172). 36 These five studies concurred that c ommunication between doctor and patient about co mplementary and alternative medicine use is lacking. This communication would be enhanced through increased physician knowledge concerning these al ternative thera pies. Reliable Research and Better Education In 2005 Cle ment, Williams, Khan, Bernard, Bhola, Fortune, Medupe, Negee and Seaforth reported on the issue of physicians' lack of knowledge of herbal remedies. They stated that t here are safety issues that must be addressed relating to adverse effects and herb-drug interactions. Most western trained physicians are ignorant of risk and benefits of herbal re medies. These researchers conducte d a cross -sectiona l surve y using a questionnaire that was interviewer -administered. One hund red and ninety four public health care physicians from six public hospitals in Trinidad were interviewed (2005, p. 2). Of those 60.4% believed that herbal re medies were beneficial to health , 40.6% had used herbs in the past, and 76.8% were satisfied with the outco me. Although 27.1% of physicians recom mended herb use to patien ts, only 15.1% could i dentify at least one herb-drug interaction (p. 3). These researchers concluded that herbal re medy use was high throughout the world, and most patients self medicate with or withou t the knowledg e of their physician. Educational intervention was recommended to deal with the contradiction that physicians showed a high level of accepta nce and a l ow level of knowledge about herbs and herb- drug interactions (2005, p. 7). Smith and Coyle (2006) addressed the belief that finding people to participate in CAM studies was difficult. The authors' concern in this study was the difficulty in 37 recruiting subjects for clinical trials of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). They used data from five cli nical trials on the efficacy of acupuncture and ginger to reduce nausea and vo miting in pregnancy. P articular attention was drawn to the recruit ment strategies in these trials (2006, p. 1). Barriers to study participation identified included time restraints, invasiveness, privacy issues and low literacy, among others. The five trials were conducted at the Women's and Children's Hospital and the Universit y of Adelaide. The authors found that trials in CAM are not more necessarily more difficult to recruit to. Media promotion tends to peak interest, offering a low effort high yield response. They addressed possible barrie rs by o ffering flexible ti mes for those participa nts with time constr aints and using referral s by doctor s to reassur e fearful participants. They also offered acupuncture treatments at no cost. Ginger is already cheap to purcha se, so this financial incentive was not evident in the ginger users. The authors concluded that there is need for more systematic str ategies for recruitment and implementation of CAM studies to help successful running and timely completion of CAM research (2006, p. 4). Standardized testing of herbal remedies is a continual concern among doctors and researchers. In 2006 Gegnier, Boon, Rochon, Moher, Barnes and Bombardier reported on a consensus meeting held with sixteen participants to develop recom mendations for reporting rando mized, controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicines. These recom mendations were based on the need to elaborate on the 22-item CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) checklist already in place. The method used to extrapolate the recom mendations was t hree-fold. Before the meeting was held, 38 participants were asked during a telephone interview to generate ite ms for revision or addition concerning the CONSORT checklis t. These pa rticipants include d 5 with expertise in the method and reporting of RCTs, 4 phar macognosy experts, 5 herbal medicinal experts, 1 expert in medical statistics , and 1 in herba l product manufacturing. These suggestions were then the matically grouped and e -mailed to each participa nt for review. Finally t he actual meeting t ook place with fourteen of the partici pants present. Each item was prese nted and debated until conse nsus e merged. A dra ft of the sum mary report was circulated to all participants as well as to the wide r CONSOR T Grou p for input and revision (2006, p. 364). No new checklist ite ms were reco mmended, but 9 items were elaborated (2006, p. 366). A table was created to show the det ailed recommendations and an example of good reporting for each recom mendation. These elab orations incl uded the use of more det ails when listing an herbal medicinal product n ame such as the bino mial Latin na me, common name, proprietary product na me, manufacturer, and product authorizat ion, if it exists. The table also elaborated on such items as the characteristics of the herb al product , the dosage regimen and descri ption, the qualitative testing, the placebo group, and t he practitioner (2006, Appendix Table p.w -71). The authors hoped that these recom mendations would be endorsed by journals that publish study results and by the au thors conducting the research. They felt it imperative that reports of RCTs provide c lear and co mplete descriptions of herbal interventio ns. Another aspect of validating herbal remedies is found in the herbal texts used long ago. The infor mation contained in these is valuabl e both as simpl e knowledg e as well as 39 guides for researchers in directions to direct their energies. In 2004 Buenz, Schnepple, Bauer, Elkin, Riddle and Motley discuss ed new technologies that are making these ancie nt texts and their i nformation more accessi ble for re searchers. According to Buenz, et al., ethnob otany faces c hallen ges from loss of traditio nal knowledge and laborious techniq ues. Historical herbal texts are beco ming increasingly valuabl e as resources docu menting tradit ional use of various species of plants as medicines. Up to this point, the methods of extracting and preserving this infor mation have been cu mberso me and ti me-consu ming. However, using new bioinfor matics data - mining syste ms with herbal texts holds great promise for identi fication of potenti ally helpful medicines (2004, p. 494). While li braries have preserved a ncient texts initially for their artefactual value, it had beco me apparent that these texts hold v aluable infor mation. For example, the authors pointed out that Gerard's The Herball containe d reference s to 18 plants to date that have been starti ng points for pharmaceuticals. Up to this point, however, there had been no efficient method of extracting this infor mation (2004, p. 494). Herbal infor mation has been detailed dating as far back as 3100 B.C. in ancient Egyptian and Sumerian texts. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identi fy with ce rtainty the plants used. Greek data is more precisely documented in works attributed to Hippocrates, where only 11 of 257 plant -based drug descr iptions remain unidentified (2004 p. 495). Recent advances in the field of data mining and bioinfor matics is making it pos sible to efficiently extract the in formation from these te xts. Origin ally, manually loading pag es in a scanner would make a 20,000 page herbal text take 4 years to scan. New, auto mated syste ms achiev e maximum scan rates of 1200 pages per hour. Several collaborative 40 projects around the world address the problem of accurately identifying plants from various descriptions in various languages. Semantic libraries exist for medical terminology and translation tool s, data warehousin g and searc h techniques are evolving rapidly (p. 497). Today, there are useful internet sites that can be used to locate names, authors and publication recor ds for plant na mes such as Tropicos and International Plant Names Index (p. 495). The authors concluded that it is beco ming easier to extract crucial and beneficial infor mation from ancient herbal texts. The in formation in these to mes is invaluable to the future of medicine. Folk Remedies are Val uable Culturally and Medically Herbal infor mation is not only passed down through historical herbal texts, but through families and cultures. So me people use herbal medicine or folk re medies that were taught to them by parents, grandparents, or other fa mily members. This aspect of traditional herbal u se will be looked at next. F olk remedies are used in this country by a variety of people. The following studies disc uss folk re medy use in Southern Appalachia and in urban black co mmunities. Infor mation regarding folk remedies including herbal medicines is accurately depicted in so me works of well -resea rched ficti on, ac cording to Strain ( 2002). The authors in her study were chosen because they all wrote about the Appalachian regions and all included folk medicine in their narratives. All novels featured folk medicine lore carefully researched and the authors portra yed this use accurately and with sensitivity to the significance of folk medicine to the c ommunities they depict (2002, p. 25). The time period spanned over one hundred years and was divided into three eras to correspond to significant changes in medical knowledge. The f irst era explores authors' works written 41 in the 1890s through the 1930s during the rise of official medicine, secondly the 1940s through the 1960s during World War II industrialization and the large growth in biomedicine, and lastly the 1970s to the present with its DNA research, cloning experi ments and the backlash against all this towards a return to folk medicine. The region described as Southern Appalachia is roughly an area of about 110,000 squar e miles that i ncludes no rtheastern Te nnessee, easter n Kentucky , wester n North Carolina, northern Georgia, and northea stern Alaba ma (2002 , p. 8-9). These may be another source used in gleaning knowledge of herbs. Strains' purpose in her study of selected works of fict ion depicting folk medicine practices in the Southern Appalachian region of the United States was to show the important ethnographic role the seven selected authors played with their accurat e depiction s of folk medicine beliefs and practices. This is significant, accor ding to Strain, because of the current rise in distrust of official medicine by patients and the return to the medical folkways of the past. The methodology used in this research was a cl ose critiq ue of each of the ten works of fiction co mpared with the extensive infor mation found by Strain that co mpiled data on folk remedies and custo ms used throughout the three time periods studied .The works and authors included The Hunter's Horn (1949 ) by Harriett e Arnow , Cold Mountain (1997 ) by Charles Frazier, The Glas s Window : A Story of the Quar e Women (1925), The Quare Women (1923), and Sight to the Blind (1914) by Lucy Fur man, The Hawk' s Done Gone (1940) by Mildred Haun, Christy (1967) by Catheri ne Marsh all, The Spirit of the Mountains (1905 fascimile) by Emma Bell Miles, and Oral History (1983) by Lee S mith (2002, p. 136 -147). These works included extensive infor mation on folk 42 medicine practices, so me from a sympath etic and others a cynical viewpoint. The common thread was the accuracy of the folkl oric infor mation in the se novels as shown through scholarly books, journals and studies cited throughou t Strain' s research. According to Strain, the end result of these work s of fictio n was that they both preserve the folk medicine knowledge of the region and remind the reader of the cultural heritage which continues to influence the future. As a bonus, they were also far more r eadable than the scholarly works that also include this folkloric infor mation (p. 133 -134). Strain concluded that certain folk remedies did exist and were used in Appalachia, and that the authors studied accurately portra yed these re medies. Further, that understanding these beliefs is i mportant as our countr y transition s from the d ependence on official medicine back to use and knowledge of the traditional methods in our past. Also, Strain offered the persp ective that science, with its fashions and fads, may beco me tomorrow's folklore. While Strain st ated th at people a re returning to more holistic models as they attempt to cope with the c omplex, technological world in which they live, the following two studies using African A merica ns as subjects would argue that folk remedies never went a way. These studies found a high percentage of use of traditional folk remedies by African Americans, contra dicting the findings of Eisenberg et al. (1998) and Kennedy (2005). In 1998 Plotkin and Post studied the prevalence and types of folk re medies (FR) used in the inner city to deter mine population utilization and attitudes towards discussing FRs with physicians. In their study, 71 patients using the inner city ambulatory clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana were interviewed. D emographic and medical infor mation was collected from the patients (1998, p. 795). Based on this infor mation, the authors 43 deter mined that 59% of the sa mple used at least one folk remedy, and 41% denied ever using one. There was no correlation shown to age. Folk remedies could be divided into two basic groups: food product and househo ld product. So me of the more common remedies involved garlic, honey, corn starch and stea m. None were considered harmful. Effectiveness was cited as the main reason the remedies were used, though some mentioned lo w cost. The majority of patients learned of folk re medies from a f amily member. Eighty -five percent said they would be comfortable tal king to their physician about their folk re medy use (p. 796). The a uthors concluded that folk remedy use was very common outside the clinic and hospital. Discussing folk re medies with their patients in a nonjudg mental fashion may help doctors be more effective in their medical care (p. 798). In a si milar vein, S mitherman, Janisse and Mathur (2004) sought to identify folk remedies used for black children in Detroit, Michigan, to treat fever, colic, and teething. Interviews were conducted with caregivers of children two years old or younger who were patients at the pediatric clinic in t he Children's Hospital of Michigan. One hundred seven i nterviews were completed with ca regivers of healthy black children. The survey consisted of 30 yes/no questions and nine open -ended question s concernin g knowledge and use of remedies for fever, te ething and coli c. Each parti cipant was familiar with the use of folk remedies. Most learned this from their mothers or grand mothers. Older parents were more likely to use these remedies than younger parents. All participants confir med using at least one herbal or food based re medy in treating their children (2004, p. e297 -e298). 44 The use of folk re medies was attrib uted more to the believed effectivene ss and traditional aspects of use than to the histo rical association of folk re medies to l ack of access to health care and language a nd cult ural barriers. They have become part of our culture. Folk re medies in t his study consisted of herbs, food products, household ite ms or manipulative practices such as b athin g or walkin g (2004 , p. e299). The folk re medy users in this study used them in conjunction with, not a replace ment to, conventional medicine. The u se was considered to be culturally based. Physicians should be aware that patients are using these re medies, both to educate them if possibl e drug interactio n danger s exist, as well as to further und erstand and better treat their patients (2004, p. e303). Summary Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is prevalent in this country, as concluded in studies by Eisenberg, et al (1998) and Kennedy (2005). Both studies used data from the Nation al Health Interview Survey to show the widespread use of herbal medicine and the lack of communication b etween patients and do ctors regarding CAM use. In 2002 18.9% of adults in the U.S. used herbal products and supple ments. User rates were highest in wo men, middle -aged adults, some racial minorities, residents of the Western U.S., college graduates and people in excellen t health . Less than one third of users tell their physician about their herb use (Kennedy 2005, p. 1855). Though these studies focused on the adult, noninstit utionalized, civilian population, Sadah and Eberhardt (2006) used the sa me data source to study adults su ffering from chronic pain, and found that CAM use was high in this population also, and comm unication with health care providers was low. College students were shown by Ambrose and Samuels (2004) to 45 use herbal preparations recom mended by friends or family, even if they knew nothing about the therapy. Over 50% of the college students were using so me sort of herbal preparation, while over one third of these students could not name the herb used. Most herba l informa tion came from family and friends, and students expressed that practitioners should include herbal info rmation when discussing treatment options. HCPs are be ginning to change their attitu des and acce pt the integration of herbal thera pies into traditional practice. They expressed a desire for more professional educ ation on alternative therapies. Adolescent s, accor ding to Klein et al (2005) knew little abo ut herbal re medies and claimed they would not tell their physicians if they were using them. More in formation about CAMs appears to be necessary for both the general po pulation and the health care professionals who treat them. These five studies would indicate that herbal remedy use in this country is common, both for chronic and acute conditions. Though used commonly, people are not always educated as to the effects and indicat ions of herbs. Health care practitioners are frequently not told about this usage by their patients. These practitioners need more education on the uses and possible drug interactions of common herbal re medies and must communicate more openly with their pati ents. Standardized , reliabl e researc h is necessary for for mal validation of patients' CAM use. Work is being done to address the issues of both infor mation sources and research techniques in validating herbal medicine efficacy. Cle ment et al. (2005) pointed out the need for educational intervention for physici ans regarding herbal re medies. S mith and Coyle in 2006 stated that finding participa nts for CAM studies was not as difficult as 46 researcher s feared . The proactiv e work of Buenz et al (2004) and Gagnier et al (2006) will have a positi ve effect on the future of herbal medicinal research and study. Standardizing research criter ia and technology advance ments are both great achievements made toward furthering the validity of herbal medicines . The use of technolog y in Buenz et al's study is exciting for herbal information seekers as it promises to make the infor mation contai ned in ancie nt herbal texts readily and efficiently available. As so me researc hers focus on the i nformation in old herbals, the folk re medies that are passed down orally through the gener ations are also being studied and put to paper. Whether in urban black co mmunities as studied by Smitherman et al. (2004) and Plotkin and Post (1998) or in works of fictio n (Strain, 2002) folk remedies are alive and well in the United States. They are an important part of our culture, and the need for accurate information and enjoyable literature pertaining to herb use is e vident from this research. Perhaps exposure and education about herbal remedies at an earlier age would be appropriate. 47 Chapter 3 Procedures Problem/Purpose This project was the production of an herbal remedy ABC book. The plants represented were ones that are easily accessed in this count ry, and shown in at least two established herbals to have medicinal benefits. Though an ABC book is generally written for young children, Chaney (1993), and Yopp & Yopp (2000) contended that they have value as a resource for older readers as well. An alphabet book can be a captivating venue for learning new infor mation. Chaney (1993) suggested that alphabet books have instructional benefits for students aged 8 -11 (p. 96). The for mat renders them user friendly, the pictures are typically engrossing and the content is thematically presente d and often offer s a solid introduction to a to pic and/or multicultural awa reness (p. 97). \"Readers of all ages, abilities and circu mstances can obtain a multitude of benefits from alphabet books\" (p. 101). Yopp and Yopp (2000) contended that children would benefit from more exposure to infor mational text. They stated that exposur e to a varie ty of text structures and features found in infor mational texts in early childhood may help thwart the fourth grade slu mp of reading level that typically occurs (p. 412). In formational alphabet books were specificall y discusse d by Yopp and Yopp as being supportive to the develop ment of language, vocabulary and context skills in young, inter mediate and middle-grade children (p. 413 -414). They state: Infor mational alphabet books provide opportunities for young readers to interact with informational te xts, ex posing them to text features and 48 structures (other than narrative) as well as to specialized knowledge and vocabulary. In addition, they provi de infor mation on topics that may arouse curiosity, spark questions, and serve as catalysts to language and literacy. Further, informational alphabet books may facilitate young readers' emerging literacy understandings such as alphabet knowledge, sound -symbol correspondences, con cepts about print, and phone mic awareness (Yopp & Yopp, 2000, p. 416-417). An herbal alphabet book will benefit young children and older readers. People in this country use herbal remedies frequ ently, herbal re medies are being actively researched and herbal remedies are a part of this country' s heritag e Therefore an herbal ABC book would be a significa nt addition to a children's library. Audience This herbal alphabet book was written with an ele mentary aged audience in mind. It can be useful, however, to all ages. The information is significant to anyone who has little prior knowledge of us ing plants for healing, and can be an enjoyable review for those who already have experience with healing plants. Tools This herba l ABC book was formatted in landscape and contains 32 pages. Each left hand page shows an illu strated facsimile of two pages of an open herbal ABC book. The right hand side of the alphabet book contains a s imple storyline of a young boy helping his stuffed ani mal to feel better u sing the plants his family members have t old him about. This structure is maintained throughout the book. The herbal side of the spread consists of an ornate letter and a pla nt name or herbal agent that begins with that 49 letter . A brief descriptio n of the plant' s common medicinal use is included, and a dra wing of the plant is in the center of the herbal page. Two of these herbal pages are on each left hand page of the book. The right hand side consist s of the storyline and colored illustratio ns about Dari us, a young boy whose stuffed an imal is feeling under the weather. Darius recalls so me of the healing plants his mother, father and grandparents have told him about, and how to make si mple medicin es. There is a border of herb sketches surrounding the right hand pages. This herbal ABC book contains both infor mational and narrative text. Procedures The creation of this alp habet book proceeded with the following steps: 1. Listed the plants and herbal information that will appear on each page of the \"herbal te xt\" portion of the book. For each piece of information, two independent herbal s were cited . Thes e citation s appea r as a bibliography at the end of the book. 2. Drawings of each of the se plants or other substances, such as olive oil as a base for salves or water as a base for teas were made by the illu strator. 3. Laid out the pages of herbal text with drawings and infor mation. 4. Wrote the specific storyline to acco mpany the ri ght hand si de of the book. Darius tries to make his stuffed ani mal feel bett er using plants he has been told about by various relatives. 5. Used line drawings and colored pencils to illu strate the storyline. The author's sister, Cindy Lane, drew the illustrations. 6. Collated the herbal text side of the book with the storyline side. 50 7. Created a title page. 8. Created a cover. 9. Prepared a bibliography of herbals consulted. 51 Chapter 4 Project Project accompanies t his pape r. 52 Chapter Five Conclusions and Recommendations Summary From Neanderthal to New Age ti mes, plant medicine has been shown to be used by people seeking relief from ailments. There is a lack of infor mation available for children to learn about the simple herbal remedies used by their ancestor s even though herbal remedies are commonly used in this country. These plant remedies are both culturally and medically significa nt. People use herbal medicine to a great extent without consulting medical professionals. Therefore, a research based herbal ABC book would be a significant addition to children's literature in this coun try, both as infor mation for children and adults, and as a conversation starter in the medical practitioner's office. As so me researchers focus on the in formation in old herbals, the folk remedies that are passed down orally through the gener ations are also being studi ed and put to paper. Whether in urban black co mmunities as studied by Smitherman et al. (2004) and Plotkin and Post (1998) or in works of fiction (Strain, 2002) folk remedies are alive and well in the United States. They are an important part of our culture, and the need for accurate information and enjoyable literature pertaining to herb use is e vident from this research. Perhaps exposure and education about herbal remedies at an earlier age would be appropriate. The purpose of this research project was to add to the information available for childre n and adult s to learn abou t commo n herbs that can be safel y used for every day ailments. As was discovered during the research process , nothin g like this is currently available in popular publication. The best way to remedy this was to create an ABC book 53 featuring commonly used medicinal herbs and ingredients presented alongside a simple storyline of a little boy remembering the remedies he had been taught by his family to help his stuffed ani mal feel better. The herbal side of the book is writte n in a rather clinical, high level reading manner - meant to be read and interpreted to the youngest readers by their parents. There is a glossary in the back containing the words that may not be known by those not knowledgeable in herbal medicine -making. T he drawings of the herbs are accurate yet whimsical so as to be attractive to children. The font and paper style reflect the tone of the herbal which is that of an old -fashioned to me. The storyline side of the book is written with simple words, most of it being a narrative of Darius, a six year old boy, talkin g to his stuffed lizard or his friend, Carrie. Seven of the herbs from the herbal are mentioned by Darius, and one more is pictured in the story. He mentions a variety of relativ es from whom he has learned the infor mation he imparts. The conclusion of this story is t hat sometimes a friend is all one needs to help one feel better . At the very end, the two stuffe d animals come to life and it is i mplied that they are ab out to e mbark on an adve nture. This can spark any child's imagination to create a storyline for LJ and Punky. The illustrations for this storyline are colorful, but the human characters remain black and white. The less coloring they have, the more they can represent any child. The unique layout of the book, with the herbal book view on one side and the storyline on the other, was the original idea that led to the conception of the book. The choosing of the herbs for each letter was the first step in the process of creating this book. Once that was done, each item was researched and found in two res pectable herbals and 54 the infor mation found was cut down to si mple summaries . The autho r alread y knew much of this infor mation, as she has been using and making herbal re medies for about 20 years. She apprenticed under Rosemary Gladstar, an herbalist and teacher widely known in the herbal community as the Godmother of the Herbal Renaissance. The drawings of the herbs are based on a combination of liv ing plants, photographs, and other herbal illustrations. The ill ustrator has a de gree in fine a rts and keeps an in formal studio in h er house from which she works on drawings an d paintings from ti me to ti me. She, too has a long history of interest in herbs and has an extensive wild garden at her ho me. The stor yline is based on the c riteria of a child to whom many children could relate. He knows a little about herbs from various f amily members. These re medies could be from European, African - American, H ispanic or Native American traditions. The herbal remedies of Asia, such as Ayurved ic or Traditional Chinese Me dicine, are far more co mplicated, but people scho oled in the se traditions co uld still relate to the forms of remedies such as teas, tinctures and poultices. The author and illu strator together laid out each page. The author chose a nd placed the text of each page while the illustrat or drew the pictures and b oth of these parts merged to create each page. Each page was photocopied onto special paper that was sepia -toned on one side and white on the other. These pages were aligne d into the book, and the cover page and dedication were added. The author has had substantial interest shown for this book by parents with whom the concept was discussed. Those few who have seen the finished product are unanimous in their de sire to proc ure a copy for t heir fa milies. Because of this interest, the process of public ation will be p ursued after this proje ct is complete. 55 Conclusions The history of herbal books is fasci nating. The importance of plant medicine throughout time is apparent when reviewi ng this history . Although much of medical practice in the United States today utilizes expensive, lab-produced chemicals to combat disease, the lay person is more and more likely to look for natural, less expensive and gentler products to serve his or her needs. Peopl e need and deserv e to be educate d about simple herbal remedies that can be used for common ai lments. They read about them in popular magazines and purchase them at their local variety store. What is missing in this process is the connection to the earth and the natural world of which all are a part. It is a healing process to see a plant, learn about its healing properties and make a s imple tea by infusing these living organis ms in water. It is also beneficial for people to recognize that their ancestral heritage includes herbal folk remedies, regardless from which nation ality they hail. ABC books are a great way for children to learn new informatio n in a non- stressful way while honing their alphabet and beginning reading skills ( Yopp & Yopp, 2000). The info rmation in the Herba l Remed y ABC Book includes facts about plant uses, their Latin na mes, simple ways to make r emedies, and an introduct ion to the historical use of plants. It also provides a positive message of people helping others to feel better. Those who read the Herba l Remed y ABC Book will bene fit from the simple format and info rmation and may recognize co mmon re medies, in plant for m, from the names on capsule boxes at the pharmacy. Howev er, from this book, they may feel a more organic connection through the simple, colorful illustratio ns and text that can easily be shared with the whole family. Whether this book is an introduction or a review for the 56 reader, it is the hope of the author that they will be inspired to learn more about herbal remedies, plant medicine, and a more natural, less stressful way of life. Recommen dations for further study Where is all the literat ure on herbal medicine in children and young adult publications? Studies s how that parents are using ho me remedies on childr en, and young adults are buying and using herbal supple ments. Though referred to as comple mentary medicine, meaning t hey accompany or co mplement conve ntional medicine products, people are neglecting to inform their medical care providers of their usage. The care provider may very well be unknowledgeable of the effects of these supple ments. There are good sources of reliable infor mation on herbal use in publication, but more shoul d be aimed at the children and young adult reader. Herbs are commonly used as remedies in this country for everyday ailments and chronic conditions, so more informatio n shoul d be available at a younger age about these safe, common plant medicines. Sharing the reading experience of this book between parent and child can enhance both participants' enjoy ment and interest in the subject and contribute to the family bond. It is recommended by this researcher that more literat ure be written in a u ser friendly manner for children, young adults and families to learn about and enjoy the traditional healing art of herbal medicine. Health care provid ers who address the common use of alternative the rapies with t heir patients can benefi t from additional professional literature a nd research on these topics as well. 57 Reference List American heritage college dictionary (4th ed.).
