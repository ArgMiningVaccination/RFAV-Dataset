We may earn a commission from your purchases. Black people have contributed to American society and culture from this country's founding, and of course, [Black History Month](https://www.rd.com/list/black-history-month-facts/) is a good time to acknowledge that. After all, you probably never learned about many of the [Black inventors](https://www.rd.com/list/black-inventors/) who made all our lives easier, or entrepreneurs such as Madam C.J. Walker and Annie Malone, who revolutionized the hair industry. But while it's important to honor and commemorate these contributions, which have been a part of the fabric of our economy for generations, it's also essential to support the Black entrepreneurs who are currently in business\u2014and [for more than just one month](https://www.rd.com/article/why-black-history-month-shouldnt-be-a-single-month/) out of the year. That said, Black History Month is the perfect time to shine a light on Black-owned businesses and brands. What makes a business Black-owned? The National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) defines a Black-owned business as one in which 51% or more is owned, operated and controlled by Black Americans. The owner must be a \"U.S. citizen of African descent,\" which means that African immigrants who have become citizens also qualify. If the business is publicly owned, at least 51% of the stock must be owned by Black shareholders. What is the largest Black-owned business? The real-estate investment trust company RLJ Lodging Trust is one of the largest Black-owned public businesses in America, with assets of $5.92 billion as of June 2020. Other notable big businesses include World Wide Technology, a global tech consulting firm; Salamander Resort & Spa, which is owned by Sheila C. Johnson, co-founder of BET; and ActOne Group, the largest privately held, woman- and minority-owned workforce management company in the United States. What are some famous Black-owned businesses? Many Black-owned companies have served as pillars of Black communities\u2014motivating, inspiring and moving different aspects of Black culture and life forward. There are big publishing groups like Johnson Publishing Company and Ebony magazine, for instance, that reach millions. On a smaller scale, there are beloved [Black-owned beauty brands](https://www.rd.com/list/black-owned-makeup-brands/) like Rihanna's Fenty and Taliah Waajid's eponymous hair-care company that fill very real needs for Black consumers. Of course, Black businesses exist in every category; these are just a few notable examples. Why is it important to buy from Black-owned businesses? Buying from Black-owned businesses, many of which are small businesses, helps to level the economic playing field and subsequently bolster communities of color in a variety of ways. These businesses have historically faced more obstacles\u2014from Black Codes to Jim Crow laws to fewer loans and investment rates\u2014than White-owned businesses, and this has put a roadblock in front of many Black Americans, widening the racial wealth gap and keeping [systemic racism](https://www.rd.com/article/systemic-vs-systematic-whats-the-difference/) in place. Black businesses were also disproportionately hurt by the pandemic. By [supporting Black businesses](https://www.rd.com/article/ways-to-support-black-owned-businesses/), you're supporting Black communities and [being an ally](https://www.rd.com/article/what-it-means-to-be-an-ally/). In many cases, Black-owned businesses strive to use their position as a means to elevate, empower, employ and be of particular service to those who are Black, though their brands extend to everyone. On a more personal level, you'll also be purchasing amazing products imbued with culture and creativity. What are the best Black-owned Amazon businesses to shop? It depends what you're looking for!
