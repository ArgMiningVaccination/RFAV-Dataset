It's such a beautiful, sacred thing to be let in with open arms during someone's most vulnerable time.\" - When I was 15, I developed an osteosarcoma (a kind of bone cancer), and through that experience, I became interested in both pediatric oncology and nursing. I've always enjoyed working with children and adolescents. As I grew in my career, I began to see myself as a pillar for the families I work with, someone parents and caregivers can lean on for support and guidance. What keeps me going are the emotional connections I form with my young patients and their families. It's such a beautiful, sacred thing to be let in with open arms during someone's most vulnerable time. I am part of the pediatric bone marrow transplant team at Seattle Children's. Before becoming an advanced registered nurse practitioner, I worked as a bedside nurse in pediatric oncology for five years. In my current role, I provide inpatient and outpatient care for children with a variety of cancers and non-malignant disorders. I work with a close-knit team of professionals in oncology and other specialties who aim to individualize care for each patient, giving them the best possible chance of success. - Overview - Clinical Interests - Acute and chronic graft-versus-host "}
