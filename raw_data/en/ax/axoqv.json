Depending on what you choose to read and study you can expand your knowledge about your wellbeing by learning about and getting to know your energy field, how to use it to help you get healthy and stay healthy. What is an aura? Aura and energy fields are our life force. They are best explained as an electromagnetic field that, given the right circumstances, can be seen around the body although that is not strictly correct. There are seven layers (simply put) to the aura and it is said they work on different planes of existence. Some are physical and this can be perceived by a sensitive eye as a whitish light about two inches around the body. Another part of the aura is more etheric and paler in colour which extends about 70cm around the body. On an astral level the aura can extend even further depending on the person. The energy of the aura can send, receive and store information. It does this with both negative and positive energies and uses our physical body to do this. It also does this in our astral and mental bodies. The energy builds and is stored - both negative and positive energy. This energy, for example, operates on the planes of the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. The energy has a past and future ability to affect you. Past energy keeps patterns going and pulls you back into old habits. Future energy depends on present actions and determines your life in this lifetime (and if you believe in reincarnation) where you will end up in future lifetimes when your energy leaves this physical body and moves on. It is this pattern in aura reflection that lets people look back into their past and also energetically into their future. Also depending on the makeup of the past energies of the person some will have a lighter energy than others. This determines their frequency. Imagine it as a life pulse pulsating at a certain vibrational level. This affects their energy and is due to the build up over a long period of time in the past. People with lighter energies choose to perhaps do things differently and live their lives differently. Why is our aura important? As a body within a soul (your aura can be seen around your body with a trained eye yet it is your life force to a degree, so your body is technically within your soul although we do say it the other way round) that aura energy moves on a journey from one body to another through many lifetimes and what happens in each one leaves an experience in your energy. This happens on all levels in all planes so it's not only physically affecting you. People who scan and read the aura can look at this stored information and tell you how that can affect your health in a psychic or a spiritual sense. All the vibrations in your energy give out a reading. If you know how to, you can read from that aura a great deal of data about the physical wellness or illness of the person, in both a psychic sense and spiritual sense. Since about 1939 auras have been photographed using a Kirlian camera giving more proof to their existence. Proof that every living thing has its own aura or vibration which is moving and pulsating and hence changing. How can it help me? By working on your aura, your chakras (energy centres) and clearing your energy you will find the negativity you hold on to will become less and less and this will move you forward on your inner and outer journeys. Your outer journey is your physical, physiological journey and what you do on this planet. Your inner journeys are more linked to your feelings, thoughts and on inner planes of consciousness involving spiritual growth and understanding. The study of your aura and yourself as a body within a soul is an interesting one and perhaps one of the hardest. It involves us being honest with ourselves and calling ourselves out when we know we are progressing in a negative way. It is perhaps one of the hardest things we will ever do and also the most rewarding helping us reach the heights of our spiritual journey. For more information on the depth of your energy check "}
