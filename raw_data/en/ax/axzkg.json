This is a time of beautiful fall colors, warm days and crisp nights. It can also be a tricky time because many start to worry about their [susceptibility to cold and flu](https://myacupuncturedurango.com/about-chinese-medicine/). Some of you have asked me what my thoughts are about the flu shot... Firstly, this year's flu shots are comprised of the most popular strains from last year and since flu strains tend to change from year to year, you may not be getting any protection from what is going around this year! Secondly, the ingredients contained in the vaccines tend to be pretty toxic. Know what's in the flu vaccine... Formaldehyde linked to multiple cancers & leukemia Thimerosal/Mercury linked to autoimmune disease & inflammation Egg protein used for cell cultures Sucrose & Gelatin used as stabilizers Polysorbate 80 linked to liver toxicity Aluminum Salts linked to Alzheimer & dementia Penicillin/Sulfa drugs can cause allergic reaction and candida Keep in mind, you're not ingesting and allowing your digestive system to somewhat process and excrete these dangerous metals, you're injecting it directly into your blood stream where it very quickly enters your tissues. If you have doubts as to the toxicity consider this, unused vials of these mercury-preserved vaccines must be disposed of as hazardous waste in steel drums by law. You have better options! Thirdly, you don't even have to go down that road! Why not just support your immune system with additional vitamins C and D and have some powerful anti-viral herbs on hand if you do happen to get hit? Most of us are deficient in vitamin D especially during the darker winter months and could greatly benefit from 2,000-5,000 IUs daily. Generally this is a safe dosage for just about everyone through the fall and winter. Vitamin C can be supplemented at 2,000 mgs a day and if you can even take up to 1,000 every hour if you feel like you're coming down with something. It's impossible for a virus to survive in a body that is saturated with Vitamin C. You will know when you've had enough when you start to get some belly cramping. Also, look for a vitamin C that comes from whole food sources since most of them are made from corn and could be GMO corn. I have a good one at my office and I also like the brand \"Pure Synergy\". Colds and flus are viruses, so antibiotics don't work on them, however, there are many herbs available that do fight viruses. I am in love with an herb called lomatium. It is an extremely powerful anti-viral herb and it's safe enough that a baby can take it, and I carry it at my office. These strategies, plus occasional acupuncture tune-ups, should get just about anyone through this season with little difficulty. [Emotox Body Balance](https://myacupuncturedurango.com/) An excellent option to help you stay healthy Emotox BioEnergetic scan is a non-needle treatment that can help to uncover and resolve stress in the body. It is helpful for people: Suffering from allergies (both food and environmental), Who have a condition that is not responding well to other treatments (is there an emotional component that is keeping it stuck?) Just about anyone who wants to be more in balance. Prices are still only $50 a treatment but will be going up to $75 at the beginning of the year. Here is what one woman had to say after going through the series: \"I came to Sydney several months ago seeking help for my auto-immune disorder. The affect of stress is a major factor in overall good heath and critical with an auto-immune disorder. I recently completed the BioEnergetic Assessment treatment program with Sydney and was very pleased with the results. Stressed areas of my body were identified and imbalances treated which was beneficial to my recovery. I consistently realized an improvement in my overall health throughout the process.The process also helped me to identify possible stress triggers so I can continue to recognize and work with them in everyday life. I found this process insightful, energizing, and healing. I am so grateful for this opportunity... Thank you Sydney for working with me through this process!\" To your best health, Sydney Cooley "}
