RONALD HOFFMAN |", "date": "2017-12-20", "cleaned_text": "of the things that infuriates me as a health care practitioner is how the word \"detox\" has been co-opted by charlatans trying to sell you suspect products you're supposed to introduce into your body through various orifices. This nonsense has unfortunately clouded some of the real things you can do to bolster your body's ability to cleanse itself. Simply opting for healthier clean foods is a great first step, but studies show that as caloric restriction causes fat cells to shrink, they release stored toxins into the system. Research has demonstrated that these harmful chemicals can actually poison metabolic pathways, causing slowed metabolism. This may actually sabotage weight loss efforts, causing weight to plateau even in the face of stringent diet adherence. The supplements in my Detox protocol have been chosen carefully to mobilize toxin elimination, easing the \"blahs\" that sometimes compromise your dietary resolve and get in the way of permanent sustainable weight loss. Start with Reg'Activ Liver and Detox. It delivers the unique probiotic lactobacillus fermentum ME-3 which generates glutathione; It also supports the liver's processing of toxins with milk thistle, n-acetylcysteine, and selenium. (Take one twice daily.) Augment the glutathione support afforded by ME-3 with NAC (N-acetylcysteine), the most efficient precursor to the body's glutathione synthesis. Protects the liver, and speeds processing of environmental chemicals. (Take one twice daily.) One of the most comprehensive detoxification formulas in the supplement marketplace, featuring a proprietary combination of botanicals and nutrients, Liver Detox supplies all you need to facilitate the elimination of waste products and harmful metabolic byproducts. (Take one twice daily.) A time-tested traditional accouterment to detoxification protocols, chlorophyll has demonstrated the ability to accelerate the mobilization of xenobiotics via its action on Phase 1 and Phase 2 pathways. (Take one twice daily.) DIM plus CDG combines two powerhouse detoxifiers: DIM (diindolylmethane) is derived from cabbage family vegetables, and accelerates the breakdown of environmental chemicals as well as excess xenoestrogens. CDG (calcium d-glucarate) aids in glucuronidation, the process by which the liver \"tags\" harmful compounds and allows them to be excreted from the body. (Take one twice daily.) Vitamin C is one of the body's most potent detoxifiers, so adding Ester-C is an essential accompaniment to your program. (Take one three times daily.)
