With simple in-office treatments, you give your system an added layer of protection.", "sitename": "Lake Urgent Care | Lake After Hours", "date": "2023-05-12", "cleaned_text": "The immune system is an incredibly complex and essential part of the body that fights off infection and sickness. By reinforcing our immune system, we can better resist illness and heal when we become sick. [IV therapy](https://lakeurgentcare.com/iv-therapy/) is a great way to boost immunity and improve overall health. If you are interested in IV therapy, you can now benefit from this simple and convenient treatment in-office at [Lake Urgent Care](https://lakeurgentcare.com/) in Baton Rouge. First, look at how IV therapy works and what makes it an effective way to strengthen immunity. What Is IV Therapy? IV therapy involves administering medication or vitamins directly into the bloodstream via an intravenous drip. This delivery method allows for the absorption of higher nutrient concentrations than you can get through oral ingestion. While oral medications must pass through the digestive system before entering the bloodstream, IV therapy enables more medicine to reach its intended target faster. Our Immunity IV Therapy Cocktail at Lake Urgent Care promotes maximum immune protection. This IV treatment blends ascorbic acid (vitamin C), Olympia Vita Complex (B-Complex vitamins), and zinc chloride. Vitamin C has powerful antioxidant properties which help [protect cells from damage](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-c/art-20363932) caused by free radicals. B-Complex vitamins are essential for [healthy immune function](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324856), nerve and organ function, and more. And, zinc chloride helps promote faster wound healing. Together, these ingredients can support protection against infection, reduced healing time following illness or injury, and shortened symptom duration if you get sick! Our Myers' Cocktail is another fantastic option for boosting your immunity. This cocktail of essential vitamins is made with magnesium chloride, B-Complex vitamins, Hydroxo B12, calcium gluconate, and ascorbic acid which help to strengthen the immune system. For example, Hydroxo B12 and magnesium chloride help to target low levels of vitamin B12 and magnesium in the body. Vitamin B12 helps the body process fat and carbohydrates to produce energy while [balancing immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8689946/). Studies have shown that magnesium may [increase immune function](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/magnesium-may-prime-the-immune-system-to-fight-cancer-and-infections), which may even have benefits for the treatment of cancer and infections. In addition to these benefits, this cocktail also helps to reduce chronic pain, headaches, asthma symptoms, stress, and more. The Benefits of IV Therapy Because of its fast absorption rates, IV therapy is a quick way to introduce nutrients and hydration to your system. In addition, IV therapy can provide the body with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may be difficult to absorb through diet alone. As a result, this treatment can help boost overall health and support specific health goals. IV therapy from our Baton Rouge clinic offers many benefits besides boosting immunity. Some IV wellness treatments support the body's natural detoxification by flushing out toxins and waste products. We also have blends that promote inflammation reduction, reduced fatigue, stress reduction, and more! These treatments can increase your overall wellness when used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise regimen.
