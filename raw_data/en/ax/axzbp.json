I bought a cheaper Solarix N Energy 3.8KWh Battery due to affordability, and a Luxpower SNA 5000 WPV. I am struggling to get the inverter to communicate with this battery via the RS485 port, despite trying PINs (1B, 2A) or (7A, 8B) on the battery as instructed by the manual. On the inverter, some o the battery brand/protocols show the SOC, however, the voltage is incorrect by a decimal i.e 5.0V instead of 50V. I installed PBMS V2.5 software to try and see whether I could change the inverter protocol of the battery as done on other similar batteries to get the coms working: Batteries with similar BMS: Ultra Energy, Jakiper, Essener, HoSelect etc. Someone on this forum managed to connect their Ultra Energy battery but they haven't shared the software they used (AIEnegy BMS software) With the help of my colleague, I am trying to connect the battery with \"USB to RS485 TTL Serial Converter Adapter FTDI\" pcb interface and a striped network cable. I tried using both pin layouts and Pin 6 for Ground but PBMS cannot detect the battery. Edited June 11 by MightyDee incomplete post Quote Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...
