In stead of continuing this practice, the Stee ring Committee (SC) re-considered the need to organize a large scale public conference a nd it was recommended that other educational models should be explored for the communica tion about ICH. An Options Paper on the need for a large scale public conference was dr afted by three industry associations. Out of the several options raised, the one to hold smaller, more frequent and more focused ICH meetings, was supported by the SC in Chicago Meeting 2006; hence ICH 6 became the last conference of the traditional large scale. Further to refine this option, the ICH Industry Party Implementation Paper for the ICH public confer ences was presented at the Brussels SC Meeting 2007. Here, principles such as size, or ganization, frequency, format, financial aspects of the meeting and evaluation process were cl arified. It was judged appropriate that the conference should be held every eighteen months in each ICH region, either as a one-day additional communication meeting at the end of ICH SC and EW G/IWG meetings, or as an ICH-branded regional meeting in collabora tion with other non-profit organizations. Based on the SC decision, the ICH Tokyo Sympos ium titled \"Hot Topics and Influence on Asia\" was held in Tokyo on November 2, 200 7, the following day of the ICH Yokohama Meeting (October 27 to November 1, 2007), as the first regional ICH public meeting. The Symposium was jointly organized by the Society of Japanese Pharmacopoeia (SJP, non-profit organization) and Japan Pharmaceutical Manufac turers Association (JPMA) and supported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welf are (MHLW), Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association of Japan, Pharmaceu tical Manufacturers' Association of Tokyo, Osaka Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and Japan Pharmaceutical Association. Over 460 participants from the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory authorities of Europe, Asia and North America (13 c ountries; France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, Turkey, Thailand, China, Ko rea, Singapore, Japan, Canada and USA) attended the Symposium. 1 ICH Tokyo Symposium 2WELCOMING ADDRESS Kohei Wada, JPMA Member of the Steering Committee Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to see so many of you on this occasion. Let me introduce myself. My name is K ohei Wada, of Daiichi Sankyo. On behalf of the organizers, I would like to say a few words. Originally, the 7th International Confer ence on Harmonization, namely ICH7, was scheduled to have taken place this spring. However, it was di scussed in Chicago last year that, rather than meeting once every 2 to 3 years in such a large gatheri ng, we would do better to meet more frequently on a regional basis. This concept was finally deci ded in Brussels this May. This is a very commemorative landmark event - th e first of this kind in the regional gathering. Up until yesterday for about a week, the Stee ring Committee and experts met to discuss various topics in Yokohama, whic h concluded with great success. This latest development/outcomes will be report ed today by the Rapporteurs as well as the topic leaders representing various countries. In the afternoon we will be discussing the ICH GCP guidelines and their implementation in Asia n countries. This is, therefore, somewhat different from the regular reporti ng meetings we usually had. It has only been six months since I joined the IC H activities, and it always strikes me that the experts are dedicating their all- out efforts to work on the ICH topics. This truly impresses me. It is because of their daily efforts and contribu tions that the ICH is wh ere it is right now. I would like to express my hearty appreciation to their dedication. Furthermore, in realizing today's Tokyo Sympos ium, there are many people whose time and efforts have made an important contribution. I w ould like to express my extra gratitude to all those helping us behind the scenes. I sincerely hope that this ICH symposium will be informative to all of you. Once again, thank you very much for coming.

Date of Next Meeting: SC, EWG/IWG Meeting 2008 June 2 - 5: Portland, USA 2008 November 17 - 20: Brussels, Belgium2009 June 6 - 11 (scheduled): Yokohama, JapanFuture of ICH Meetings ICH Tokyo Symposium Makoto MHLW (NIHS) Rapporteur Abstract The S2A (1995) and S2B (1997) guidelines describe a basic test battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests to sup port the safety of drugs for human us e. This three-test battery is a bacterial mutagenicity assay, a mammalian cell assay (either tk mutations in mouse lymphoma cells, or in vitro assay for metaphase chromo some aberrations) and an in vivo assay for cytogenetic damage, typically a test fo r micronuclei in erythroc ytes of rodents. The major issues prompting revisions to the guidelin es are the high frequency with which positive results are found in the in vitro mammalian cell assays, and are considered not relevant under in vivo conditions because they include many that are weakly positive, associated with considerable toxicity, and/or on ly seen at high concentrati ons, and the other tests in the battery are negative. This leads to a great deal of follow-up testin g including additional animal testing to assess whether there is a ny genotoxic risk. We also take account the 3Rs concept into the revisi on of the guidance. The group considered options su ch as: developing a better gui dance on weight-of-evidence and interpretation of results. Based on the discu ssion at the last Chicago meeting in October 2006, we decided to merge two S2 guidances (A and B) into one guidance (S2 (R1)). After the Chicago meeting, we made a survey for JPMA, EFPIA, and PhRMA to ask for examples of the lowest effective concentration for the in vitro mammalian assays that were considered relevant positive results. Also we asked the dose and C max values for the single and repeat dose toxicological studies to evaluate the suitab ility of genotoxicity studies incorporated into the general toxicological studi es. Based on the outcomes of the survey, we revised the standard battery to detect genotoxicity to the new standard methods. At the moment, we have not yet well achieved consensus on the new strate gy of battery and/or tier system, I would like to discuss this point. Issues that we agreed at the Chicago and Br ussels meetings are as follows: Use of flow cytometry for micronucleus assessment was also discussed and approved, in line with OECD guidance. For in vivo MN assay, it is not necessary to include treatments with positive controls in every study. Validation of scori ng can be done periodically and quality control samples included for automated scoring. There was consensus that the top dose could be reduced from the existing 10 mM (5 mg/ml) to 1 mM (0.5 mg/ml), and this would reduce the number of irrelevant positive results. The cu rrent guideline requires testing several doses above the solubility limit (with vi sible precipitate in cu ltures) if necessary to meet the toxicity limits for the assays. We have agreed that th e top dose can now be th e lowest dose with visible precipitate. Questions and Answers Question: This time, a couple of options were pr esented at the Yokohama Meeting. In the genotoxicity test, we have to consider the test for the compound which contains impurities. Is S2 (R1) 11 there any plan to conduct that kind of discussion? Hayashi : As to impurities, we received many questions, but did not discuss about it at this meeting. Although we had a different EWG in the past to discuss this, we, as the S2 group, do not have any plans to include a discussion about impurities. Thank you. Question: When you incorporate the genotoxic evaluati on (genotoxicity endpoints) into the routine general toxicity study, it is recommended that the dose should be set to 50 percent of the top dose used for acute or single dose toxicity studies. I think this dose is too high in the repeated dose toxicity study. What do you think? Hayashi: At the EWG, we had extensive discussion about this point, but in the end we came to the conclusion that we would like to reduce the false negatives as much as possible. We also would like to achieve the sensitivity that is secured by the current guidance. That is the reason why we have included that condition. This acceptance criterion does not mean to satisfy all the criteria. But if you can satisfy one of those accep tance criteria, it is OK. So maybe you can clear that point with other cond itions. Then the data can be accepted and can be evaluable. Question: One more point: Will the genotoxicity endpoints be incorporated into the single dose toxicity study? Hayashi: It is OK to incorporate that into the single dose toxicity study. Kishi : If I may have a question or a comment to ma ke about the guideline that is in question, it was designed to resolve many questions or difficulties that we had with the present guideline based upon the accumulated data. Especially for the regulatory au thorities as well as for the industry, this is more realistic, and th is is more readily acceptable. Therefore, I think the revised new guideline appears to be splend id, especially with the addition of options which are to be considered and concluded scientifically by the industry. From the view point of the 3Rs (Reduce, Refine a nd Replace) principle, rather than using the animal models independently in both studies, if the routine general toxicity study could be evaluated by integrating the genotoxicity endpoints provided th at the requirements are fulfilled, I believe the new guideline would be a great achievement. Hayashi : Thank you very much. By incorporating in to the routine gene ral toxicity study, comprehensive evaluation is possible. That is the direction that we should consider in the future. In the S2 group, from a global point of view, maybe it has been performed by a small number of people. Therefore all of them are fa miliar with each other. That may have led to a very extensive and detailed discussion. Kishi : Yes, you are right. To incorporate a genotoxi city test into the general toxicity study allows us to give a very comprehensive evalua tion. So that is anothe r benefit of this new guideline. If we do not have further questions, we would lik e to move on. Thank you very much, Dr. Hayashi.

The concept is recommended by CIOMS VI and VII. The collection, monitoring and regu latory reporting of safety in formation on trial subjects is an essential part of conducting clinical tr ials. Regulations and guidance specify the responsibilities and reporting requirements for sponsors, investigators and their institutions. Most focus on the expedited re porting of Individual Case Safe ty Reports (ICSRs), with ICH Guideline E2A generally considered as the sta ndard for defining what information must be sent to various stakeholders, and when. Howeve r, the periodic analysis of involving safety information is crucial to the ongoing assessment of risk during the clinical development of an investigational drug. Regular co mmunication of such informati on to regulatory authorities and other stakeholders provides an informati on base critical for pr otecting the rights and welfare of subjects participating in clinical trials . This is true not only when an investigational drug is being evaluated in an ambitious clin ical development program encompassing dozens of trials, but also when a drug is being investigat ed in a single clinical trial, by a commercial or non-commercial (academic) sponsor. This guid ance provides an outline of issues to be considered in preparing a DSUR as we ll as guidance on its content and format. The purpose of a drug development program is to characterize the benefit-risk profile of a drug. This includes developing adequate instruc tions for use, as well as a sound program for risk management. During early drug developmen t, a drug's benefits and risks are purely theoretical. As experience is gain ed and data accumulate, benefits and risks come into clearer focus. Thus, the development of the benefit-risk assessment is a dynamic process. The balance must be evaluated on an ongoing basis and placed into proper perspective. Therefore data regarding drug safety needs to be available for ongoing regulatory review and evaluation, not only to protect the welfare of tr ial subjects, but also to ensure that the appropriate data are collected, especially as new safety issues are identified. Together with other regular and periodic safety monitoring procedures, DSUR provides an opportunity for a broad, overall safety re-evaluat ion and to ensure that the risks to trial participants are recognized, assessed, and communicated. This guideline is currently on Step 1. We EW G aim this guideline to be Step 2 at the Yokohama Meeting. E2F 15Questions and Answers Kishi : Thank you very much, Dr. Sa to, for your wonderful presen tation. It was detailed and yet quite specific about key points. You also shar ed with us the overall frame work. So first I would like to invite questions or comments from the floor. Since this will be the guideline for the first time, I am sure that the audience is quite eager to ask questions. Considering that this guideline is not in existence in Japan, thre e regions have been continuing their discussions on this particular subject matter. By the regions there could be differences. Could you make a comment on such differences and issues for harmonization? Perhaps that would ease the unde rstanding of the audience. Sato: Yes. As for the differences concerned, a majo r one would be the fact that the EU and the U.S. each have their own annual reporting system. In Japan, at least at the moment, such a system does not exist. The EU and the U.S. annual reporting systems, although similar by nature, nevertheless have differences. At the Y okohama Meeting we discu ssed this at length. For example, there is a manufacturing chan ge. When you handle that in the U.S., any manufacturing change would have to be incorporated in the annual report. However, in the EU, not all manufacturing changes have to be incorporated in su ch a report. At a glance their systems look similar, but they are different in de tail. Since that is the practice in the U.S. and the EU, they have difficulty in negotiating whic h one should precede the other. It is a difficult negotiation. Considering that it is a vacuum in Japan, we would observe and see which one is easier or more beneficial for us to adopt. List ening to the discussion so far, I think the EU approach is closer to our mindset. That is the current situation. Kishi : At this point, we have not yet reached Step 2. So what would be the major issues or the most important issue? Sato: Well, as for the \"most important issue\", in fact there could be multiple; for instance, how to deal with the combination therapy. The \"combination therapy\" refers to the situation where there is a two-in-one t ype of drug - for example, one tablet containing two effective ingredients, or the cancer drug combination th erapy that uses two different drug products. Also, the way to formulate line listing would be another issue. For thos e countries or regions that already have reporting systems, how to ali gn with the existing regulations can also be an issue. For instance, in the EU and the U.S., if different regulations were to be introduced, would they really be acceptable and able to coordinate? Those will be the major issues that we have to consider. Kishi: Any other questions? No further questions from the floor? Oh, yes. Please use the microphone. Could you repeat that? Molzon: Thank you, Junko, for your very nice presen tation. Will the group be discussing a common format for the information, once it is determined what should be included in these reports? Sato: Thank you. Where the format is concerned, it is currently being disc ussed. As for the future, when it is approved, the product would become subject to the PSUR. So transition has to be smooth and we have to s ecure that. That is the idea for approaching the DSUR. In this regard, as I mentioned yesterda y at the Steering Committee, we must consider whether this ICH Tokyo Symposium 16should be part of the guideline, or should be part of the Q&A. Or wh ether this particular process should be applicable not only to the commercial sponsors but also to the non-commercial sponsors. Since they have to be knowledgeable about this, perhaps the format portion should be published in scientific journals and et cetera, to create better knowledge for the people concerned. As far as the methodology is concerned, we have not reached a consensus. Nevertheless, these are the f actors discussed so far, and we would like to have a format which will be accepted by a wider audience in an easier manner. Question: About the DSUR, you mentioned that annual reports that already exist in the EU and the U.S. will be replaced with the DSUR . What about the case for the PSUR? It is considered that the PSUR comes as an additiona l report required. That is how it is currently used in operation. Therefore, we are very c oncerned about what the ideas are behind the replacement of the annual report with the DSUR. Sato: Ideas? Well, in principle, in the EU and the U.S. there already exists a similar system. Therefore, if it results in an increased burden and work, that would be unfortunate - for the industry as well as for the regulatory authorities, because they would be flooded with a lot of documents. Therefore, we want to improve wh at exists today, by ta king advantage of the benefits of the existing system and trying to improve it. But as to the replacement with the DSUR, the EWG members only stated that they w ould work hard to try to replace it. So it does not mean that the U.S. FDA, for instance, has already accepted the replacement, but at least our EWG members state that they will work so that the replacement will be realized. Kishi: I hope you are satisfied with the resp onse. Are there any other questions? Any questions on the matter will be fine. This is entirely new to you, I understand. Therefore, it could be a basic question or a detailed quest ion... Yes, please; and please approach the microphone. Question: As a sponsor I am hesitant to ask this question, but let us say that in Europe and the U.S. a similar system is in place. Still, this is not the case in Japan. They do it because it has some merit, I understand. This is going to be a global scheme, a nd I am basically in support of such an approach. However, as for Japan, we have to have a clear-cut idea that such a system should not be for the sake of formality. The repo rts should not be sittin g on the desk. It just means extra cost but not much benefit. In su ch a reporting system, as long as you receive it, you have to be responsible to review it because it is clinical-trial-relat ed information. You can not say, \"Oh, we did not take a look at it.\" In the case of west ern countries, the investigation of new drugs is in a true sense and these invest igations are conducted on drugs that appear for the first time globally. But you see, in the case of Japan, many of the trials or investigations are for drugs that have been ap proved already in western countrie s or elsewhere. So when the system is introduced in Japan, it should not be for the sake of forma lity. I hope you will be cautious about that. Sato: Dr. Doi, I understand. You made a very good point, because the bene fit or the merit for Japan is that, speaking from the administrators or the agencies side, al though individual safety reports had been submitted from time to time, as far as the summary information is concerned, we only had a response when we asked for it taking note of the signals. So the summary information was only in our minds. However, with such a system, the signals become easier to E2F 17identify. Yet, what you said is right: sitting on the desk does not mean that we read them. We should make sure that we go through them. As far as the DSUR is concerned, executive summaries would be provided to th e investigators and IRBs. That is the basic concept. In the case of Japanese medical institutions, indivi dual case reports had been submitted discretely and so they were not fully utilized in the be st way in the past. So upon introducing the DSUR, perhaps medical institutions may benefit - fo r example, by utilizing the executive summary reports as their latest safety information available for the respective trial drugs. As you had mentioned, the development status is different. Not many drugs would come in Japan for first approval. It would be approved elsewhere. So maybe the data volume would be significantly different. We have to be aware of that difference and by clearly reflecting the EWG discussions, we will discuss with JPMA, PMDA and MHLW on how to manage this.

What is the ultimate goal that you are trying to reach? Can you comment on that? Okuda : Well, not only the overall goal but also what the quality is designed to achieve, I think will be presented by the next speaker, Dr. Robe rt. Therefore, I would like to say here that pharmaceutical products have to be products which can be take n by the patients safely and securely, and we have to always ensure their qu ality and also have to endeavor to enhance the quality. The ultimate goal is to build up the sy stem to assure it. Th e production activity of drugs is maintained for many years and new t echnologies are being invented constantly for the period. If such new technologies would be properly incorporated in to their production, more appropriate quality products could constantly be produced so as to realize safety and efficacy of products. If you woul d be successful, and then you mi ght be able to reduce the cost as well. In order to accomplish that, con tinual improvement is a key concept that would enable us to reach such a goal. So through such activities, it is essential to supply safe and secure products, and that is the main target which is included in guidelines from Q8 to Q10.

Since then, a lot of progress has been made. In the Quality area, the following guidelines ha ve been drafted in order to ensure robust protection of public health th rough quality: Technical oriented : Stability (Q1), Analytical validation (Q4); Format oriented : Common Technical Document (M2); Technical and conceptual oriented : Pharmaceutical Development (Q8); System related : Good Manufacturing Practice of APIs (Q7A), Qua lity Risk Management (Q9), Pharmaceutical Quality System (Q10) (step 2). In Brussels 2003, after a long discussion, the follo wing vision on quality has been agreed on: 3Pharmaceutical Quality - A New Vision \" Develop a harmonised pharmaceutical quality system applicable across the lifecycle of the product emphasizing an integrated approach to quality risk management and science.\" Brussels July 2003 Q8: Pharmaceutical Development (step 5)Q8 (R): under discussion Q9: Quality Risk Management (step 5) Q10: Pharmaceutical Quality System (step 2) This new vision or paradigm considers the medi cinal product during its li fecycle, i.e. starting from development through technical transfer to routine manufacturing, emphasises on a better product and process understanding and on derivi ng specifications from this understanding. The whole should be achieved by having a more systematic approach to development, by using risk management tools and by work ing within a Q10 type quality system. Q8 has defined several concepts like PAT, design space, real time release, control strategies, systematic approach to development. If Q8 addr esses the drug product, e xperts agree, that the same principles and concepts described there, are also applicable to the drug substance, both chemically and biotech derived. It is rather the complexity of the product than the type of product itself which will impact implementation. Quality (2): New Paradigm 35 The presentation will address all these different principles and/or concepts and also the opportunities which 'potentia lly' can be derived from this new paradigm. Relationship between Q8, Q9 and Q10 4Existing GMP s sManagementThe Regulatory systemThe EU regulatory point of view on integration of different ICH quality concepts Quality System (Q10)Quality Risk Management (Q9) Pharmaceutical Development (Q8) Inter relationship between Q8, Q9, Q10 Quality system Existing GMPQuality Risk ManagementPharmaceutical development Questions and Answers Tominaga : So, probably as a starter, looking at your diagrams on the process, the quality by design approach and quality space approach, it is complicated and almost daunting, in my opinion. So my question is, does the quality by design approach automa tically increase the regulatory requirements and he nce the resources imposed upon the applicant? What do you think about those aspects? Robert : The question is a little tr icky. Personally, I do not think that this will trigger new requirements or that an enhanced level of resources will be required. It always depends on how you look at it. Pharmaceutical development has to be done anyhow, so before a company releases a product onto the market it has to pe rform pharmaceutical development studies in order to make sure that the product will be of consistent good quality and be meeting performance requirements. If we understand, by \"quality by design\", a more systematic approach to development, I am sure that this will help the applicant or the manufacturer, to reach faster the same degree of knowledge. Of cour se, if one wants to do what we refer to as \"achieving enhanced knowledge\", then you will be able, for instance, to establish a design space or to perform real time releas e. So, if a manufacturer wants to go in this direction, to take advantage of these opportunities, this wi ll require more investment. Short-term you might have to do more investment, but long-term I would say you will also have some benefit from it. To my opinion, I think, that also for th e basic or the traditional development approach, a systematic way will lower your cost. If you want to achieve \"enhanced knowledge\", it will require more resources, but long-term it will also be of some benefit for the company. So if one makes the balance at the e nd, it will probably not raise th e cost or raise the resources compared to the benefits which a manufacture can get. ICH Tokyo Symposium 36 Tominaga: Thank you so much. That is a relief for us with fewer resources! Do we have any other questions? In that case, thank you so much, Dr. Robert. In the interest of time, we would like to move on.

On-site presentation slides are attached below. Question and Answers Tominaga : So as to the items being worked in your IWG, the number of tasks that you shoulder is so large, and the eCTD alone is no small task. Do you have any idea about the future of M2, especially in terms of eCTD? Marr : Yes, if you saw on my slide, I had versio n 3.3 on one slide that became version 3.2.1 on another slide. We were originally intending to progress a minor version that involved a technical change that would i nvolve costs to applicants and regulators to implement. There was also a question as to whether that was going to be value for money to make that change. Coupled together with the knowledge that, agai n, the FDA had got exactly the same problem with the eCTD, in that it needs to work with electronic submissions for medical devices and veterinary medicines, and want s to have one standard. So it needs a new major version. By law, it now has to deliver th e ability to do two-way comm unication by the end of 2012. So that is why we were looking at this question: If we were going to do a minor version that was going to cost us, and then we were going to have to do another version th at would cost us to implement, the next major version, then can we minimize this change of 3.3.2? We agreed to go two ways. One is to go forward, plan for the next major version, which in my personal opinion, will almost certainly be with in the SDO processes. We are gathering the requirements to allow us to know what it is that we need to take forward. Then, we have gone back and said, \"Let's do with some small, narra tive changes that help with implementation at the moment.\" So M2 is the group that has the knowledge about those re quirements, and I am sure that it will work to create those. But we are learning all the time, on these SDO processes - the ICSR and the vocabularies - and we want to make sure that we use M2's resource efficiently. I think we can lear n to do perhaps more in the S DOs than actually doing it all inside ICH, doing too much work in ICH, and ha ving to redo things in the SDOs. It is a matter of getting that balance right. So we are certainly looking to re duce the resources that we are utilizing inside M2. But at the moment they are setting up these processes, monitoring and making sure it all works to ICH's satisfaction. It is taking a large amount of resources, which hopefully as we move on to the next project, will be much reduced. Thank you. Tominaga : Thank you. Do we have any questions? Yes, Dr. Molzon? Molzon : Andrew, maybe you could talk about the bene fits to your company of the transition to electronic submissions. In the FDA, the eCTD ha s been very helpful to the review staff, because they are able to access documents quicker , and the consistent format of the CTD has ICH Tokyo Symposium 42 really provided for more consistent and effi cient reviews. I thought you could discuss the company's benefits. Marr : OK, I will talk about my company which is GlaxoSmithKline, because that is obviously what I know. The benefits to us have been a large amount in the U.S., because it is electronic-only. We do not need to ship hundreds of thousands of pages to FDA. We can now actually stream it electro nically directly into the agency, get the acknow ledgment immediately, and in five minutes it is on the reviewer's desk. So that, to us, in terms of speed and cost of delivery, is great. It also gives us an internal re cord, a complete record, available to us to refer back to and et cetera. So it is a very good history of the product. From a European perspective, we still are caught with this having to provide paper. So we are getting benefit from access to information, but we have not yet reduced the co st. But all of the agen cies are moving towards the electronic-only approach. Our experience in Japan is relatively large, compared with most companies. I think what we are seeing there is fewer benefits at the moment, because it is being used as an electr onic version of paper. At least, that is my opinion. It is not, perhaps, using the opportunities that elect ronic information, and processing it differently, might have. The fact that the CTD has got a common structur e all the way across is of great help, because it allows electronic reuse of in formation globally. That, in itsel f, has brought benefits. So CTD has brought some and eCTD has brought us much more. But it is not yet evenly distributed between regions. Thank you. Tominaga : Thank you. Any other views on the use of the eCTD? Its be nefits or its downside, perhaps from any end users? Then, the last question... Are there any ideas regarding more enhancement of the use of the eCTD? Marr : There are some new requirements that will co me out of this major review. I think it is important to look at the opport unities that it provides - th ings like two-way communication. At the moment, we manage the information bei ng sent to the agency, and then we get back some paper or an e-mail or something, and it is no t able to be integrated. I think there is much to be done. It is not ab out how you review. You are not exp ected to do a diff erent scientific review. But I think some of the functionality could be supported by im proved specifications, to give more opportunity to the agencies to do th ings better, to do things differently. Yet, it might not be much more difficult for the appli cant to do that if we know what the agencies want to facilitate in their business process. Tominaga : Thank you so much. Increased functionali ty and increased efficiency. That is a good message when we are increasing the use of eCTDs. Thank you so much, Dr. Marr.

DeGeorge, PhRMA Rapporteur Abstract Preliminary presentation slides submitted as abstracts are omitted. On-site presentation slides are attached below. Question and Answers Tominaga : As to the expansion of the scope of the guidelines, there are issues such as abuse, liability and such things, and al so initial dosage setti ng, of course that is on the consideration as to that monoclonal antibody incident. Co uld you elaborate a bit more on these newer movements in your working group, please? DeGeorge : As for the new topics that we are taki ng up, there was a lot of interest from the pharmaceutical representatives in the working group, to talk about the combination drug testing. This is because the wo rld is moving to a lot of combination products as lifecycle extension approaches greater value. As for the guidance that is out there, I do not believe the European guidance gives any recommendations on timing. The FDA guid ance actually gives recommendations that are very difficult to un derstand, in terms of the difference between marketed products and products in development, particularly as where one product is in development and another is marketed, and this is further complicated when by early versus late-stage development candidates. So we need to get more clarity around what the recommendation really is going to be, for a gl obal process. Again, we are trying to make global drugs we can get globally approved. The pr oblem is that, absent any agreement - or even, in some cases, absent guidance from the re gions - it is very diff icult for the regulatory authorities to come to a consen sus about what makes sense on timing. We also do not want to make the M3 guidance be a guidance whic h now creates requirements for regions where certain requirements do not exis t. So we are working through a lot of these di fficulties, in terms what is the agreed language and how do we approach that to say \"it should be done here\" (for this region but not that region), if it needs to be done at all... One experience to date is that where we have had about four lines in the guidance on one of these topics in the guidance before, we have spent the entire morni ng and half of the afternoon discussing those four lines. By the end of the day we now have three paragraphs on that section. So adding these topics to the guidance has and will extend our timeline. But they are critical particularly on, as I said, something like combination testing. Tominaga : So, again, might there be some spin-o ff from your working group to another guideline, like the one you mentioned? What about the possibility of sp inning off some of the work, some guideline starting from your EWG? Or are you going to do it by yourself forever? DeGeorge : If at the end of this we determine ther e is a lot of non-harmonized guidance that we have to capture, the Steeri ng Committee ought to look at t hose guidances and see if there M3 (R2) 49 is not a reason to drive harmoni zation on those topics. If this was done sooner, it might make our job revising M3 easier, but I do not thi nk the ICH process can ge t a new guideline done before June, when we would like to be signing off on M3.

M3 (R2) 53QuestionsQuestions ?? ICH Tokyo Symposium 54Chairperson's Closing Comments Toshiyoshi Tominaga, MHLW Member of the Steering Committee Everybody, before concluding this particular se ssion, I would like to make a few comments. The latest trends of our quali ty-related guidelines have been presented. I think you have the feeling that the scope has expanded, and the impact is more far-reaching than ever. I agree with you. The situations about our M guidelines illustrate how grave the effect of ICH guidelines are and how actively electronic developmen t is being incorporated into the process. As was clear from the presentation, the ICH guide lines currently being made are of very high technical level and with a broad scope. Being a member of the Steering Committee, I am always feeling the challenge. However, ICH guidelines in themselves are not the goal. We are not formulating them for the sake of having them. As Dr. Okuda aptly point ed out, in the end, or all the way from the beginning to the end, the guidelines are for patients. They are to help deliver better and safer drugs to patients as soon as possible. We have to always bear that in mind as the ultimate goal of the ICH. A part of our effort to achieve this difficult goal has been presented today. With that, I would like to conclude this session. Thank you very much. Chairperson's Closing Comments 55PANEL DISCUSSION Clinical Development in Asia and ICH: Implementation of ICH Guid elines in Asian Countries (1) GCG/Industry Kohei Wada, JPMA Member of the Steering Committee Abstract In the last 10 years, along with the development and establis hment of ICH principles and guidelines, the arena of clini cal trials expanded into non-ICH regions including Asia, Eastern Europe, Central/South America, Gulf countries and South Africa. Many c linical trials have been conducted on a multinational basis. Many of the non-ICH countries adopted or ad apted ICH guidelines. In terms of GCP guideline, regulatory authorities of the ICH regi ons basically accept clinical data from abroad as long as the studies are conducte d under local GCP requirements. However, even a slight difference in GCP gui deline sometimes requires additional effort on the industry side. Such differences can be overperformance or underperformance of ICH standards, in either case will be an obstacle for the industry. When a company plans to conduct clinical stud ies in non-ICH regions, they (1) cross-check the similarities and differences of the local clinical guideline versus ICH guideline; (2) analyze and interpret the differen ces and (3) adjust the procedures as needed. Even if there is a big difference in the description of the gui deline, sometimes the actual implementation is very similar. On the other hand, even if th ere seems to be no difference in the guideline, sometimes the actual implementation is different. It takes extra effort for the industry to identify the actual situation, and such effort woul d not be required if the guideline differences are minimized. As will be introduced by my other Co-chair Mr. Mike Ward, GCG (Global Cooperation Group) is a sub-committee of the ICH Steering Committee, with the mission to promote ICH principles and guidelines to non-ICH regions, such as APEC, ASEAN, GCC, PANDRH and SADC. The regional harmonization representatives (RHIs) are representing each organization to promote this activity. GCG activities are very important for the industry to conduct effective global drug development. In this panel, the RHIs from the Asian region (APEC and ASEAN) will discuss the ICH status of their countries with special focus on clinical GCP guidelines.

Originally fo rmed with the intent of responding to information requests on ICH matters, the GCG ha s evolved into an active partnership with regional harmonisation initiatives (RHIs) from across the globe that seeks to more effectively facilitate the adoption and implementati on of ICH guidelines in non-ICH regions. Towards this end, the GCG has made substant ial progress in promoting a better understanding of both ICH guidelines and the issues associ ated with their implementation in non-ICH regions, including those surrounding the adopti on versus adaption or modification of guidelines. As training has been identified as a key enab ler of successful implementation, the GCG has focussed much of its effort to date on developing a strategy, process and tools that will allow maximum benefit to be derived from the invest ment of ICH and RHI resources. With these elements in place, the GCG expects to devote mo re of its collective re sources to training and is committed to ensuring the delivery of training that responds to the needs of RHIs and the public health priorities of ICH members. The GCG has also taken important measures to improve the transparency of GCG operations, identify potential means of encouraging feedb ack from RHI countries on draft ICH guidelines and promote good harmonisation practices. Further improvements to operations and procedures are under consideration. It is noteworthy that these accomplishments wo uld not have been possible without the spirit of trust and cooperation that exists between ICH and re presentatives from fellow harmonisation initiatives - perhaps th e most important outcome of all.

(2) GCG/Regulator 65Clinical Development in Asia and ICH: Implementation of ICH Guid elines in Asian Countries (3) APEC: China Jianhua Ding, APEC Member of the Global Cooperation Group Abstract China has established its clinical trial requi rements since 1998, by which the first GCP was published, and several clinical trial techni cal guidelines related to pharmaceuticals, bio-product and traditiona l Chinese medicine were introduced to regulatory practices. Since then, guidelines for clinical trials have b een revised by adapting many concepts from ICH guidelines, with some being adopted as regula tory enforcements to the Provisions for Drug Registration. As a new move, more clinical trial guidelines are going to be set up on each main category of diseases. Many challenges have been emerging in the ar eas such as the timing for the approval of clinical trials application, doc umentation requirements for IDN in the part of CMC, IDN and NDA differentiation. In July, SFDA published its revised Provision s for the Drug Registration and has become effective since October 1. By then, a CTD format of application package can be accepted with the administrative part to follow the require ments by the Chinese Regulation particularly.

Some parts of CGCP are less in details due to its legal orientation. But with many supplementary official explanation, notification for each detailed i ssue in conforms with ICH GCP CGCP -ICH GCP Comparison (2) Medical institutions are pre-qualified and pre-approved by MOH and SFDA according to the Law.

If some things are the same in principa l, only with the difference in structure of contents, and wording, but in practices everything turns out to be the same. There are varies of copies of translation of ICH GCP to different languages. This is a area of mistakes and conflicts between different versions of translation in the same language and between languages. Suggestion How to put ICH GCP to practices by the same manner for each sponsors, investigator, monitor, auditor, is something worth consideration and more important The same in content of a Guid elines might not necessarily become the same in understanding and in practices , then Practical training is a crucial way for better implementation of ICH GCP Implementation Model -GIP ICH GCP Translating InterpretingUnderstanding Good ImplementationPracticingICH GCP Translating Understanding Interpreting Practicing Bad Implementation TRAINING- -GIP Thank you for your attention !

To harmonize the aim of GCP in ICH guideline E6, which is a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses and reporting of clinical trials \u0001so that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confid entiality of trial subjects are protected, we revised KGCP in 2000. Bridging study was introduced in 2001 for the new drug registration, and the IND approval system was introduced as part of the new drug approval system in 2002 for enhancing new drug development and allowi ng multinational clinical trials easier. We tried to harmonize ICH guideline E6, to pr otect trial subjects and safety, to give investigators clear responsibility and to stre ngthen IRB's function, and we are adapting this guideline to KGCP continuously.

(5) ASEAN: Thailand 79 Clinical Development in Asia and ICH: Implementation of ICH Guidelines in Asian Countries Discussion (Chairpersons: Kohei Wada and Mike Ward) Wada : May I now invite the panelists to the stag e? I thank all the speakers very much for talking about the situation in their country. From what I h eard about the GCP adoption or adaptation, in China it is adapted, and in Korea it is mostly adopted? Kim: Yes, mostly adopted. Wada : In Thailand is it adopted? I hope I am differentiating the pronunciation. Anyway, now under this situation, I would like to talk a little b it about the actual impl ementation issue. Can I ask each of you: What do you think are the most important issues right now, related to the implementation of GCP or regarding conduct of c linical studies in your country? For example, the investigators' side, IRB side, or the industr y side, would be one perspective. Or, I think many of you do the inspection; what have you f ound from the inspection that is significant? Or, you do a lot of training; what do you put focus or emphasis on in such training? - Anything that you can bring up as an example would be nice. Kim: In the case of Korea, the main problem is th e difference in the quality in clinical trial centers and IRB. Because of that, the Korean FDA tried to persuade hospitals, IRBs and CRCs to keep the KGCP and ICH rules. The KF DA and the MHW in Korea invested nine regional clinical centers point five to one million dollars per center for the development of an education program, especially in clinical centers and IRB/CRC. Another problem is following the adverse clinical results. No wadays, hospitals and other clin ical trial centers are not too frank about results with adverse r eactions. It is a problem. Thank you. Wada : Thank you. Javroongrit : I also would like to share about the impor tance or the difficulty in terms of implementing the GCP. I think that in the case of Thailand it may be the same as in other countries in Asia. One of the im portant issues is to ask the c onsent from the subject. As an oriental culture, most of the pa tients always leave everything up to the doctor, and they just do whatever the doctor asks them to do, without any attention whether it is a clinical trial. The point is that the PI (principal investigator) should donate availa ble ample time to the clinical trial. Since only a good physician can be a good investigator, they might face difficulty in donating sufficient time to the trial due to thei r busy schedules with their other routine work. Therefore, I think on this point we might need to strengthen our consenting system, in terms of the work on asking consent and recognition of the subject. I think this is really important, on the view of a regulator. We need the subject to really realize and get all the information ICH Tokyo Symposium 80 before they get into any trials. The second thing, which is quite difficult in my country, is the monitoring issue. You know, clinic al trials in the past were kind of voluntary. Medical schools have to do teaching and also resear ch. When we started to have th e GCP, a part of that was the monitoring. It is quite difficult fo r the Thai FDA. What we need to do, really, is to discuss and then to set up the standards and the policies on how to work on these. This is, I think especially either from the regulator, the Thai FDA, or from the ethical committee, how to do the monitoring over the clinical trials. Even though we have achieved successfully from sponsor-internal audit and from the US FDA and the EMEA inspection, I think we still need to work more on how to do the appropriate monitoring over the clinical trials. Thank you. Wada : Thank you, Dr. Javroongrit. Dr. Ding, please? Ding : I believe, as I mentioned in my presentatio n, that training for GCP is the most important issue - not only in China, but in some other count ries as well. This is because, in considering the nature of it, GCP cannot be implemented by a single pers on unlike other ICH guidelines. They should be understood and practically used by investigators, monitors, sponsors and many other authorities. One single clinical trial will, at the same time, involve many factors rather than a single entity to fini sh it. Conversely, even if a singl e investigator is to do things wrong within one clinical trial boun dary, then the clinical trial as a whole can turn out wrong. In other words, a single wrong step can cause a wrong result. It is a systematic issue. Only training can ensure all the system, without any pr oblems so that they can be assured that the ICH would be practically implemented. Otherwis e, because the technical guidelines are in fact without boundaries, regardle ss of whether the country has adopted or adapted from the Web or from a publication, the technical expert s can utilize the guidelines with the language they know, whether it is English or another la nguage. I know some Chinese professionals and experts that indeed read Japane se, and so they understand Japa nese more than English. Then the issues are greater issues. Because of the non-boundary of the technical guidelines, the issue that becomes more important is how to train people who are involved in the clinical trials - for all, not for only one person. Thank you. Wada : Mr. Ward, who is sitting next to me, has been involved in theses GCG activities for many, many years, and I know you have a lo t of thoughts about a doption/adaptation and implementation of guidelines. Can you share some of your thoughts with us? Ward : We have certainly had some very productiv e discussions within the GCG over the last year or so, involving the presenters today, on the adoption versus adaptation and the complexities associated with this issue. Really, there are two categories. One is where there is a deliberate intention to apply some of a particular guideline and maybe transition into applying the entire ICH guideline. Then there are other situations where it is not intentional and it is matter of language, of in terpretation, of training, et cetera. It is also true that adoption is not the same as implementa tion, and that to truly implemen t a guideline as it was intended, you have to have a good understanding of the obj ectives of the guideline; and you have to have - and I think this was repeated several times - training of all the players. When it comes to GCP, we do have many players: we have th e investigators, the I RBs, the sponsors and the regulatory authorities. Other co nsiderations include: havi ng the right skill sets and qualifications to make use of certain ICH gui delines; awareness of new requirements; the barriers that regulations pose, as we have hear d: for example, if regulations do not allow for Panel Discussion 81 particular guidelines to be a pplied; the need for collateral guidances to integrate an ICH guideline in a regulatory framework; and as we have heard again from Dr. Ding, the difficulties translation of words and even conc epts pose. So, clearly, the actual understanding and effective and complete implementation of a guideline really re lies on a number of different things within any country. Wada : Thank you. Now we are running out of time. But do any of the panelists want to share any information specific to their country? Javroongrit : I would like to share something, but not specific to my country, maybe on behalf of the region. As an RHI I really would like to express our sincere thanks to the ICH, especially in the GCG, which is the forum fo r the information changing as well as the forum to build understanding and trust among us. With the GCG I think that our ICH party understands our obstacle or difficulty in terms of implementing the ICH technical guidelines and lead to a valuable offer - for example, fr om the ICH's Regulators just now has created a forum for the regulator of non-ICH countries, and used that to open training for the non-ICH. In addition, each of them, as well as Health Ca nada, try to provide support as requested, if possible. Right now the IC H GCG is trying to expand the facilita tion. I think that this is really a good way or mechanism to help the non-ICH countries to understand and be able to implement the ICH guidelines with understanding and know how to do so better. So I just would like to thank you. Wada : Thank you for your statement. Before clos ing this session, I would like to ask Mr. Ward to make a short statement on where he thi nks the GCG is heading, or the future of the GCG. Ward : Well, I think we are really at a crossroads right now. It has taken a certain amount of time to set up mechanisms to bring in regional harmonization initiatives, to have dialog, to get to know one another, to understand some of the issues. And I thin k we really have established a partnership. ICH has better understanding of the challenges faced by no n-ICH regions. Let's face it: the implementation of IC H guidelines can sometimes be a challenge even for ICH regulators and industry within the ICH regions. Imagine: if you are not part of the process, not part of the dialog, how can you be expected to fully understand the intent behind these guidelines? So I believe the GC G will play an increasingly impor tant role in promoting global implementation of ICH guidelines, to the benefit of all countries involved. We do rely on our colleagues from the regions. We have, I think it is fair to say, established a considerable level of trust and respect and understand ing for one another. We are all in the same game. We are all looking at promoting public health. ICH guidelines are essential to achieving that goal. I think the new mechanisms that are being set up, that will bring in other countries and allow for frank discussion amongst regulators on some of the issues that were raised today, and then feed that back into the Global Cooperation Group for specific training, will be vital. I believe that we have a very bright future ahead of us, under the leadership of Wada-san and Dr. Arlett. Wada : Thank you. So I hope, for the audience, this session was useful. I apologize that we do not have enough time to discuss more, but we will continue with this GCG activity within the ICH framework, and we would like to share with you any ne w progress or advancemen ts we make along the ICH Tokyo Symposium 82 way. Before I close, I would like to ask you to gi ve big hands to the four speakers from abroad. Thank you very much. Panel Discussion 83CLOSING REMARKS Satoshi Toyoshima, MHLW (PMDA) Member of the Steering Committee Ladies and gentlemen, upon closing, as a member of the Steering Committee of ICH I would like to say a few words. For today, we covere d many hot topics. It ha s been a long day and I thank you all for your attention. As Mr. Wada mentioned this morning, in the past, ICH results have been presented every three years or so at the big conventions or c onferences. However, with the cancellation of the major conference this spring, we decided to have a very region-ti ed symposium on the following day of the SC expert meetings to report on the latest meeting results to the audience. We decided to invite Rapporteurs amongst the committee members to give direct presentations to the audience of interest. They ha d to stay an extra day for this presentation, but they are the central figures embedded in the entire work of that particular subject. I am sure that you had a very good understanding of the themes presented. Since this was the very first arrangement of this kind, we had many worries. However, this turned out to be a very rich progr am. I was privileged to be a part of it and feel that this was a tremendous success. I would like to thank the speak ers for their extra effort that made this possible. I do not want to go into lengths, but as for myself, I believe that this particular symposium will contribute to the global deve lopment of innovative new drugs. With this, I would like to conclude my short speech. Thank you very much. ICH Tokyo Symposium 84 "}
