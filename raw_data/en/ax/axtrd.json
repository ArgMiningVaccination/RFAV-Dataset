(Amethyst) has been serving Bloomington si nce 1980. It is a Bloomington-based non-profit United Way agency that provides recovery focused residential and outpatient services for people with drug, alcohol and gambling addictions, as well as educational and self-awareness gr oups for persons with signs of potential substance abuse. Its mission is to \"partner with individuals, fa milies and communities impacted by additions and substance abuse issues by providing quality reco very services and guidance for clean, sober and healthy living.\" It collaborates with the court sy stem and a network of social services agencies to provide services to its clients, train staff, and raise money for these purposes. Amethyst has three transitional residential facilities in Bl oomington that house 17 men as well as 10 women and their dependent children and that provide 5 weekly 12-Step AA/NA meetings for about 80 persons, who include both new comers and people with long-term sobriety. Project Amethyst House requests $7,860 to replace vinyl and carpet flooring in Men's and Women's houses as well as purchase three \"near commercial-grade\" dishwashers to replace existing ones in Women's house (one) and Men's house (two). The carpet in the Men's House is about 8 years old and the carpet and vinyl in the Wo men's House is 14 years old. The new surfaces should last about 15 years. Criteria Need. The application in 2003 stated that the SPAN/MC ranked drug and alcohol abuse and affordable housing among the five highest prioritie s for social services in this community. It cited other local studies (by the CARES board and in the HAND's Consolidated Plan) for the need to increase the beds for men seeking tr eatment for substance abuse. The 1991 COMPASS report also recommended use of the men' s facility to reduce the jail population. One-Time Investment. This is a one time request to repl ace aged and worn carpet and vinyl flooring and three old dishwashers. Fiscal Leveraging. Amethyst House is a non-profit th at garners approximately $650,000 in funds from a variety of sources to run all of its programs. It is also planning to pay for a fourth dishwasher. Broad and Long-Lasting Benefits. The investment in flooring and equipment will provide safer and more habitable facilities for all of Amethyst's programs. They will provide broad and long-lasting benefits by keepi ng existing and attracting new persons for its transitional and counseling services. These person s are facing their addictions and attempting to better their lives and the lives of those around them.

Project BBI requests $5,000 in bridge funding (e .g. salaries, site visits, traini ng and conference fees, equipment and supplies, etc.) to support IU Best Buddies Chap ter which began in 2002. The funds will help a BBI Program Manager \"recruit, train, and guide IU faculty and student leader s to a run a successful chapter\" here. This project is being done in collaboration with Stone Belt Arc, who will serv e as the Host Site and identify the 26 potential buddies. The buddy relationship lasts for one aca demic year and \"begin(s) with organized group activities, followed by weekly one-to-one communication betw een the Buddy Pairs and one-to-one individual activ ities twice a month.\" Criteria Need: The application cites the 2003 SCAN Report for iden tifying persons with disabilities as a priority for services, particularly in less ening the \"public discomfort and mi sunderstanding of their capabilities\" through \"greater awareness and education.\" It also notes that over 8,500 such persons between the ages of 21-64 are living in Monroe County. One-Time Investment: This is a request for $5,000 in bridge funding to support the program due to a loss of revenue. A follow-up communication with the grant writer indicated that there was no clear loss in funding, but more of an uncertainty about future funding that led to the application. In regard to a well-developed plan for future funding, the applica tion says that BBI will \"support the IU chapter by raising funds from private sources including ... speci al events, major gift cultivation, direct mail, corporate and individual donor cu ltivation, and foundation grants.\" Fiscal Leveraging: The statewide BII College Pr oject has garnered $84,780 in grants and donations, and relies on a significant contributi on in the form of the college students serving as \"buddies.\" Broad and Long-Lasting Effects: The Best Buddy program is unique in providing long-term, mutually enriching one-to-one relationships between people with and without IDD and is recognized as an exemplary model for integrating persons with IDD into the community-life.

Its mission is to help children reach their potential through professionally supported, mentoring relationships with measurable impact. In 2009, they served over 900 at-risk youth in this county through their community based 1-1, in-school 1-1, Club Bigs (with Boys and Girls Club), and First Friends (which provides group mentoring for youth on the waiting list). The children matched with BBBS mentors have been shown to be more likely to have better peer relationships and be significantly less likely to skip a day of school, start using il legal drugs or drinking alcohol, or lie to their parents. Project BBBS is requesting $3,309 to complete a multi-year investment in the BBBS of America Agency Information Management (AIM) System. The AIM System streamlines how they \"manage contact with (their) matches, track ev aluation information, allow 'real time' reports, interface directly with (their national office), communicate directly with volunteers and allow for a massive scale down of 'paper' files.\" The final step involves the purchase of, and training on, the BlackBaud Sphere in a Box, which is software that includes: 1) Website-in-a-box (allowing them to maintain a webpage that accepts credit card donati ons, receives volunteer inqui ries, enrolls children, and increases collaboration within their network), 2) Friends-ask ing-Friends along with a Special Events package (allowing them to manage fund-ra ising events) and 3) E- Communications (allowing them to communicate more effectively with supporters). Criteria Need. The application notes that the HAND 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan places a hi gh priority on youth services and estimates a service gap of 3,200 youth. The Plan acknowledges that caring adult role models and mentors make a positive and measurable difference in the lives of the at-risk youth. The application furthe r notes that the 2003 SCAN Report identifies positive youth development as one of its top ten priorities, especially the la ck of appropriate consis tent role models. The Report also recommends targeting low-income families and other at-risk children and removing barriers to their success. One-Time Investment. The request is for the purchase of , and training on, the BBBS of America web software. It is the final stage in a series of technology improvements. The annual service fees will be covered by the agency in the future. Fiscal Leveraging. \" Through grants from the United Way, Smithville Telephone Foundation, and others over the last 4 years, (they) have been able to purchase laptops for staff, fully integrate into the AIM System and update (their) server capacity.\" Th e cost of the package has also been \"greatly discounted.\" Broad and Long-Lasting Benefits. This project will \"increase (their) efficiency, thus allowing (them) to serve more children cost effectively a nd help (them) become a more 'green' agency.\" Cost Amount Requested Blackbaud Sphere Bundle Fee (including Website in a Box, E Communications, Friends asking Friends Kintera BFKS Use) $2,500 One Time Set Up/Training Fee $809 TOTAL AMOUNT REQUESTED $3,309 Other Funds Smithville Telephone Foundation - for Laptop $1,400 BBBS General - for American Agency Information Management System (AIM) Yearly Management Fee $4,298 Total Other Funds $5,698 Total Project Cost $9,007 SSF Funding History 1995 Granted Office Renovation $4,800 1999 Denied Capital Grant $50,000 2000-June Denied Long Range Business and Growth Plan $20,000 2000-Oct.

Accord ing to its webpage, CH provides: health clinics, health screeni ng, lead testing, nutriti on counseling, State Hea lth Insurance Program (SHIP), car seat safety checks, Teen Options, Hea lthy Aging (and a discount Plus Card), Alzheimer's Resource Center, Tobacco Prevention, and a Parish Nurse Program. During 2009, CH served approximately 13,000 county residents. Project CH is requesting $8,320 in bridge funding to pa y half of the salary of Coordinator for the Fresh Start to Life Program, which began in 2007 and is designe d to reduce the rate of premature birth among at-risk pregnant women. Th is population includes pregnant women of low-income or young age (under 18), or with an addiction to drugs, alcohol or tobacco. The Coordinator would conduct 5 visits to 75 at-risk pregnant women to prov ide health assessments, education (on preventative behaviors, risk factors and signs of pre-term labor), and support (via, in part, referrals to other community resources like WIC, food stamps, Hoosier Healthwise, and child care and parenting programs). The incidence of premature birth was 15% for clients of this program compared to 55% for a sim ilarly situated group of pregnant women. A two-year grant fro m the Indiana Chapter of the Marc h of Dimes is ending this June. Criteria Need. The application cites the most recent SCAN Report for the importance that health care and education play in breaking the cycle of poverty. This included providing outreach in the form of parenting education and health inform ation to low-income populations. One-Time Investment. The $8,230 request is for bridge-funding to pay half of the salary of the Coordinator operating the Fresh Start to Life Program. The program was previously funded by the Community Foundation in 2007 and the Indiana Chapter of the March of Dimes, whose two-year grant will expire in mid-2010. A follow-up call, indicated that CH would seek March of Dimes funds in 2011, seek funds from the Hospital Foundation, and also ask the Foundation's help in raising money. Fiscal Leveraging. The $8,230 is leveraged by $11,002 in other so urces (including part of the grant from the March of Dimes), office space provided by Hannah House, and office space and, technology and supplies provided by Bloomington Hospital. Broad and Long-Lasting Benefits. This program significantly reduced the incidence of premature birth among at-risk pregnant women which, in turn, lowers the cost of medical care. It also helps improve the lives of the mother and child by prov iding useful education and support on a one-o-one basis.

All the Boys and Girls Club programs are designed to build character and strengthen life skills while providing hope and opportunity. There is a main facility at 311 South Lincoln, a satellite facil ity at 1108 W. 14 th Street in the Crestmont Center, and a camp site at Lake Lemon. Pr ograms are staffed by trained youth development professionals, Indiana University students , and community volunteers. B&GC provides transportation services from school to its progra ms and programs of other youth agencies every school day. Over 1,300 youth are curre ntly registered members of its two clubs. In a follow-up communication, B&GC indicated that 24% of th e main club members' families earn below $15,000 per year and 22% of them earn between $15,000 and $30,000 per year. Project B&GC is requesting $4,900 to purchase equi pment and tools to add capacity to its Club Riders Program which be gan in 2009. The program takes six members (age 11-16) accompanied by two adults on long afternoon ri des around Bloomington and focuses on outdoor exercise (health), bike safety and maintenance, and appreciation of our community. The money would help transport the bikes (by paying for two tr ailer hitches and two hitch-mounted bike racks), replace the aging fleet of bikes (by buying 7 ch ildren-size and 1 adult-si ze bikes), and provide maintenance and instruction on maintenance (by b uying a work bench and t ools). The request will result in additional 2-4 riders per ride. Thos e rides are once a week during the school year and, hopefully, every day during the summer. Criteria Need. The application cites the SCAN Report for the need to provide programs for youth in households experiencing socio-economic ills, who f ace greater life difficulties than other children. It also cites a study indicating that inco me-disparities coincide with a lack of healthy food and a lack of opportunities for physical exercise. One-Time Investment. This is a one-time $4,900 request for bicycles and related equipment for a recently added outdoor exercise program. Fiscal Leveraging. This request joins contributions by Exodus Church (8 youth bicycles), Bloomington Hospital (8 youth bike helmets), eight community residents ( $2,500 toward staff time), and Bloomington Bike Club ($1,400 toward a permanent leader for the rides).

Its mission is to: 1) provide kids whose parents have or have had cancer with a summer camp experience that gives them a chance to be kids; and 2) allow college students to channel their passion fo r making a difference, while developing critical leadership skills for long-term social impact. Over those five years and with financial and technical support from the national organization, th e local branch has provided eligible children 6-16 years of age with a free camp where they ca n meet peers going through a similar experience and learn six core values: compassion, community, safety, confidence, leadership and magic. Project Camp Kesem is requesting $16,960 in bridge-f unding to cover half of the cost of lodging and food for this week-long camp. The camp is the culmination of a year-long project for IU students who make it ha ppen. The camp is located at Happy Hollow Camp Grounds in Nashville, Indiana. Criteria Need. The application represents an organization that serves ch ildren of parents who have or have had cancer and sets forth a logical argument for the need for those services, but does not cite any local or other survey s upporting the need for this effort. One-Time Investment. This is a request for bridge -funding where subsequent communication with the grant writer elaborated upon Kesem's circumstances. Due to economic conditions and changes in grant policies, Kesem did not receive money it had received in the past from the Lilly Endowment ($5,000), the Summer Y outh Program Fund, and other sources. To provide future funding, they will augment their fundraising efforts by holding events (e.g. car wash), conduction letter writing parties (to friends asking for money) , and seeking other grants. Fiscal Leveraging. The application explains that IU stude nts meet every week during the year to plan and raise money for this camp.

It is a memb er agency of the United Way and has the mission of enhancing human dignity and func tioning for the community at large through education, social service delivery, and advocacy. It is a faith-based agency committed to providing quality therapeutic counseling without regard to religious affiliation, gender, disability, race, se xual orientation, age, or ability to pay for services. It serves a six c ounty area but approximately 75% of its clients are from M onroe County. In 2009, CCB provided 2,337 hours of mental health counselin g to 208 individuals and 84 families, reaching a total of 146 family members. Eighty -two percent of those hours were fo r clients without insurance or on Medicaid. During that y ear, CCB also provided 840 hours of counseling in two schools, reaching 200 children. The fee for mental health counseling ranges fr om $0 - $100/hr depending on the household income. Project CCB requests $9,882.50 to pay for start-up costs for a series of pilot group therapy programs for children and their families based upon The Incredible Years Social Skills Training Program . This award- winning, evidence-based program \"is desi gned to promote social competence a nd to prevent, reduce, and treat aggression and related conduct problems in very young a nd school-age children.\" The start-up costs include: training two clinical staff (4 -day workshop in Seattle), various program s (largely in the form of DVDs), and materials (in the form of puppets, laminated cards, i nk stamps, and books). These programs will be conducted both in school and clinical settings under the supervis ion of Marsha McCarty, who is a licensed psychologist with 30 years experience with child and family thera py. She confirmed in a call th at CCB is aware of other agencies (i.e. Milestones and Centerstone) using this pr ogram and will collaborate w ith them and not duplicate services. Criteria Need. The application notes that the 2003 SCAN Report identified children as a vulnerable population and found that mental health services we re \"in a state of crisis, with poor accessibility, especially for families without insurance and families living below the poverty le vel.\" That crisis worsened when Oak Tree Counseling closed this year. CCB has taken up some of that client load. This request will \"greatly enhance CCB's ability to reach young children and their families with an array of (effective) programs...with recognizable outcomes.\" One-Time Investment.

With 30 y ears experience in the community, its mission is to promote a civil and just community through me diation, education, and restorative justice. CJAM serves as a central organiza tional hub for conflict reso lution activities in Bloomington and Monroe County. Programs include the Healing Community Harm/Victim-Offender Reconciliation Program (VORP) and Shoplifter's A lternative, as well as comprehensive community mediation and conflict resolution services for all sectors of the comm unity. Across all of its programs, CJAM took 363 referrals and served over 550 clients and their families in 2009. Project Communication with CJAM clarified that it is reque sting $20,000 in bridge/start-up funding to help to create a part-t ime Manager, Healing Community Harm Services at 20 hours per week ($15,000) and bring the Managing Direct or from part-time (18 hrs/wk) to full-time ($5,000) in order to continue and expand existing prog rams. Principal among these progr ams is VORP, which works with the Probation Department and the Courts to redu ce recidivism for juvenile offenders, \"increase reparations, reduce victim discomfort, and produce a commun ity model for addressi ng violations of trust.\" In 2009, VORP accepted 97 referrals (75 juven iles and their families) and spent between 5 - 12 hours per offender at no cost. Due to the low particip ation of victims in this program (50%), CJAM intends to use JHSSF funds to develo p a \"Community Voices\" initiative to make offenders aware of the harm caused by their actions. CJAM also intends to redesign the SA/YES Shoplifters Alternative Program to better serve local needs by, in part, instituting Victim Impact Panels. Lastly, CJAM intends to meet the expanding need for Community Mediation services which went from 6 referrals in 2008 to 93 in 2009. Criteria Need. The application cites the 200 3 SCAN Report for the number of crimes in the community (4,343 in 2000) and the high level of respondents who felt a ffected as a victim of household crime (48%). It also cites numerous references in the Report regardi ng the efficacy and benefits of mediation, especially in regard to family matters. One-Time Investment. This is a $20,000 request for bridge/start-up funding to continue and expand programs.

It has served the Bloomington Community for over 50 years a nd provides services to 4,000 persons at its Bloomington facilities each year. Project CSI is requesting $25,000 in start-up funds to cover the training and certification to implement their Be Well Lifestyles (BWL) Program. The BWL promotes health and physical fitness for adults with serious mental illness, which includes those in treatment for co-occurring substance abuse disorders. The JHSSF money would be used to pay for certification and traini ng and one year of support with the In SHAPE program developed by the Monadnock Family Services in New Hampshire. In SHAPE \"prepares ... CSI to deliver the program in a way that appeals to participants, generates reportable outcomes, strengthens credibility a nd partnerships among other community groups and (provides) the benefits of patient -centered care.\" The program takes th ree years to get established and involves a health mentor/personal trainer meeting w ith the client every week to create and carry-out individualized health, nutrition and fitness goals. Nutrition education and ac tivities, vouchers for membership at exercise facilities, smoking cessa tion programs and access to their primary care physician will further encourage clients to change beha vior. Numerous organizations will collaborate in this program including Bloomington Hospital, YMCA, Parks & Recreation, Mother Hubbard's Cupboard, IU HYPER, and many others. Criteria Need. The application states that BWL will serve clients with severe an d persistent mental illness which were identified as a vulne rable population in the 2003 SCAN Report . It cites a national technical report for the proposition that persons with serious ment al illness die 25 years ea rlier than the general population, and that the disparity is \"c learly linked\" to a lack of acce ss to primary care services. Those services can help address many ot her contributing factors - sedent ary life styles, poor diet, smoking, substance abuse, and metabolic alte ration due to psychiatric medications - that lead to an early death and a poor quality of health. One-Time Investment. The $25,000 request will pay for formal ( In SHAPE ) training and certification for CSI leadership and staff for the first year of a th ree year commitment. While the first year is being largely paid for outside of its budge t, CSI is looking for greater Medica id reimbursement and intends to develop the resources to fund this program in the future.

Tom Po meranz, a nationally renowned author and expert, will give a key-note address to 100, and then co nduct an afternoon training session for smaller group of 40, direct service professionals during this one-and-a-half-day conference. This follows a keynote speech and training he provided last year at a two-day conference sponsored by Christole, Stone belt and Options. In a follow-up communicati on, the grant writer noted that the presentations will be video-recorded for future use as training. Criteria Need. The 2008 application cited the SCAN Report for the fact that there are 2,130 persons in Monroe County 5-20 years of age with disabilitie s and that, in general, this population faces difficulties obtaining: transportation; advocacy fo r health care and financial services; and the specially trained staff they need. The current application makes the l ogical (but unsupported) argument that it is difficult for agencies to retain motivated and engaged dire ct service professionals because there are no existing training programs fo r them and the work is demanding and requires acute skills, selflessn ess, and compassion. One-Time Investment. In a follow-up communication, the gr ant writer described this as a request for bridge-funding due to a significant reduction in Medicaid reimbursements of 2.5% in 2009 and 3% in 2010, which resulted in deficit of $227,000 over two years. They have cut staff, reduced benefits and frozen wages in order to deal with the loss. This trai ning is an important priority which they intend to fund in the future. Fiscal Leveraging.

It is an organization of volunteers who, through direct service, advocac y, education and research, identify needs of their Latino clients and support their efforts to become independent and self-sustaining. CCL's programs include \"tutoring services for all ages, th e Medical Interpretation Network, di rect services, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program, the Legal Advice Project, Info rmate (a series of educational presentations, health programming) and the Bienvenidos progr am (a support group that helps immigrants acculturate to life in the United States.\" CCL is currently located within the Monroe County Library and logged 300 direct service visits and se rves approximately 600 persons per year. Project CCL is requesting $3,500 in bridge-funding to pay for part of the salary of the Volunteer Coordinator, which was formerly known as the Advocate for Community Engagement (ACE) position. The ACE position was created three years ago and funde d in partnership with the IU Community Outreach and Partnerships in Service Learning (COPSL) Program. Budget cuts at IU led to the termination of funding for th e next academic year. The position is essential for this \"volunteer powered\" agency. The incumbent: \"coordinate(s) ove r 50 volunteers per semester, manage(s the) tutoring program, orient(s) volunteers to CCL's mission opport rd(s) all servic e hours completed and facilitate(s) ...(the assessment) of programs and future needs.\" Criteria Need. The application notes that the SCAN Report classifies Latinos as an \"at-risk population\" who: suffer from language and cultural barriers; are uninf ormed about services, laws, and rights; become caught up in legal problems; mi ss opportunities for employment; and, don't use needed social services. A previous applicati on noted that a Monroe County La tino Needs Assessment Task Force found that many sectors of the community lack th e means to inform the Spanish-speaking population of their services. It also me ntioned an IU study identifying the challenges of relying on a volunteer driven organization. One-Time Investment. CCL is requesting $3,500 in bridge-funding due to a significant loss of funding from IU, in order to continue the Volunt eer Coordinator position into the fall semester. According to a follow-up call, CCL will renew its request for funds from IU COPSL in the future and will engage in more fundraising. Fiscal Leveraging. The request would be leveraged by $1,700 of CCL funds for salary and $1,050 in grants for materials and supplies. CCL recei ves income through board contributions, fundraising and enrollment fees. It is primarily \"power ed\" by approximately 90 volunteers each year. Broad and Long-Lasting Benefits. Funding the Volunteer Coordina tor position will assure that volunteers are effective and also enriched by the experience. CCL addresses the p roblems of the growing Spanish-speaking population by facilita ting entry of Latinos with Limited English Proficiency into the community and maximizing the de livery of services which will enrich lives and make Bloomington a more welcoming community.

The Foundation works with all 23 schools in the district to develop, implement, and fund educational project s and initiatives that significantly impact student learning. It is our belief that an investment in children is an investment in our community and in our future.\" Project . FMCCS is requesting seed money to fund an implementation coordinator for a new instructional model at Fairview School called Artful Learning . Fairview serves the most disadvantaged population in our community - over 90% of students qualify for free and reduced lunch. This economic disadvantage often translates into lower achievement and attendance. Indeed, Fairview has failed to meet progress benchmarks required by federal law. As a result, federal rules have required it to replace its administrator and half of its teaching staff and to completely overhaul its instructional methodology. After years of study, Fairview has identified a new instructional tool for the school called Artful Learning . This is the signature school improvement model of the Leonard Bernstein Center and is based on 19 years of research and refinement by leading educators. It is an interdisciplinary approach to learning that combines music, fine arts and performing arts with concept-based learning. By embedding the arts in the learning process, it \"serves as a method of response for students to convey understanding across content areas and throughout the curriculum.\" Studies show that students w ith high levels of arts participation did better than their peers on achievement, critical thinking and behavior measures. This difference was more significant in lower socioeconomic groups. Artful Learning was approved for Fairview, in part, because the arts have become such an anchor there. Within the last five years, the school has partnered with the IU to provide before and after school programs for instrument lesso ns, acting and dancing. This has increased both the participation of the students and their parents. Fairview leadership has studied other Artful Learning schools and has learned that both teachers and the broader school community \"will need assistance in transition into an entirely new way of learning and teaching.\" A full-time coordinator would be the expert on implementation, coaching the teachers and serving as a liaison to the community. The coordinator would ensure that the program is being implemented with integrity and, along with the principal, will be accountable for the success of the program. Bridge funding will \"allow the school system time to acclimate to the upcoming changes necessitated by extreme funding cuts and develop an action plan for funding the position in the next sever years.\" If full funding is not granted, partial funding will provide it more time to secure additional funds through other sources. Faculty and staff will commence mandatory tr aining for the program this summer. Criteria Need. SCAN points out that \"education and participation in productive activities can help break the cycle of persistent poverty. Special efforts should be made to reach out to youth and families in crisis, to those who are underserved, to those who are at risk, and to remove or mitigate barriers to participation.\" One-Time Investment. Artful Learning requires a three-year implementation phase. Most of the funding for the first year has been secured, except for fund s for the coordinator. Beyond the first year, FMCCS will work closely with the school system to secure funding in years two and three. In years two and three, the need for the coordinator will diminish. An implementation coordinator is not required after the third year of the program. Indeed, after the third year, the model is sustainable without additional investment. Fiscal Leveraging. As recounted below, FMCCS has already leveraged $93,829 toward the $153,829 first- year cost of the program. It seeks Hopkins funds to make up the difference. Broad and Long-Lasting Benefits. Artful Learning \"has the potential to change the lives of our students.

(GI) has been in Bloom ington since 1975 with the mission of inspiring all \"girls to be strong, smart, and bold.\" It serves girls age 6 - 18 with qua lity, research-based programs in the areas of: career choice & life planning, self-reliance & life skills, health & sexuality, sports & adventure, leaders & community action, and culture & her itage appreciation. It transports and provides programs to girls after school, at summer and winter camps, and via sports leagues. Project GI requests bridge funding for its Program Director 's salary due to a substantial loss of Neighborhood Assistance tax credit Program (NAP) credits. GI's credits were reduced from 7,600 ($15,200) in 2008-2009 to 3,000 ($6,000) in 2009-2010. This loss has been compounded by a general decline in donations due to the economic downturn. GI is currently implementing a strategic long-term plan for fund development. GI writes that its programs and staff are teaching girls to resist gender stereotypes, prepare for the workforce, economic independence and to accept their bodies. GI writes that single-sex environments foster greater self acceptance and make girls more likely to try new things and focus on their individual interests, free of distraction. \"In today's economy, it is crucial that girls have a safe place to go after school while guardians finish school and find jobs.\" By offering need-based scholarships and transportation to its center, GI works to make sure girls of all backgrounds have access to its services. GI collaborates wit MCCSC and Boys and Girls Club to provide transportation to its facilities and partners with Hoosier Hills Food Bank, Mother Hubbard's Cupboard and the IU Chemistry Club for its programming. Criteria Need. The SCAN Report notes that 40% of families wi th household income of less than $15,000 had a problem finding affordable after-school programs (as opposed to 19% of all households). The Report also suggested that youth facing economic difficulties have fewer a ppropriate role models. Adolescent girls feel more stress and use more alcohol (38% v 27%) and cigarettes (66% v 49%) than adolescent boys. GI writes that it is therefore, \"crucial that girls have a safe sp ace in which they are encouraged to talk about the anxiety or stress they may be experiencing, receive en couragement from caring staff and volunteers, and learn healthy methods fro dealing w ith stress.\" According to SCAN, caring adult role models and mentors make girls more likely to complete school, do better academically, make healthier life choice(s) and engage in fewer destructive behaviors. One-Time Funding. This is a request for one-time bridge funding to address the loss of NAP credits. GI states that it recently mapped out a strategic pla n, of which a comprehensive funds development plan was developed and is now being implemented \"to ensure the fiscal health of the agency.\" One area of focus in this new plan is st rengthening individual giving. Fiscal Leveraging. GI will leverage $6,000 in NAP money and $3,200 from the Smithville Charitable Foundation to fund this position. GI also relies on the work of 150+ volunteers to make its initiatives successful. Broad and Long Lasting Benefits. \"By educating girls about how to care for themselves and for others, and by building their self-confidence,\" GI writes that it is, \"reducing the changes that they will engage in risky behavior that often creates financial burdens for a community.

They charge no interest, sell for no profit, and work with other housing organizations to eliminate homelessness and poverty h ousing in Monroe County. Since their inception in 1987, they have built 93 homes resulting the housing of 114 adults and 172 children from low-income families. Project Habitat is requesting funds for its Construction Leadership Program - an effort to increase the affiliate's building capacity. Funds will be used to purchase a \u00be ton pickup truck with a dump bed, a 24-foot job site trailer and power tools. Habitat has a goal of housing ten more families in the fiscal year 2010-2011 (an increase over eight houses built in 2009-2010) and will have up to four build sites under construction at any one time. To make this goal of increased, simultaneous house-building work, Habitat has launched a Construction Leadership Program . The program will train 200 volunteers to serve as skilled volunteers on construction sites. These leaders will be trained by Ha bitat staff and will direct the work of 2-5 unskilled volunteers on construction sites. To equip the increased number of crew and job sites, it needs more tools and more mobile storage space. Habitat currently has one trailer whose size is insufficient to store the necessary tools, nor is it possible for the trailer to be on more than one site at a time. Habitat currently has one, aging 1987 pick up truck. If it receives funds for an additional truck, it will use both trucks to address the need of simultaneous house building. Criteria Need. SCAN identifies the need for safe and affordable housing in our community, especially opportunities for home-ownership by low-income families. It recognizes the problems low-income households face obtaining conventional financing for housing, cars, and higher education. About 43% of households with income of less than $25,000 and about 28% of households with income of less than $15,000 own their own homes. SCAN further states that affordable housing was a major problem for 27% and a minor problem for 54% of respondents. One-Time Funding. This is a request for one-time funding. Fiscal Leveraging. Habitat has budgeted $14,000 or 36% of the purchase price of the truck. Habitat will also provide all other vehicle expenses: title, registration, insurance, maintenance and fuel (estimated @ $5,600 in the first year after purchase). Habitat will pr ovide staff members to train the construction leaders, operate the vehicles and maintain the inventory of tools at a cost of $3,672/year. The organization has budgeted $1,000 for tool purchases for the remainder of the fiscal year. An estimated 1,000 construction volunteers will invest more than 8,000 hours as a result of this program, and estimated $156,720 in labor. Broad and Long Lasting Benefits. The new truck, job site trailer and tools will allow Habitat to begin the process of significantly building its capacity. Once it is able to provision for simultaneous sites, it will be able to grow its volunteer builder base and increase the number of homes it builds every year, thereby serving an ever-more number of families in need of affordable housing.

Page # 225 Indiana Homeless Prevention Wiki (Pilot) $ 12,500 City residents served by this project in 2010: 3,000 (of: 86,000*) 6] Mission \"To use our resources to provide poor people with a wide variety of aggressive, quality legal services which will effectively help them to gain equal access to the c ourts; empower them to control their lives; and impact on the major causes and effects of poverty.\" ILS services low-income people (less than 200% of federal poverty guidelines) and seniors age 60 and over. Project Indiana Legal Services (ILS) requests funds to develop a homeless prevention wiki for its web site: www.indianajustice.org . The wiki will include Bloomington-specific information. A wiki is software that allows the creation, collaboration and editing of software on the web in simplified form. The goal of ILS's homeless prevention wiki is to provide simple, up- to-date information on housing law and homelessness prevention through increased legal information. The wiki will largely focus on landlord-tenant and foreclosure prevention. ILS's Bloomington Housing Law Center requests funds to develop the wiki content, to develop a tutorial on use of the wiki, for website hosting, consultant time fo r wiki set up and consultant time for development, collaboration and consulting on set up. This will provide information on Indiana law, with Bloom ington-specific information. This wiki is modeled on the homelessness wiki maintained by the Na tional Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty (www.nlchp.org ). The housing law wiki will have current information on local, State and federal housing law. For example, it will include current information on illegal lease provisions such as right of re-entry or shutting off utilities without going to court. The wiki will also have information such as the rights of tenants who are victims of domestic violence or whose landlords are being foreclosed upon. Bloomington information will also be culled from IU Student Legal Services, the foreclosure prevention pilot project in the Monroe County courts and other local information, such as the Bloomington Housing Authority. Content will also include brochures and handouts that low-income consumers and agencies can use, as well as sources of law, particularly useful for attorneys and people representing themselves in court. Tutorials providing instruction on the use of the wiki will be conducted for agencies such as the Housing Network, the Circles Initiative, United Way agen cy directors and will be filmed for CATS. Criteria Need. According to SCAN, 45% of those making less than $25,000/yr. had a problem affording needed legal help. 37% of social service agency clients lived in housing that needed major repairs. ILS writes that, \"Getting needed repairs done in rental housing can be extremely tr icky and often requires legal advice in order to avoid eviction. A clear statement of the landlord's and tenant's obligations under Indiana law can give tenants the tools they need to enforce their rights and meet their oblig ations. A list of resources for low-income people getting needed repairs in Bloomington will also be helpful. Having a homeless prevention wiki available around the clock will also prove useful in emerge ncy situations when consumers and agency staff do not have access to clear legal information about their rights.\" One-Time Investment. This is a request for one-time funding. ILS writes that it has the stability and long- term funding to maintain the wiki as a permanent presence on its website. Fiscal Leveraging . ILS will use Equal Justice AmeriCorps Fellow attorneys to develop the content for the wiki. A Hopkins grant will provide the necessary ma tch for the federal Americorps program. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits . ILS writes that low-income housing presents a challenging constellation of statues and regulations that make this area of law a my stery to most people. A wiki will provide clear, easy-to- understand guidance for practitioners, social service providers and residents in crisis.

The hours of operation will be from 9 PM to 7 AM.\" In January 2009, Trinity Episcopal Church started to respond to the need for winter shelter for area homeless residents by providing the facility, beds, staff and volunteers for a low-barrier emergency winter shelter in Bloomington. In the first three months of operation, it served 124 different individuals for a total of 1,882 bed nights. For the 2009-2010 winter season, the church started to recruit partners to help share the load of the emergency winter shelter. In the 2009-2010 season, over 20 local faith communities and 13 governmental, social service and business partners worked together to provide a total of 3,627 bed nights to people in need.* 3,246 of these nights were used by Monroe County residents. The shelter was housed in 2009-2010 at Allison-Jukebox, First United Church, Trinity Episcopal and First Christian Church. The Interfaith Winter Shelter Initiative (IWSI) is a low barrier shelter and only requires a simple screening and that guests conduct themselves in safe, respectfu l manner. IWSI strives to accommodate guests at any hour of need. Services are not tied to any sort of religious instruction, nor any other requirement. At the March 2010 IWSI Task Force meeting, the group voted to move forward with planning for a low-barrier emergency winter shelter from November 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011. The sites for 2010-2011 have not yet been identified. Project IWSI requests funds for the purchase of laundry equipment to clean the shelters linens and blankets and to provide a job for one or more of its shelter guests. IWSI writes that it spent more than $17,000 in the 2009- 2010 season to launder bed linens. Rather than paying a local business to wash linens and blankets, IWSI proposes to move the laundry in house. Specifically, it requests funds to purchase two large-capacity washing machines, two large-capacity driers, laundry supplies, funds to cover utilities and funds to hire a shelter guest at a living wage to do the labor. The exact location of the washers and dryers are still to be determined, but will likely be sited in one of the partner churches. Criteria Need. Emergency shelter is a need cited in both the SCAN and HAND 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan . Specifically, the Plan lists \"emergency housing for homeless individua ls a \"high priority\" (p. 108). According to the Plan, one of the principal needs is operating e xpenses for emergency housin g. (p.116). HAND's updated 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan specifically points out the Interfaith Wi nter Shelter and concludes that \"the churches need more support to continue.\" (p. 59) One-Time Investment. This is a request for one-time funding. If the program contracting with a shelter guest for the laundry labor is a success, then the IWSI Task For ce will work to raise donations for its continuation. In the event the IWSI does not endure into the 2011-2012 season, the washers and dryers will be donated to a local non-profit. Fiscal Leveraging . The request for funding for the IWSI laundry initiative is an integral part of its overall Winter Shelter. The IWSI aims to leverage approximate ly $46,000 in other funds to run the shelter in the 2010- 2011 winter season. The project is a collaborative effort of over 20 local faith communities and 13 governmental, social service and business partners. IWSI relies on 450 volunteers.

It opened in 2002 to continue emergency housing after Shelter, Inc. closed and incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2004. Since that time, it has provided food, clothing and shelter to 1,600 non-duplicated clie nts and provided over 38,000 nights of stay. MH runs two programs - Emergency Shelter, where clients can stay for as long as 120 days and Permanent & Supportive Housing (the Bridges Program), where clients can stay as long as they are meeting the requirements. MH staff work with clients in both programs to establish goals regarding employment, life skills, social services and housing and then evaluate their progress. In 2009, MH exceeded HUD benchmarks regarding consulting with clients, finding them stable housing, and improving their employment status. Project MH request funds for 14, two-drawer, under-bed clothing chests. Because of limited space, there are only 14 lockers available for residents to store their personal possessions. The remaining 14 residents store their things in bags and crates under the bed. \"Because their storage space is not as well defined as a locker, clothing, shoes, etc. spill out on to the limited space ar ound the beds. Their possessions are more easily rifled through by other residents as well. The bed storage units will maximize the limited space available for residents to store personal belongings and clearly define s how much room they may use for their possessions. This funding will help maximize space to better serve re sidents by making each resident's living space more secure.\" Criteria Need. The SCAN Report recognized that homeless individu als and families: do not have access to enough affordable housing in this community; often have multiple problems that block their prospects for self-sufficiency; and, would benefit from more sheltering places. The SCAN Steering Committee recommended that Monroe County \"expand the commun ity capacity for providing emergency shelter to individuals and families.\" MH writes that its services continue to be needed as the current economy threatens to reduce potential employment fo r the most vulnerable of our community.\" One-Time Investment.

From a crisis line in 1971, Middle Way House (MWH) grew in response to the identified needs of victims of abuse and now provides 24-hour crisis intervention, emergency sh elter, transition and permanent housing, life skills development and personal growth activities, legal ad vocacy, pre-employment training, placement assistance and supported employment, comprehensive programming for children and youth, violence prevention and professional development training programs. Project MWH requests $10,554 to help fund the purchase of kitchen equipment for the expansion of its Food Works program. Food Works is a MWH social enterprise that provides living-wage entry level jobs for low-skill workers. \"These jobs are hard to come by and are often incompatible with the demands placed on single mothers. Expansion [of] Food Works will provide meaningful, supported employment for more of the women we serve and promote economic development through the Bloomington Kitchen Incubator (BKI) as well.\" In the next 18 month, MWH anticipates that its Food Works' staff will grow by 5-10 workers (25-25 total) and BKI will support 20-25 people starting food-based businesses. Criteria Need. MWH points out that HAND's 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan ranks services for battered and abused spouses as a \"high priority.\" The Plan refers to MWH as part of an anti-poverty strategy, providing safety net offering self-sufficiency programs, case management services and appropriate counseling referrals. MWH writes that it \"figures prominently in the City's Continuum of Care, where shelter is considered first-stage housing in a plan that envisions transitional accommoda tions (which MWH provides) , permanent supportive housing (we maintain one unit and are planning six more ), and affordable housing for the working poor.\" MWH is referenced in the Antipoverty Strategy section of the Plan as part of the safety net offering self-sufficiency programs, case management services, and appropriate counseling referrals.

Vernal Pike. This will allow the HHFB Garden Program to increase food volume, quality and crop variety. HHFB's Bloomington agencies serve approximately 13,413 City residents per year. In 2009, the HHFB distributed over 300,000 pounds of produce, 83% of which went to agencies in the City. With weekly deliveries to three Bloomington Housing sites as and the Templeton Family Market; and 3x/week deliveries to Community Kitchen, Shalom Community Center and Mother Hubbard's Cupboard, HHFB anticipates similar levels of produce distribution to City agencies in the future. Indeed, such distribution might increase. A letter of support provided by HHFB director, Julio Alonso points out that the proximity of the proposed garden to the food bank (approx. 5 minutes away) and the perishable nature of the produce will have an \"even higher percentage of benefit to City residents.\" The HHFB will compost over 30,000 pounds of food wast e annually at the garden compost facility. If the garden equipment is funded, the orchard trees will be planted in 2010-2011 and the garden operations would commence in 2011. It is estimated that, after the perennial crops and the trees take root, the garden/orchard operation may generate over 20,000 pounds of produce each season. This 2\u00bc garden is part of an 18-acre park which connects the Bloomington B-Line Trail with the Karst Greenway, making access to the garden and orchard possible by bicycle. Criteria Need. SCAN points out that \"food is a fundamental human need,\" and that 17% of all households and 50% of low-income households reported problems having enough money for food. 7% of all households and 31% of low-income household needed emergency or supplemental food assistance. One-Time Investment. This is a request for a one-time investment in equipment. Fiscal Leveraging . The HHFB Garden and Gleaning Programs Coordinator will manage the garden and orchard and recruit and train volunteers. The Monroe County Parks and Recreation Department (MCPR) will provide $7,860 in in-kind labor. MCPR will also donate a tractor, hay wagon and 300-gallon water tank. The Monroe County Highway Department will devote $3,000 to driveway entrance improvement. Further, the land for the 18-acre park was donated to MCPR and has a total value of $153,000. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. MCPRF writes that fresh, nutritious food has a number of long-term benefits, including improved individual and community health.

We provide quality education and a safe place for children, basic needs assistance for the poor and community service opportuniti es.\" MCUM provides affordable care to children ages 2-6 in a licensed & accredited cente r. In 2009, the Childcare Program cared for 157 preschool-aged children. Project MCUM requests funds for cots & disaster preparedness for its Childcare Program. Cots: MCUM requests funds for 15 toddler cots, 90 standard cots, 2 cot carriers and 110 cot name plates (labels required for licensure compliance). MCUM states that its current cots are more than 10 years old and that volunteer and staff resources are regularly spent repairi ng cots, most of which have reached the end of their repairable lives. MCUM must replace thee cots to avoid safety concerns and to maintain licensing compliance. The new cots are vinyl-coated polyester mesh over coated steel tubes and come with an eight-year guarantee. Disaster Preparedness Kit : MCUM recently completed a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan to prepare for potential scenarios ranging from a tornado to a te rrorist attack - \"a complicated undertaking when considering the 90 children in our care on any day.\" The final step in the plan is assembling two extensive emergency kits to be used when sheltering place or to be taken along if MCUM has to relocate children. The kit include things such as water purification tablets, equipment specific to workin g with children during an emergency (including diapers, nametags, crayons and snack s) and rolling luggage that allows for easy transport. Criteria Need. HAND's Consolidated Plan cites childcare services as a high priority, explaining that \"[r]eliable, quality, affordable child care is one of the greatest barriers to women obtaining and keeping a job, or furthering their education.\" It was listed as the 5th highest priority by Bloomington Housing Authority residents. According to a Census 2008 American Community Survey, 5,235 households in Monroe County where all parents were working included children under the age of six. However, in 2008, only 2,520 slots were available in licensed childcare facilities and only 827 children received vouchers to cove r the cost of care for low-income families. One-Time Investment. This is a request for one-time funding for equipment. MCUM anticipates that the new cots will last ten years and that the kits will serve the program for years, with minimal investments in replacement supplies. Fiscal Leveraging . The MCUCM childcare program is supported with a wide range of local, State and federal funds and parent fees. However, none of these sour ces are focused on equipment purchase and funds are not available in the operating budge for these purchases. Ch ildcare Program volunteers donated 966 hours in 2009. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. Quality, affordable childcare allows pa rents to work and prepares children for kindergarten. MCUM also states that children who participate in quality childcare are more likely to demonstrate greater cognitive achievement, better social adjustment, less-frequent grade repetition, and lower rates of crime as adolescents and adults. Further, supporti ng parents in their efforts to maintain employment and continue their education results in increased short-and long-term family stability, higher earning potential, and improved access to benefits such as health insurance.

This is a prevention progra m that is partially funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and is based on previous studies demonstra ting that lifestyle intervention can reduce the risk of developing diabetes in pre-diabetics by almost 60 percent. The YMCA is working in close collaboration with Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) and Nurse Practitioner, Sue Stoltz for referrals. VIM has already identified more than 1,000 low-income individuals from their current patient base who would benefit from the program. The program includes a 16-week course, plus a year-l ong maintenance intervention program aimed at helping individuals with pre-diabetes make enduring lifestyle cha nges related to food choices and exercise. The program will be delivered to 100 community members (in groups of 10-12 participants). The CDC will provide the local YMCA (and seven others throughout the country) with funds to implement and evaluate a group-based version of the successful, yet cos tly, program. Hopkins funds will expand the program to provide access to low-income residents as defined as tho se below the federal poverty lin e. This population is disproportionately burdened by diabetes risk and may be deterred from participating if required to pay the full cost of the program. The full cost of the program is $250/participant. The Y seeks Hopkins funding at $230/participant for 50 City residents. The YMCA will ask participants to contribute $20 of their own money to the program, to foster greater buy-in and investment in participation. (As the full program will serve approximately 100 people, other pa rticipants will be assessed a partic ipation feed on a sliding scale.) Criteria Need. Currently, 1/3 of the US population is pre-diabetic (57 million people) and it is estimated that 83 percent of these individuals will become diabetic wit hout any lifestyle changes. Indiana ranks 10th in the nation for obesity. This translates into a higher diabetes risk fo r Hoosiers. According to SCAN, many in the community need health-related services but cannot afford them. SCAN also identifies othe r challenges for community health, such as the need for more health and wellness programs. The YMCA states that it partnered with the Active Living Coalition and others entities to complete a CDC assessment tool (CHANGE) designed to assess the commun ity's strengths and weaknesses. CHANGE showed that the community lacks access to ch ronic disease prevention programs and need s to adopt strategies to educate its residents on the importance of preventative care. One-Time Investment. The YMCA was chosen by the CDC & YMCA of the USA to be one of 8 sites to test the results of this lifestyle intervention program because of the local Y's successes in the ACHIEVE initiative - a collaborative effort promoting policy and environmental ch anges to address physical inactivity, proper nutrition, tobacco use and obesity/chronic diseases. Because this is a pilot project, the YMCA writes that it is still mapping out a long-term strategy for sustaining this initiative and is exploring futu re program subsidizes for low-inco me individuals from the Community Foundation of Bloomington and Monroe C ounty, specifically, the Precision Health Network Fund. Ultimately, the goal of this program is to use the results to help the CDC and the YMCA to convince insurers and policymakers to consider covering certified diabetes prevention programs as an insurance benefit. Fiscal Leveraging . The YMCA will leverage $50,000 in federal f unds and devote $23,400 of its own funds to this intervention project. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits . \"Since diabetes and hypertension are clinical precursors of more serious and more costly conditions, primary preventi on activities targeted at the 'entry level' diseases are most likely to have long-lasting positive effects on health and reduce health care spending. If addressed early enough, prevention of these first stage diseases can be relatively straightforwar d and does not need to involve expensive clinical intervention. The program's systemic impact helps comm unity residents lead healthier lifestyles thus creating a healthier community overall.\" Since the program serves as both intervention and study, as stated above, another long -term goal of the project is to use data from the project to convince insurance companies to cover diabetes prevention programs.

It serves people with disabilities of all ages in the area of employment, community living, continuing educa tion and respite. In 2009, Options served 288 people. It helped 14 customers gain employment and supported a nother 86 in their jobs. It provided 5,503 hours of respite for 58 families, had 162 people in community living and 57 customers enrolled in continuing education. Project In partnership with Christole, Options is seeking funds for a pilot project, PowerUP -- a program which offers resources for autism, families & agency staff. The project has three components: 1) training for staff; 2) skills assessment of clients and 3) evaluation of the program & dissemination of training resources. 1) Training - The program will develop and implement a systemic approach to training direct services staff in supporting youth and adult with autism in 52 settings supported by Options and Christole. People with autism are visual learner and teaching must utilize visual cues to help clients focus on the relevant information. The orientation program provided by the State does not provide detail on how to implement these teaching strategies. Options and Christole plan to use ASD experts at IU's Institute for Disability and Community to provide their agencies with more specific, supplemental training. Such training will be videotaped so that future staff and the community may benefit. 2) Assessment - Developmental assessments are key in identifyi ng abilities and deficits of clients. Options proposes to purchase and implement an evaluation tool called the Support Intensity Scale (SIS). SIS measures support requirement in 85 life areas as well as behavioral and medical areas. SIS evaluates the practical supports clients with autism need to be independent. 3) Evaluation & Dissemination of Training Resources - Six-nine months after implementation of training and SIS, Options & Christole will evaluate the program's effec tiveness. The organizations will re-administer the SIS to assess skill development. Once finalized, the training will be made available to all staff from both agencies through an Options training website. The organizations will summarize the results and disseminate it and the training video to local schools, community gro ups and civic leaders in State agencies. Criteria Need. SCAN states that individuals with disabilities find it difficult to advocate for themselves and must rely on others for support services. The Indiana Department of Education reports that the State's incidence of ASD was 1 in 113 in 2008-2009. Indiana ranks 10 th in the nation for the number of persons with autism in public schools. 18% of Options customers (58 total) have an ASD diagnosis and 82% of Christole customers have such diagnosis (39 total). One-Time Investment. This is a one-time request for pilot funds. The program will be supported in the future by the existing training infrastructure of both organizations. SIS will be integrated into the existing customer support tools. The online training will be added into the educational requireme nts of direct support professional at both agencies. The video-taped training will be used a library resource. Fiscal Leveraging . Both organizations will leverage funds a nd personnel by contributing staff, resource and money. They are contributing $6,000 toward the SIS soft ware and are contributing half the cost of the training, video production and resource materials for the library. Th ey are also devoted $1,000 worth of staff time to the initiative. These contributions account for approximately $8,750 of the total project cost. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. Through these assessment tools, \"both agencies will have a means of identifying what to teach customers and how to meas ure progress. . . .

In order to sustain this program, \"PALS and part ner agencies will research and apply for funding through several grant opportunities.\". Fiscal Leveraging PALS has secured additional funding for this initiative. Boys and Girls Club has committed $5.00/rider/lesson, totaling $50 for each 10-week session per rider. These funds cover 12.4% of the total costs of providing 150 therapeutic riding lesson. Additionally, the family of each rider will be asked to contribute $1/lesson totaling $10 for each 10-week session. Broad and Long-Lasting Benefits. \"At PALS, riders learn life skil ls that prepare and encourage them [them] to be a healthy and active part of their community.\" PALS cites skills learned as: improved communication, building positive relationship and learning to care for animals. Based on a 2009 PALS survey, 75% of riders experienced improved self-c onfidence, 62% developed respect for animals, 56% experienced an increase in positive relationship skill, 47% experiences a sense of responsibility and 41% experienced improved communication skills.

It currently serves 73 students; about 72% of which are City residents. Project Pinnacle requests funds to help establish a summer program for at-risk high school students in the community. This program aims to fill the void left by the recent closing of area summer schools. Specifically, Pinnacle asks for funds to cover IU High School required credit/program fees for cu rricula, salary for three teachers and math and reading books and material. The Summer High School program is an 8-week program targeted to low-income students missing credits in reading, writing, or math and w ho have no access over the summer to the instruction and materials to catch up to their peers. The program will serve 36 students. Of these students, 18 will attend summer school free of charge, and up to an 18 a dditional students may attend on a slid ing scale. Students will meet in small groups with qualified instructors to build core skills a nd improve their credit shortfall. Pinnacle will also offer remedial reading and math instruction to other low-inco me high school students who are at-risk for falling behind, but not yet lacking credits for graduation. Pinnacle will work closely with the Franklin Initiative , the Bloomington Housing Authority, and the Juvenile Division of the Monroe County Probation Department to id entify students who are at-risk of dropping out of high school and would benefit from a summer program. Criteria Need. SCAN states that \"low academic attainment and a lack of life skills and competencies have a demonstrable, negative impact on quality of life and future earning potential.\" Pinnacle writes that students who cannot read or write effectively will find it cha llenging to graduate, and to enter or complete post- secondary education. Many students who leave school ear ly do so because they haven't earned enough credits to graduate, or they don't have the opportunity to gain those credits during the summer months. Pinnacle points out that over 200 MCCSC students left school without graduating during the 2008-2009 academic school year. According to the NIH, dyslexia is the leading cause of reading failure and school dropouts. Pinnacle points out that it is uniquely qualified to assist students at risk for dropping out of school 1) many of the students may have learning disabilities and 2) Pinnacle teachers are trained to work with students with learning disabilities. One-Time Investment. This program is being implemented to address th e gap left by the recent elimination of most area summer schools. Pinnacle writes that the shor t timeline between the decision to close summer schools and the end of school requires a \"one-time investment\" to help fill this void. \"Pinnacle is committed to working with the school corporation and other non-profit agencies during the coming year to develop and implement a longer-term solution using alternative funding sources to meet the summer school needs of low-income high school students, should the need continue.\" Pinnacle further stat es that its \"strong collaborations with other area agencies, including the Franklin Initiative and IU High school, a nd it successful history providing these types of services and programs to at-risk students will allow it to effectively and successfully implement the program within a relatively short time line.\" Fiscal Leveraging . Pinnacle is leveraging $12,764 in other funds for this project ($11,364 from CVS Caremark and $1,400 from Pinnacle). Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. \"Research clearly indicates a strong relationship between dropping out of high school and poverty, unemployment, homelessness, etc. Therefore, increasing the number of at-risk students who graduate high school will have a direct, positive impact on our broader community by increasing the quality of life and future earning potentia l of the participating at-risk students.\" Cost -- Amount Requested - Ranked by Priority IUHS Required Credit/Program Fees (c urricula) for 36 students $ 6,278 Instructor Salary - 3@ 6.25 hours/week for 8 weeks @$20/hour $ 3,000 Math & Reading Texts & Materials $ 1,000 Other Funds Remedial Reading Software $ 6,000 (CVS Caremark) Program Supervisor 10 hrs/week for 8 weeks $ 1,400 (Pinnacle) Student Assessments$149 for 36 students $ 5,364 (CVS Caremark) TOTAL PROJECT COST $ 23,042 SSF Funding History 2006 Granted To purchase speciali zed teaching materials. $4,394.67 2008 Denied Global Beat -- Orff Music Program for Dyslexia $5,585.00 TOTAL AMOUNT RE QUESTED $ 10,278 35#28 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF INDIANA, INC.

Project Planned Parenthood requests funds to launch Recession Rx in Bloomington. Recession Rx is a new health care initiative designed to help Hoosiers affected by layoffs and plant closures. The program provides free annual exams and STD screenings plus discounted birth control. The program assists people who were laid off and cannot find work; however, any patient who indicates difficulty paying for services due to their current economic situation can qualify. Currently, Recession Rx is offered in two of Indiana's hardest-hit communities: Mishawaka and Warsaw. It plans to e xpand the program to Bloomington. Funds will pay for costs associated with the program, such as medical supplies, laboratory testing and pharmaceuticals. Funds will allow for medical services for 40 men and women. Under the Rx program, each visit costs approximately $150 and includes: an annual exam, Pap test, STD testing and reduced cost birth control for three months. Recession Rx assists people who were laid off and cannot find work; however PPIN advises that any patient who indicated difficulty paying for services due to their current economic situation can qualify. Criteria Need. Indiana and Monroe County rank very near the top of the Guttmacher Institute's list of underserved areas of contraceptive services and supplies. In Monroe County, it is estimated that 14,930 women between ages of 13 and 44 are in need of publicly-funded contraceptives. PPIN writes that, \"[j]ob losses and the loss of empl oyer-paid insurance have created an unprecedented need for publicly-funded health care for a record nu mber of Americans.\" A May 2009 report issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologi sts reported that the curre nt economic crisis is affecting preventative health ca re for women. This study found that 14% of women have postponed an annual exam because of the economy, 15% have cut b ack or stopped taking medication due to cost, 21% reported difficulty paying for hea lth care or medications and 13% w ho are currently using a hormonal method of contraception, are worried they might not be able to pay for it. According to the most recent update of SCAN (2008), 37% of res pondents do not receive annual health exams and paying for health care and prescription drugs was a ma jor problem for many residents. PPIN continues to provide health car e to low-income and uninsured patients through its Women's Health Fund (WHF). However, in 2009, the request for WHF were unprecedented - PPIN saw a doubling of request during the second half of the fiscal year, compared with the first half. One-Time Investment. PPIN see ks funds to launch this project. PPIN has already incorporated this program into our ongoing fundraising efforts (dir ect mail, grants, specia l events and individual solicitations) to ensure program continuation. Fiscal Leveraging . PPIN has secured $3,000 from the Monroe County Council and $2,000 from the Wahl Family Charitable. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits.

The Salvation Army (SA) is a faith-base d agency providing basic human needs: food, clothing, emergency financial assistance, after-school care, religious services and child car e. Religious instruction is not a condition for receiving services. SA works closely with the following community partners: Centerstone, Amethyst House, Township trustees, Lions Clubs, Lenscrafters, IU School of Optometry and Kohls. Project. SA requests funds to provide childcare training voucher s to 15 City childcare providers. These vouchers will cover a year-long training program for non-formal Childhood Development Associate (CDA) certificates. This is a national certification; \"non formal\" indicates that the certification is not part of a degree program. The weekly, evening classes are taught in Bloomington by Columbus, Indiana-based Childhood Connections. Childhood Connections is certified to issue CDA certificates by the State Office of Family and Social Service Administration. SA staff will recruit par ticipants and administer the program. SA points out that many local childcare providers do not have access to adequate training. A lack of training leads to frustration on the part of caregivers and greater turnover. On the other hand, those providers with training and certification stayed at childcare agencies longer and parents preferred their care. Criteria Need. The National Association of Education for Youth Children reports that one third of new child care hires will be gone within the year. SA writes that locally, 39% of childcare providers have difficulty finding job- related training. SCAN points to the need for quality childcare. SA writes that training up to 15 staff per year will increase the quality of care, improve care provider re tention, instill greater confidence in parents who use childcare services. SA writes that the training program will also improve the lives of trainees, by: improving trainee's abilities to secure higher-paying jobs (SCAN, p.26), reduci ng household economic challenges (SCAN, p. 11), and reducing reliance on agencies for basic needs (SCAN, p. 13). One-Time Investment. This is a request for a one-time investment in training. SA will evaluate the program after one year to discern whether funding shoul d be pursued for its continuation. Fiscal Leveraging . The Salvation Army will leverage resources in at least four ways. First, SA volunteers will provide childcare to children of trainees. Second, SA Social Service and Community Relations staff will recruit childcare workers for training and will administer the program. The SA will provide participants without transportation with monthly bus passes. Lastly, the SA Women's Auxiliary will throw a certification party at the completion of the training for trainees and their families. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. SA writes that, \"[a] program that focuses on training low-income childcare workers can help break the cycle of poverty (SCAN, p. 15 ).\" The program aims to improve the quality of childcare in the City, thereby better serving children and parents.

Its principal purpose is to serve as a front door to the larger community and the institutions which can help bring stability and a greater de gree of self-sufficiency to those in need. The Center employs a low-barrier outreach model, which is considered to be best practice on a national level. This model includes the delivery of a continuum of onsite social servi ces by area agencies, the provision of basic life supports, and the utilization of an asset-based, client centered appr oach to employment. Shalom's overriding goal is to maximize opportunities for all people to develop their assets and talents to the fullest extend possible and to take responsibility for their own lives. Project Shalom Center requests $9,300 in operational funding to complete the funding for a part-time hunger relief assistant. This position is new and will enable the orga nization to provide better hunger relief services to more people in Bloomington and Monroe County in this time of extraordinary demand for such services. The Monroe County Council awarded Shalom $5,000 toward the creation of this position in November 2009. Shalom's Board of Directors has already voted to make this a permanent position in subsequent annual budgets. Shalom is waiting to fill the position until it has full funding to do so. Shalom points out that it has experienced a significant increase in demand for its hunger relief programs. In 2009, the Center served 80,561 meals through its breakfast and lunch programs -- a 17.5% increase over 2008. This follows a 20% increase in 2008 over 2007. It projects th at it will serve 91,000 meals and provide groceries to 12,000 people in 2010. It writes that \"escalating demand fo r assistance will clearly challenge the agency's financial capacity.\" * Note : In light of the recent announcement that the Firs t United Methodist Church will no longer be providing rent-free space to Shalom, the organization is looking for a short-term housing solution. The Director advises that the loss of space at the church does not ch ange the need for this position; instead, it makes the need for this position even more acute. Criteria Need. SCAN indicates that approximately 25% of Monroe Count y residents live in poverty or at serious economic risk. Shalom primarily serves the community's most vulnerable citizens experiencing hunger & homelessness. Shalom writes that its efforts are \"at the heart of anti- poverty efforts in Bloomington, serving primarily our most vulnerable citizens who are experiencing hunger and homelessness.\" HAND's 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan points out the service coordination provided by Shalom as a key part of the local strategy of support and effort to regain self-sufficiency.\" One-Time Investment. The Shalom board voted to make this a full-time position and, as such, the organization will building funding for this post into its fundraising efforts. Shalom had expected CDBG monies to fund this position, but was not granted funds this year. Fiscal Leveraging . The Monroe County Council devoted $5,000 to this position last year. In addition, Shalom' Hunger Relief program receives approximately $125,023 in other grants, contributions and subsidizations from the Hoosier Hills Food Bank (H HFB); in-kind provision of 7,900 volunteer hours (valued at $502,445) and $221,000 in-kind provision of free food from area businesses, individuals and HHFB.

SCCAP administers the Circles Initiative and Head Start programs in Monroe County and it also operates the En ergy Assistance, Weatherization, Individual Development Account and Section 8 programs in Monroe, Morgan, Owen and Brown Counties. SCCAP serves more than 11,000 annually and works with more than a dozen othe r agencies and organizations in providing its services. Project SCCAP requests $22,000 to add 15 spaces to the parking lot at its main location, 1500 W. 15th Street. The additional spaces would increase the total available spaces from 55 to 70. SCCAP writes that while the services it provides have grown substantially since the parking lot was built in 1992, its parking lot has remained the same size. SCCAP staff has grown from 38 in 1992, to 65 today. On a busy day, SCCAP has more than 60 clients visit its office. This number is anticipated to grow. Over time, SCCAP has experienced an average growth rate in clients of ~5 percent/annum. Due to major expansions of its Head Start and Weatherizaton programs provided by the receipt of federa l stimulus funds, the organization anticipates a 10 percent in clients served over 2009. The lot is insufficient for SCCAP's growing cliente. The growing number of clients and staff place considerable pressure on the parking lot's 55 spaces. It also presents substantial safety concerns. SCCAP operates five Head Start buses out of its main location. These buses carry 3- to 5- year olds. When the lot is at capacity , clients will resort to parking in unsafe areas such as 15 th Street (a narrow street), yards, and in grassy areas on SCCAP property. The extra cars on 15th Street make it difficult for Head Start buses to make the turn off of 15th into the parking lot. A November 2009 parking study pointed out the parking problem on 15th Street. MCCSC buses also pick up and drop off students at the building; MCCSC has complained about the hazards of this situation. SCCAP consulted with the City's Planning staff to determine the need for 15 additional parking spaces. Criteria Need. HAND's 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan describes the need for programs to help low-income people in its Anti-Poverty Strategy (p. 124). The proposed parking lot expansion \"will benefit a large number of low- income households (more than 3,000 annually) who receive services at Bloomington's largest anti-poverty agency.\" Further, the Plan identifies child care services as a high priority need and Head Start is the largest child care program fro low-income families in Bloomington. SCCAP also provides public services that serve low income individuals and families with basic emergency needs, another high priority need identified in HAND's Consolidated Plan. One-Time Investment. This is a request for one-time funding. Fiscal Leveraging . SCCAP will leverage $6,815 in additional funds for this project. It has already secured $3,815 and its fundraising committee, the Friends of SCCAP, will raise another $3,000. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. SCCAP points out that it is essential that it offer services to low-income people that are safe and accessible for all. SCCAP writes that while several sources have a llowed it to substantially increase its services over the years to help meet the growing need of working poor and the unemployed, such expansion of services has not been met with a need for more parking.

Page # 379 Renovation & Technologies (One-time Investment) $ 4,820 City residents served by this project in 2010: 34 34) Agency Employees 5+] Mission Stepping Stones, Inc.'s (SSI) mission is to provide a semi-supervised transition housing and supportive services program for youth between the ages of 16-20 that are expe riencing homelessness. SSI provides three services: 1) housing for seven residents; 2) education services & vo cational planning and prepar ation and; 3) supportive services including life skills development, case management, and assistance for current and former residents. At present, SSI provides housing to seven residents (four females and three males). (SSI anticipates a semi-annual turnover in beds; thus, expect to house 14 youth in 2010). As in 2009, it anticipates to reach an additional 20 youth not housed in its program through outr each efforts. SSI plans to increase the nu mber of youth housed in its program to from 7 to 11 by the end of 2011. Project SSI requests $4,820 in one-time funding for technology and renovation (furniture and storage). Technology . As the number of youth served by the organization gr ows, SSI cites the need to improve its technology systems. Specifically, SSI asks for funds for: 1) applica tion software to make it easier for youth and families to apply for SSI programs (Wufoo [www.wufuoo.com]); 2) donor and volunteer software to better track development initiatives (Giftworks [missionresearch.com]); and 3) ma rketing and graphic design software (Adobe CS4 and Constant Contact [www.constantcontact.com] ) to sign ificantly increase its community presence via web-based activities such as social networking site and e-mail correspondence. Renovation (Furniture and Storage) . In large part, SSI has relied on community donations of used furniture to furnish its facilities. SSI writes that, after five years and over 40 youth living in its program and congregating at its community center, apartments are in need of new beds, dressers, couches and night stands. As the program is housed in an apartment complex, it has little space to store donations and youth's belongings. To remedy this problem, it requests one year of storage rental space. Criteria Need. SSI cites the Consolidated Plan for support that, \"[t]he lack of housing and necessary services provided to homeless adolescents was identified as a 'critical problem' by the Housing Network of Region 10 (115) and an essential aspect of the community's long-range pl anning. In response to the public service category 05D Youth Services being given a 'high priority'(72) and the identified 'Need for a residential mentoring program for 'runaway' or 'throwaway' teens who are struggling to survive.' \" SSI is the only organization in the County devoted solely to addressing th e needs of this population. One-Time Investment. The technology and furniture components are one-time funding requests. SSI intends to sustain funding for storage by holding a garage sale to sell those items which are not claimed by the end of the year or which are not used by the organization. Board members, staff and other donors will contribute items to the sale. This is to be an annual event. Fiscal Leveraging . As described below, SSI is leveraging $1,666 in funds for this project's technology via Tech Soup and Constant Contact component and $588 via Co mfort Solutions and IU Surplues for its furniture component. Broad & Long-Lasting Benefits. Through housing, education encourag ement and attainment, vocational planning, and other life skills training, SSI advises th at it provides the most vulnerable of the economically disadvantage population an opportunity to succeed as adults SSI states that by helping troubled youth complete high school and increasing their earning potential and by providing these young people a safe and nurturing environment and by reducing the pressure on alternative system s like foster care, juvenile and adult corrections and emergency systems yields healthier and more productive citizens and a healthier community.

The program meets twice a week and includes four primary components: Tutoring, Reading/Writing enrichment activities, SAT preparation, and Leadership skills. CLIP staff works in conjunction with parents and schools to monitor participants' grades and leadership as a means to support and meet their needs. The main goals of CLIP are: - To emphasize critical thinking and provide literacy support as a way to improve and extend disadvantaged students' literacy skills. - To facilitate improve academic success in an effort to help youth matriculate through high school and ultimately attend college. - To help youth utilize community resources to respond to low levels of literacy performance in the school context. - To build supportive collaboration among, parents, teaches, schools, university community, and larger Bloomington community to improve youth's literacy needs and abilities.\" Professor Stephanie Carter runs CLIP and uses IU fac ilities and staff, students and faculty as volunteer tutors. CLIP does not receive funding from IU for this program, nor do the Trustees require a percentage of this grant, if funded. Project CLIP is requesting bridge funding to help support staffi ng, a mobile technology literacy lab, literacy enrichment materials and activities, and workshop series for local youth, parents and teachers. It also requests educational resources for staff. CLIP notes that it was unable to secure more funding in 2009 due to the poor economy and has had to cut its staff from two people (1@ 20 hrs/wk and 1@ 10 hrs/wk) to just one person working 10 hours or less per week. As a result, it has had to cut back on the nu mber of students is served from approximately 25/week to 10/week. CLIP writes that bridge funding will help ramp b ack up its services to provide help to 20-30 City youth. Professor Carter writes that part of the success of the program is that it monitors and supports academic success. Lately, she has had to call parents, go to schools, meet with counselors and monitor grades. Having help would help the program continue this level of attention, while reaching more students. Criteria Need. Local test results point to a disparity among disadvantaged youth in Bloomington. The MCCSC 2008- 2009 ISTEP Language Arts data on 8th grade students illustrated the following passing rates: 34% Black, 65% Hispanics; 77% White and 89% Asians. students are passing the ISTEP at the following rates: Blacks 59%; Hispanics 66%; and Whites at 80%. CLIP writes that, \"After school pre-college programs such as CLIP being to bridge the literacy Gap that many of these youth face.\" One-Time Investment. CLIP's current funding is ending and they seek Hopkins funds to bridge the program into next year. CLIP writes that it is seeking federal and private funds to support the program in future years. It is specifically targeting The Kellogg Foundation, which supports projects that foster partnerships between educational institutions and communities to promot e learning and workforce preparation among vulnerable young people.

In addition, permanent clinical and administrative staff provides consistency and structure to the clinic's services and operations. In cooperation with others in the community, VIM provides the following services to the uninsured: 1) easily accessible, quality primary and preventive healthcare, 2) treatment for both acute and chronic conditions, 3) health education that empowers individuals to take responsibility for their own well being. VIM completed approximately 25,000 patient visits in 2009. Project This is a request for one-time funding to purchase an automatic tablet counter. VIM points out that the hazards of manually counting out pills with a pharmacy spatula and tray are well documented. Due to staff shortages, increase in prescription volumes, hectic p ace and complicated insurance reimbursement procedures, it is more likely that human error ensues when counting out pills. Errors in counting can be dangerous and the time it takes to count (and recount when count is lost) pills is time consuming. In response, many pharmacies are employing advanced technology for pill dispensations. VIM requests funds to purchase an automatic tablet counter, called the Kirby Lester Tablet Counter. This counter can count 15-18 tablets per second. In 2009, VIM filled 27,160 prescriptions. VIM writes that the requested tablet counter will improve safety, accuracy, ef ficiency and will help get patients in and out of the clinic faster, thereby allowing them to serve more patients.
