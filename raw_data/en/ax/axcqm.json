BREWING GUIDE: Duration: 3-5 minutes Temperature: 100C\u00b0 (full 1 tbsp per cup BREWING RECOMMENDATIONS: - If you like your tisane brewed stronger or weaker, adjust the amount of leaves than what the brewing directions call for. Brewing your tisane too long can extract an undesirable bitterness from the leaves - Tisanes can typically be steeped multiple times. However, each steeping will yield a slightly lighter flavor than the previous. - To brew in a large teapot, increase the amount of loose leaf to match the total cups of water you're using.
