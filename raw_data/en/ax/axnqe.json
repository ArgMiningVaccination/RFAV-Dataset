DePaul encourages all faculty, staff and students to get vaccinated when it is their turn. By getting vaccinated, you will put our Vincentian mission into practice by living in service of the common good. DePaul is working closely with the city to learn when we can begin helping our students, faculty and staff access the vaccine. Except for specific individuals who qualify for earlier phases, the city anticipates that vaccinations will not be available for most of the DePaul community until May 31. You can view the city's timeline on its Vaccination Distribution Phases website. Vaccine supplies are limited and depend on production and distribution at the federal level. \"DePaul relies on local and federal entities to supply the vaccine and determine processes for equitable distribution\u2014and the guidance we receive changes by the day,\" says Eugene Zdziarski, vice president for Student Affairs, who is a member of the group examining health and wellness aspects of campus operations during the pandemic. \"To prepare for a time when we can help people access the vaccine, the university will reach out to faculty, staff and students soon with more education and to gauge their interest in receiving it.\" Both vaccines approved by the FDA for emergency use require two doses. The Pfizer vaccine isn't fully effective until a week after the second dose, while the Moderna vaccine is fully effective two weeks later. The vaccine rollout is a fast-evolving situation. Right now, there is not a clear answer on whether local employers or schools can require COVID-19 vaccinations. It is expected that public health agencies, such as the Illinois Department of Public Health and Chicago Department of Public Health, will continue to issue guidance regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. DePaul will follow this guidance and all state and local mandates regarding vaccinations. More information will be shared as the university's plans develop. In the meantime, you can learn more about the vaccine and the city's vaccination plans at www.chicago.gov/covidvax. DePaul's students, faculty and staff should continue staying home when they are sick, washing hands, maintaining a safe physical distance from others and wearing masks. "}
