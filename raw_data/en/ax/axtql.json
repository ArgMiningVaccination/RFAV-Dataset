No more global warming,pollution,disease,traffic,wars,etc.. Just a pristine planet and owning it all. Forget things like Basic income and all that nonsense. What would it be for them? This is why they are hoarding as much wealth as they can and working hard towards automation and AI. They see the long game down the line. For now slave wages and keeping people ignorant works but eventually the time comes when the big switch can be flipped and total control becomes the final outcome. It makes sense when you think about it, once the planet is depopulated any threat of losing power is gone in addition to living in paradise (no more destruction of the planet due to continually growing populations decimating natural resources) The question is how would they accomplish a rapid depopulation to insure they do not lose control of the situation, and how long in the future before this is a possibility? Maybe 1000 years? There is no way in hell the 1% are going to want to carry the 99% of the population for no reason at all once human labor is replaced and the majority of the population is considered surplus to them.
