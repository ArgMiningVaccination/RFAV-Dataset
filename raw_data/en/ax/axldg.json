Please co ntinue to check our web si te for 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 5 CHAPTER 1: RESIDENT ASSESSMENT INSTRUMEN T (RAI) 1.1 Overview The purpose of this m anual is to offer cl ear gui dance about how to use the Resident A ssessm ent Instru ment (RAI) corre ctly and e ffectively to help provide appropri ate care. Providing care to residents w ith post -hospital and long -term care n eeds is co mplex and cha llenging wor k. Clinic al competence, observa tional, interviewing and c ritical thinking skills, and a ssessm ent exper tise from all dis ciplines ar e required to develop indi vidua lized ca re plans. T he RAI helps nursing home staf f in gather ing definitive in formation on a re sident's s trengths and ne eds, which m ust be addressed in an indi vidualized car e plan. It also assists staff with ev aluating goal ac hievement and revi sing care plans a ccordin gly by enabling the nursing hom e to track changes in t he resident's status. As the process of problem identification is integr ated w ith sound c linical interventions, the c are plan beco mes each r esident's unique path toward achieving or m aintaining his or he r highest pr actical level of well-being. The RAI helps nursing hom e staf f look at re sidents hol istically\u2014as indi viduals f or wh om quality of life and qual ity of care are m utually signi ficant and nec essary. In terdisciplinary u se of the RAI promotes th is emphasis on qual ity of care and q uality of life. Nursing hom es have f ound that involving di sciplines s uch as di etary, social work, physic al therapy, occup ational therapy, speech language p athology, pha rmacy, and activities in the RAI process has f ostered a m ore holis tic approach to resident c are and stren gthened team communication. This i nterdis ciplinary process also h elps to support t he spheres of influence on t he resi dent's exper ience of care, in hom e's cu ltural and physic al environm ent, sta ff satisfaction, and care prac tice deliv ery, shared l eaders hip, regula tions.1 Persons ge neral ly en ter a nursing hom e because of proble ms with f uncti onal s tatus caused by physic al deterioration, c ognitive dec line, the ons et or ex acerbation of an acute illness or condi tion, or other r elated factors. S ometimes, the individual 's ability to m anage inde pendently has been l imited to the e xtent that s killed nur sing, medical t reatment, and/or reha bilitation is needed f or the resi dent to maintain a nd/or r estore function or to live saf ely from day to day. While we r ecognize that there are o ften unavoida ble de clines, particularly in the last stages of life, all nece ssary r esources and di sciplines m ust be used to e nsure tha t residents achieve the highest level of functioning possible (quality of care) and m aintain their sense of indivi duality (quality of life). This is true for both long -term residents and r esidents in a rehab ilitative program anticipating return to their pre vious e nvironm ent or anothe r environm ent of their ch oice. 1.2 Content of the RAI for Nursing Homes The RAI consists of three basic co mponents: T he Mini mum Data Set ( MDS) Version 3.0, the Care Area Assess ment (CAA) process and the R AI Utili zation Guidelines . The uti lization of the 1 Healthcentric Advisors: The Holistic Approach to Transfor mational QIOSC CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 6 three co mponents of the RAI yields information about a r esident's f unctional s tatus, st rengths, weaknesses, and pre ferences, as wel l as offering guidance on f urther as sessment once proble ms have Ea ch compone nt flows natur ally into t he next as f ollows: Minimum Data Set (MDS). A core s et of screen ing, c linical, and f unctiona l status elem ents, including c omm on de finitions and c oding ca tegories, which f orms the foundation of a co mprehensive assess ment for all residents of nursing hom es certified to participate in Medic are or Medica id. T he ite ms in t he MDS st andardi ze comm unicati on about re sident proble ms and condi tions within nur sing homes, between nur sing homes, and between nursing ho mes and out side agenci es. The requ ired subsets of data i tems for each M DS assess ment and tr acking docum ent (e.g., Comprehensive , Quarterly, OBRA Discharge, Entry T racking, P PS item sets ) can be found in Appendix H. Care Area Assessment (CAA) Process. This pr ocess is des igned to as sist the a ssessor to syste matica lly interpret the in formation recor ded on the MDS. Once a car e area has been triggered, n ursing hom e provide rs use cur rent, e videnc e-based clinical resources to conduct an a ssessm ent of the pote ntial probl em and deter mine whether or n ot to c are plan for it. The CAA process helps t he clinician to focus on key i ssues ide ntified during the assessm ent process so t hat de cisions as to whe ther and how to int ervene can be exp lored with the resident. The CAA process is expl ained in det ail in Chapter 4. S pecific components of the CAA process include: \u2014 Care Area Triggers ( CATs) are s pecific resident respons es for one or a combination of MDS elem ents. The trigge rs identify reside nts who have or are at risk for developing specific functional probl ems and req uire f urther as sessm ent. \u2014 Care Area Assessment is the f urther inve stigation of trigge red area s, to deter mine if the ca re area trig gers r equire interventions and car e planning. The CAA r esources a re provided as a cour tesy to facilities in Appendix C. These resources i nclude a compilation of checkli sts and Web links that m ay be help ful in per forming the assessm ent of a trigg ered care a rea. The use of these reso urces is not m andatory and the list of Web links is ne ither all-inclusi ve nor gover nment endorse d. \u2014 CAA Summary (Se ction V of the MDS 3.0) provides a location f or doc umentation of the care a rea(s) that have t riggered from the MDS and the deci sions made during the CAA process re garding whether or not to pr oceed to c are planning.

These in clude i nstru ctions fo r completion of the RAI as well as structured fra meworks for synthe sizing MDS and http://cms.hhs.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_r.pdf ). 1.3 Completion of the RAI Over ti me, the various uses of the M DS ha ve expanded. W hile its pri mary purpose a s an assessm ent tool is t o iden tify resident care proble ms that are ad dressed in an indi vidua lized care plan, da ta co llected from MDS a ssessm ents i s also used f or the Skilled Nursing Facility Prosp ective Payment System (SNF PPS) Medica re rei mburse ment sys tem, many State Medica id reimburse ment syste ms, and m onitori ng the qua lity of care prov ided to nur sing home residents. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1-7 The MDS instr ument has also been adap ted for use by non- critical ac cess hospita ls with a swing bed agreement. They are required to co mplete the MDS f or rei mbursem ent under S NF PPS. Medicare and Medica id Payment Systems. The MDS contains i tems that re flect the acuity level of the resi dent, including diagnoses, t reatments, and an evalu ation of the resident's fu nctiona l status. The MDS is used as a data collection to ol to c lassify Medica re residents into PDPM components . The PDPM classification system is used in SNF PPS for skilled nursing fa cilities and non- critical access hospital swing bed programs . States may use PDPM, a Resource Utilization Group-based system , or an alternate system to group residents into sim ilar re source usage categ ories for the purposes of Medicaid reimburse ment. More detai led in formation on the SNF PPS is provided in Chapters 2 and 6. Ple ase ref er to the Medica re Intern et-Only Manuals, including the Medica re Benefit Poli cy Manual, located at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/index.html for co mprehensive information on SNF not lim ited to , SNF coverage, SNF polic ies, and claim s proces sing. Monito ring the Qua lity of Care. M DS assessment dat a are also used to monitor the quali ty of care in the na tion's nursing hom es. MDS -based qua lity m easur es (QMs) we re developed b y rese archers to as sist: (1) Sta te Survey and Certification staff in identifyi ng potent ial care problems in a nursing hom e; (2) nursing home providers with qua lity improvement act ivities/efforts; (3) n ursing hom e consumers in understanding the qua lity of care prov ided by a nursing home; and (4) CMS with long-te rm quality monitoring and program planning. CMS continuousl y evalu ates the usefulness of the QMs, which ma y be modified in the future to enhance t heir effectiveness. Consumer Access to N ursing Ho me Inform ation . Consum ers ar e also able to acces s information about every Medicare- and /or Medicaid -certified nursing home in the country. The Nursing Home Compare tool ( www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare ) provides public a ccess to nursing hom e charact eristics, s taffing and quali ty of care measures for ce rtified nursing hom es. The RAI process has m ultiple reg ulatory requirem ents. Federal r egulations 483.20 (b)(1)(xv iii), (g), and (h) requir e that the ass essment accura tely reflects the resi dent's status (2) a regi stered nurse conducts or co ordinates e ach a ssessm ent with the appr opria te participation of health p rofessionals (3) the ass essment proc ess includes dir ect obser vation, as well a s communication with the resident and direct care staff on all shif ts. Nursing hom es are lef t to determine (1) who should part icipate in the ass essment process (2) how the asse ssment process is co mpleted CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1-8 (3) how the asse ssment in formation is docum ented w hile remaining in com pliance with the requirements of the Federal regu lations and the i nstru ctions contained w ithin this manual. Given the requirements of parti cipation of appropria te hea lth profession als and di rect care s taff, completion of the RAI is best a ccomplished by a n interdisciplin ary team (IDT) that includes nursing hom e staff with varied clinical back grounds, including nursing s taff and the resident's physic ian. Such a team brings t heir combined experience and knowledge to the table in providing an understanding of the st rengths, needs and prefer ences of a resident to en sure the best poss ible quali ty of care and q uality of life. It is important to note that even nursing h omes that have b een granted an RN waiver under 42 CFR 483.35(e) must provide an RN to conduct or coordina te the assessm ent and sign off the asses sment as c omplete. In addition, an accu rate assessm ent requires collecting information f rom multiple sources, so me of which are m andated b y regul ations. Those sources must include t he resident and dir ect ca re staff on all shifts, and should also in clude the re sident's m edical record, physic ian, and fam ily, guardian, or signi ficant other as appropria te or acceptable. It is important to note her e that information obtained sh ould cover the same observation pe riod as speci fied by the M DS ite ms on the asses sment, and should be val idated f or accuracy (what the resi dent's a ctual status was during that observation period) by the IDT c ompleting the ass essment. As such, nursing hom es are responsi ble for ensur ing th at all participa nts in the ass essm ent process have the requisit e knowledge t o complete an accur ate assessm ent. Whi le CMS does not im pose speci fic docu mentation proced ures on nur sing hom es in co mpleting the RAI, docum entation that co ntributes to identification and co mmunication of a resi dent's problems, needs, and s trengths, that monitors the ir con dition on an on- going basis, and that records treatment and response to t reatment, is a m atter of good clinical pract ice and an expect ation of trained and lice nsed health care prof essionals. Good clinic al practice is an expect ation of CMS. As such, it is i mportant to n ote that comple tion of the MDS does not remove a nursing hom e's respon sibility to d ocument a m ore detai led as sessment of par ticular issues relevant f or a re sident. In addi tion, documentation must substantia te a resi dent's need f or Part A SNF -level services and the response to those ser vices f or the Medic are SNF PPS. 1.4 Problem Identification Using the RAI Clinic ians are gener ally taught a problem identification proces s as pa rt of their pro fessional education. For example, the nursing pro fession's problem identif ication model is c alled the nursing process, which consists of as sessment, diagnosis, out come identi fication, planning, implementation, and ev aluation. All good problem identif ication models have sim ilar steps to those of the nursing proc ess. The RAI si mply provides a s tructured, standa rdized approach for applying a proble m identification process in nursing homes. The RAI should not be, nor was it ever meant to be, an additional burden for nursing hom e staff. The co mpl etion of the RAI can be conceptu alized using the nursing proce ss as follows: CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1-9 a. Assessmen t\u2014Taking s tock of all o bservations, information, and knowledge about a resident from all available sourc es (e.g., m edical records, the resident, res ident's family, and/or guardian or other legal ly aut horized representative). b. Decision Mak ing\u2014De termining w ith the resident (resident' s family and/or guardian or other legal ly aut horized representative), the resi dent's physic ian and the inter disci plinary team, the sever ity, functiona l impact, and scope of a resid ent's c linical issues and needs. Deci sion making should be guide d by a rev iew of the assess ment in formation, in-depth understanding of the resi dent's d iagno ses and co -morbidi ties, and the ca reful consider ation of the tr iggered areas in the CAA process. Understanding the causes and r elationships between a resident's clinical issues and needs and discove ring t he \"whats\" and \"whys\" of the r esident's cli nical issues and needs; finding out who the resident is and consider ation f or incorpora ting his or her needs, interests, and lif estyle choices into the deliv ery of care, is key to this step of the process. c. Identi fication of Outc omes \u2014Deter mining the expected o utcom es forms the bas is for evalu ating r esident- specific goals and inte rventions that are designed to help residents achieve th ose goals. This a lso as sists the int erdisciplinary team in determining who needs to be involved to support the expec ted resident out comes. Out comes iden tification rein forces individual ized care tenet s by pro moting the reside nt's act ive par ticipation in the proc ess. d. C are Planning \u2014Estab lishing a cour se of action with input from the resi dent ( resident's family and/ or guard ian or other leg ally author ized repre sentative), resident 's physi cian and interdisciplinary move s a resident t oward resi dent-specific goals mentation \u2014Put ting that co urse of interven tions derived through interdisciplinary in dividuali zed care planning ) into motion by staff knowledgeable about the resident' s care g oals and approa ches; ca rrying out the \"how\" and care. f. Evaluation \u2014Crit ically reviewing individua lized care plan goals, inter ventions and implementation in t erms of achieved resident out comes as identi fied and a ssessing the need to modif y the ca re plan (i.e., change in terventions) to adjust to chan ges in t he resident's status, goa ls, or improvem ent or decline. The f ollowing illu problem identif ication process flowi ng from MDS (and other assessments), to the CAA decision -making process, car e plan developm ent, ca re plan implementation, and f inally to evalu ation. This m anual wi ll refer to th is process t hroughout sever al chapter discus sions. If you look at the RAI process a s a solution ori ented and dy namic process, it b ecomes a r ichly pract ical means of help ing nursing hom e staff gather and analyze in form ation in order to improve a residen t's qu ality of care and quali ty of life. The RAI o ffers a clear path t oward using CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 10 all mem bers of the int erdisci plinary team in a proactive pro cess. There is absolut ely no reason to inser t the R AI process as an added task or view it as another \"lay er\" of labor. The key to s uccess fully using the R AI process is to underst and that its structure is designe d to enhance r esident ca re, increas e a resident's active par ticipation in car e, and promote the quali ty of a resident 's life. Th is occurs not only becau se it follows an inte rdisciplinary proble m-solving model, but a lso becau se ff (across all s hifts), residents and fam ilies (an d/or guar dian or other legal ly aut horized representative) and physici ans (or othe r authorized hea lthcare profe ssional s as allowab le under sta te law) are a ll involved in its \"hands on\" approach. T he resu lt is a process that flows smoothly and allows for good communication and t racking of resi dent ca re. In short, i t works. Since the R AI has been implemented, nursing hom e staff who have applied the RAI process in the m anner we have di scussed have discover ed that it works in the f ollowing ways: Residents Respond to Individuali zed Care. While we wi ll discuss oth er posi tive responses to the RAI be low, there is none m ore persuasive or powerf ul than good resident outcomes both in terms of a resident's qual ity of care and enhanced qual ity of life. Nursing home provi ders have found that when resi dents actively p articipate in their care, and care refle ct appro priate resi dent-speci fic ap proaches to care based on careful consideration of individu al problem s and causes, l inked with input f rom residents, residents' fa milies (and /or guard ian or other leg ally authorize d repre sentative), and t he interdisciplinary t eam, residents have exper ience d goal achievem ent and eith er their level of functioning has improved or has deteriora ted at a s lower r ate. Nursing hom e staff report that, as individua lized at tention incre ases, resident s also i ncreases. taff Co mmunication Has Beco me More When f members ar e inv olved in a resident's ongoing a ssessment and have input into the deter mination and development of a resi dent's c are plan, the commit ment to and the understanding of that care plan is enhanced. A ll levels of staff, including nursing a ssistants, ha ve a stake in the process. Knowledge gained from caref ul examination of poss ible c auses and solutions of resident problems (i.e., from performing the CAAs) chal lenges staff to hone the professional skills of their discipline as well as fo cus on the individua lity of the resi dent and holis how that individua lity is acco mmodated in the car e plan. Resident and Family I nvolvement i n Care Has Increased. There has b een a dram atic increase in the frequen cy and nature of resident and fam ily involvement in the c are planning process. Inp ut has been pro vided on individual resi dent goals, needs, int erest s, stren gths, problems, preference s, and lif estyle choices. When consider ing all of this information, staf f members have a much bett er picture of the resident, and residents a nd families ha ve a bet ter understan ding of the goals and process es of care. Increased Clarity of D ocumenta tion. When the approaches to achievi ng a speci fic goal are und erstood and dis tinct, the need for voluminous documentation diminishes. Likewise, when staf f mem bers are comm unicati ng effectively emselves respec t to resident care, repetit ive d ocumentation is not ne cessary and co ntradictory notes do not occur. In addition, new staff, consultants, or others who review r ecords have found CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 11 that the in creased c larity of the in formation documented about a resident m akes tracking care and o utcomes easier to ac complish. The purpose of this manual is to offer cl ear gui dance, through instr uction and example, for the effective use of the RAI, and ther eby help nursing hom e staf f achieve the benef its listed above. In keeping with objecti ves set f orth in the Ins titute of Medi cine (IO M) study co mpleted in 1986 (Comm ittee on Nursing Home Regulation, IOM) that m ade r ecommendations to improve the quali ty of care in nu rsing homes, the RAI provide s each r esident with a standardized, comprehensive and reproducible ass essment. This tool ass esses a res ident's ability to per form daily life functions, identi fies significant i mpairments in a resident's functiona l capacity, and provides opportuni ties for dir ect resident inter view. In essen ce, with an ac curat e RAI c ompleted perio ly, tent recor ded \"look\" a t the resi dent and can attend to th at resident's needs with r ealistic goa ls in hand. Furthermore, with the co nsiste nt ap plication of item def initio ns, the RAI e nsures s tandardi zed communication both within the nurs ing home and between f acilities (e.g., other long-t erm care facilities or hospita ls). B asica lly, w hen everyone is spea king t he sam e language, the opportuni ty for misunderstanding or error is diminished consi derably. 1.5 MDS 3.0 In respons e to changes in nursing hom e care, res ident ch aracteristics, advances in resident assessm ent methods, and provider and consumer conce rns about the perform ance of the MDS 2.0, the Cent ers for Med icare & Med icaid Ser vices (CMS) co ntracted with the RAND Corporation and Harvard Universi ty to draf t revisions and na tionally test the MDS Version 3.0. Following is a synopsis of the goals and key findings as r eported in the Development & Validation of a Revi sed Nursing Home Assessment Tool: MDS 3.0 final report (Sa liba and Buchanan, 2008). Goals The goals of the MDS 3.0 revision ar e to i ntroduc e advances in assessm ent m easures, i ncreas e the clinic al relevan ce of items, improve the ac curacy and va lidity of the tool, inc rease user satisfaction, and incr ease the resident 's voice by introducing m ore resi dent interview ite ms. Providers, consumers, and other te chnical experts in nursing hom e care r equested that MDS 3.0 revisions focus on improving the tool's c linical utility, c larity, and accu racy. CMS a lso wanted to increase the usabil ity of the inst rument while m aintai ning the abi lity to us e MDS data for quality measure reporting and Medica re SNF PPS rei mbursem ent (via Patient Driven Payment Model [PDPM] classification). In addition to improving the cont ent and struc ture of the MDS, the RAN D/Harvard t eam also aimed to improve user satisfaction. User at titudes are key deter minants of quality improvem ent implementation. Negativ e user att itudes toward t he MDS are of ten cited as a reason that nurs ing homes have not f ully i mplem ented the in form ation from the MDS into ta rgeted care planning. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 12 Methods To address m any of the issues and challen ges previously id entified and to provide an em pirical foundation f or examining revisions to the MDS before they were i mplem ented, the RAND/Harvard t eam engaged in a c areful iterative process that incorpo rated provid er and consumer input, exper t consultation, scien tific ad vances in clinical knowl edge about screening and assess ment, CMS experience, and intens ive item developm ent and testing by a nat Veterans Ad n ational testing of MDS 3.0 to include well-developed and tes ted items. The national valid ation and evalua tion of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing h omes (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA nursing homes (764 residents regio nally distribut ed throughout the United S tates. The evaluation was designed to test and anal yze in ter-rater ag reement (reliability) between go ld-stand ard (resea rch) n urses and bet ween nursin g home and gold- standard nurses, val idity of key secti ons, response rates for in terview i tems, anonymous f eedback on changes f rom partici pating n urses, and tim e to co mplete the MDS ass essment. In addition, the nationa l test design a llowed co mparison of item dist ribut ions between MDS 3.0 and MDS 2.0 and thus facilitated mapping into paym ent cells ( Saliba and Buchanan, 2008). Key Findings for MDS 3.0 Improved R esident Inp ut Improved A ccuracy and Reliab ility In cr eased E fficiency Improved Staff Satis faction and Perception of Cl inical U tility Improvements inc orpor ated in a ass essment in strument: b etter quali ty information was obtained in l ess ti me. Such gains should improve identif ication of resident needs and enha nce res ident-focused car e planning. I n addi tion, inclusion of i tems recogn ized in other c are settings is likely to en hance co mmunication among provide rs. These signi refl ect the cu mulative of changes a cross the tool, inclu ding: use of m ore valid items, direct inclusion of resid ent reports, and improved clar ity of retai ned item s. 1.6 Components of the MDS The MDS is co mpleted for al l residents in Medic are- or Me dicaid-certified nursing hom es and resident s in a PPS stay in non- critical access hos pitals w ith Me dicar e swing bed agreements. The mandated a ssessment schedule is discussed in Chapter 2. S tates may also establish additional MDS requirem ents.

PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT - HEALTH CARE RECORDS Long Term Care-Minimum Data Set (MDS) System of Records revised 04/28/2007 (Issued: 9 -6-12, Implementation/Effective Date: 6-17-13) THIS FORM PROVIDES YOU THE ADVICE REQUIRED BY THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 USC 552a). THIS FORM IS NOT A CONSENT FORM TO RELEASE OR USE HEALTH CARE INFORMATION PERTAINING TO YOU. 1. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND WHETHER DISCLOSURE IS MANDATORY OR VOLUNTARY. Authority for maintenance of the system is given under Sections 1102(a), 1819(b)(3)(A), 1819(f), 1919(b)(3)(A), 1919(f) and 1864 of the Social Security Act. The system contains information on all residents of long- term care (LTC) facilities that are Medicare and/or Medicaid certified, including private pay individuals and not limited to Medicare enrollment and entitlement, and Medicare Secondary Payer data containing other party liability insurance information necessary for appropriate Medicare claim payment. Medicare and Medicaid participating LTC facilities are required to conduct comprehensive, accurate, standardized and reproducible assessments of each resident's functional capacity and health status. To implement this requirement, the facility must obtain information f rom every resident. This information is also used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that the facility meets quality standards and provides appropriate care to all residents. 42 CFR \u00a7483.20, requires LTC facilities to establish a database, the Minimum Data Set (MDS), of re sident assessment information. The MDS data are required to be electronically transmitted to the CMS National Repository. Because the law requires disclosure of this information to Federal and State sources as discussed above, a resident does not have the right to refuse consent to these disclosures. These data are protected under the requirements of the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 and the MDS LTC System of Records. 2. PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THE SYSTEM FOR WHICH INFORMATION IS INTENDED TO BE USED. The primary purpose of the system is to aid in the administration of the survey and certification, and payment of Medicare/Medicaid LTC services which include skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), nursing facilities (NFs) a nd non- critical access hospitals with a swing bed agreement. Information in this system is also used to study and improve the effectiveness and quality of care given in these facilities. This system will only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary to achieve the purposes of the MDS, reimbursement, policy and research functions. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 1: Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) October 2019 Page 1- 17 3. ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM.

These sections of the SSA require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to specify a Minimum Data Set (MDS) of core elements for use in conducting assessments of nursing home residents. It furthermore requires the Secretary to designate one or more resident assessment instruments based on the MDS. The OBRA regulations require nursing homes that are Medicare certified, Medicaid certified or both, to conduct init ial and periodic assessments for all their residents. The Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) process is the basis for the accurate assessment of each resident. The MDS 3.0 is part of that assessment process and is required by CMS. The OBRA -required asses sments will be described in detail in Section 2.6. MDS assessments are also required for Medicare payment ( Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) PPS) purposes under Medicare Part A (described in detail in Section 2.9) or for the SNF Quali ty Reporting Program (QRP) required under the Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 ( IMPACT Act ). It is important to note that when the OBRA and PPS assessment time frames coincide, one assessment may be used to satisfy both require ments. In such cases, the most stringent requirement for MDS completion must be met. Therefore, it is imperative that nursing home staff fully understand the requirements for both types of assessments in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and to remain in compliance with both OBRA and PPS requirements. (Refer to Sections 2.10 and 2.11 for combining OBRA and PPS assessments). 2.2 CMS Designation of the RAI for Nursing Homes Federal regulatory requirements at 42 CFR 483.20(b)(1) and 483.20(c) r equire facilities to use an RAI that has been specified by CMS. The Federal requirement also mandates facilities to encode and electronically transmit MDS 3.0 data. (Detailed submission requirements are located in Chapter 5.) While states must use all Fed erally required MDS 3.0 items, they have some flexibility in adding optional Section S items. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 2 CMS' specified RAI covers the core items included on the instrument, the wording and sequencing of those items, and all definitions and instructions for the RAI . CMS' specified RAI does not include characteristics related to formatting (e.g., print type, color coding, or changes such as printing triggers on the assessment form) . All comprehensive RAIs specified by CMS must include at least the CMS MDS Version 3.0 (with or without optional Section S) and use of the Care Area Assessment (CAA) process (including C are Area T rigger s (CAT s) and the CAA Summary (Section V) . If allowed by the State, facilities may have some f lexibility in form design (e.g., print type, color, shading, integrating triggers) or use a computer -generated printout of the RAI as long as the State can ensure that the facility's RAI in the resident's record accurately and completely represents the CMS -specified RAI in accordance with 42 CFR 483.20(b). This applies to either pre -printed forms or computer -generated printouts . Facility assessment systems must always be based on the MDS (i.e., both item terminology and definitions). However, facilities may insert additional items within automated assessment programs, but must be able to \"extract\" and print the MDS in a manner tha t replicates CMS' specified RAI (i.e., using the exact wording and sequencing of items as is found on the RAI specified by CMS ). Additional information about CMS specification of the RAI and variations in format can be found in Sections 4145.1-4145.7 of t he CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) which can be found here: https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107c04.pdf . For m ore information about your State's assessment requirements, contact your State RAI coordinator (see Appendix B) . 2.3 Responsibilities of Nursing Homes for Completing Assessments The requirements for the RAI are found at 42 CFR 483.20 and are applicable to all residents in Medicare and/or Medicaid certified long -term care facilities. The requirements are applicable regardless of age, diagnosis, length of stay, payment source or payer source. Federal RAI requirements are not applicable to individuals residing in non- certified units of long -term care facilities or licensed -only facilities. This does not preclude a State from mandating the RAI for residents who live in these units. Please contact your State RAI Coordinator for State requirements. An RAI (MDS, C AA process, and Utilization Guidelines) must be completed for any resident residing in the facility, including: All residents of Medicare (Title 18) skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or Medicaid (Title 19) nursing facilities (NFs). This includes certified SNFs or NFs in hospitals, regardless of payment source. Hospice r esidents: When a SNF or NF is the hospice resident 's residen ce for purposes of the hospice benefit, the facility must comply with the Medicare or Medicaid participation requirements, meaning the resident must be assessed using the RAI, have a care plan and CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 3 be provided with the services required under the plan of ca re. This can be achieved through cooperation of both the hospice and long -term care facility staff (including participation in completing the RAI and care planning) with the consent of the resident. Short -term or respite residents: An RAI must be complete d for any individual residing more than 14 days on a unit of a facility that is certified as a long -term care facility for participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. If the respite resident is in a certified bed, the OBRA assessment schedule and t racking document requirements must be followed. If the respite resident is in the facility for fewer than 14 days, an OBRA Admission assessment is not required; however, a n OBRA Discharge assessment is required: \u2014 Given the nature of a short -term or respite resident, staff members may not have access to all information required to complete some MDS items prior to the resident's discharge. In that case, the \"not assessed/no information\" coding convention should be used (\" -\") (See Chapter 3 for more informatio n). \u2014 Regardless of the resident's length of stay, the facility must still have a process in place to identify the resident's needs and must initiate a plan of care to meet those needs upon admission. \u2014 If the resident is eligible for Medicare Part A benefits, a Medicare assessment will still be required to support payment under the SNF PPS. Special population residents (e.g. , pediatric or residents with a psychiatric diagnosis): Certified facilities are required to complete an RAI for all residents who reside in the facility, regardless of age or diagnosis. Swing bed facility residents: Swing beds of non- critical access hospitals that provide Part A skilled nursing facility -level services were phased into the SNF PPS on July 1, 2002 (referred to as swing be ds in this manual). Swing bed providers must assess the clinical condition of beneficiaries by completing the MDS assessment for each Medicare resident receiving Part A SNF level of care in order to be reimbursed under the SNF PPS. CMS collects MDS data fo r quality monitoring purposes of swing bed facilities effective October 1, 2010. Therefore, swing bed providers must complete these assessments: Swing Bed PPS assessment (SP) and Swing Bed Discharge (SD) in addition to the Entry Tracking and Death in Facil ity record. Swing bed providers may also choose to complete an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) at any time during the resident's stay in the facility. Swing bed providers must adhere to the same assessment requirements including, but not limited to, compl etion date, encoding requirements, submission time frame, and RN signature. Swing bed facilities must use the instructions in this manual when completing MDS assessments . Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program: The IMPACT Act of 2014 establishe d the SNF QRP. Amending Section 1888(e) of the Social Security Act, the IMPACT Act mandates that SNFs are to collect and report on standardized resident assessment data. Failure to report such data results in a 2 percent reduction in the SNF's market baske t percentage for the applicable fiscal year. Data collected for the SNF QRP is submi tted through the Quality Improvement Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system as it currently is for other MDS assessments. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 4 Additional information regarding the IMPACT Act and associated quality measures may be found on CMS's website at: RAI process must be used with residents in facilities with different certification situations, including: Newly Certified Nursing Homes: \u2014 Nursing homes must admit residents and operate in compliance with certification requirements before a certification survey can be conducted. \u2014 Nursing homes must meet specific requirements, 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 483 (Requirements for States and Long Term Care Facilities, Subpart B), in order to participate in the Medicar e and/or Medicaid programs. \u2014 The completion and submission of OBRA and/or PPS assessments are a requirement for Medicare and/or Medicaid long -term care facilities. However, even though OBRA does not apply until the provider is certified, facilities are required to conduct and complete resident assessments prior to certification as if the beds were already certified .* \u2014 Prior to certification, although the facility is conducting and completing assessments, these assessments are not technically OBRA required, but are required to demonstrate compliance with certification requirements. Since the data on these pre -certificati on assessments was collected and completed with an ARD/target date prior to the certification date of the facility, CMS does not have the authority to receive this into the QIES ASAP system . Therefore, these assessments cannot be submitted to the QIES ASAP system. \u2014 Assuming a survey is completed where the nursing home has been determined to be in substantial compliance, the facility will be certified effective the last day of the survey and can begin to submit OBRA and PPS required assessments to the QIES ASAP system . o For OBRA assessments, the assessment schedule is determined from the resident's actual date of admission. Please note, if a facility completes an Admission assessment prior to the certification date, there is no need to do another Admission ass essment. The facility will simply continue with the next expected assessment according to the OBRA schedule, using the actual admission date as Day 1. Since the first assessment submitted will not be an Entry or OBRA Admission assessment, but a Q uarterly, OBRA D ischarge, etc., the facility may receive a sequencing warning message, but should still submit the required assessment. o For PPS assessments, please note that Medicare cannot be billed for any care provided prior to the certification date. Therefore, the facility must use the certification date as Day 1 of the covered Part A stay when establishing the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) for the Medicare Part A SNF PPS assessments. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2-5 \u2014 *NOTE: Even in situations where the facility's certification da te is delayed due to the need for a resurvey, the facility must continue conducting and completing resident assessments according to the original schedule. Adding Certified Beds: \u2014 If the nursing home is already certified and is just adding additional certified beds, the procedure for changing the number of certified beds is different from that of the initial certification. \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid residents should not be placed in a bed until the facility has been notified that the bed has been certified. Change i n Ownership: There are two types of change in ownership transactions: \u2014 The more common situation requires the new owner to assume the assets and liabilities of the prior owner and retain the current CCN number. In this case: The assessment schedule for existing residents continues, and the facility continues to use the existing provider number. Staff with QIES user ID s continue to use the same QIES user IDs. Example: if the Admission assessment was done 10 days prior to the change in ownership, the next OBRA assessment would be due no later than 92 days after the ARD (A2300) of the Admission assessment and would be submitted using the existing provider number. If the resident is in a Part A stay, and the 5- Day PPS assessment was combined with the OBRA Admission assessment, the next PPS assessment could be an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) , if the provider chooses to complete one, and would also be submitted under the existing provider number. \u2014 There are also situations where the new owner does not assume the assets and liabilities of the previous owner. In these cases: The beds are no longer certified. There are no links to the prior provider, including sanctions, deficiencies, resident assessments, Quality Measures, debts, provider number, etc. The previous owner would com plete an OBRA Dischar ge assessm ent - return n ot anticipat ed, thus code A0310F = 10, A2000 = date of ownership change, and A2100 = 02 for those res idents who will re main in the f acility. The new o wner would complete an Adm ission assessment and Entry tracking record f or all residents, thus code A0310F = 01, A1600 = date of ownership change, A1700 = 1 (a dmission), and A1800 = 02. Staff who worked for the previous owner cannot use their previous QIES user IDs to submit assessm ents for the new owner as this is now a new facility. They must register for new user IDs for the new facility. Com pliance with OBRA regul ations, inclu ding t he MDS requirements, is expected at the time of survey f or certification of the facility with a new owner. See in formation above r egarding ne wly cer tified nursing hom es. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 6 Resident Transfers: \u2014 When trans ferring a resident, the transferring f acility must provide the ne w facility with neces sary r ecords, i ncluding ents, to support the con tinuity of resident care. \u2014 When a dmitting a resident from another nur sing home, rega rdless of whether or n ot it is a t ransfer within the s ame chain, a new A dmission asse ssment m ust be done within 14 days. The MDS schedule then st arts with the new A dmission asse ssment and, if appli cable, a 5- Day assess ment. \u2014 The ad mitting f acility should look a t the previo us facility's assessm ent in the sa me way they would r eview oth er incoming docum entation about the resident f or the purpose of understandi ng the res ident's h istory and prom oting continui ty of care.

However, the de cision on retaining the prior s tay re cord in the a ctive clinical record is a matter of facility po licy and is not a CMS requi rement. After the 1 5-month period, RAI inf ormation may be thinned f rom the active clin ical record a nd stored in the medical r ecords depa rtment, provided that it is e asily retrievable requested by cli nical staff, State agency yors, CMS, or othe rs as a uthor ized by law.

Nursing hom es may use elec tronic signat ures f or clinical record docum entat ion, including the MDS, when per mitted t o do so by State and loc al law and when author ized by the facility's p olicy. Use of electronic sign atures f or the MDS does not requi re that the ent ire clinical record be m aintained elec tronically. F acilities m ust have writ ten pol icies in place to ensure pr oper secur ity measures are in place to prote ct the use of an elec tronic signature by anyone other than the per son to whom the el ectronic sign ature belongs.

Detai led in structions a re provided th roughout the rest of this chapter. Admission refers to the date a pe rson ente rs the facility and is ad mitted as a res ident. A day begins a t 12:00 a.m . and ends at 1 1:59 p.m . Regardless of whether admission occurs at 12:00 a.m. or 11:59 p.m ., this date i s cons idered t he 1st day of admission. Com pletion of an OB RA Admission assessm ent must occur in any of the f ollowing ad mission s ituations: when the re sident ha s never been adm itted to th is facility be fore; OR when the re sident ha s been in t his facility previously and w as disch arged return not anticipated; OR when the re sident ha s been in t his facility previously and w as disch arged return anticipated and did not re turn wit hin 30 days of dischar ge (see Dischar ge assessm ent below). Assessment Combination refers to t he use of one asses sment to sat isfy both O BRA and PPS assessm ent req uirements when the time frames coinci de for both requir ed assessm ents. In such cas es, the m ost strin gent require ment of the two ass essments f or MDS co mpletion m ust be met. There fore, it is imperat ive that n ursing home staff fully understand the requi rements f or both t ypes of asses sments in order to avoid unnecess ary duplic ation of effort and to re main in compliance with bot h OB RA and PPS requir ements. Sections 2.10 and 2.11 pr ovide m ore detai led in formation on c ombining PPS and OBRA assessm ents. In addi tion, when all requirements f or both are m et, one assess ment m ay sat isfy two O BRA assessm ent require ments, such as Ad mission and OBRA Discharge assessm ent. Assessment Completion refers to the da te that al l information needed has been collected and record ed for a par ticular asses sment type and sta ff have signed and dated t hat the assessment is complete. For OBRA -required C omprehensive assessm ents, assess ment co mpletion is de fined as completion of the CAA process in addition to t he MDS ite ms, meaning that the RN CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 9 assessm ent coordina tor has signed a nd dated bot h the MDS ( item Z0500) and CAA(s) (item V0200B) co ttestations. Since a Comprehensive ass essment in cludes completion of both the MDS and the CAA process, the a ssessment tim ing requi rements for a co mprehensive as sessment apply to both t he completion of the MDS and the CAA process. For non- comprehensive and Discha rge assess ments, ass essment co mpletion is de fined as completion of the MDS only, m eaning that the RN assessm ent coor dinator has s igned and dated t he M DS (item Z0500) com pletion a ttestation. Completion requi rements are depen dent on the assessment type and ti ming requi rements. Completion speci fics by assessm ent type are discussed in Se ction 2.6 f or OBRA assess ments and Section 2.9 f or PPS assess ments. Assessment Referen ce Date (ARD) refers to the last day of the observa tion (or \"look back\") p eriod that the as sessm ent covers f or the reside nt. Si nce a day be gins at 1 2:00 a. m. and ends at 1 1:59 p.m ., the ARD must also cover this time peri od. The f acility is r equired to set the ARD on the MDS Item Set or in the f acility so ftware wit hin the requ ired tim e frame of the assessm ent type being com pleted. Thi s concept of setting the A RD is used f or all asse ssment types (OBRA and PPS) and varies by assessment type and f acility deter mination. Most of the MDS 3.0 it ems have a 7 -day look ba ck period. If a resi dent h as an ARD of July 1, 2011, then a ll pertinent inf ormation s tarting at 12:00 a.m. on June 25th and e nding on July 1st at 11:59 p.m. should be incl uded f or MDS 3.0 coding. Assessment Scheduling refers to the pe riod of time during which a ssessm ents t ake place, setting the A RD, t iming, com pletion, subm ission, and the observation pe riods requi red to complete the MDS ite ms. Assessment Submission refers to elec tronic MDS data being in reco rd and f ile formats that conform to standard rec ord layo uts and data di ctionaries, and passes s tandardi zed ed its defined by CMS and the St ate. Chapter 5, C FR 483.20( f)(2), and the MDS 3.0 D ata Sub mission Speci fications on the CMS MDS 3.0 web site provide m ore detai led in formation. Assessment Timi ng refers to w hen and how of ten asses sments must be conduct ed, based upon the re sident's len gth of stay and the len gth of time bet ween ARDs. The table in Section 2.6 descri bes the assess ment tim ing sc hedule f or OBRA -requi red assess ments, while information on the P PS assessm ent tim ing s chedule i s provided in S ection 2.8. For OBRA -required assessments, regulat ory req uirements f or each as sessment type dictate assessment tim ing, the sche dule f or whi ch is es tablished with the Admission (comprehensive) a ssess ment when t he ARD is set by the RN assessm ent coordina tor and the Interdisciplinary T eam (IDT). Assuming the resi dent di d not expe rience a s ignificant change in st atus, was not dischar ged, and did not have a Sign ificant Corr ection to Pri or Comprehensive as sessment (SCPA) co mpleted, as sessment scheduling would then move through a cycle of three Quarter ly assessm ents fo llowed by an Annual ( comprehens ive) ass essment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 10 This cyc le (Comprehensive ass essment - Quar terly as sessment - Quart erly assessm ent - Quarter ly assessm ent - C omprehensive ass essment) would r epeat itself annua lly for the resident who: 1) t he IDT deter mines the c riteria for a Signi ficant Change in Status Assessm ent (SCSA) has not occur red, 2) an uncor rected sig nificant error in prior comprehensive or as sessment was not d etermined, a nd 3) was not disc harged with r not ant icipated. OBRA assessm ents may be schedu led early if a nursing hom e wants to s tagger due dat es for assessm ents. As a res ult, m ore th an three OBRA Quarterly assessm ents may be completed on a par ticular resident in a given ye ar, or the Annual m ay be c ompleted ea rly to ensure that regulatory time frames between as sessments are m et. How ever, St ates may have m ore stringe nt restrictions. When a res ident does ha ve an SCSA or SCPA c ompleted, the assessm ent reset assessm ent timing/scheduling. The next Quar terly assessm ent would be s cheduled w ithin 92 days a fter the ARD of the SCSA or SCPA, a nd the next com prehens ive assess ment would be s cheduled wi thin 366 days after the ARD of the S CSA or SC PA. Assessment Tran smission refers to the electro nic transmission of sub mission files to the QIES ASAP syst em using the Medica re Data C ommunication Networ k (MDCN). Chapter 5 a nd the CMS MDS 3.0 w eb site provi de m ore detai led in formation. Comprehensive MDS assessm ents in clude both the co mpletion of the MDS as well as completion of the C AA process and care plann ing. C omprehensive MDSs incl ude A dmission, Annual, SCSA, and SCPA. Death in Facility refers to when the re sident dies in the f acility or di es while on a leave of absence (LOA) (see LOA def initio n). The f acility must co mplete a Deat h in Fac ility tracking record. No Discharge ass essment is req uired. Discharge refers to the date a resi dent l eaves t he facility or the date the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends but the resident remains in the facility . A day begins a t 12:00 a.m . and ends at 11:59 p.m . Regardless of whether dischar ge occurs at 1 2:00 a. m. or 11:59 p.m ., this date i s conside red the actu al date of discha rge. There ar e three types of discharg es: two are OBRA required \u2014ret urn a nticipated and ret urn not an ticipated; the third is Medicare required \u2014Part A PPS Discharge . A Discha rge assess ment is r equired with all three t ypes of discharges. Section 2.6 provides det ailed instructions regarding return anticipated and return not anticipated ty pes, and Section 2.8 provides detailed instructions regarding the Part A PPS Discharge type . Any of the following situations w arrant a Dis charge as sessment, regardless of facility pol icies regarding opening and closing clinical records and bed holds : Resident i s discharged f rom the f acility to a p rivate resi dence ( as opposed t o going on a n LOA); Resident i s admitted to a hospit al or other c are setting (re gardless of whether the nursi ng home disch arges or f ormally c loses the record); Resident has a hospi tal observat ion s tay grea ter than 24 hours, r egard less of whether t he hospit al admits the res ident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 11 Resident is transferred from a Medicare- and/or Medicaid -certified bed to a non- certified bed. Resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility. Discharge Assessmen t refers to an assess ment req uired on reside nt discharge from the facility, or when a resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remain s in the facility (unless it is an instance of an interrupted stay, as defined below) . This assessm ent includes clinical items for quality monito ring as w ell as disc harge tracking in formation. Entry is a t erm used f or both an a dmission and a ree ntry a nd requi res completion of an Entry tracking r ecord. Entry and Discha rge Reporting MDS a ssessm ents and tracking r ecords t hat include a selec t num ber of items from the M DS used to t rack resi dents and gath er important qual ity data at transition po ints, such as when they e nter a nursing home , leave a nursing home, or when a resident's Medicare Part A stay end s, but the resident r emain s in the facility . Entry /Discharge reporting include s Entry tracking record, OBRA Discharge as sessments, Part A PPS Discharge assessment, and Death in Fa cility tracki ng record. Interdisciplinary Team (IDT1) is a g roup of professional disciplines th at combine knowledge, ski lls, and res ources to pr ovide the greatest benefit to the res ident. Interrupted Stay is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A -covered stay ) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A -covered stay during the interruption window. Interruption Window is a 3 -day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A -covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non- covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m . on the third consecutive non -covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A - covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion . Examples of when there is an Interrupted Stay: If a resident is discharged from Part A, remains in the facility , and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , this is an interrupted stay and no Part A PPS 1 42 CFR 483.21(b)(2) A comprehensive care plan must be (ii) Prepared by an interdisciplinary team, that includes but is not limited to - the atte nding physician, a registered nurse with responsibility f or the resident, a nurse aide with responsibility for the resident, a member of food and nutrition services staff, and other appropriate staff or professionals in disciplines as determined by the resident's needs or as requested by the resident, and, to the extent practicab le, the participation of the resident and the resident's representative(s). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 12 Discharge or OBRA Discharge is completed, nor is a 5 -Day or Entry Tracking record required when Part A resumes. If a re sident is discharged from Part A, leaves the facility, and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , this is an interrupted stay and only an OBRA Discharge is required. An Entry Tracking record is required on reentry, but no 5- Day is required. Examples of when there is no Interrupted Stay: If a resident is discharged from Part A, remains in the facility, and does not resume Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , it is not an interrupted stay. Therefore, a Part A PPS Discharge and a 5 -Day as sessment are both required (as long as resumption of Part A occurs within the 30- day window allowed by Medicare). If a resident is discharged from Part A, leaves the facility, and does not resume Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , it is not an in terrupted stay and the Part A PPS Discharge and OBRA Discharge are both required and may be combined (see Part A PPS Discharge assessment in Section 2.5). Any return to the facility in this instance would be considered a new entry \u2014that means that an Entry Tracking record, OBRA admission and/or 5- Day assessment would be required. Item Set refers to t he MDS ite ms that a re active on a pa rticular as sessm ent type or t racking form. There are 9 di fferent item subsets f or nur sing ho mes and 5 for swing bed provi ders as follows: Nursing Home \u2014 Comprehensive (N C2) Item Set.

Observation (Look Back) Period is the ti me period over which t he resi dent's condi tion or status is captured by the MDS assess ment. When the re sident is first admitted to the nursing home, the RN ass essment coordinat or and t he IDT will set t he AR D. For subse quent assessments, the observa tion period f or a particular assessm ent for a par ticular resident wi ll be chosen based upon the reg ulatory requi rements conc erning equire an obser vation pe riod, such as 7 or 14 days, depending on t he ite m. Since a day begins at 12:00 a .m. and ends at 11:59 p.m ., the obser vation period must also c over t his time period.

They are not requ ired for reside nts in swing be d facilities. Assessment Management Requirements and Tips for Comprehensive Assessments: The ARD ( item A2300) is the l ast day of the observa tion/look back pe riod, and day 1 f or purposes of counting ba ck to de termine the beg inning of observa tion/look back pe riods. For exa mple, if the ARD is set f or day 14 of a residen t's ad mission, then t he beginni ng of the obser vation pe obs ervat ion pe riod would be day 8 of admission (ARD + 6 previous c alend ar day s), while the beginning of the obser vation period f or M DS ite ms requiring a 14-day obser vation pe riod would be day 1 of admission (ARD + 13 previous c alendar day s). The nur sing hom e may not co mplete a Signi ficant Change in Status Assess ment until after an OBRA Admission assessm ent has been co mpleted. If a resi dent had an OB RA Adm ission assessm ent co mpleted and then goe s to the hospit al (discharge ret urn anti cipated and ret urns within 30 days) and re turns dur ing an assessm ent period and m ost of the assess ment was co mpleted prior to the hospi talization, then the nur sing hom e may wish to continue w ith the origi nal ass essment, provi ded the resident doe s not m eet the cr iteria for an SCSA . In this c ase, t he ARD r emains the s ame and the as sessment must be co mpleted by the com pletion dat es requ ired of the assess ment type based on the t ime frame in which the ass essment was st arted. Otherwi se, the assessment should be rei nitiated with a new ARD and c ompleted wi thin 14 days after re - entry f rom the hospi tal. The por tion of the res ident's asses sment that was previo usly completed should be st ored on the residen t's record with a not ation that the assess ment was rein itiated because t he resi dent was hospit alized. If a resi dent is disc harged prior to the co mpletion deadli ne for the a ssessment, c ompletion of the asses sment is not r equired. W hatev er port ions of the R AI that have b een co mpleted must be m aintained in the resi dent's medical rec ord.3 In closing the r ecord, the nur sing home should note why t he RAI was not co mpleted. 3 The RAI is considered part of the resident's clinical record and is treated as such by the RAI Utilization Guidelines, e.g., portions of the RAI that are \"started\" must be saved. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 20 If a resi dent dies p rior to the co mpletion deadli ne for the asses sment, c ompletion of the assessm ent is not requir ed. W hatever portions of the RAI that have been c ompleted m ust be m aintained in the resident's medical r ecord .4 In closing the record, the nursing hom e should note why the R AI was not c ompleted. If a signi ficant change in status is identified in the process of completing a ny OB RA assessm ent except Ad mission and S CSAs, code and com plete the as sessment as a comprehensive SCSA instead. The nursing hom e may combine a com prehensive assessm ent with a Disc harge assessm ent. In the pr ocess of completing any OBRA comprehensive a ssessment except an Ad mission and a n SCPA, if it is iden tified that an unc orrected s ignificant e rror curred in alr eady been subm itted and accep ted into t he QIES ASAP syste m, and has not a lready been corr ected in a subseque nt co mprehensive as sessment, code a nd complete the assess ment as a co mprehensive SCPA instead.

Assessm ent Managem ent Requirements and Tips for Admission Assess ments: Since a day begins a t 12:00 a.m . and ends at 1 1:59 p.m ., the actual date of admission, regar dless of whether a dmission occurs at 12:00 a .m. or 11:59 p.m ., is cons idered day \" 1\" of admission. The ARD ( item A2300) must be set no lat er than day 14, counting t he dat e of admission as day 1. Si nce a day begins at 1 2:00 a. m. and ends at 11:59 p.m ., the ARD must also cover t his tim e period. For exa mple, if a resi dent is ad mitted a t 8:30 a.m . on W ednesday (day 1), a completed RAI is r equired by the end of the day Tuesday (day 14). Federal s tatute and r egulations requi re that residents a re assessed prom ptly upon admission (but no l ater than day 14) and the r esults are used i n planning a nd providi ng appropr iate care to highe st pract icable well -being. This m eans it is imperative f or nursing ho mes to ass ess a re sident upon the i ndividua l's admission. T he IDT may choose to s tart and co mplete the Ad mission com prehensive a ssessment at any time prior to the end of day 14. Nurs ing homes may find early completion of the MDS and CAA(s) bene ficial to providing appropri ate care, p articularly f or individuals w ith short l engths of stay when the as sessment and care plan ning process is often acc elerated. The MDS com pletion date ( item Z0500B) must be no la ter than day 14. This date m ay be earlier than or the sa me as the CAA(s) co mpletion date, but not l ater than. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be no l ater than day 14. The care pl an completion date ( item V0200C2) m ust be no l ater than 7 c alend ar days after the C AA(s) co mpletion da te (item V0200B 2) (CAA(s) c ompletion date + 7 c alendar days). For a re sident who goes in and out of the facility on a rel atively frequent basis and return is expec ted within t he next 30 days, the res ident may be discharged with return anticipated. This st atus requires an Entry t racking record each time the reside nt returns to the f acility and a n OBRA Discharge as sessment each time the resident is disch arged. The nursing hom e may combine the Ad mission a ssess ment with a Dischar ge assessm ent when appli cable. 02. Annual Assessment (A0310A = 03) The Annual assess ment is a co mprehensive as sessment for a resident th at must be co mpleted on an annual ba sis (at least every 366 days) unl ess an SCSA or an SCPA has been co mpleted since the m ost recent comprehensive assess ment was co mpleted.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 22 Assessm ent Managem ent Requirements and Tips for Annual As sessments: The ARD ( item A2300) must be set within 366 days a fter the ARD of the previous OBRA comprehensi ve assessm ent (ARD of previous com prehensive assessment + 366 calend ar days) AND within 92 days since the ARD of the previous OBRA Quarterly or SCQA (A RD of previous OBRA Quarte rly assess ment + 92 calen dar days). The MDS com pletion date ( item Z0500B) must be no la ter than 14 days after the A RD (ARD + 14 calend ar days). This da te may be ear lier than or the sam e as the CAA(s) completion date, but not later than. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be no l ater than 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 calen dar days). Th is date m ay be the sa me as the MDS co mpletion dat e, but not e arlier than.

Significant Change in Status Assessment (SCSA) (A0310A = 04) The SCSA i s a co mprehensive a ssessment for a reside nt that must be co mpleted when the IDT has det ermined that a resident m eets the sig nificant change guidelines f or either major improve ment or decli ne. It can be per formed at any ti me after the co mpletion of an A dmission assessment, and its com pletion dates ( MDS/CAA(s)/care plan) de pend on the da te that the I DT's determination was m ade that the resi dent h ad a signi ficant change. Assessm ent Managem ent Requirements and Tips for Significant Change in S tatus Assessm ents: When a res ident's s tatus changes and it is n ot clear wheth er the res ident meets the SCSA guide lines, t he nursing h ome may take up to 14 days to de termine whet her the criteria are met. A \"signific ant change\" is a major de cline or improve ment in a residen t's status tha t: 1. Will not nor mally resol ve itself without int ervent ion by sta ff or by i mplementing standard di sease- related clinical interventions, the decline is not considered \"s elf- limiting\"; 2. Impacts more than one a rea of the re siden t's he alth status; and 3. Requires interdis ciplinary review and/or re vision of the care plan. A signif icant change di ffers f rom a s ignificant e rror because i t reflects an actual s ignificant change in the resident's health s tatus and NOT incorrect coding of the MDS. A signif icant change may r equire referral for a Preadmission Sc reening and Resident Review (PASRR) evaluat ion if a ment al illness, intellectu al disabil ity (ID), or related condi tion is present or is suspected to be pr esent. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 23 After the I DT has det ermined that a resident m eets t he sig nificant change guide lines, the nursing hom e should doc ument the i nitial identification of a significant c hange in t he resident's status in the clinical record . An SCSA is appropri ate when: \u2014 There is a deter mination that a signi ficant change (either improvement or decli ne) in a resident's condition f rom his/h er bas eline h as occurred as indicated by com parison of the res ident's curre nt status to the m ost re cent com prehensive assessm ent and any subsequent Quarter ly assessments; a nd \u2014 The resi dent's condi tion is not ex pected to r eturn to bas eline within two weeks. \u2014 For a re sident who goes in and out of the facility on a rel atively frequent basis and reentry is expected w ithin the next 30 days, the r eside nt may be disch arged with return anticipated. This status requ ires an Entry tracking r ecord each t ime the res ident retur ns to the facility and an OBRA Dischar ge assess ment each time the resi dent is disch arged. However, if the IDT det ermines that t he resi dent would bene fit from an SCSA during the i nterve ning period, t he sta ff must co mplete an SCSA . This is only allowed when the resi dent h as had an OBRA A dmission assessm ent co mpleted and subm itted prior to di scharge return an ticipated (and resident r eturns within 30 days) or when the OBRA A dmission assessm ent is co mbined w ith the discharge r eturn anticipated assessm ent (and reside nt returns within 30 da ys). An SC SA may not be com pleted p rior to an OBRA Adm ission assessm ent. An SC SA is required to be per formed when a ter minally ill resident enr olls in a -licensed h ospice provider) or changes hospice providers and remains a r esident at the nursing hom e. The ARD must be wi thin 14 days from the ef fective date of the hospice elec tion (w hich can be t he sam e or lat er than the date of the h ospice e lection sta tement, but not e arlier than). A n SCSA must be per formed regar dless of whether an assessm ent was recently conducted on the re sident. This is to ensure a co ordin ated pl an of care between the hospice and nursing hom e is in place. A Medicare -certified h ospice m ust conduct an a ssess ment at the i nitiation of its ser vices. This is an appropr iate time for the nursing hom e to ev aluate the MDS i nformation to deter mine if it reflects the cur rent condi tion of the res ident, since the n ursing ho me remains responsible f or providing necess ary care and s ervices to as sist the resi dent in achieving his/h er highest pr acticable well -being a t whatev er stage of the d isease pr ocess the resident is ex periencing. If a resi dent is ad mitted on the hospi ce benef it (i.e., the r esident is co ming into t he facility having a lready ele cted hospice), or elects hospice on or prior to the ARD of the Admission assessment, the facility sho uld co mplete the Ad mission assessm ent, checking the Hospice Care i tem, O0100K. C ompleting an A dmission assessm ent followed by an SCSA is not required. Where hospice election occurs after the Admission assessment ARD but prior to its completion, facilities may choose to adjust the ARD to the date of hospice election so that only the Admission assessment is required. In such situations, an SCSA is not required. An SC SA is required to be per formed when a resi dent is rece iving hospice services and then de cides to s ervices (know n as revoki ng of hospice car e). The ARD must be wi thin 14 days from one of the f ollowi ng: 1) t he effecti ve date of the hospice CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 24 election r evocation (which can be t he sam e or lat er than the date of the h ospice e lection revoc ation s tatement, but not e arlier than ); 2) t he expir ation date of the ce rtification of terminal il lness; or 3) t he date of the physic ian's or m edical direc tor's order st ating the resident i s no longer terminally ill. If a resident is admitted on the hospice benefit but decides to discontinue it prior to the ARD of the Admission assessment, the facility should complete the Admission assessment, checking the Hospice Care item, O0100K. Completing an Admission assessment f ollowed by an SCSA is not required. Where hospice revocation occurs after the Admission assessment ARD but prior to its completion, facilities may choose to adjust the ARD to the date of hospice revocation so that only the Admission assessment is required. In such situations, an SCSA is not required. The ARD must be less than or equal to 14 days after the IDT's determination that the criteria for an SCSA are met (determination date + 14 calendar days). The MDS com pletion date ( item Z0500B) must be no la ter than 14 days from the A RD (ARD + 14 calend ar days) and no l ater than 14 days a fter the deter mination that the criteria for an SCSA were m et. This date m ay be ear lier than or the sam e as the CAA(s) completion date, but not later than. When an SCSA is co mpleted, the nur sing home must re view al l triggered ca re areas compared to the re sident's pre vious s tatus. If the CAA process indi cates no change in a care a rea, then the p rior docum entation f or the pa rticular care area m ay be car ried forward, and the nur sing home should speci fy where t he sup porting doc umentation can be loc ated in the m edical record. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be no l ater than 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 calen dar days) and no lat er than 14 days a fter the d etermination that the criteria for an SCSA were m et. This date m ay be the sam e as the MDS co mpletion dat e, but not e arlier than M DS completion. The care pl an completion date ( item V0200C2) m ust be no l ater than 7 c alend ar days after the C AA(s) co mpletion da te (item V0200B 2) (CAA(s) c ompletion date + 7 c alendar days). Guidel ines for Deter mining a S ignificant Change in a R esiden t's Status: Note: this is not an exhaustive li st The f inal d ecision regarding what c onstit utes a signi ficant c hange in s tatus m ust be based upon the judg ment of the IDT. MDS asses sments are not req uired fo r minor or t emporary va riations in resident s tatus - in these cases, t he residen t's co ndition is ex pected to return to bas eline within 2 weeks. Ho wever, s taff must note these tran sient changes in t he resi dent's status in the resident's record and imple ment necess ary as sessment, ca re planning, and cli nical interventions, even though an M DS assessm ent is n ot required. Some Gui delines to Assist in Decidin g If a Change I s Significa nt or Not: A condition is de fined as \"self-limiting\" when the condi tion will nor mally resolve itself without f urther intervent ion or by s taff implementing s tanda rd diseas e-related c linical interventions. If the co ndition has not res olved within 2 w eeks, sta ff should begin an SCSA . This time frame may vary depending on clinical judg ment and resident ne eds. For CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 25 exam ple, a 5% weight loss for a re sident with the flu would not nor mally meet the requi rements f or an SCSA . In gener al, a 5% wei ght loss m ay be an expect ed outcom e for a resident wi th the f lu who exper ienced nausea and diarr hea f or a week. In this s ituation, staff should m onitor the reside nt's status and a ttempt various interventions to re ctify the immediate weight loss. If the res ident did not be come dehy drated and st arted to reg ain weight a fter the sy mptom s subsided, a com prehensive as sessment woul d not be re quired. An SC SA is appropri ate if there are e ither two or more areas of decline or two or more areas of improve ment. In this e xample, a res ident with a 5% w eight loss in 30 days would not gene rally requi re an SCSA unless a second a rea of decline acco mpanies it. Note that this a ssumes that the car e plan has already been modified to acti vely t reat the weig ht loss as opposed t o continuing with the or iginal probl em, \"potenti al for weight loss.\" This situation should be doc umented in the resi dent's clinical record along w ith the plan fo r subsequent monitoring and, if the p roblem persi sts or worse ns, an SCSA may be warranted. If there is only one change , staff may still decide that the r esident would bene fit from an SCSA . It is important to remember that each resident's s ituation is unique , and the IDT must make the deci sion as to wheth er or not the r eside nt will bene fit from an SCSA . Nursing hom es must docum ent a rat ionale, in the resi dent's medical rec ord, f or completing an SCSA that does not m eet the cr iteria for co mpletion. An SC SA is also appropr iate if there is a consi stent pattern of changes, with eith er two or more areas of decline or two or more areas of improve ment. This m ay include two changes wi thin a pa rticular do main (e.g., two ar eas of ADL decli ne or i mprove ment). An SC SA would not be a ppropri ate in situ ations where the r esident has s tabilized but is expected to be disch arged in the immedia te future. The nursi ng home has engaged in dischar ge planning with the re sident and f amily, and a com prehensive reassessm ent is not necess ary to facilitate discharge pla nning.

Examples (SC SA): 1. Mr. T no longer responds to verbal requests to alter his screaming behavior. It now occurs daily and has neither lessened on its own nor responded to treatment. He is also starting to resist his daily care, pu shing staff away from him as they attempt to assist with his ADLs. This is a significant change, and an SCSA is required, since there has been deterioration in the behavioral symptoms to the point where it is occurring daily and new approaches are needed t o alter the behavior. Mr. T's behavioral symptoms could have many causes, and a n SCSA will provide an opportunity for staff to consider illness, medication reactions, environmental stress, and other possible sources of Mr. T's disruptive behavior. 2. Mrs. T r equired minimal assi stance w ith ADLs. She f ractu red her hip and upon return to the facility req uires ex tensive assi stance with a ll ADLs. Rehab has st arted and staff is hope ful she will ret urn to her pr ior lev el of function in 4- 6 weeks. 3. Mrs. G has been in t he nursing hom e for 5 weeks following an 8- week a cute hos pitalization. On a dmission she was v ery frail, had troubl e thinking, was c onfused, and had m any behavior al complica tions. The cour se of treat ment led to st eady i mprove ment and she is now stable. She i s no longer conf used or exhibi ting inappropr iate behaviors. T he resi dent, her family, and sta ff agree t hat she has made r emarkable prog ress. A n SCSA is req uired at this time. The resident is not the person s he was at adm ission - her in itial problems have resolved and she wi ll be rem aining in the f acility.

Guidel ines for Deter mining the N eed for an SCSA for Residents with Ter minal Conditi ons: Note: this is not an exhaustive li st The key in deter mining i f an SCSA is requi red for individuals with a t erminal condi tion is whether or not t he change in con dition is an e xpected, wel l-defined pa rt of the d isease cour se and is consequentl y being add ressed as p art of the over all plan of care for the in dividua l. If a ter minally ill resident exper ience s a new ons et of symptom s or a co ndition that is not part of the e xpected co urse of deterioration and t he cr iteria are met for an SC SA, an SCSA is requ ired. If a resi dent elects the Medica re Ho spice pro gram, it is im porta nt that the two separ ate entities (nursing hom e and hospice program staff) coordi nate the ir respo nsibi lities and develop a re plan reflecting the i nterven tions r equired by both ent ities. The nursing home and hospice plans of care sh ould be re flective of the c urrent status of the resi dent. Examples (SC SA): 1. Mr. M has been in t his n ursing hom e for two and one -half years. He has been a f avorite of staff and other re sidents, and his daug hter has be en an act ive volunte er on t he unit. M r.

If the r esident's discharge plans chan ge, or if she i s not disc harged, an SCSA is required by the end of the allotted 14- day period. 3. Mrs. P, too, has responded to c are. Unlike M rs.

W hatev er por tions of the RAI that ha ve been co mpleted m ust be maintained in the res ident's medical r ecord.6 When cl osing the record, the nur sing home should document why the RAI was not co mpleted. If a signi ficant change in status is identified in the process of completing a ny assess ment except Ad mission and S CSAs, code and com plete the as sessment as a co mprehensive SCSA instead. In the pr ocess of completing any a ssessment except an Ad mission and a n SCPA, if it is identified that a s ignificant err or occurred in a previous com prehensive assessment that has al ready been subm itted and a ccepted i nto the QIES ASAP syst em and has not a lready been corr ected in a subseque nt co mprehensive as sessment, code a nd co mplete the assessm ent as a co mprehensive SCPA instead.

While th e CAA process is not r equired with a n on-comprehensive as sessment (Quarterly, SCQA), nursing h omes are s till requ ired to review t he information f rom these assessm ents, and review and revise the resident's care plan. The MDS must be t ransmitted (su bmitted and accepted into the QIES ASAP system ) electronically no lat er than 14 calen dar days a fter the MDS co mpletion dat e (Z0500B + 14 calend ar days). Non-comprehensive a ssessments may be co mbined with a 5- Day assessment or SNF Part A PPS Discharge Assess ment (see Sect ions 2.10 and 2.11 f or deta ils). 6 The RAI is considered part of the resident's clinical reco rd and is treated as such by the RAI Utilizatio n Guidelines, e.g., portions of the RAI t hat are \"started\" must be saved.

T he assess ment in formation is used to develop, r eview, and re vise t he resident's pl ans of care t hat wi ll be used to provi de serv ices to attain or m aintain the resident's highest pra cticable phy sical, m ental, and psychos ocial w ell-being. The RAI process, which include s the Federal ly mandated M DS, is the ba sis for an accurate assessm ent of nursing ho me residents. The MDS inf ormation and the C AA process provide the foundation upon which t he care plan is formulated. There ar e 20 proble m-oriented CAAs, each of which includes MDS -based \"t rigger\" con ditions that s ignal the n eed for addi tional assessm ent and rev iew of the trig gered ca re area. Detai led information r egarding e ach care area a nd the CAA process, including definitio ns and trig gers, appear in Chapter 4 of this m anual. Chapter 4 also contains det ailed information on care plan ning develo pment utili zing the RAI and CAA process. CAA (s) Completion Is req uired f or OBRA -required com prehensi ve as sessm ents. They are n ot required f or non-comprehensive sessments, P PS assessm ents, Disch or Tr acking records. After co mpleting the M DS portion of the co mprehensive assessment, the next s tep is to further i dentify and eval uate t he resi dent's s trengths, proble ms, and ne eds through use of the CAA process (d escribed in de tail in Chapt er 3, Section V , and Chapt er 4 of this manual) and through f urther inve stigation of any resident -specific issues not the RAI/CAA process. The CAA(s) co mpletion date ( item V0200B2) must be e ither later than or the sam e date as the MDS completion date ( item Z0500B). In no event should eith er date be lat er than the established time frames as descr ibed i n Section 2.6. It is important to not e that for an Adm ission assessm ent, the r esident ent ers the nur sing home with a set of phys ician-based t reatment or ders. Nursing hom e staf f should re view these or ders and begin to assess the r esident and t o ident ify potent ial care issues/ proble ms. Within 48 hours of admission to the facility, the facility must develop and implement a Baseline Care Plan for the resident that includes the instructions needed to provide effective and person- centered care of the resident that meets professional standards of care (42 CFR \u00a7483.21(a)). In many cases, interventions to meet the resident's needs will a lready have been implemented to addre ss prio rity issues pri or to completion of the f inal c are plan. At this tim e, many of the resident's pr oblems in the 20 care ar eas will have been identifi ed, causes w ill have been conside red, and a baseline c are plan in itiated. However, a f inal CAA(s) rev iew and associ ated docu mentation are s till required no la ter than the 14th calen dar day of adm ission ( admission da te plus 13 c alendar days). Detai led in formation r egarding e ach CAA and t he CAA pr ocess app ears in Chapter 4 of this m anual. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 42 Care Plan Completion Care plan com pletion ba sed on the C AA process is req uired f or OBRA -required comprehensive assess ments. It is not requi red for non- comprehensive as (Quarterly, SCQA), P PS assessm ents, Discharge assessm ents, or Trac king records. However, t he resident's care plan must be reviewed after each assessment , as required by \u00a7483.20, except discharge assessments, and revised based on changing goals, preferences and needs of the resident and in response to current interventions. After co mpleting the M DS and C AA portions of the co mprehensive a ssessment, the next step is to evaluat e the i nformation gained t hrough both asse ssment processes in order to identify proble ms, causes, cont ributing f actors, a nd risk f actors re lated to the proble ms. Subsequent ly, the IDT m ust evalu ate the in formation g ained to develop a care plan t hat address es those f indings in the co ntext of the resi dent's goals, preferences, strengths, proble ms, and ne eds (descr ibed in deta il in C hapter 4 of this m anual). The care pl an completion date ( item V0200C2) m ust be eit her later than or the sa me date as the CAA co mpletion date ( item V0200B2), but no l ater than 7 calend ar days a fter the CAA c ompletion da te. The MDS co mpletion dat e (item Z0500B) must be ear lier than or the sam e date as the care plan co mpletion da te. In no event should eit her d ate be l ater than the es tablished ti me frames as des cribed in Sect ion 2.6. For Annual assess ments, SCSAs, and SCPAs, the process is basically the same as that descri bed w ith an Adm ission ass essment. In these cases, h owever, the c are p lan will already be i n place. Re view of the CAA(s) when the MDS is complete f or these assessm ent types should raise q uestions about t he need to m odify or conti nue serv ices and resu lt in either the continuanc e or rev ision of the exis ting care plan. A new care plan does not ne ed to be deve loped a fter each Annual assessm ent, SCSA, or S CPA. Residents' preferences and goals may change throughout their stay, so facilities should have ongoing discussions with the resident and resident representative, if applicable, so that changes can be reflected in the comprehensive care plan . Detai led in formation regarding the care planni ng process appears in Cha pter 4 of this manual. 2.8 Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System Assessment Schedule SNFs m ust assess the c linical con dition of bene ficiaries by c ompleting the MDS as sessment for each Medic are res ident receiving Pa rt A SNF -level ca re for rei mburse ment under the SNF PPS. In addi tion t o the PPS assess ments, the SNF m ust also c omplete the requi rements f or ments ap ply to the PPS assessm ents, such as c ompletion a nd subm ission tim e frames. Asses smen t Window The PPS 5- Day assessment has de fined days within whi ch the Assessm ent Ref erence Date (ARD) m ust be set. The ARD must be a day within the prescribed window of Days 1 through 8 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 43 of the Part A stay and must be set on the MDS form itself or in the facility software before this window has passed. The f irst day of Medicare Part A cov erage f or the curre nt stay is co nsidered day 1 f or PPS assessm ent scheduling purposes and for purposes of the variable per diem adjustment, as discussed in Chapter 6, Section 6.7. In most cases, the first day of Medicare Part A cover age is the date of admission. However, the re are situations in which the M edica re ben eficiary may quali fy for Part A s ervices at a l ater date. See Chapter 6, Section 6.7, f or more de tailed information. Scheduled PPS Asses smen t The PPS- required s tandard ass essment is the 5 -Day assessment, which has a p redetermined ti me period f or set ting the ARD. The SNF provider m ust set the ARD on days 1 -8 to assure complian ce with t he SNF PPS PDPM requi PPS Assessme nts There ar e situations whe n a SNF provider may complete an a ssessm ent after the 5-Day assessment. This asse ssment is an unsche duled assess ment called the Interim Payment Assessment (IPA). When deemed appropriate by the provider, t his assessment may be completed to capture changes in the resident 's status and condition. Tracki ng Records and Discharge Assessm ents Reporting Tracking records and Di scharge a ssessments reporting are re quired on all residents in the SNF and swing bed f acilities. Tracking records and st andalone D ischarge ass essments do not i mpact payment. Part A PPS Discharge Assessment (A0310H) The Part A PPS Discharge assessment contains data elements used to calculate current and future SNF QRP quality measures under the IMPACT Act . The IMPACT Act directs the Secretary to specify quality measures on which Post -Acut e Care ( PAC ) providers (which includes SNFs) are required to submit standardized resident asse ssment data. Section 1899B(2)(b)(1)(A)(B) of the Act delineates that resident assessment data must be submitted with respect to a resident's admission into and di scharge from a SNF setting. Per current requirements, the OBRA Discharge assessment is used when the resident is physically discharged from the facility. The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is completed when a resident 's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility (unless it is an instance of an interrupted stay) . Item A0310H, \"Is this a Part A PPS Discharge Assessment?\" identifies whether or not the discharge is a Part A PPS Discharge assessment for the purposes of the SNF QRP ( see Chapter 3, Section A for further details and coding instructions). The Part A PPS Discharge assessment can also be combined with the OBRA Discharge assessment when a resident receiving services under SNF Part A PPS has a Discharge Date (A2000) that occurs on the day of or one day after the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C), because in this instance, both the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments would be required. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 44 Part A PPS Discharge Assessment (A0310H = 1): For the Part A PPS Dischar ge ass essment, the A RD (item A2300) is not set prospe ctively as with other assess ments. The ARD (A2300) for a standalone Part A PPS Disch arge assessment is alwa ys equal to the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C). The ARD m ay be coded on the ass essment any ti me during the a ssessm ent com pletion period ( i.e., End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) + 14 calend ar days) . If the resident's Medicare Part A st ay ends and the resident is physically discharged from the facility, an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. If the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the day of or one day before the Discharge Date (A2000), the OBRA Discharge assessment and Part A PPS Discharge assessment are both required and may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000). The Part A PPS Discharge assessment may be co mbined with most OBRA -required a ssessm ents when requ irements f or all assess ments are m et (please see Section 2.1 0 Combining PPS Assessments and OBRA Assessments). Must be c ompleted ( item Z0500B) within 14 da ys after the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C + 14 calend ar days). Must be su bmitted with in 14 days a fter the MDS co mpletion date (Z0500B + 14 calendar days). Consists of demographic, ad ministr ative, and c linical items. If the resident's Medicare Part A s tay ends and the resident subsequently returns to a skilled level of care and Medicare Part A benefits do not resume within 3 days, the PPS schedule starts again with a 5 -Day assessment. If the Medicare Part A stay does resume within the 3 -day interruption window, the n this is an interrupted stay (see below). If the resident leaves the facility for an interrupted stay, no P art A P PS Discharge Assessment is required when the resident leaves the building at the outset of the interrupted stay; however, an OBR A Discharge r ecord is required if the discharge criteria are met ( see Section 2.5) . If the resident returns to the facility within the interruption window, as defined above , an Entry tracking form is required; however, no new 5 -Day assessment is required.

If the assess ment is b eing used for reimbursement under the SNF PPS, the PPS Reason f or Assessm ent m ust be co ded in item A0310B. T he OBRA Reason f or Assessm ent is descri bed ea rlier in th is section whi le the PPS assessme nts are des cribed below. A SNF pro vider m ay co mbine asses sments to m eet both OBRA and PPS req uirements. W hen co mbining assess ments, a ll completion deadli nes and other requirements f or both types of assessm ents m ust be met. If all require ments cannot be m et, the assessments must be co mpleted separ ately. The rel ationship betwe assessm ents is discu ssed below a nd in ctions 2.10 and 2.11 . PPS Assessm ents for a Medicare Part A Stay 01. 5-Day Assessment ARD ( item A2300) must be s et for D ays 1 throug h 8 of the Part A SNF covered s tay. Must be c ompleted ( item Z0500B) within 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 days). Authorizes payment for entire PPS stay (except in cases when an IPA is completed). Must be su bmitted ele ctronica lly and accep ted in to the QIES ASAP system within 14 days a fter completion ( item Z0500 B) (co mpletion + 14 days). If combined with the OBRA A dmission assessm ent, the a ssessment must be co mpleted by the end of day 14 of admission ( admission da te plus 13 c alendar day s). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 46 Is the f irst PPS- required a ssessment to be co mpleted when the resident is first admitted for a SNF Part A stay. Is the f irst PPS- required a ssessment to be co mpleted when the resident is re-admitted to the facility for a Part A stay f ollowing a di scharge ass essment - re turn not a nticipated or if the resident returns m ore than 30 days a fter a disch arge assess ment-return an ticipated. A 5-Day assessment is not required at the time when a resident returns to a Part A - covered stay following an interrupted stay , regardless of the reason for the interruption (facility discharge, resident no longer skilled, payer change, etc.) . If a resident changes payers from Medica re Advantage to Medica re Part A, the SNF must complete a 5- Day assessment with the ARD set for one of days 1 through 8 of the Medica re Part A stay , with the resident 's first day covered by Medicare Part A serving as Day 1, unless it is a case of an interrupted stay. 02. Interim Payment Assessment Optional assessment . ARD ( item A2300) may be set for any day of the SNF PPS stay, beyond the ARD of the 5-Day assessment. Must be c ompleted ( item Z0500B) within 14 da ys after the ARD ( ARD + 14 days). Authorizes payment for remainder of the PPS stay, beginning on the ARD. Must be su bmitted ele ctronica lly and accep ted in to the QIES ASAP system within 14 days a fter completion ( item Z0500 B) (co mpletion + 14 days). The ARD for an IPA may not precede that of the 5- Day assessment. May not be combined w ith any other assessments (PPS or OBRA). 03. Part A PPS Discharge Assessment See definition provided in Section 2.8, Part A PPS Discharge Assessment (A0310H = 1). 2.10 Combining PPS Assessments and OBRA Assessments7 SNF providers a re req uired to m eet two assessm ent standar ds in a Me dicare ce rtified nursing facility: The OBRA standards are designated by the reason selected in item A0310A, Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment , and item A0130F, Entry/Discharge Reporting and are required for all residents. The P PS standards are designated by the reason selected in item A0310B, PPS Assessment and item A0310H, Is this a SNF Part A PPS Discharge Assessment? When the OBRA and PPS assessment time frames coincide (except the IPA) , one assessment may be used to satisfy both requirements. PPS and OBRA assessments (except 7 OBRA assessments do not apply to Swing Bed providers; however, Swing Bed providers are required to complete the Entry Tracking record, Swing Bed PPS (SP), Swing Bed Discharge (SD) assessment, and Death in Facility Tracking record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 47 the IPA) may be combined when the ARD windows overlap allowing for a common assessment reference date. When combining the OBRA and PPS assessments, the most stringent requirements for ARD, item se t, and CAA completion requirements must be met. For example, the skilled nursing facility staff must be very careful in selecting the ARD for an OBRA Admission assessment combined with a 5- Day assessment. For the OBRA Admission, the ARD must be set between days 1 and 14 counting the date of admission as day 1. For the 5 -Day, the ARD must be set for days 1 through 8. However, when combining a 5- Day assessment with the OBRA Admission assessment, the use of the latter end of the OBRA Admission ARD window would cause the 5 -Day assessment to be considered late. To assure the assessment meets both standards, an ARD of a day between Day 1 and 8 would have to be chosen in this situation. In addition, the completion standards must be met. While a PPS assessment can b e completed within 14 days after the ARD when it is not combined with an OBRA assessment, the CAA completion date for the OBRA Admission assessment ( item V0200B2) must be day 14 or earlier. With the combined OBRA Admission/ 5- Day assessment, completion by day 14 would be required. Finally, when combining a PPS assessment with an OBRA assessment, the SNF staff must ensure that all required items are completed. Some states requi re pro viders to co mplete addi tional s tate-specific items (Section S) f or sel ected assessm ents. States m ay also add c omprehensive items to the Quarter ly and/or PPS i tem sets. Providers m ust ensur e that they f ollow their s tate requi rements in addi tion to any OB RA and/or PPS re quire ments. The f ollowing tabl es provide the item set f or each type of assessm ent or trac king r ecord.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 50 2.12 Factors Impacting SNF PPS Assessment Schedul ing8 Resident Expires Before or On the Eighth Day of SNF Stay If the benefi ciary dies in the SNF or while on a l eave of absence bef ore or on the e ighth day of the cov ered SNF stay, the provide r should prepare a 5- Day assessm ent as co mpletely as possi ble and subm it the assess ment as req uired. If there is not a PPS assessment in the QIES ASA P syste m, the provider must bil l the def ault r ate for any Medicare days. The pro vider m ust al so complete a Death in F acility T racking Record ( see Section 2.6 f or grea ter det ail). Resident Transfers or Is Discharged Before or On the Eighth Day of SNF Stay If the benefi ciary is discharged f rom the SNF or the Medicare Part A stay ends (e.g., trans ferred to another payer source) before or on the eighth day of the covered SNF stay, the pro vider should prepar e a 5-Day assessment as co mplete ly as possible and subm it the ass essment as r equired. If there i s not a PPS assessment in the QIES AS AP syste m, the provider must bil l the def ault r ate for any Medica re days. When the Medicare Part A stay ends on or before the eighth day of the covered SNF stay, and the beneficiary remains in the facility, a Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required. When the benefi ciary is disch arged f rom the SNF, the provider must also co mplete an OBRA Discharge assess ment, but if the Medicare Part A stay ends on or before the eighth day of the covered SNF stay and the beneficiary is physical ly discharged from the facility the day of or the day after the Part A stay ends, the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments may be combined. (S ee Sections 2.10 and 2.11 for deta ils on combining a PPS assessm ent with a Discharge as sessment.) Resident Is Admitte d to an Acute Care Facility and Returns If a Medicar e Part A re sident is ad mitted to an ac ute ca re facility and la ter retur ns to the SNF to resume Part A coverage, the resident requires a new 5 -Day assessment , unless it is an instance of an interrupted stay. If it is a case of an interrupted stay (i.e., the resident returns to the SNF and resumes Part A services in the same SNF within the 3 -day interruption window), then no PPS assessment is required upon reentry, only an Entry tracking form. An IPA may be completed, if deemed appropriate. Resident I s Sent to Acute Ca re Facilit y, Not in SNF over Midnight, and I s Not Admitted to Acute Care Facili ty If a resi dent is out of the f acility over a midnight, but f or less than 24 hours, and is not ad mitted to an acute c are facility, a new 5 -Day PPS assessment is not required , though an IPA may be completed, if deemed appropriate. However, there a re pay ment im plications: the day pre ceding the midnight on whi ch the r esident was absent f rom the nursing hom e is not a covered Par t A day. This is known as the \"midnight rule.\" For e xample, if the resi dent g oes to t he em ergency room at 10 p.m. W ednes day, day 22 of his Part A stay, and returns at 3 a.m. the next day, Wednesday is not bill able to Par t A. As a re sult, the day of his return to the SNF, Thursday, 8 These requirements/ polici es also a pply to swing bed providers. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 51 beco mes day 22 of his Part A stay. This means that this day is skipped for purposes of the variable per diem adju stment, described in Chapter 6. Resident Takes a Lea ve of Absence from the SNF If a resi dent is out of the facility for a Leave of Absence (L OA) as def ined on page 2- 13 in this chapt er, there may be payment implications . For exa mple, if a resident l eaves a SNF at 6:00 p.m. on W ednesday, which is Day 27 of the res ident's s tay a nd retur ns to the SNF on Thursday at 9:00 a .m., then W ednesday beco mes a non -billable day and Thursday be comes Day 27 of the resident's stay. If the beneficiary experiences a leave of absence during part of the assessment observation period, the facility may include services furnished during the beneficiary's temporary absence (when permitted under MDS coding guidelines; see Chapter 3) . Resident Discharg ed from Part A Ski lled Services and from the Facility and Returns to SNF Part A Skilled Level Services In the s ituation when a bene ficiary is discharged from Medicare Par t A and is physically discharged from the facility, but returns to resume SNF Part A skilled services after the interruption window has closed, the OBRA Discharge and Part A PPS Discharge must be completed and can be combined (see Part A PPS Discharge in Section 2.5). On return to the facility, this is conside red a new Part A stay (as long as resumption of Part A occurs within the 30- day window allowed by Medicare), and a new 5- Day and Entry Tracking record must be completed. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no OBRA assessment is required. How ever, if the resident was discharged return not anticipated, the facility must complete a new OBRA Admission assessment. See Chapter 6, Section 6 .7 for great er detai l to d etermine whether or not the resi dent is eligible f or Part A SNF coverage. However, in the case of an interrupted stay, that is, if a resident leaves the facility and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , only an OBRA Discharge is required. An Entry Tracking record is required on reentry, but no 5- Day is required. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no OBRA assessment is required. However, if the resident was discharged return not anticipated, the facility must complete a new OBRA Admission assessment. The be neficiary should be ass essed to deter mine if there was a signi ficant c hange in s tatus. Resident Discharg ed from Part A Ski lled Services Is Not Physically Discharged from the Skilled Nursing Facility In the situation when a resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident is not physically discharged from the facility, remaining i n a Medi care and/or Me dicaid certified bed with another payer source, t he facility must continue with the OB RA schedule from the beneficiary's original date of admission (item A1 900) and must also complete a Part A PPS Discharge assessment. If Part A benefits resume, there is no reason to change the OB RA schedule; the PPS schedu le would start ag ain with a 5 -Day assessment, MDS item A 0310B = 01, unless it is a case of an CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 52 interrupte d stay \u2014that is, if the resident is discharged from Part A, remains in the facility , and resumes Part A within the 3 -day interruption window , no Part A PPS Discharge is completed, nor is a 5- Day required when Part A resumes. Delay in Requiring and Receiving Skilled Services There ar e instances wh en the bene ficiary d oes not req uire S NF level of care s ervices when initially ad mitted to t he SNF. See Ch apter 6, Se ction 6.7. Non-Com pliance w ith the PPS Assessmen t Schedule According t o Part 42 Code of Feder al Regula tion (CFR) Sect ion 413.343, an assess ment th at does not ha ve its ARD within the p rescribed A RD window will be p aid at the de fault rate for the number of days the ARD is out of compliance. Frequent l ate assessment scheduling prac tices or missed assessments m ay resu lt in additional review. The default r ate takes the place of the otherwise ap plicable Federal rate. It is equal to the r ate paid for the Health Insurance Prospective Payment System ( HIPPS) code ref lecting the l owest acu ity level for each PDPM component and would gene rally be lower than the M edica re rate payable if the SNF had su bmitted an assessm ent in accordan ce with the pr escri bed as sessment schedule. Late PPS Asse ssment If the SNF fails to set the ARD within the defined ARD window for a 5 -Day assessment, and the resident is still on Part A, the SNF must complete a late assessment. The ARD can be no earlier than the day the error was identified. The SNF will bill the default rate for the number of days that the ass essment is out of compliance. This is equal to the number of days between the day following the last day of the available ARD window and the late ARD (including the late ARD). The SNF would then bill the HIPPS code established by the late assessment for th e remainder of the SNF stay, unless the SNF chooses to complete an IPA. For example, a 5 -Day assessment with an ARD of Day 11 is out of compliance for 3 days and therefore would be paid at the default rate for Days 1 through 3 of the Part A stay and the HI PPS code from the late 5 -Day assessment for the remainder of the Part A stay, unless an IPA is completed. Missed P PS Asse ssment If the SNF fails to set the ARD of a 5-Day assess ment pri or to the end of the last day of the ARD window, and the resident was already dis charged f rom Medica re Part A when this e rror is discove red, the provide r cannot co mplete an ass essment for SNF PPS purposes a nd the days cannot be bi lled to Pa rt A. Errors on a PPS As sessment To corre ct an error on an MDS that has been su bmitted to the QIES AS AP syste m, the SNF must follow the nor mal MDS correction procedur es (see Chapter 5). 2.13 Expected Order of MDS Records The MDS records f or a n ursing hom e resident a re expected to occur in a specific order. For exam ple, the f irst record for a resi dent is ex pected to be an Ent ry rec ord w ith en try type (item A1700) indi cating admission, and t he next r ecord is expec ted to be an Ad mission assess ment, a CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 2: Assessments for the RAI October 2019 Page 2- 53 5-Day assess ment, a Dischar ge assessment , or Death in Facility tracking record .

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: Overview of Guide to MDS Items October 2019 Page 3- 1 CHAPTER 3: OVERVIEW TO THE ITEM -BY-ITEM GUIDE TO THE MDS 3.0 This chapter provides item -by-item coding instructions for all required sections and items in the MDS Version 3.0 item set s. The goal of this chapter is to facilitate the accurate coding of the MDS resident assessment and to provide assessors with the rationale and resources to optimize resident care and outcomes. 3.1 Using this Chapter Throughout this chapter, MDS assessment sections are presented using a standard format for ease of review and instruction. In addition, screenshots of each section are available for illustration purposes. Note: There are images imbedded in this manual and if you are using a screen reader to acc ess the content contained in the manual you should refer to the MDS 3.0 item set to review the referenced information. The order of the sections is as follows: Intent. The reason(s) for including this set of assessment items in the MDS. Item Display. To facilitate accurate resident assessment using the MDS, each assessment section is accompanied by screen shots, which display the item from the MDS 3.0 item set. Item Rationale. The purpose of assessing this aspect of a resident's clinical or functional sta tus. Health- related Quality of Life. How the condition, impairment, improvement, or decline being assessed can affect a resident's quality of life, along with the importance of staff understanding the relationship of the clinical or functional issue relat ed to quality of life. Planning for Care. How assessment of the condition, impairment, improvement, or decline being assessed can contribute to appropriate care planning. Steps for Assessment. Sources of information and methods for determining the correct response for coding each MDS item. Coding Instructions. The proper method of recording each response, with explanations of individual response categories. Coding Tips and Special Populations. Clarifications, issues of note, and conditions to be considered when coding individual MDS items. Examples. Case examples of appropriate coding for most, if not all, MDS sections/items. Additional layout issues to note include (1) the symbol is displayed in all MDS 3.0 sections/items that require a resident interv iew, and (2) important definitions are highlighted in the columns, and these and other definitions of interest may be found in the glossary. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: Overview of Guide to MDS Items October 2019 Page 3- 2 3.2 Becoming Familiar with the MDS -recommended Approach 1. First, reading the Manual is essential. The CMS Long -Term Care Facility Resident Assessment Instrument User's Manual is the primary source of information for completing an MDS assessment. Notice how the manual is organized . Using it correctly will increase the accuracy of your assessments. While it is important to understand and apply the information in Chapter 3, facilities should also become familiar with Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. These Chapters provide the framework and supporting information for data collected on the item set as well as the process for further assessment and care planning. It is important to understand the entire process of the RAI in conjunction with the intent and rationale for coding items on the MDS 3.0 item set. Check the MDS 3.0 Web site regularly for updates at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient -Assessment - Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/MDS30RAIManual.html . If you require further assistance, submit your question to your State RAI Coordinator listed in Appendix B: State Agency and CMS Regional Office review the MDS item sets. Notice how sections are o rganized and where information should be recorded. Work through one section at a time. Examine item definitions and response categories as provided on the item sets, realizing that more detailed definitions and coding information is found in each Section o f Chapter 3 . There are several item sets, and depending on which item set you are completing, the skip patterns and items active for each item set may be different. 3. Complete a thorough review of Chapter 3. Review procedural instructions, time frames, and g eneral coding conventions. Become familiar with the intent of each item, rationale and steps for assessment. Become familiar with the item itself with its coding choices and responses, keep ing in mind the clarifications, issues of note, and other pertinent information needed to understand how to code the item. Do the definitions and instructions differ from current practice at your facility? Do your facility processes require updating to comply with MDS requirements? Complete a test MDS assessment for a resident at your facility. Enter the appropriate codes on the MDS. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: Overview of Guide to MDS Items October 2019 Page 3- 3 Make a note where your review could benefit from additional information, training , and using the varying skill sets of the interdisciplinary team. Be certain to explore resources available to you. As you are completing this test case, read th rough the instructions that apply to each section as you are completing the MDS. Work through the Manual and item set one section at a time until you are comfortable coding items . Make sure you understand this information before going on to another section. Review the test case you completed. Would you still code it the same way ? Are you surprised by any definitions, instructions, or case examples? For example, do you understand how to code ADLs? As you review the coding choices in your test case against the manual, make notations corresponding to the section(s) of this Manual where you need further clarification , or where questions arose. Note sections of the manual that help to clarify these coding and procedural questions. Would you now complete your initial case differently? It will take time to go through all this material. Do it slowly and carefully without rushing. Discuss any clarifications, questions or issues with your State RAI Coordinator (see Appendix B : State Agency and CMS Regional Office RAI/MDS Contacts available on Use of information in this chapter: Keep this chapter with you during the assessment process. Where clarification is needed , revie w the intent , rationale and specific coding instructions for each item in question. 3.3 Coding Conventions There are several standard conventions to be used when completing the MDS assessment, as follows. The standard look- back period for the MDS 3.0 is 7 days , unless otherwise stated. With the exception of certain items (e.g., some items in Sections K and O ), the look - back period does not extend into the preadmission period unless the item instructions state otherwise . In the case of reentry, the look -back period does not extend into time prior to the reentry, unless instructions state otherwise. When determining the response to items that have a look- back period to the Admission/Entry, Reentry, or Prior OBRA or schedule d PPS assessment, whichever is most recent, staff must only consider those assessments that are required to be submitted to the QIES ASAP system. PPS assessments that are completed for private insurance and Medicare Advantage Plans must not be submitted to the QIES ASAP system and therefore should not be considered when deter mining the \"prior assessment.\" There are a few instances in which scoring on one item will govern how scoring is completed for one or more additional items. This is called a skip patte rn. The instructions direct the assessor to \"skip\" over the next item (or several items) and go on to another. When you encounter a skip pattern, leave the item blank and move on to the next item as CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: Overview of Guide to MDS Items October 2019 Page 3-4 directed (e.g., item B0100, Comatose , directs the assesso r to skip to item G0110, Activities of Daily Living Assistance , if B0100 is answered code 1, yes. The intervening items from B0200-F0800 would not be coded (i.e. left blank). If B0100 was recorded as code 0, no, then the assessor would continue to code the MDS at the next item, B0200). Use a check mark for boxes where the instructions state to \"check all that apply,\" if specified condition is met; otherwise these boxes remain blank (e.g., F0800, Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences , boxes A- Z). Use a numeric response (a number or pre-assigned value) for blank boxes (e.g., M1030, Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers ). When completing hard copy forms to be used for data entry, capital letters may be easiest to read. Print legibly. When recording month, day, and year for dates, enter two digits for the month and the day and four digits for the year. For example, the third day of January in the year 2011 is recorded as: Almost all MDS 3.0 items allow a dash ( -) value to be entered and submitted to the MDS QIES ASAP system. \u2014 A dash value indicates that an item was not assessed. This most often occurs when a resident is discharged before the item could be assessed. \u2014 Dash values allow a partial assessment to be submitted when an assessment is required for payment purposes. \u2014 There are four date items (A2400C, O0400A6, O0400B6, and O0400C6) that use a dash-filled value to indicate that the event has not yet occurred. For example, if there is an ongoing Medicare stay, then the end date for that Medicare stay (A2400C) has not occurred, therefore, this item would be dash- filled. \u2014 The few items that do not allow dash values include identification items in Section A [e.g., Legal Name of Resident (Item A0500), Assessment Reference Date (Item A2300), Type of Assessment (Item A0310), and Gender (Item A0800)] and ICD diagnosis codes (Item I8000). All items for which a dash is not an acceptable value can be found on the CMS MDS 3.0 Technical Information web page at the following link: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient-Assessment - Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/NHQIMDS30TechnicalInformation.html . When the term \"phys ician\" is used in this manual, it should be interpreted as including nurse practitioners, physician assistant s, or clinical nurse specialist s, if allowable under state licensure laws and Medicare. Residents should be the primary source of information for r esident assessment items. Should the resident not be able to participate in the assessment, the resident's family, significant other, and guardian or legally authorized representative should be consulted. Several times throughout the manual the word \"signi ficant\" is used. The term may have different connotations depending on the circumstance in which it is used. For the MDS 3.0 , the term \"significant\" when discussing clinical, medical, or laboratory findings 01 03 2011 Month Day YearCMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: Overview of Guide to MDS Items October 2019 Page 3- 5 refers to measures of supporting evidence that a re considered when developing or assigning a diagnosis, and therefore reflects clinical judgment. When the term \"significant\" is used in discussing relationships between people, as in \"significant other,\" it means a person, who may be a family member or a close friend that is important or influential in the life of the resident. When complet ing the MDS 3.0, there are some items that require a count or measurement, how ever, there are instances where the actual results of the count or measurement are greater than the number of available boxes. For example, number of pressure ulcers, or weight. When the result of a count or measurement is greater than the number of available boxe s, facilities are instructed to maximize the count/measurement by placing a \"9\" in each box (e.g. , for item K0200B , if the weight was 1010 lbs , you would enter 999 in the available boxes). Even though the number is not exact, the facility should document the correct number in the resident's medical record and ensure that an appropriate plan of care is completed that addresses the additional counts/measurements. Section Title Intent A Identification Information Obtain key information to uniquely identify each resident, nursing home , type of record, and reasons for assessment.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -1 SECTION A : IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION Intent: The intent of this section is to obtain key information to uniquely identify each resident, the home in which he or she resides, and the reasons for assessment. A0050: Type of Record Coding Instructions for A0050, Type of Record Code 1, Add new record: if this is a new record that has not been previously submitted and accepted in the QIES ASAP system. If this item is coded as 1 , continue to A0100 Facility Provider Numbers. If there is an existing database record for the same resident, the same facility, the same reasons for assessment/tracking, and the same date (assessment reference date, entry date, or discharge date), then the current record is a duplicate and not a new record. In this case, the submitted record will be rejected and not accepted in the QI ES ASAP system and a \"fatal\" error will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. Code 2, Modify existing record: if this is a request to modify the MDS items for a record that already has been submitted and accepted in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System ( QIES ) Assessment Submission and Processing ( ASAP ) system. If this item is coded as 2 , continue to A0100, Facility Provider Numbers. When a modification reque st is submitted, the QIES ASAP system will take the following steps: 1. The system will attempt to locate the existing record in the QIES ASAP system for this facility with the resident, reasons for assessment/tracking, and date ( Assessment Reference D ate (ARD) , entry date, or discharge date) indicated in subsequent Section X items. 2. If the existing record is not found, the submitted modification record will be rejected and not accepted in the QIES ASAP system. A \"fatal\" error will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. 3. If the existing record is found, then the items in all sections of the submitted modification record will be edited. If there are any fatal errors, the modification record will be rejected and not accepted in the QIES ASAP system. The \"fatal\" error(s) will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. 4. If the modification record passes all the edits, it will replace the prior record being modified in the QIES ASAP system . The prior rec ord will be moved to a history file in the QIES ASAP system . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -2 A0050: Type of Record (cont.) Code 3, Inactivate existing record: if this is a request to inactivate a record that already has been submitted and accepted in the QIES ASAP system. If this item is coded as 3 , skip to X0150, Type of Provider. When an inactivation request is submitted, the QIES ASAP system will take the following steps: 1. The system will attempt to locate the existing record in the QIES ASAP system for this facility with the resident, reasons for assessment/tracking, and date ( ARD, entry date, or discharge date) indicated in subsequent Section X items. 2. If the existing record is not found in the QIES ASAP system , the submitted inactivation request will be rejected and a \"fatal\" error will be reported to the facility on the Final Validation Report. 3. All items in Section X of the submitted record will be edited. If there are any fatal errors, the current inactivati on request will be rejected and no record will be inactivated in the QIES ASAP system. 4. If the existing record is found, it will be removed from the active records in the QIES ASAP system and moved to a history file. Identification of Record to be Modifie d/Inactivated The Section X items from X0200 through X0700 identify the existing QIES ASAP system assessment or tracking record that is in error. In this section, reproduce the information EXACTLY as it appeared on the existing erroneous record, even if the information is incorrect. This information is necessary to locate the existing record in the database. Example: A MDS assessment for Joan L. Smith is submitted and accepted by the QIES ASAP system. A data entry error is then identified on the previously submitted and accepted record : The encoder mistakenly entered \"John\" instead of \"Joan\" when entering a prior assessment for Joan L. Smith. To correct this data entry error, the facility will modify the erroneous record and complete the items in Section X including items under Identification of Record to be Modified/Inactivated. When completing X0200A, the Resident First Name, \"John\" will be entered in this item. This will permit the MDS system to locate the previously submitted assessment that is being cor rected. If the correct name \"Joan\" were entered, the QIES ASAP system would not locate the prior assessment. The correction to the name from \"John\" to \"Joan\" will be made by recording \"Joan\" in the \"normal\" A0500A, Resident First Name in the modification r ecord. The modification record must include all items appropriate for that assessment, not just the corrected name. This modification record will then be submitted and accepted into the QIES ASAP system, which causes the desired correction to be made.

DEFINITION Part A PPS Discharge Assessment A discharge assessment developed to inform current and future Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program ( SNF QRP ) measures and the calculation of the se measures. The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is completed when a resident's Medicare Part A stay ends , but the resident remains in the facility; or may be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Part A stay ends on the same day or the day before the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -9 A0310: Type of Assessment (cont.) Codi ng Instructions for A0310G1, Is this a SNF Part A Interrupted Stay? Code 0, no: if the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A-covered stay) but did not resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window. Code 1, yes: if the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A- covered stay) but did resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window. Coding Tips Item A0310G1 indicates whether or not an interrupted stay occurred. The interrupted stay policy applies to residents who either leave the SNF, then return to the same SNF within the interruption window, or to residents who are discharged from Part A- covered services and remain in the SNF, but then resume a Part A- covered stay within the interruption window. DEFINITION S Interrupted Stay Is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A -covered stay) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A -covered stay during the interruption window. Interruption Window Is a 3 -day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A -covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non-covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A-covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A-covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -10 A0310: Type of Assessment (cont.) The following is a list of examples of an interrupted stay when the resident leaves the SNF and then returns to the same SNF to resume Part A- covered services within the interruption window. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: o Resident transfers to an acute care setting for evaluation or treatment due to a change in condition and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window . o Resident transfers to a psychiatric facility for evaluation or treatment and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. o Resident transfers to an outpatient facility for a procedure or treatment and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window . o Resident transfers to an assisted living facility or a private residence with home health services and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. o Resident leaves against medical advice and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. The following is a list of examples of an interrupted stay when the resident under a Part A-covered stay remains in the facility but the stay stops being covered under the Part A PPS benefit, and then resumes Part A-covered services in the SNF within the interruption window. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: o Resid ent elects the hospice benefit, thereby declining the SNF benefit, and then revokes the hospice benefit and resumes SNF -level care within the interruption window. o Resident refuses to participate in rehabilitation and has no other daily skilled need; this ends the Part A coverage. Within the interruption window, the resident decides to engage in the planned rehabilitation regime and Part A coverage resumes. o Resident changes payer sources from Medicare Part A to an alternate payer source (i.e. , hospice, private pay or private insurance) and then wishes to resume their Medicare Part A stay, at the same SNF, within the interruption window. If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF, and resumes a Part A-covered stay in the SNF w ithin the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. No discharge assessment (OBRA or Part A PPS) is required, nor is an Entry Tracking Record or 5-Day required on resumption. If a resident leaves the SNF and returns to resume Part A- covered service s in the same SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. Although this situation does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay, the resident left the SNF, and therefore an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. On return to the SNF, no 5-Day would be required. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -11 A0310: Type of Assessment (cont.) When an interrupted stay occurs, a 5-Day PPS assessment is not required upon reentry or resumption of SNF care in the same SNF, because an interrupted stay does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay. If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF and does not resume Part A-covered services within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, a Part A PPS Discharge is required. If the resident qualifies and there is a resumption of Part A services within the 30-day window allowed by Medicare, a 5- Day would be required as this would be considered a new Part A stay. The OBRA schedule would continue from the resident's original date of admission (item A1900). If a resident leaves the SNF and does not return to resume Part A-c overed services in the same SNF within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, both the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments are required (and may be combined). If the resident returns to the same SNF, this would be considered a new Part A stay. An Entry Tracking record and 5-Day would be required on re turn. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. The OBRA assessment schedule is unaffected by the interrupted stay policy. Please refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on OBRA assessment scheduling requirements. Coding Instructions for A0310H, Is this a Part A PPS Discharge Assessment? Code 0, no: if this is not a Part A PPS Discharge assessment . Code 1, yes: if this is a Part A PPS Discharge assessment . A Part A PPS Discharge assessment (NPE Item Set) is required under the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program (SNF QRP) when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends (as documented in A2400C, End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay) but the resident remains in the facility . If the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the day of or one day before the Discharge Date (A2000) , the OBRA Discharge assessment and Part A PPS Discharge assessment are both required and may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000) . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -12 A0410: Unit Certification or Licensure Designation Item Rationale In coding this item, the facility must consider its Medicare and/or Medicaid status as well as the state's authority to collect MDS records. State regulations may require submission of MDS data to the QIES ASAP system or directly to the state for residents residing in licensed -only beds. Nursing homes must be certain they are submitting MDS assessments to the QIES ASAP system for those residents who are on a Medicare and/or Medicaid certified unit. Swing bed facilities must be certain that they are submitting MDS assessments only for those residents whose stay is covered by Medicare Part A benefits. For those residents who are in licensed -only beds, nursing homes must be certain they are submitting MDS assessments either to QIES ASAP or directly to the state in accordance with state requirements. Payer source is not the determinant by which this item is coded. This item is coded solely according to the authority CMS has to collect MDS data for residents who are on a Medicare and/or Med icaid certified unit and the authority that the state may have to collect MDS data under licensure. Consult Chapter 5, page 5-1 of this Manual for a discussion of what types of records should be submitted to the QIES ASAP system . Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the nursing home administrator or representative which units in the nursing home are Medicare certified, Medicaid certified or dually certified (Medicare/Medicaid) . 2. If some or all of the units in the nursing home are neither Medica re nor Medicaid certified, ask the nursing home administrator or representative if there are units that are state licensed and if the state requires MDS submission for residents on that unit. 3. Identify all units in the nursing home that are not certified or licensed by the state, if any. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -13 A0410: Unit Certification or Licensure Designation (cont.) Coding Instructions Code 1, Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified and MDS data is not required by the State: if the MDS record is for a resident on a un it that is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified, and neither CMS nor the state has authority to collect MDS information for residents on this unit , the facility may not submit MDS records to QIES ASAP. If any record s are submitted under this certification designation , they will be rejected by the QIES ASAP system . Code 2, Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State: if the nursing home resident is on a unit that is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified, but the s tate has authority under s tate licensure to collect MDS information for residents on such units, the facility should submit the resident's MDS reco rds per the state's requirement to QIES ASAP or directly to the state . Note that this certification designation does not apply to swing -bed facilities. Assessments for swing -bed residents on which A0410 is coded \"2\" will be rejected by the QIES ASAP syste m. Code 3, Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified: if the resident is on a Medicare and/or Medicaid certified unit , regardless of payer source (i.e., even if the resident is private pay or has his/her stay covered under Medicare Advantage, Medicare HMO, private insurance, etc.), the facility is required to submit MDS records (OBRA and SNF PPS only) to QIES ASAP for these residents . Consult Chapter 5, page 5-1 of this Manual for a discussion of what types of records should be submitted to the QIES ASAP system. A0500: Legal Name of Resident Item Rationale Allows identification of resident. Also used for matching each of the resident's records . Steps for Assessment 1. Ask resident, family, significant other, guardian, or legally authorized representative. DEFINITION LEGAL NAME Resident's name as it appears on the Medicare card. If the resident is not enrolled in the Medicare program, use the resident's name as it appears on a Medicaid card or other government -issued document. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -14 A0500: Legal Name of Resident (cont.) 2. Check the resident's name on his or her Medicare card, or if not in the program, check a Medicaid card or other government -issued document. Coding Instructions Use printed letters. Enter in the following order: A. First Name B. Middle Initial (if the resident has no middle initial, leave Item A0500B blank; if the resident has two or more middle names, use the initial of the first middle name) C. Last Name D. Suffix (e.g., Jr./ Sr.) A0600: Social Security and Medicare Numbers Item Rationale Allows identification of the resident. Allows records for resident to be matched in system. Coding Instructions Enter the Social Security Number (SSN) in A0600A, one number per space starting with the leftmost space. If no SSN is available for the resident (e.g., if the resident is a recent immigrant or a child) the item may be left blank. Note: A valid SSN should be submitted in A0600A whenever it is available so that resident matching can be performed as accurately as possible. Enter Medicare number in A0600B exactly as it appears on the resident's documents. For PPS assessments (A0310B = 01 or 08), the Medicare nu mber (A0600B) must be present (i.e., may not be left blank). A0600B must be a Medicare number . DEFINITIONS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER A tracking number assigned to an individual by the U.S. Federal government for taxation, benefits, and identification purposes. MEDI CARE NUMBER An identifier assigned to an individual for participation in national health insurance program. The Medicare Health Insurance identifier is different from the resident's Social Security Number (SSN) and may con tain both letters and numbers. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -15 A0700: Medicaid Number Item Rationale Assists in correct resident identificatio n. Coding Instructions Record this number if the resident is a Medicaid recipient . Enter one number or letter per box beginning in the leftmost box. Recheck the number to make sure you have entered the digits correctly . Enter a \"+\" in the leftmost box if the number is pending. If you are notified later that the resident does have a Medicaid number, just include it on the next assessment. If not applicable because the resident is not a Medicaid recipient, enter \"N\" in the leftmost box. Coding Tips and Special Populations To obtain the Medicaid number, check the resident's Medicaid card, admission or transfer records, or medical record. Confirm that the resident's name on the MDS matches the resident's name on the Medicaid card. It is not necessary to process an MDS correction to add the Medicaid number on a prior assessment . However, a correction may be a State -specific requirement. A0800: Gender I tem Rationale Assists in correct identification . Provides demographic gender specific health trend information. Coding Instructions Code 1: if resident is male. Code 2: if resident is female. Coding Tips and Special Populations Resident gender on the MDS must match what is in the Social Security system. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -16 A0900: Birth Date Item Rationale Assists in correct identification. Allows determination of age. Coding Instructions Fill in the boxes with the appropriate birth date. If the complete birth date is known, do not leave any boxes blank. If the month or day contains only a single digit, fill the first box in with a \"0.\" For example: January 2, 1918, should be entered as 01- 02-1918. Sometimes, only the birth year or the birth year and birth month will be known. These situations are handled as follows: \u2014 If only the birth year is known (e.g., 1918), then enter the year in the \"year\" portion of A0900, and leave the \"month\" and \"day\" portions blank. If the birth year and birth month are known, but the day of the month is not known, then enter the year in the \"year\" portion of A0900, enter the month in the \"month\" portion of A0900, and leave the \"day\" portion blank. A1000: Race/Ethnicity I tem Rationale This item uses the common uniform language approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report racial and ethnic categories . The categories in this classification are social -political constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. Provides demographic race/ethnicity specific health trend information. These categories are NOT used to determine eligibility for participation in any Federal program. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -17 A1000: Race/Ethnicity (cont.) Steps for Assessment: Interview Instructions 1. Ask the resident to select the category or categories that most closely c orrespond to his or her race/ethnicity from the list in A1000. Individuals may be more comfortable if this and the preceding question are introduced by saying, \"We want to make sure that all our residents get the best care possible, regardless of their race or ethnic background. We would like you to tell us your ethnic and racial background so that we can review the treatment that all residents receive and make sure that everyone gets the highest quality of care\" (Baker et al., 2005). 2. If the resident is unable to respond, ask a family member or significant ot her. 3. Category definitions are provided to resident or family only if requested by them in order to answer the item. 4. Respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. 5. Only if the resident is unable to respond and no fami ly member or significant other is available, observer identification or medical record documentation may be used. Coding Instructions Check all that apply. Enter the race or ethnic category or categories the resident , family or significant other uses to identify him or her.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -18 A1100: Language Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Inability to make needs known and to engage in social interaction because of a language barrier can be very frustrating and can resu lt in isolation, depression, and unmet needs. Language barriers can interfere with accurate assessment. Planning for Care When a resident needs or wants an interpreter, the nursing home should ensure that an interpreter is available. An alternate method of communication also should be made available to help to ensure that basic needs can be expressed at all times, such as a communication board with pictures on it for the resident to point to (if able). Identifies residents who need interpreter services in order to answer interview items or participate in consent process. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident if he or she needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff . 2. If the resident is unable to respond, a family member or significant other should be asked. 3. If neither source is available, review record for evidence of a need for an interpreter. 4. If an interpreter is wanted or needed, ask for preferred language. 5. It is acceptable for a family member or significant o ther to be the interpreter if the resident is comfortable with it and if the family member or significant other will translate exactly what the resident says without providing his or her interpretation. Coding Instructions for A1100A Code 0, no: if the resident (or family or medical record if resident unable to communicate) indicates that the resident does not want or need an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff.

Coding Instructions for A1100B Enter the preferred language the resident primarily speaks or understands after interviewing the resident and family , observing the resident and listening, and reviewing the medical record. Coding Tips and Special Populations An organized system of signing such as American Sign Language (ASL) can be reported as the pref erred language if the resident needs or wants to communicate in this manner. A1200: Marital Status I tem Rationale Allows understanding of the formal relationship the resident has and can be important for care and discharge planning. Demographic information. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident about his or her marital status. 2. If the resident is unable to respond, ask a family member or other significant other. 3. If neither source can report, review the medical record for information. Coding Instructions Choose the answer that best describes the current marital status of the resident and enter the corresponding number in the code box: 1. Never Married 2. Married 3. Widowed 4. Separated 5. Divorced CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -20 A1300: Optional Resident Items Item Rationale Some facilities prefer to include the nursing home medical record number on the MDS to facilitate tracking. Some facilities conduct unit reviews of MDS items in addition to resident and nursing home level reviews. The unit may be indicated by the room number. Preferred name and lifetime occupation help nursing home staff members personalize their inter actions with the resident. Many people are called by a nickname or middle name throughout their life . It is important to call residents by the name they prefer in order to establish comfort and respect between staff and resident . Also, some cognitively imp aired or hearing impaired residents might have difficulty responding when called by their legal name, if it is not the name most familiar to them. Others may prefer a more formal and less familiar address . For example, a physician might appreciate being re ferred to as \"Doctor.\" Knowing a person's lifetime occupation is also helpful for care planning and conversation purposes. For example, a carpenter might enjoy pursuing hobby shop activities. These are optional items because they are not needed for CMS program function . Coding Instructions for A1300A , Medical Record Number Enter the resident's medical record number (from the nursing home medical record, admission office or Health Information Management Department) if the nursing home chooses to exercise this option. Coding Instructions for A1300B , Room Number Enter the resident's room number if the nursing home chooses to exercise this option. Coding Instructions for A1300C, Name by Which Resident Prefers to Be Addressed Enter the resident's preferred name .

Coding Instructions for A1300D, Lifetime Occupation(s) Enter the job title or profession that describes the resident's main occupation(s) before retiring or entering the nursing home. When two occupations are identified, place a slash (/) between each oc cupation. The lifetime occupation of a person whose primary work was in the home should be recorded as \"homemaker.\" For a resident who is a child or an intellectually disabled /developmentally disabled adult resident who has never had an occupation, record as \"none.\" A1500: Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life All individuals who are admitted to a Medicaid certified nursing facility , regardless of the individual's payment source, must have a Level I PASRR completed to screen for possible mental illness (MI), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disability (DD) , or related conditions (please contact your local State Medicaid Agency for details regarding PASRR requirements and exemptions). Individuals who have or are suspected to have MI or ID/DD or related conditions may not be admitted to a Medicaid -certified nursing facility unless approved through Level II PASRR determination. Those residents covered by Level II PASRR process may require certain care and services provided by the nursing home, and/or specialized services provided by the State. A resident with MI or ID /DD must have a Resident Review (RR) conducted when there is a significant change in the resident's physical or me ntal condition. Therefore, when an SCSA is completed for a resident with MI or ID /DD, the nursing home is required to notify the State mental health authority, intellectual disability or developmental disability authority (depending on which operates in their State ) in order to notify them of the resident's change in status. Section 1919(e)(7)(B)(iii) of the Social Security Act requires the notification or referral for a significant change. 1 1 The statute may also be referenced as 42 USC 1396r(e)(7)(B)(iii). Note that as of this revision date the statute supersedes Federal regulations at 42 CFR 483.114(c), which still reads as requiring annual resident review. The regulation has not yet been updated to reflect the statutory change to resident review upon significant change in condition. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -22 A1500: Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) (cont.) Each State Medicaid A gency might have specific processes and guidelines for referral, and which types of significant changes should be referred. Therefore, facilities should become acquainted with their own State requirements. Please see https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/ltss/institutional/pasrr/index.html for CMS information on PASRR. Planning for Care The Level II PASRR determination and the evaluation report specify services to be provided by the nursing home and/or speci alized services defined by the State. The State is responsible for providing specialized services to individuals with MI or ID/DD. In some States specialized services are provided to residents in Medicaid - certified facilities (in other States specialized services are only provided in other facility types such as a psychiatric hospital). The nursing home is required to provide all other care and services appropriate to the resident's condition. The services to be provided by the nursing home and/or specialized services provided by the State that are specified in t he Level II PASRR determination and the evaluation report should be addressed in the plan of care. Identifies individuals who are subject to Resident Review upon change in condition. Steps for Assessment 1. Complete if A0310A = 01, 03, 04 or 05 (Admission assessment, Annual assessment, SCSA , Significant Correction to P rior Comprehensive A ssessment). 2. Review the Level I PASRR form to determine whether a Level II PASRR was r equired. 3. Review the PASRR report provided by the State if Level II screening was required. Coding Instructions Code 0, no: and skip to A1550, Conditions Related to ID/DD Status, if any of the following apply: \u2014 PASRR Level I screening did not result in a referral for Level II screening, or \u2014 Level II screening determined that the resident does not have a serious MI and/or ID/DD or related conditions, or \u2014 PASRR screening is not required because the resident was admi tted from a hospital after requiring acute inpatient care, is receiving services for the condition for which he or she received care in the hospital, and the attending physician has certified before admission that the resident is likely to require less than 30 days of nursing home care. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -23 A1500: Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) (cont.)

Code 9, not a Medicaid- certified unit: if bed is not in a Medicaid- certified nursing home. Skip to A1550, Conditions Related to ID/DD Status. The PASRR process does not apply to nursing home units that are not certified by Medicaid (unless a State requires otherwise) and therefore the question is not applicable. \u2014 Note that the requirement is based on the certification of the part of the nursing home the resident will occupy . In a nursing home in which some parts are Medicaid certified and some are not, this question applies when a resident is admitted, or transferred t o, a Medicaid certified part of the building.

A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) Item Rationale To document the date this episode of care in this facility began. Coding Instructions Enter the date this episode of care in this facility began . Use the format : Month- Day- Year : XX -XX-XXXX. For example, October 12, 2010, would be entered as 10-12-2010. The Admission Date may be the same as the Entry Date (A1600) f or the entire stay (i.e., if the resident is never discharged). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -29 A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) (cont.) Examples 1. Mrs. H was admitted to the facility from an acute care hospital on 09/14/2013 for rehabilitation after a hip replacement. In completing her Admission assessment , the facility entered 09/1 4/2013 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 1, Admission; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800, Entered From; and entered 09/1 4/2013 in item A1900, Admission Date. 2. The facility received communication from an acute care hospital discharge planner stating that Mrs. H, a former resident of the facility who was discharged home return not anticipated on 11/02/2013 after a successful recovery and rehabilitation, was admitted to their hospital on 2/8/2014 and wished to return to the facility for rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Mrs. H returned to the facility on 2/15/2014. Although Mrs. H was a resident of the facility in September of 2013, she was discharged home return not anticipated ; therefore, the facility rightly considered Mrs. H as a new admission. In completing her Admission assessment, the facility entered 02/15/2014 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 1, Admission; c hose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800, Entered From ; and entered 02/15/2014 in item A1900, Admission Date. 3. Mr. K was admitted to the facility on 10/05/2013 and was discharged to the hospit al, return anticipated, on 10/20/2013. He returned to the facility on 10/26/2013. Since Mr. K was a resident of the facility , was discharged return anticipated , and returned within 30 days of discharge, Mr. K was considered as continuing in his current sta y. Therefore, when the facility completed his Entry Tracking Record on return from the hospital, they entered 1 0/26/2013 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 2, Reentry; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800; and entered 1 0/05/2013 in item A1900, Admi ssion Date. Approximately a month after his return, Mr. K was again sent to the hospital, return anticipated on 11/05/2013. He returned to the facility on 11/22/2013. Again, since Mr. K was a resident of the facility , was discharged return anticipated , and returned within 30 days of discharge, Mr. K was considered as continuing in his current stay. Therefore, when the facility completed his Entry Tracking Record, they entered 11/22/2013 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 2, Reentry; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800; and entered 10/05/2013 in item A1900, Admission Date. 4. Ms. S was admitted to the facility on 8/26/2014 for rehabilitation after a total knee replacement. Three days after admission, Ms. S spiked a fever and her surgical site was observed to have increased drainage, was reddened , swollen and extremely painful. The facility sent Ms. S to the emergency room and completed her OBRA D ischarge assessment as return anticipated . The hospital called the facility to inform t hem Ms. S was admitted . A week into her hospitalization, Ms. S developed a blood clot in her affected leg, further complicating her recovery. The facility was contacted to readmit Ms. S for rehabilitative services following discharge from the hospital on 10/10/2014. Even though Ms. S was a former patient in the facility's rehabilitation unit and was discharged CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -30 A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) (cont.) return anticipated, she did not return within 30 days of discharge to the hospital. Therefore, Ms. S is considered a new admission to the facility. On her return, when the facility completed Ms. S's Admission assessment, they entered 10/10/2014 in A1600, Entry Date; coded A1700 = 1, Admission; chose Code 03, acute hospital in item A1800, Entered From; and entered 10/10/2014 in item A1900, Admission Date. Coding Tips and Special Populations Both s wing bed facilities and nursing homes must apply the above instructions for coding items A1600 through A1900 to determin e whether a patient or resident is an admission/entry or reentry. In determining if a patient or resident returns to the facility within 30 days, the day of discharge from the facility is not counted in the 30 days. For example, a resident discharged return anticipated on December 1 would need to return to the facility by December 31 to meet the \"within 30 days \" requirement. If the Type of Entry for this assessment is an Admission (A1700 = 1), the Admission Date (A1900) and the Entry Date (A1600) must be the same. If the Type of Entry for this assessment is a Reentry (A1700 = 2), the Admission Date (A1900) will remain the same, and the Entry Date (A1600) must be later than the date in A1900. Item A1 900 (Admission Date) is tied to items A1600 (Entry Date), A1700 (Type of Entry) , and A1800 (Entered From). It is also tied to the concepts of a \"stay\" and an \"episode.\" A stay is a set of contiguous days in the facility and an episode is a series of one or more stays that may be separated by brief interruptions in the resident's time in the facility. An episode continues across stays until one of three events occurs: the resident is discharged with return not anticipated, the resident is discharged with ret urn anticipated but is out of the facility for more than 30 days, or the resident dies in the facility. A1900 (Admission Date) should remain the same on all assessments for a given episode even if it is interrupted by temporary discharges from the facility . If the resident is discharged and reenters within the course of an episode, that will start a new stay. The date in item A1600 (E ntry Date) will change, but the date in item A1900 (Admission Date) will remain the same. If the resident returns after a dis charge return not anticipated or after a gap of more than 30 days outside of the facility, a new episode would begin and a new admission would be required. When a resident is first admitted to a facility, item A1600 (Entry Date) should be coded with the date the person first entered the facility, and A1700 (Type of Entry) should be coded as 1, Admission. The place where the resident was admitted from should be documented in A1800 (Entered From), and the date in item A1900 (Admission Date) should match the date in A1600 (Entry Date). These items would be coded the same way for all subsequent assessments within the first stay of an episode. If the resident is briefly discharged (e.g., brief hospitalization) and then reenters the facility, a new (second) stay CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -31 A1900: Admission Date (Date this episode of care in this facility began) (cont.) would start, but the current episode would continue. On the Entry Tracking Record and on subsequent assessments for the second stay, the date in A1600 (Entry Date) would chang e depending on the date of reentry, and item A1700 (Type of Entry) would be coded as 2, Reentry. Item A1800 (Entered From) would reflect where the resident was prior to this reentry, and item A1900 (Admission Date) would continue to show the original admis sion date (the date that began his or her first stay in the episode). A2000: OBRA Discharge Date Item Rationale Closes the episode in the QIES ASAP system. Coding Instructions Enter the date the resident was discharged (whether or not return is anticipated). This is the date the resident leaves the facility. For OBRA Discharge assessments, the Discharge D ate (A2000) and ARD (A2300) must be the same date. Do not include leave of absence or hospital observational stay s less than 24 hours unless admitted to the hospital. Obtain data from the medical, admissions or transfer records. Coding Tips and Special Populations A Part A P PS Discharge assessment (NPE Item Set) is required under the SNF QRP when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident does not leave the facility. If a resident receiving services under SNF Part A PPS has a Discharge Date (A2000) that occurs on the day of or one day after the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C), then both an OBRA Discharge assessment and a Part A PPS Discharge assessment are required; but these two assessments may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -32 A2100: OBRA Discharge Status Item Rationale Demographic and outcome information. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record including the discharge plan and discharge orders for documentation of discharge location. Coding Instructions Select the 2 -digit code that corresponds to the resident's discharge status. Code 01, community (private home/apt., board/care, assisted living, group home): if discharge location is a private home, apartment, board and care, assisted living facility , or group home.

The hospice must be licensed by the State as a hospice provider and/or certified under the Medicare program as a hospice provider . Includes community- based (e.g., home) or inpatient hospice programs. Code 08, deceased: if resident is deceased. Code 09, long term care hospital (LTCH): if discharge location is an ins titution that is certified under Medicare as a short -term, acute -care hospital which has been excluded from the Inpatient Acute Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (IPPS) under \u00a71886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Social Security Act. For the purpose of Medicare payment, LTCHs are defined as having an average inpatient length of stay (as determ ined by the Secretary) of greater than 25 days. Code 99, other: if discharge location is none of the above. A2200: Previous Assessment Reference Date for Significant Correction Item Rationale To identify the ARD of a previous comprehensive (A0310 = 01, 03, or 04) or Quarterly assessment (A03 10A = 02) in which a significant error is discovered. Coding Instructions Complete only if A0310A = 05 (Significant Correction to P rior Comprehensive Assessment) or A0310A = 06 (Significant Correction to P rior Q uarterly A ssessment). Enter the ARD of the prior comprehensive or Q uarterly assessment in which a significant error has been identified and a correction is required. A2300: Assessment Reference Date CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -34 A2300: Assessment Reference Date (cont.) Item Rationale Designates the end of the look- back period so that all assessment items refer to the resident's status during the same period of time. As the last day of the look- back period, the ARD serves as the reference point for determining the care and services captured on the MDS assessment . Anything that happens after the ARD will not be captured on that MDS . For example, for a MDS item with a 7 -day look-back period, assessment information is collected for a 7 -day period ending on and including the ARD which is the 7th day of this look-back period. For an item with a 14 -day look- back period, the infor mation is collected for a 14 -day period ending on and including the ARD. The look-back period includes observations and events through the end of the day (midnight) of the ARD. Steps for Assessment 1. Interdisciplinary team members should select the ARD based on the reason for the assessment and compliance with all timing and scheduling requirements outlined in Chapter 2. Coding Instructions Enter the appropriate date on the lines provided. Do not leave any spaces blank. If the month or day contains only a single dig it, enter a \"0\" in the first space. Use four digits for the year. For example, October 2 , 2010, should be entered as: 10-02-2010. For detailed information on the timing of the assessments, see Chapter 2 on a ssessment s chedules . For discharge assessments, t he discharge date item (A2000) and the ARD item (A2300) must contain the same date. Coding Tips and Special Populations When the resident dies or is discharged prior to the end of the look-back period for a required assessment, the ARD must be adjusted to equal the discharge date. The look-back period may not be extended simply because a resident was out of the nursing home during part of the look-back period (e.g., a home visit, therapeutic leave, or hospital observation stay less than 24 hours when reside nt is not admitted ). For example, if the ARD is set at day 1 3 and there is a 2 -day temporary leave during the look- back period, the 2 leave days are still considered part of the look-back period. When collecting assessment information, data from the time period of the leave of absence is captured as long as the particular MDS item permits . For example, if the family takes the resident to the physician during the leave, the visit would be counted in Item O 0600, Physician Examination (if criteria are otherwi se met) . DEFINITION ASSESSMENT REFERENCE DATE (ARD) The specific end -point for the look-back periods in the MDS assessment process. Almost all MDS items refer to the resident's status over a designated time period referring back in time from the Assessment Reference Date (ARD). Most frequently, this look -back period, also called the observation or assessment period, is a 7- day period ending on the ARD. Look -back periods may cover the 7 days ending on this date, 14 days ending on this date, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -35 A2300: Assessment Reference Date (cont.) This requirement applies to all assessments, regardless of whether they are being completed for clinical or payment purposes. A2400: Medicare Stay It em Rationale Identifies when a resident is receiving services under the scheduled PPS. Identifies when a resident 's Medicare Part A stay begins and ends. The end date is used to determine if the resident 's stay qualifies for the short stay assessment. Coding Instructions for A2400A , Has the Resident Had a Medicare -covered Stay since the Most Recent Entry? Code 0, no: if the resident has not had a Medicare Part A covered stay since the most recent admissio n/entry or reentry. Skip to B0100, Comatose. Code 1, yes: if the resident has had a Medicare Part A covered stay since the most recent admission/ entry or reentry. Continue to A2400B. Coding Instructions for A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare Stay Code the date of day 1 of this Medicare stay if A2400A is coded 1, yes . Coding Instructions for A2400C, End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay Code the date of last day of this Medicare stay if A2400A is coded 1, yes . DEFINITIONS MOST RECENT MEDICARE STAY This is a Medicare Part A covered stay that has started on or after the most recent admission/entry or reentry to the nursing facility. MEDICARE -COVERED STAY Skilled Nursing Facility stays billable to Medicare Part A. Does not include stays billable to Medicare Advantage HMO plans. CURRENT MEDICARE STAY NEW ADMISSION: Day 1 of Medicare Part A stay. READMISSION: Day 1 of Medicare Part A coverage after readmission following a discharge. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2019 Page A -36 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) If the Medicare Part A stay is ongoing , there will be no end date to report . Enter dashes to indicate that the stay is ongoing. The end of Medicare date is coded as follows, whichever occurs first: \u2014 Date SNF benefit exhausts (i.e., the 100th day of the benefit ); or \u2014 Date of last day covered as recorded on the effective date from the Notice of Medicare Non -Coverage (NOMNC) ; or \u2014 The last paid day of Medicare A when payer source changes to another payer (regardless if the resident was moved to another bed or not); or \u2014 Date the resident was discharged from the facility (see Item A2000, Discharge D ate). Coding Tips and Special Populations When a resident on Medicare Part A returns following a therapeutic leave of absence or a hospital observation stay of less than 24 hours (without hospital admission) , this is a continuation of the Medicare Part A stay, not a new Medicare Part A stay. When a resident on Medicare Part A has an interrupted stay (i.e., is discharged from SNF care and subsequently readmitted to the same SNF within the interruption window after the discharge), this is a continuation of the Medicare Part A stay, not a new Medicare Part A stay. The E nd D ate of the Most Recent Medicare S tay (A2400C) may be earlier than the actual Discharge D ate (A2000) from the facility . If this occurs, the Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required. If the resident subsequently physically leaves the facility, the OBRA Discharge assessment would be required. If the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the day of or one day before the Discharge Date (A2000), the OBRA Discharge assessment and Part A PPS Discharge assessment are both required and may be combined. When the OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessments are combined, the ARD (A2300) must be equal to the Discharge Date (A2000) . If the End Date of Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) occurs on the same day that the resident dies, a Death in Facility Tracking Record is completed, with the Discharge Date (A2000) equal to the date the resident died. In this case, a Part A PPS Discharge assessment is not required. For a standalone Part A PPS Discharge ass essment, the End Date of the Most Recent Medicare Stay (A2400C) must be equal to the A RD (Item A2300). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -37 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) Examples 1. Mrs. G. began receiving services under Medicare Part A on October 14, 2016. Due to her stable condition and ability to manage her medications and dressing changes, the facility determined that she no longer qualified for Part A SNF coverage and began planning her discharge. An Advanced Beneficiary Notice (ABN) and an NOMNC with the last day of coverage as November 23, 2016 w ere issued. Mrs. G. was discharged home from the facility on November 24, 2016. Code the following on her combined OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge assessment : A0310F = 10 A0310G = 1 A0310H = 1 11-24-2016 11-23-2016 Rationale: Because Mrs. G's last day covered under Medicare was one day before her physical disc harge from the facility, a combined OBRA and Part A PPS Discharge was completed. 2. Mr. N began receiving services under Medicare Part A on December 11, 2019. He was unexpectedly sent to the emergency department on December 19, 2019 at 8:30 p.m . and was not admitted to the hospital. He returned to t he facility on December 20, 2019, at 11:00 a .m. Upon Mr. N's return, his physician's orders included significant changes in his treatment regime. The facility staff determined that an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) was indicated as the PDPM nursing component was impacted. They completed the IPA with an ARD of December 24, 2019. Code the following on the IPA: A2400A = 1 A2400B = 12-11- 2019 A2400C = ---------- Rationale: Mr. N was out of the facility at midnight but returned in less than 24 hours and was not admitted to the hospital, so was considered LOA. Therefore, no Discharge assessment was required. His Medicare Part A Stay is considered ongoing; therefore, the date in A2400C is dashed. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -38 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) 3. Mr. R. began receiving services under Medicare Part A on October 15, 2016. Due to complications from his recent surgery, he was unexpectedly discharged to the hospital for emergency surgery on October 20, 2016, but is expected to return within 30 days. Code the following on his OBRA Discharge assessment: A0310F = 11 A0310G = = 10-20-2016 Rationale: Mr. R's physical discharge to the hospital was unplanned, yet it is anticipated that he will return to the facility within 30 days. Therefore, only an OBRA Discharge was required. Even though only an OBRA Discharge was required, when the Date of the End of the Medicare Stay is on the day of or one day before the Date of Discharge, MDS specifications require that A0310H be coded as 1. 4. Mrs. K began receiving services under Medicare Part A on October 4, 2016 . She was discharged from Medicare Part A services on December 17, 2016. She and her family had already decided that Mrs. K would remain in the facility for long -term care services, and she was moved into a private room (which was dually certified) on December 18, 2016. Code the following on her Part A PPS Discharge assessment: A0310F = 99 A0310G = ^ A0310H = 1 = ^ A2100 = ^ 10-04-2016 A2400C = 12-17-2016 Rationale: Because Mrs. K's Medicare Part A stay ended, and she remained in the facility for long -term care services, a standalone Part A PPS Di scharge was required. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [A] October 2 019 Page A -39 A2400: Medicare Stay (cont.) 5. Mr. W began receiving services under Medicare Part A on November 15, 2016. His Medicare Part A stay ended on November 25, 2016, and he was unexpectedly discharged to the hospital on November 26, 2016. Ho wever, he is expected to return to the facility within 30 days. Code the following on his OBRA Discharge assessment: A0310F = 11 A0310G = = 11-25-2016 Rationale: Mr. W's Medicare stay ended the day before discharge and he is expected to return to the facility within 30 days. Because his discharge to the hospital was unplanned, only an OBRA Discharge assessment was required. Even though only an OBRA Discharge was required, when the Date of the End of the Medicare Stay is on the day of or one day before the Date of Discharge, MDS specifications require that A0310H be coded as 1 .

B0100: Comatose Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Residents who are in a coma or persistent vegetative state are at risk for the complications of immobility, including skin breakdown and joint contractures. Planning for Care Care planning should center on eliminating or minimizing complications and providing care consistent with the resident's health care goals. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record to determine if a neurological diagnosis of comatose or persistent vegetative state has been documented by a physici an, or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws. Coding I nstructions Code 0, no : if a diagnosis of coma or persistent vegetative state is not present during the 7 -day look-back period. Continue to B0200 Hearing . Code 1, yes : if the record indicates that a physician , nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist has documented a diagnosis of coma or persistent vegetative state that is applicable during the 7-day look- back period . Skip to Section G0110, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance . DEFINITION COMATOSE (coma) A pathological state in which neither arousal (wakefulness, alertness) nor awareness exists. The person is unresponsive and cannot be aroused; he/she does not open his/her eyes, does not speak and does not move his/her extremities on command or in response to noxious stimuli (e.g., pain). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-2 B0100: Comatose (cont.) Coding Tips Only code if a diagnosis of coma or persistent vegetative state has been assigned . For example, some residents in advanced stages of progressive neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease may have severe cognitive impairment, be non- communicative and sle ep a great deal of time; however, they are usually not comatose or in a persistent vegetative state , as defined here. B0200: Hearing Item Rational e Health -related Quality of Life Problems with hearing can contribute to sensory deprivation, social isolation, and mood and behavior disorders. Unaddressed communication problems related to hearing impairment can be mistaken for confusion or cognitive impairment. Planning for Care Address r eversible causes of hearing difficulty (such as cerumen impaction). Evaluate potential benefit from hearing assistance devices. Offer assistance to r esidents with hearing difficulties to avoid social isolation. DEFINITION PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE Sometimes residents who were comatose after an anoxic -ischemic injury (i.e., not enough oxygen to the brain) from a cardiac arrest, head trauma, or massive stroke, regain wakefulness but do not evidence any purposeful behavior or cognition. Their eyes are open, and they may grunt, yawn, pick with their fingers, and have random body movements. Neurological exam shows extensive damage to both cerebral hemispheres. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-3 B0200: Hearing (cont.) Consider other communication strategies for persons with hearing loss that is not reversible or is not completely corrected with hearing devices. Adjust environment by reducing background noise by lowering the sound volume on televisions or radios, because a noisy environment can inhibit opportunities for effective communication . Steps for Assessment 1. Ensure that the resident is using his or her normal hearing appliance if they have one. Hearing devices may not be as conventional as a hearing aid. Some residents by choice may use hearin g amplifiers or a microphone and headphones as an alternative to hearing aids. Ensure the hearing appliance is operational. 2. Interview the resident and ask about hearing function in different situations (e.g. hearing staff members , talking to visitors, using telephone, watching TV , attending activities). 3. Observe the resident during your verbal interactions and when he or she interacts with others throughout the day. 4. Think through how you can best communicate with the resident. For example, you may need to speak more clearly, use a louder tone, speak more slowly or use gestures. The resident may need to see your face to understand what you are saying, or you may need to take the resident to a quieter area for them to hear you. All of these are cues that there is a hearing problem. 5. Review the medical record. 6. Consult the resident 's family, direct care staff, activities personnel, and speech or hearing specialists. Coding Instructions Code 0, adequate: No difficulty in normal conversation, social interaction, or listening to TV . The resident hears all normal conversational speech and telephone conversation and announcements in group activities. Code 1, minimal difficulty : Difficulty in some environments (e.g., when a person speaks softly or the setting is noisy) . The resident hears speech at conversational levels but has difficulty hearing when not in quiet listening conditions or when not in one-on- one situations. The resident's hearing is adequate after environmental adjustments are made, such as reducing background noise by moving to a quiet room or by lowering the volume on television or radio. Code 2, moderate difficulty : Speaker has to increase volume and speak distinctly. Although hearing -deficient, the resident compensates when the speaker adjusts tonal quality and speaks distinctly; or the resident can hear only when the speaker's face is clearly visible. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-4 B0200: Hearing (cont.) Code 3, h ighly impaired: Absence of useful hearing . The resident hears only some sounds and frequently fails to respond even when the speaker adjusts tonal quality, speaks distinctly, or is positioned face- to-face. There is no comprehension of conversational speech, even when the speaker makes max imum adjustments. Coding Tips for Special Populations Residents who are unable to respond to a standard hearing assessment due to cognitive impairment will require alternate assessment methods. The resident can be observed in their normal environment. Does he or she respond (e.g., turn his or her head) when a noise is made at a normal level? Does the resident seem to respond only to specific noise in a quiet environment? Assess whether the resident responds only to loud noise or do they not respond at all. B0300: Hearing Aid Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Problems with hearing can contribute to social isolation and mood and behavior disorders. Many residents with impaired hearing could benefit from hearing aids or other hearing appliances . Many residents who own hearing aids do not have the hearing aids with them or have nonfunctioning hearing aids upon arrival. Planning for Care Knowing if a hearing aid was used when determining hearing ability allows better identification of evaluation and management needs. For residents with hearing aids, use and maintenance should be included in care planning. Residents who do not have adequate hearing without a hearing aid should be asked about history of hearing aid use. Residents who do not have adequate hearing despite wearing a hearing aid might benefit from a re -evaluation of the device or assessment for new causes of hearing impairment. Steps for Assessment 1. Prior to beginning the hearing assessment, ask the resident if he or she owns a hearing aid or other hearing appliance and, if so, whether it is at the nursing home. 2. If the resident cannot respond, write the question down and allow the resident to read it. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-5 B0300: Hearing Aid (cont.) 3. If the resident is still unable, check with family and care staff about hearing aid or other hearing appliances. 4. Check the medical record for evidence that the resident had a hearing appliance in place when hearing ability was recorded. 5. Ask staff and significant others whether the resident was using a hearing appliance when they observed hearing ability (above). Coding Instructions Code 0, no : if the resident did not use a hearing aid (or other hearing appliance) for the 7-day hearing assessment coded in B0200, Hearing . Code 1, y es: if the resident did use a hearing aid (or other hearing appliance) for the hearing assessment coded in B0200, Hearing . B0600: Speech Clarity Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Unclear speech or absent speech can hinder communication and be very frustrating to an individual. Unclear speech or absent speech can result in physical and psychosocial needs not being met and can contribute to depression and social isolation. Planning for Care If speech is absent or is not clear enough for the resident to make needs known, other methods of communication should be explored. Lack of speech clarity or ability to speak should not be mistaken for cognitive impairment. Steps for Assessment 1. Listen to the resident. 2. Ask primary assigned caregivers about the resident 's speech pattern. 3. Review the medic al record. DEFINITION SPEECH The verbal expression of articulate words. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-6 B0600: Speech Clarity (cont.) 4. Determine the quality of the resident 's speech, not the content or appropriateness\u2014just words spoken. Coding Instructions Code 0, clear speech: if the resident usually utters distinct, intelligible words . Code 1, u nclear speech: if the resident usually utters slurred or mumbled words. Code 2, n o speech: if there is an absence of spoken words. B0700: Makes Self Understood Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Problems making self understood can be very frustrating for the resident and can contribute to social isolation and mood and behavior disorders. Unaddressed communication problems can be inappropriately mistaken for confusion or cognitive impairment. Planning for Care Ability to make self under stood can be optimized by not rushing the resident, breaking longer questions into parts and waiting for reply, and maintaining eye contact (if appropriate). If a resident has difficulty making self understood: \u2014 Identify the underlying cause or causes. \u2014 Identify the best methods to facilitate communication for that resident. DEFINITION MAKES SELF UNDERSTOOD Able to express or communicate requests, needs, opinions, and to conduct social conversation in his or her primary language, whether in speech, writing, sign language, gestures, or a combination of these. Deficits in the ability to make one's self understood (expressive communication deficits) can include reduced voice volume and difficulty in producing sounds, or difficulty in finding the right word, making sentences, writing, and/or gesturing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-7 B0700: Makes Self Understood (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Assess using the resident 's preferred language or method of communication. 2. Interact with the resident. Be sure he or she can hear you or have access to his or her preferred method for communication. If the resident seem s unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing , sign language, or using cue cards. 3. Observe his or her interactions with others in differe nt settings and circumstances . 4. Consult with the primary nurse assistants (over all shifts) and the resident 's family a nd speech -language pathologist. Coding Instructions Code 0, u nderstood : if the resident expresses requests and ideas clearly. Code 1, u sually understood: if the resident has difficulty communicating some words or finishing thoughts but is able if prompted or given time . He or she may have delayed responses or may require some prompting to make self understood. Code 2, s ometimes understood: if the resident has limited ability but is able to express concrete requests regarding at least basic needs (e.g., food, drink, sleep, toilet). Code 3, rarely or n ever understood: if, at best, the resident's understanding is limited to staff interpretation of highly individual, resident-specific sounds or body language (e.g., indicated presence of pain or need to toilet). Coding Tips and Special Populations This item cannot be coded as Rarely/Never Understood if the resident completed any of the resident interviews, as th e interviews are conducted during the look-back period for this item and should be factored in when determining the residents' ability to make self understood during the entire 7-day look-back period. While B0700 and the resident interview items are not directly dependent upon one another, inconsistencies in coding among these items should be evaluated. B0800: Ability to Understand Others CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-8 B0800: Ability to Understand Others (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Inability to understand direct person- to-person communication \u2014 Can severely limit association with others . \u2014 Can inhibit the individual's ability to follow instructions that can affect health and safety . Planning for Care Thorough assessment to determine underlying cause or causes is critical in order to develop a care plan to address the individual's specific deficits and needs. Every effort should be made by the facility to provide information to the resident in a consistent manner that he or she understands based on an individualized assessment. Steps for Assessment 1. Assess in the resident 's preferred language or preferred method of communication. 2. If the resident uses a hearing aid, hearing device or other communications enhancement device, the resident should use that device during the evaluation of the resident' s understanding of person- to-person communication. 3. Interact with the resident and observe his or her understanding of other' s communication. 4. Consult with direct care staff over all shifts , if possible, the resident' s family , and speech - language path ologist (if involved in care). 5. Review the medical record for indications of how well the resident understands others. Coding Instructions Code 0, u nderstands : if the resident clearly comprehends the message(s) and demonstrates comprehension by words or actions/behaviors. Code 1, u sually understands : if the resident miss es some part or intent of the message but comprehends most of it. The resident may have periodic difficulties integrating information but generally demonstrates comprehension by responding in words or actions. Code 2, s ometimes understands : if the resident demonstrates frequent difficulties integrating information, and responds adeq uately only to simple and direct questions or DEFINITION ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND OTHERS Comprehension of direct person- to-person communication whether spoken, written, or in sign language or Braille. Includes the resident's ability to process and understand language. Deficits in one's ability to understand (receptive communication deficits) can involve declines in hearing, comprehension (spoken or written) or recognition of facial expressions. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-9 B0800: Ability to Understand Others (cont.) instructions. When staff rephrase or simplif y the message(s) and/or use gestures, the resident's comprehension is enhanced. Code 3, rarely/ never understands : if the resident demonstrates very limited ability to understand communication. Or, if staff ha ve difficulty determining whether or not the resident comprehends messages, based on verbal and nonverbal responses. Or, the resident can hear sounds but does not unders tand messages. B1000: Vision Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A person's reading vision often diminishes over time. If uncorrected, vision impairment can limit the enjoyment of everyday activities such as reading newspapers, books or correspondence, and maintaining and enjoying hobbies and other activities. It also limits the ability to manage personal business, such as reading and signing consent forms. Moderate, high or severe impairment can contribute to sensory deprivation, social isolation , and depressed mood. Planning for Care Reversible causes of vision impairment should be sought. Consider whether simple environment al changes such as better lighting or magnifiers would improve ability to see. Consider large print reading materials for persons with impaired vision. For residents with moderate, high, or severe impairment, consider alternative ways of providing access to content of desired reading materials or hobbies. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask direct care staff over all shifts if possible about the resident's usual vision patterns during the 7 -day look-back period (e.g., is the resident able to see newsprint, menus, gree ting cards ?). 2. Then ask the resident about his or her visual abilities. 3. Test the accuracy of your findings: DEFINITION ADEQUATE LIGHT Lighting that is sufficient or comfortable for a person with normal vision to see fine detail. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-10 B1000: Vision (cont.) Ensure that the resident's customary visual appliance for close vision is in place (e.g., eyeglass es, magnifying glass). Ensure adequate lighting. Ask the resident to look at regular-size print in a book or newspaper. Then ask the resident to read aloud, starting with larger headlines and ending with the finest, smallest print. If the resident is unable to read a newspaper, provide material with larger print, such as a flyer or large textbook. When the resident is unable to read out loud (e.g. due to aphasia, illiteracy), you should test this by another means such as, but not limited to: \u2014 Substituting numbers or pictures for words that are displayed in the appropriate print size (regular -size print in a book or newspaper). Coding Instructions Code 0, a dequate: if the resident sees fine detail, including regular print in newspapers/books. Code 1, impaired: if the resident sees large print, but not regular print in newspapers/books. Code 2, moderately impaired: if the resident has limited vision and is not able to see newspaper headlines but can identify objects in his or her environment. Code 3, h ighly impaired: if the resident's ability to identify objects in his or her environment is in question, but the resident's eye movements appear to be following objects (especially people walking by). Code 4, s everely impaired: if the resident has no vision, sees only light, col ors or shapes, or does not appear to follow objects with eyes . Coding Tips and Special Populations Some residents have never learned to read or are unable to read English. In such cases, ask the resident to read numbers, such as dates or page numbers, or t o name items in small pictures . Be sure to display this information in two sizes (equivalent to regular and large print). If the resident is unable to communicate or follow your directions for testing vision, observe the resident 's eye movements to see if his or her eyes seem to follow movement of objects or people. These gross measures of visual acuity may assist you in assessing whether or not the resident has any visual ability. For residents who appear to do this, code 3, highly impaired . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-11 B1200: Corrective Lenses Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Decreased ability to see can limit the enjoyment of everyday activities and can contribute to social isolation and mood and behavior disorders. Many residents who do not have corrective lenses could benefit from them, and others have corrective lenses that are not sufficient. Many persons who benefit from and own visual aids do not have them on arrival at the nursing home. Planning for Care Knowing if corrective lenses were used when determining ability to see allows better identification of evaluation and management needs. Residents with eyeglass es or other visual appliances should be assisted in accessing them. Use and maintenance should be included in care planning. Residents who do not have adequate vision without eyeglass es or other visual appliances should be asked about history of corrective lens use. Residents w ho do not have adequate vision, despite using a visual appliance, might benefit from a re -evaluation of the appliance or assessment for new causes of vision impairment. Steps for Assessment 1. Prior to beginning the assessment, ask the resident whether he or she uses eyeglasses or other vision aids and whether the eyeglasses or vision aids are at the nursing home. Visual aids do not include surgical lens implants. 2. If the resident cannot respond, check with family and care staff about the resident 's use of vision aids during the 7-day look- back period . 3. Observe whether the resident used eye glasses or other vision aids during reading vision test (B1000). 4. Check the medical record for evidence that the resident used corrective lenses when ability to see was recorded. 5. Ask st aff and significant others whether the resident was using corrective lenses when they observed the resident 's ability to see. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [B] October 2019 Page B-12 B1200: Correct ive Lenses (cont.) Coding Instructions Code 0, no: if the resident did not use eye glasses or other vision aid during the B1000, Vision assessment. Code 1, yes: if corrective lenses or other visual aids were used when visual ability was assessed in completing B1000, Vision . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-1 SECTION C: COGNITIVE PATTERNS Intent: The items in this section are intended to determine the resident's attention, orientation and ability to register and recall new information. These items are crucial factors in many care - planning decisions. C0100: Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Most residents are able to attempt the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS). A structured cognitive test is more accu rate and reliable than observation alone for observing cognitive performance. \u2014 Without an attempted structured cognitive interview, a resident might be mislabeled based on his or her appearance or assumed diagnosis. \u2014 Structured interviews will efficiently pr ovide insight into the resident's current condition that will enhance good care. Planning for Care Structured cognitive interviews assist in identifying needed supports. The structured cognitive interview is helpful for identifying p ossible delirium behavi ors (C1310). Steps for Assessment 1. Interact with the resident using his or her preferred language. Be sure he or she can hear you and/or has access to his or her preferred method for communication. If the resident appears unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. 2. Determine if the resident is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing , or using another method. If rarely/never understood, skip to C0700-C1000, Staff Assessment of Mental Status. 3. Review Language item (A1100), to determine if the resident needs or wants an interpreter. If the resident needs or wants an interpreter, complete the interview with an interpreter. Coding Instructions Code 0, n o: if the interview should not be conducted because the resident is rarely/never understood; cannot respond verbally, in writing , or using another method; or an interpreter is needed but not available. Skip to C0700, Staff Assessment of Mental Status. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-2 C0100: Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? (cont.) Code 1, y es: if the interview should be conducted because the resident is at least sometimes understood verbally, in writing , or using another method, and if an interpreter is needed, one is ava ilable . Proceed to C 0200, Repetition of Three Words. Coding Tips Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look-back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident needs an interpreter, every effort should be made to have an interprete r present for the BIMS. If it is not possible for a needed interpreter to participate on the day of the interview, code C 0100 = 0 to indicate interview not attempted and complete C0700-C1000, Staff Assessment of Mental Status , instead of C0200-C0500, Brief Interview for Mental Status . Includes residents who use American Sign Language (ASL). If the resident interview was not conducted within the look-back period (preferably the day before or the day of) the ARD, item C0100 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \"- \") entered in the resident interview items. Do not complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status items (C0700 -C1000) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. Because a PDPM cognitive level is utilized in the speech language pathology (SLP) payment component of PDPM, only in the case of PPS assessments, staff may complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for an interviewable resident when the resident is unexpectedly discharged from a Part A stay prior to the completion of the BIMS. In this case, the assessor should enter 0, No in C0100: Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? and proceed to the Staff Assessment for Mental Status . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-3 C0200-C0500: Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-4 C0200-C0500: Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Direct or performance -based testing of cognitive function decreases the chance of incorrect labeling of cognitive ability and improves detection of delirium. Cognitively intact residents may appear to be cognitively impaired because of extreme frailty, hearing impairment or lack of interaction. Some residents may appear to be more cognitively intact than the y actually are. When cognitive impairment is incorrectly diagnosed or missed, appropriate communication, worthwhile activities and therapies may not be offered. A resident's performance on cognitive tests can be compared over time. \u2014 If performance worsens, then an assessment for delirium and or depression should be considered. The BIMS is an opportunity to observe residents for signs and s ymptoms of delirium (C1310). Planning for Care Assessment of a resident's mental state provides a direct understanding of resident function that may: \u2014 enhance future communication and assistance and \u2014 direct nursing interventions to facilitate greater independence such as posting or providing reminders for self -care activities. A resident's performance on cognit ive tests can be compared over time. \u2014 An abrupt change in cognitive status may indicate delirium and may be the only indication of a potentially life threatening illness. \u2014 A decline in mental status may also be associated with a mood disorder. Awareness of p ossible impairment may be important for maintaining a safe environment and providing safe discharge planning. Steps for Assessment : Basic Interview Instructions for BIMS (C0200 - C0500) 1. Refer to Appendix D for a review of basic approaches to effective interviewing techniques. 2. Interview any resident not screened out by Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? (Item C0100). 3. Conduct the interview in a private setting. 4. Be sure the resident can hear you. Residents with hearing impairment should be tested using their usual communication devices/techniques, as applicable. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-5 C0200-C0500: Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) (cont.) Try an external assistive device (headphones or hearing amplifier ) if you have any doubt about hearing ability. Minimize background noise. 5. Sit so that the resident can see your face. Minimize glare by directing light sources away from the resident's face. 6. Give an introduction before starting the interview. Suggested language : \"I would like to ask you some questions. We ask everyone these same questions. This will help us provide you with better care. Some of the questions may seem very easy, while others may be more difficult.\" 7. If the resident expresses concern that you are testing his or her memory, he or she may be more comfortable if you reply: \"We ask these questions of everyone so we can make sure that our care will meet your needs.\" 8. Directly ask the resident each item in C0200 through C0400 at one sitting and in the order provided. 9. If the resident chooses not to ans wer a particular item, accept his or her refusal and move on to the next questions. For C0200 through C0400, code refusals as incorrect. Coding Instructions See coding instructions for individual items. Coding Tips On occasion, the interviewer may not be a ble to state the items clearly because of an accent or slurred speech . If the interviewer is unable to pronounce any cognitive items clearly, have a different staff member complete the BIMS . Nonsensical responses should be coded as zero. Rules for stopping the i nterview before it is complete: \u2014 Stop the interview after completing (C 0300C ) \"Day of the Week \" if: 1. all responses have been nonsensical (i.e., any response that is unrelated, incomprehensible, or incoherent; not informative with respect to the item being rated ), OR 2. there has been no verbal or written response to any of the questions up to this point, OR 3. there has been no verbal or written response to some questions up to this point and for all others, the resident has given a nonsensical response. If the interview is stopped, do the following: 1. Code -, dash in C0400A, C0400B, and C0400C. 2. Code 99 in the summary score in C0500. 3. Code 1, yes in C0600 Should the Staff Assessment for Mental Status (C0700- C1000) be Conducted? 4. Complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-6 C0200-C0500: Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) (cont.) When staff identify that the resident's primary method of communication is in written format, the BIMS can be administered in writing. The administration of the BIMS in writing should be limited to this circumstance. See Appendix E for details regarding how to administer the BIMS in writing. Examples of Incorrect and Nonsensical Responses 1. Interviewer asks resident to state the year . The resident replies that it is 1935 . This answer is incorrec t but related to the question. Coding: This answer is coded 0, incorrect but would NOT be considered a nonsensical response . Rationale: The answer is wrong, but it is logical and relates to the question. 2. Interviewer asks resident to state the year . The resident says, \"Oh what difference does the year make when you're as old as I am?\" The interviewer asks the resident to try to name the year, and the resident shrugs. Coding: This answer is coded 0, incorrect but would NOT be considered a nonsensical response . Rationale: The answer is wrong because refusal is considered a wrong answer, but the resident's comment is logical and clearly relates to the question. 3. Interviewer asks the resident to name the day of the week. R esident answers, \"Sylvia, she's my daughter.\" Coding: The answer is coded 0, incorrect ; the response is illogical and nonsensical. Rationale: The answer is wrong, and the resident's comment clearly does not relate to the question; it is nonsensical. C0200: Repetition of Three Words DEFINITION NONSENSICAL RESPONSE Any response that is unrelated, incomprehensible, or incoherent; it is not informative with respect to the item being rated. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-7 C0200: Repetition of Three Words (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Inability to repeat three words on first attempt may indicate: \u2014 a hearing impairment, \u2014 a language barrier, or \u2014 inattention that may be a sign of delirium. Planning for Care A cue can assist learning. Cues may help residents with memory impairment who can store new information in their memory but who have trouble retrieving something that was stored (e.g., not able to remember someone's name but can recall if given part of the first name). Staff can use cues when assisting residents with learning and recall in therapy, and in daily and restorative activities. Steps for Assessment Basic BIMS interview instructions are shown on page s C-3 and C-4. In addition, for repetition of three words: 1. Say to the resident: \"I am going to say three words for you to remember. Please repeat the words after I have said all three. The words are: sock, blue, and bed.\" Interviewers need to use the words and related category cues as indicated. If the interview is being conducted with an interpreter present, the interpreter should use the equivalent words and similar, relevant prompts for category cues. 2. Immediately after presenting the three words, say to the resident : \"Now please tell me the three words.\" 3. After the resident's first attempt to repeat the items: If the resident correctly stated all three words, say , \"That's right, the words are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture\" [category c ues]. Category cues serve as a hint that helps prompt residents' recall ability . Putting words in context stimulates learning and fosters memory of the words that residents will be asked to recall in item C0400, even among residents able to repeat the words immediately. If the resident recalled two or fewer words, say to the resident: \"Let me say the three words again. They are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture. Now tell me the three words.\" If the resident still does not recall all three words correctly, you may repeat the words and category cues one more time . DEFINITION CATEGORY CUE Phrase that puts a word in context to help with learning and to serve as a hint that helps prompt the resident. The category cue for sock is \"something to wear.\" The category cue for blue is \"a color.\" For bed, the category cue is \"a piece of furniture.\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-8 C0200: Repetition of Three Words (cont.) If the resident does not repeat all three words after three attempts, re -assess ability to hear. If the resident can hear, move on to the next question. If he or she is unable to hear, attempt to maximize hearing (alter environment, use hearing amplifier) before proceeding. Coding Instructions Record the maximum number of words that the resident correctly repeated on the first attempt. This will be any number between 0 and 3. The words may be recalled in any order and in any context. For example, if the words are repeated back in a sentence, they would be counted as repeating the words. Do not score the number of repeated words on the second or third attempt. These attempts help with learning the item, but only the number correct on the first attempt go into the total score. Do not record the number of attempts that the resident needed to complete. Code 0, n one: if the resident did not repeat any of the 3 words on the first attempt. Code 1, o ne: if the resident repeated only 1 of the 3 words on the first attempt. Code 2, two: if the resident repeated only 2 of the 3 words on the first attempt. Code 3, three: if the resident repeated al l 3 words on the first attempt. Coding Tips On occasion, the interviewer may not be able to state the words clearly because of an accent or slurred speech. If the interviewer is unable to pronounce any of the 3 words clearly, have a different staff member conduct the i nterview. Examples 1. The interviewer says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The resident replies, \"B ed, sock, and blue.\" The interviewer repeats the three words with category cues, by saying, \"That's right, the words are sock, something to wear; blue , a color; and bed, a piece of furniture.\" Coding: C0200 would be coded 3, three words correct. Rationale: The resident repeated all three items on the first attempt. The order of repetition does not affect the score. 2. The interviewer says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The resident replies, \"Sock, bed, black.\" The interviewer repeats the three words plus the category cues, saying, \"Let me say the three words again. They are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture. Now tell me the three words.\" The resident says , \"Oh yes, that's right, sock, blue, bed.\" Coding: C0200 would be coded 2, two of three words correct. Rationale: The resident repeated two o f the three items on the first attempt. Residents are scored based on the first attempt. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-9 C0200: Repetition of Three Words (cont.) 3. The interviewer says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The resident says, \"Blue socks belong in the dresser.\" The interviewer repeats the three words plus the category cues. Coding: C0200 would be coded 2, two of the three words correct. Rationale: The resident repeated tw o of the three items \u2014blue and sock. The resident put the words into a sentence, resulting in the resident repeating two of the three words. 4. The interviewer says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The resident replies, \"What were those three words?\" The interviewer repeats the three words plus the category cues. Coding: C0200 would be coded 0, none of the words correct. Rationale: The resident did not repeat any of the three words after the first time the interviewer said them . C0300: Temporal Orientation (Orientation to Year, Month, and Day) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A lack of temporal orientation may lead to decreased communication or participation in activities. Not being oriented may be frustrating or frightening. Planning for Care If staff know that a resident has a problem with orientation , they can provide reorientation aids and verbal reminders that may reduce anxiety . DEFINITION TEMPORAL ORIENTATION In general, the ability to place oneself in correct time. For the BIMS, it is the ability to indicate the correct date in current surroundings. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-10 C0300: Temporal Orientation (Orientation to Year, Month, and Day) (cont.) Reorienting those who are disoriented or at risk of disorientation may be useful in treating symptoms of delirium. Residents who are not oriented may need further assessment for delirium, especially if this fluctuates or is recent in onset. Steps for Assessment Basic BIMS interview instructions are shown on pages C-3 and C-4. 1. Ask the resident each of the 3 questions in I tem C 0300 separately . 2. Allow the resident up to 30 seconds for each answer and do not provide clues. 3. If the resident specifically asks for clues (e.g., \"is it bingo d ay?\") respond by saying, \"I need to know if you can answer this question without any help from me.\" Coding Instructions for C0300A , Able to Report Correct Year Code 0, missed by >5 years or no answer: if the resident's answer is incorrect and is greater than 5 years from the current year or the resident chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, missed by 2 -5 years : if the resident's answer is incorrect and is within 2 to 5 years from the current year. Code 2, missed by 1 year: if the resident's answer is incorrect and is within one year from the current year. Code 3, c orrect: if the resident states the correct year . Examples 1. The date of interview is May 5, 2011. The resident, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is 20 11. Coding: C0300A would be coded 3, correct . Rationale: 2011 is the current year. 2. The date of interview is June 16, 2011. The resident, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is 20 07. Coding: C0300A would be coded 1, missed by 2- 5 years . Rationale: 2007 is within 2 to 5 years of 2011. 3. The date of interview is January 10, 2011. The resident, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is 19 11. Coding: C0300A would be coded 0, missed by more than 5 years . Rationale: Even though the '11 part of the year would be correct, 1911 is more than 5 years from 2011. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-11 C0300: Temporal Orientation (Orientation to Year, Month, and Day) (cont.) 4. The date of interview is April 1, 2011. The resident, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is \"'11\". The interviewer asks, \"Can you tel l me the full year?\" The resident still responds \" '11,\" and the interviewer asks again, \"Can you tell me the full year, for example, nineteen -eighty -two.\" The resident states , \"2011.\" Coding: C0300A coded 3, correct . Rationale: Even though '11 is partially correct, the only correct answer is the exact year. The resident must state \"20 11,\" not \"'11\" or \"1811\" or \"1911.\" Coding Instructions for C0300B, Able to Report Correct Month Count the current day as day 1 when determining whether the response was accurate within 5 days or missed by 6 days to 1 month. Code 0, missed by >1 month or no answer: if the resident's answer is incorrect by more than 1 month or if the resident chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, missed by 6 days to 1 month: if the resident's answer is accurate within 6 days to 1 month. Code 2, a ccurate within 5 days: if the resident's answer is accurate within 5 days, count current date as day 1. Coding Tips In most instances, it will be immediately obvious which code to select . In some cases, you may need to write the resident's response in the margin and go back later to count days if you are unsure whether the date given is within 5 days. Examples 1. The date of interview is June 25, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is June. Coding: C0300B would be coded 2, accurate within 5 days . Rationale: The resident correctly stated the month. 2. The date of interview is June 28, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is July. Coding: C0300B would be coded 2, accurate within 5 days . Rationale: The resident correctly stated the month within 5 days, even though the correct month is June. June 28th (day 1) + 4 more days is July 2nd, so July is within 5 days of the interview. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-12 C0300: Temporal Orientation (Orientation to Year, Month, and Day) (cont.) 3. The date of interview is June 25, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is July. Coding : C0300B would be coded 1, missed by 6 days to 1 month . Rationale : The resident missed the correct month by six days. June 25th (day 1) + 5 more days = June 30th. Therefore, the resident's answer is incorrect within 6 days to 1 month. 4. The date of interview is June 30, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is August. Coding: C0300B would be coded 0, missed by more than 1 month . Rationale: The resident missed the month by more than 1 month. 5. The date of interview is June 2, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is May. Coding: C0300B would be coded 2, accurate within 5 days . Rationale: June 2 minus 5 days = May 29th. The resident correctly stated the month within 5 days even though the current month is June. Coding Instructions for C0300C. Able to Report Correct Day of the Week Code 0, incorrect, or no answer: if the answer is incorrect or the resident chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, c orrect: if the answer is correct . Examples 1. The day of interview is Monday, June 25, 2011. The interviewer asks : \"What day of the week is it today?\" The resident responds, \"It's Monday.\" Coding: C0300C would be coded 1, correct . Rationale: The resident correctly stated the day of the week. 2. The day of interview is Monday, June 25, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What day of the week is it today?\" states , \"Tuesday.\" Coding: C0300C would be coded 0, incorrect . Rationale: The resident incorrectly stated the day of the week. 3. The day of interview is Monday, June 25, 2011. The resident, responding to the question, \"What day of the week is it today?\" states, \"To day is a good day.\" Coding: C0300C would be coded 0, incorrect . Rationale: The resident did not answer the question correctly. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-13 C0400: Recall Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Many persons with cognitive impairment can be helped to recall if provided cues. Providing memory cues can help maximize individual function and decrease frustration for those residents who respond. Planning for Care Care plans should maximize use of cueing for resident who respond to recall cues. This will enh ance independence. Steps for Assessment Basic BIMS interview instructions are shown on pages C-3 and C-4. 1. Ask the resident the following : \"Let's go back to an earlier question. What were those three words that I asked you to repeat?\" 2. Allow up to 5 seconds for spontaneous recall of each word. 3. For any word that is not correctly recalled after 5 seconds, provide a category cue (refer to \"Steps for Assessment, \" pages C-6-C-7 for the definition of category cue). Category cues should be used only after the resident is unable to recall one or more of the three words. 4. Allow up to 5 seconds after category cueing for each missed word to be recalled. Coding Instructions For each of the three words the resident is asked to remember: Code 0, no\u2014could not recall : if the resident can not recall the word even after being given the category cue or if the resident responds with a nonsensical answer or chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, y es, after cueing: if the resident requires the category cue to remember the word . Code 2, yes, no cue required: if the resident correctly remembers the word spontaneously without cueing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-14 C0400: Recall (cont.) Coding Tips If on the first try (without cueing), the resident names multiple items in a category, one of which is correct, they should be coded as correct for that item. If, however, the interviewer gives the resident the cue and the resident then names multiple items in that category, the item is coded as could not recall, even if the correct item was in the list. Examples 1. The resident is asked to recall the three words that were initially presented. The resident chooses not to answer the question and states, \"I'm tired, and I don't want to do this anymore.\" Coding: C0400A-C0400C would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall , could not recall for each of the three words. Rationale: Choosing not to answer a question often indicates an inability to answer the question, so refusals are coded 0, no\u2014could not recall . This is the most accurate way to score cognitive function, even though, on occasion, residents might choose not to answer for other reasons. 2. The resident is asked to recall the three words. The resident replies, \"Socks, shoes, and bed.\" The examiner then cues, \"One word was a color.\" The resident says, \"Oh, the shoes wer e blue.\" Coding: C0400A, sock, would be coded 2, yes, no cue required . Rationale: The resident's initial response to the question included \"sock.\" He is given credit for this response, even though he also listed another item in that category (shoes), becau se he was answering the initial question, without cueing. Coding: C0400B, blue, would be coded 1, yes, after cueing . Rationale: The resident did not recall spontaneously, but did recall after the category cue was given . Responses that include the word in a sentence are acceptable. Coding: C0400C, bed, would be coded 2, yes, no cue required . Rationale: The resident independently recalled the item on the first attempt. 3. The resident is asked to recall the three words. The resident answers, \"I don't remember.\" The assessor then says, \"One word was something to wear.\" The resident says, \"Clothes.\" The assessor then says, \"OK, one word was a color.\" The resident says, \"Blue.\" The assessor then says, \"OK, the last word was a piece of furniture.\" The resi dent says, \"Couch.\" Coding: C0400A, sock, would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall . Rationale: The resident did not recall the item, even with a cue. Coding: C0400B, blue, would be coded 1, yes, after cueing . Rationale: The resident did recall after being given the cue. Coding: C0400C, bed, would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall . Rationale: The resident did not recall the item, even with a cue. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-15 C0400: Recall (cont.) 4. The resident is asked to recall the three words. The resident says, \"I don't remember.\" The assessor then says, \"One word was something to wear.\" The resident says, \"Hat, shirt, pants, socks, shoe, belt.\" Coding: C0400A, sock, would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall . Rationale: After getting the category cue, the resident named more than one item (i.e., a laundry list of items) in the category . The resident's response is coded as incorrect, even though one of the items was correct, because the resident did not demonstrate recall and likely named the item by chance. C0500: BIMS Summar y Score Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The total score: \u2014 Allows comparison with future and past performance . \u2014 Decreases the chance of incorrect labeling of cognitive ability and improves detection of delirium. \u2014 Provides staff with a more reliable estimate of resident function and allows staff interactions with residents that are based on more accurate impressions about resident ability. Planning for Care The BIMS is a brief screener that aids in detecting cognitive impairment. It does not assess all possible aspects of cognitive impairment. A diagnosis of dementia should only be made after a careful assessment for other reasons for impaired cognitive performance. The final determination of the level of impairment should be made by the resident's physician or mental health care specialist; however, these practitioners can be provided specific BIMS results and the following guidance: The BIMS total score is highly correlated with Mini- Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) scores. Scores from a carefully conducted BIMS assessment where residents can hear all questions and the resident is not delirious suggest the following distributions: 13-15: cognitively intact 8-12: moderately impaired 0-7: severe impairment RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-16 C0500: BIMS Summary Score (cont.) Abrupt changes in cognitive status (as indicative of a delirium) often signal an underlying potentially life threatening illness and a change in cognition may be the only indication of an underlying problem. Care plans can be more individualized based upon reliable knowledge of resident function. Steps for Assessment After completing C0200-C0400: 1. Add up the values for all questions from C0200 through C0400. 2. Do not add up the score while you are interviewing the resident. Instead, focus your f ull attention on the interview. Coding Instructions Enter the total score as a two-digit number. The total possible BIMS score ranges from 00 to 15. If the resident chooses not to answer a specific question(s), that question is coded as incorrect and the item(s) counts in the total score. If, however, the resident chooses not to answer four or more items, then the interview is coded as incomplete and a staff assessment is comple ted. To be considered a completed interview, the resident had to attempt and provide relevant answers to at least four of the questions included in C0200-C0400. To be relevant, a response only has to be r elated to the question (logical); it does not have t o be correct . See general coding tips below for residents who choose not to participate at all. Code 99, unable to complete interview: if (a) the resident chooses not to participate in the BIMS, (b) if four or more items were coded 0 because the resident chose not to answer or gave a nonsensical response, or (c) if any of the BIMS items is coded with a dash. \u2014 Note: a zero score does not mean the BIMS was incomplete. To be incomplete, a resident had to choose not to answer or give completely unrelated, nonsensical responses to four or more items. Coding Tips Occasionally, a resident can communicate but chooses not to participate in the BIMS and therefore does not attempt any of the items in the section . This would be considered an incomplete interview ; enter 99 for C0500, BIMS Summary Score, and complete the staff assessment of mental status. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-17 C0500: BIMS Summary Score (cont.) Example 1. The resident's scores items C0200-C0400 were as follows: C0200 (repetition) 3 C0300A (year) C0400A \"sock\") C0400C C0500 would be coded 12 . C0600: Should the Staff Assessment for Mental Status (C0700- C1000) Be Conducted? Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Direct or performance -based testing of cognitive function using the BIMS is preferred as it decreases the chance of incorrect labeling of cognitive ability and improves detection of delirium. However, a minority of residents are unable or unwilling to participate in the BIMS. Mental status can vary among persons unable to communicate or who do not complete the interview. \u2014 Therefore, report of observed behavior is needed for persons unable to complete the BIMS interview. \u2014 When cognitive impairment is incorrectly diagnosed or missed, appropriate communication, activities , and therapies may not be offered. Planning for Care Abrupt changes in cognitive status (as indicative of delirium) often signal an underlying potentially life -threatening illness and a change in cognition may be the only indication of an underlying problem. \u2014 This remains true for persons who are unable to communicate or to complete the BIMS. Specific aspects of cognitive impairment, when identified, can direct nursing interventions to facilitate greater independence and function. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-18 C0600: Should the Staff Assessment for Mental Status (C0700- C1000) Be Conducted? (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review whether BIMS Summary Score item (C0500), is coded 99 , unable to complete interview. Coding Instructions Code 0, n o: if the BIMS was completed and scored between 00 and 15. Skip to C1310. Code 1, y es: if the resident chooses not to participate in the BIMS or if four or more items were coded 0 because the resident chose not to answer or gave a nonsensical response. Continue to C0700- C1000 and perform the Staff Assessment for Mental Status . Note : C0500 should be coded 99 . Coding Tips If a resident is scored 00 on C0500, C0700-C1000, Staff Assessment , should not be completed. 00 is a legitimate value for C0500 and indicates that the interview was complete. To hav e an incomplete interview , a resident had to choose not to answer or had to give completely unrelated, nonsensical responses to four or more BIMS items . C0700-C1000: Staff Assessment of Mental Status Item CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-19 C0700-C1000: Staff Assessment of Mental Status Item (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Cognitive impairment is prevalent among some groups of residents, but not all residents are cognitively impaired. Many persons with memory problems can function successfully in a structured, routine environment. Residents may appear to be cognitively impaired because of communication challenges or lack of interaction but may be cognitively intact. When cognitive impairment is incorrectly diagnosed or missed, appropriate communication, worthwhile activities , and therapies may not be offered. Planning for Care Abrupt changes in cognitive status (as indicative of a delirium) often signal an underlying potentially life -threatening illness and a change in cognition may be the only indication of an underlying problem. The level and specific areas of impairment affect daily function and care needs . By identifying s pecific aspects of cognitive impairment, nursing interventions can be directed toward facilitating greater function. Probing beyond first, perhaps mistaken, impressions is critical to accurate assessment and appropriate care planning . C0700: Short-term Memory OK Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life To assess the mental state of residents who cannot be interviewed, an int act 5 -minute recall (\"short -term memory OK\") indicates greater likelihood of normal cognition. An observed \"memory problem\" should be taken into consideration in Planning for Care. Planning for Care Identified memory problems typically indicate the need fo r: CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-20 C0700: Short -term Memory OK (cont.) \u2014 Assessment and treatment of an underlying related medical problem (particularly if this is a new observation) or adverse medication effect, or \u2014 possible evaluation for other problems with thinking \u2014 additional nursing support \u2014 at times frequent prompting during daily activities \u2014 additional support during recreational activitie s. Steps for Assessment 1. Determine the resident 's short -term memory status by asking him or her: to describe an event 5 minutes after it occurred if you can validate the resident's response, or to follow through on a direction given 5 minutes earlier. 2. Observe how often the resident has to be re-oriented to an activity or instructions. 3. Staff members also should observe the r esident 's cognitive function in varied daily activities. 4. Observations should be made by staff across all shifts and departments and others with close contact with the resident. 5. Ask direct care staff across all shifts and family or significant others about the resident 's short- term memory status. 6. Review the medical record for clues to the resident 's short- term memory during the look - back period. Coding Instructions Based on all information collected regarding the resident's short-term memory during the 7-day look-back period, identify and code according to the most representative level of function. Code 0, memory OK: if the resident recalled information after 5 minu tes. Code 1, memory problem: if the most representative level of function shows the absence of recall after 5 minutes. Coding Tips If the test cannot be conducted (resident will not cooperate, is non-responsive, etc.) and staff members were unable to make a determination based on observing the resident, use the standard \"no information\" code (a dash, \" -\") to indicate that the information is not available because it could not be assessed. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-21 C0700: Short-term Memory OK (cont.) Example 1. A resident has just retur ned from the activities room where she and other residents were playing bingo. You ask her if she enjoyed herself playing bingo, but she returns a blank stare . When you ask her if she was just playing bingo, she says, \"no.\" Code 1, memory problem . Coding: C0700, would be coded 1, memory problem . Rationale: The resident could not recall an event that took pla ce within the past 5 minutes. C0800: Long-term Memory OK Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life An observed \"long- term memory problem\" may indicate the need for emotional support, reminders, and reassurance. It may also indicate delirium if this represents a change from the resident's baseline. An observed \"long-term memory problem\" should be taken into consideration in Planning for Care. Planning for Care Long -term memory problems indicate the need for: \u2014 Exclusion of an underlying related medical problem (particularly if this is a new observation) or adverse medication effect, or \u2014 possible evaluation for other problems with thinking \u2014 additional nursing support \u2014 at times frequent prompting during daily activities \u2014 additional support during recreational activitie s. Steps for Assessment 1. Determine resident's long -term memory status by engaging in conversation, reviewing memorabilia (photographs, memory books, keepsakes, videos, or other recordings that are meani ngful to the resident) with the resident or observing response to family who visit. 2. Ask questions for which you can validate the answers from review of the medical record, general knowledge, the resident' s family, etc. Ask the resident , \"Are you married?\" \"What is your \" \"When is your birthday? \" Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-22 C0800: Long- term Memory OK (cont.) 3. Observe if the resident responds to memorabilia or family members who visit. 4. Observations should be made by staff across all shifts and departments and others with close contact with the resident. 5. Ask direct care staff across all shifts and family or significant others about the resident' s memory status. 6. Review the medical record for clues to the resident 's long- term memory during the look -back period. Coding Instructions Code 0, memory OK: if the resident accurately recalled long past information. Code 1, memory problem: if the resident did not recall long past information or did not recall it correctly. Coding Tips If the test cannot be condu cted (resident will not cooperate, is non-responsiv e, etc.) and staff were unable to make a determination based on observation of the resident, use the standard \"no information \" code (a dash, \" -\"), to indicate that the information is not available because it could not be assessed. C0900: Memory/Recall A bility Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life An observed \"memory/recall problem\" with these items may indicate: \u2014 cognitive impairment and the need for additional support with reminders to support increased independence; or \u2014 delirium, if this represents a change from the resident's baseline. Planning for Care An observed \"memory/recall problem\" with these items may indicate the need for: \u2014 Exclusion of an underlying related medical problem (particularly if this is a new observation) or adverse medication effect; or \u2014 possible evaluation for other problems with thinking ; \u2014 additional signs, directions, pictures, verbal reminders to support the resident's independence; CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH October 2019 Page C-23 C0900: Memory/Recall Ability (cont.) \u2014 an evaluation for acute deli rium if this represents a change over the past few days to weeks; \u2014 an evaluation for chronic delirium if this represents a change over the past several weeks to months; or \u2014 additional nursing support; \u2014 the need for emotional support, reminders and reassurance to reduce anxiety and agitation. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident about each item. For example, \" What is the current season? Is it fall, winter, spring, or summer? \" \"What is the name of this place?\" If the resident is not in his or her room, ask, \"Will you show me to your room? \" Observe the resident 's ability to find the way. 2. For residents with limited communication skills, in order to determine the most representative level of function, ask direct care staff across all shifts and family or significant other about recall ability. Ask whether the resident gave indications of recalling these subjects or recognizing them during the look- back period. 3. Observations should be made by staff across all shifts and departments and others with close contact with the resident. 4. Review the medical record for indications of the resident 's recall of these subjects during the look-back period. Coding Instructions For each item that the resident recalls, check the corresponding answer box. If the resident recalls none, check none of above. Check C0900A, c urrent season: if resident is able to identify the current season (e.g., correctly refers to weather for the time of year, legal holidays, religious celebrations, etc.). Check C0900B, location of own r oom: if resident is able to locate and recognize own room. It is not necessary for the resident to know the room number, but he or she should be able to find the way to the room. Check C0900C, s taff names and faces: if resident is able to distinguish staff members from family members, strangers, visitors, and other residents. It is not necessary for the resident to know the staff member's name, but he or she should recognize that the person is a staff member and not the resident's son or daughter, etc. Check C0900D, that he or she is in a nursing home/hospital swing bed: if resident is able to determine that he or she is currently living in a nursing home. To check this item, it is not necessary that the resident be able to state the name o f the nursing home, but he or she should be able to refer to the nursing home by a term such as a \"home for older people,\" a \"hospital for the elderly,\" \"a place where people who need extra help live,\" etc. Check C0900Z, none of above was recalled. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-24 C1000: Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life An observed \"difficulty with daily decision making\" may indicate: \u2014 underlying cognitive impairment and the need for additional coaching and support or \u2014 possible anxiety or depression. Planning for Care An observed \"difficulty with daily decision making\" may indicate the need for: \u2014 a more structured plan for daily activities and support in decisions about daily activities, \u2014 encouragement to participate in str uctured activities , or \u2014 an assessment for underlying delirium and medical evaluation. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record. Consult family and direct care staff across all shifts. Observe the resident. 2. Observations should be made by staff across all shifts and departments and others with close contact with the resident. 3. The intent of this item is to record what the resident is doing (performance). Focus on whether or not the resident is actively making these decisions and not whether staff believes the resident might be capable of doing so. 4. Focus on the resident' s actual performance. Where a staff member takes decision -making responsibility away from the resident regarding tasks of everyday living, or the resident does not participate in dec ision making, whatever his or her level of capability may be, the resident should be coded as impaired performance in decision making. DEFINITION DAILY DECISION MAKING Includes: choosing clothing; knowing when to go to meals; using environmental cues to organize and plan (e.g., clocks, calendars, posted event notices); in the absence of environmental cues, seeking information appropriately (i.e. not repetitively) from others in order to plan the day; using awareness of one's own strengths and limitations to regulate the day's events (e.g., asks for help when necessary); acknowledging need to use appropriate assistive equipment such as a walker. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-25 C1000: Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making (cont.) Coding Instructions Record the resident's actual performance in making everyday decisions about tasks or activities of daily living. Enter one number that corresponds to the most correct response. Code 0, independent: if the resident's decisions in organizing daily routine and making decisions were consistent, reasonable and organized reflecting lifestyle, culture, values. Code 1, modified independence: if the resident organized daily routine and made safe decisions in familiar situations, but experienced some difficulty in decision making when faced with new tasks or situations. Code 2, moderately impaired: if the resident's decisions were poor; the resident required reminders, cues, and supervision in planning, organizing, and correcting daily routines. Code 3, severely impaired: if the resident's decision making was severely impaired; the resident never (or rarely) made decisions. Coding Tips If the resident \"rarely or never\" made decisions, despite being provided with opportunities and appropriate cues, Item C1000 would be coded 3, severely impaired . If the resident makes decisions, although poorly, code 2, moderately impaired . A resident 's considered decision to exercise his or her right to decline treatment or recommendations by interdisciplinary team members should not be captured as impaired decision making in Item C1000, Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making . Examples 1. Mr. B . seems to have severe cognitive impairment and is non -verbal. He usually clamps his mouth shut when offered a bite of food. 2. Mrs. C . does not generally make conversation or make her needs known, but replies \"yes\" when asked if she would like to take a nap. Coding: For the above examples, Item C1000 would be coded 3, severe impairment . Rationale : In both examples, the residents are primarily non -verbal and do not make their needs known, but they do give basic verbal or non- verbal responses to simple gestures or questions regarding care routines. More information about how the residents function in the environment is needed to definitively answer the questions. From the limited information provided it appears that their communication of choices is limited to very particular circumstances, which would be regarded as \"rarely/never\" in the relative number of decisions a person could make during the course of a week on the MDS. If such decisions are more frequent or involved more activities, the resident may be only moderately impaired or better. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-26 C1000: Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making (cont.) 3. A resident makes her own decisions throughout the day and is consistent and reasonable in her decision -making except that she constantly walks away from the walker she has been using for nearly 2 years. Asked why she doesn't use her walker, she replies, \"I don't like it. It gets in my way, and I don't want to use it even though I know all of you think I should.\" Coding: C1000 would be coded 0, independent . Rationale: This resident is making and expressing understanding of her own decisions, and her decision is to decline the recommended course of action - using the walker. Other decisions she made throughout the look-back period were consistent and reasonable. 4. A resident routinely participates in coffee hour on Wednesday mornings, and often does not need a reminder. Due to renovations, however, the meeting place was moved to another location in the facility. The resident was informed of this change and was accompanied to the new location by the activities director. Staff noticed that the resident was uncharacteristically agitated and unwilling to engage with other residents or the staff. She eventually left and was found sitting in the original coffee hour room. Asked why she came back to this location, she responded, \"the aide brought me to the wrong room, I'll wait here until they serve the coffee.\" Coding: C1000 would be coded 1, modified independent . Rationale: The resident is independent under routine circumstances. However, when the situation was new or different, she had difficulty adjusting. 5. Mr. G . enjoys congregate meals in the dining and is friendly with the other residents at his table. Recently, he has started to lose weight. He appears to have little appetite, rarely eats without reminders and willingly gives his food to other residents at the table. Mr. G. requires frequent cueing from staff to eat and supervision to prevent him from sharing his food. Coding: C1000 would be coded 2, moderately impaired . Rationale: The resident is making poor decisions by giving his food away. He requires cueing to eat and supervision to be sure that he is eating the food on his plate. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-27 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Delirium is associated with: \u2014 increased mortality, \u2014 functional decline, \u2014 development or worsening of incontinence, \u2014 behavior problems, \u2014 withdrawal from activities \u2014 rehospitalizations and increased length of nursing home stay. Delirium can be misdiagnosed as dementia. A recent deterioration in cognitive function may indicate delirium, which may be reversible if detected and treated in a timely fashion. Planning for Care Delirium may be a symptom of an acute, treatable illness such as infection or reaction to medications. Prompt detection is essential in order to identify and treat or eliminate the cause. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 and Sy mptoms of Delirium (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Observe resident behavior during the BIMS items (C0200- C0400) for the signs and symptoms of delirium. Some experts suggest that increasing the frequency of assessment (as often as daily for new admissions) will improve the level of detection. 2. If the Staff Assessment for Mental Status items (C0700- C1000) w ere completed instead of the BIMS, ask staff members who conducted the interview about their observations of signs and symptoms of delirium. 3. Review medical record documentation during the 7-day look-back period to determine the resident's baseline status, fluctuations in behavior, and behaviors that might have occurred during the 7-day look-back period that were not observed during the BIMS. 4. Interview staff, family members and others in a position to observe the resident's behavior during the 7-day look-back period. For additional guidance on the signs and symptoms of delirium can be found in Appendix C. Coding Instructions for C1310A, Acute Mental Status Change Code 0, n o: if there is no evidence of acute mental status change from the resident's baseline. Code 1, y es: if resident has an alteration in mental status observed in the past 7 days or in the BIMS that represents a change from baseline. Coding Tips Interview resident's family or significant others. Review medical record prior to 7 -day look-back to determine the resident's usual mental status. Examples 1. Resident was admitted to the nursing home 4 days ago. Her family reports that she was alert and oriented prior to admission. Du ring the BIMS interview, she is lethargic and incoherent. Coding: Item C1 310A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: There is an acute change of the resident's behavior from alert and oriented (family report) to lethargic and incoherent during interview. 2. Nurse reports that a resident with poor short- term memory and disorientation to time suddenly becomes agitated, calling out to her dead husband, tearing off her clothes, and being completely disoriented to time, person, and place. Coding: Item C1 310A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: The new behaviors represent an acute change in mental status. DEFINITION DELIRIUM A mental disturbance characterized by new or acutely worsening confusion, disordered expression of thoughts, change in level of consciousness or hallucinations. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-29 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium (cont.) Other Examples of Acute Mental Status Changes A resident who is usually noisy or belligerent becomes quiet, lethargic, or ina ttentive. A resident who is normally quiet and content suddenly becomes restless or noisy. A resident who is usually able to find his or her way around the unit begins to get lost. Steps for Assessment for C13 10B, Inattention 1. Assess attention separately from level of consciousness. Evidence of inattention may be found during the resident interview, in the medical record, or from family or staff reports of inattention during the 7- day look- back period. 2. An additional step to identify difficulty with attention is to ask the resident to count backwards from 20. Coding Instructions for C1310B, Inattention Code 0, b ehavior not present: if the resident remains focused during the interview and all other sources agree that the resident was attentive during other activities. Code 1, behavior continuously present, did not fluctuate: if the resident had difficulty focusing attention, was easily distracted, or had difficulty keeping track of what was said AND the inattention did not vary during the look-back period. All sources must agree that inattention was consistently present to select this code. Code 2, b ehavior present, fluctuates: if inattention is noted during the interview or any source reports that the resident had difficulty focusing attention, was easily distracted, or had difficulty keeping track of what was said AND the inattention varied during interview or during the look-back period or if information source s disagree in assessing level of attention. DEFINITIONS INATTENTION Reduced ability to maintain attention to external stimuli and to appropriately shift attention to new external stimuli. Resident seems unaware or out of touch with environment (e.g., dazed, fixated or darting attention). FLUCTUATION The behavior tends to come and go and/or increase or decrease in severity. The behavior may fluctuate over the course of the interview or during the 7-day look- back period. Fluctuating behavior may be noted by the interviewer, reported by staff or family or documented in the medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-30 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium (cont.) Examples 1. The resident tries to answer all questions during the BIMS. Although she answers several items incorrectly and responds \"I don't know\" to others, she pays attention to the interviewer. Medical record and staff indicate that this is her consistent behavior. Coding: Item C1310B would be coded 0, behavior not present . Rationale: The resident remained focused throughout the interview and this was constant during the look-back period. 2. Questions during the BIMS must be frequently repeated because resident's attention wanders. This behavior occurs throughout the interview and medical records and staff agree that this behavior is consistently present. The resident has a diagnosis of dementia. Coding: Item C1310B would be coded 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate . Rationale: The resident's attention consistently wandered throughout the 7-day look- back period. The resident's dementia diagnosi s does not affect the coding. 3. During the BIMS interview, the resident was not able to focus on all questions asked and his gaze wandered. However, several notes in the resident's medical record indicate that the resident was attentive when staff communicat ed with him. Coding: Item C1310B would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates . Rationale: Evidence of inattention was found during the BIMS but was noted to be absent in the medical record. This disagreement shows possible fluctuation in the behavior. If any information source reports the symptom as present, C1310B cannot be coded as 0, Behavior not present . 4. Resident is dazedly staring at the television for the first several questions. When you ask a question, she looks at you momentarily but does not answer. Midway through questioning, she seems to pay more attention and tries to answer. Coding: Item C1310B would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates . Rationale: Resident's attention fluctuated during the interview. If as few as one source notes fluctuation, then the behavior should be coded 2 . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-31 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium (cont.) Coding Instructions for C1310C, Disorganized Thinking Code 0, b ehavior not present: if all sources agree that the resident's thinking was organized and coherent, even if answers were inaccurate or wrong. Code 1, b ehavior continuously present, did not fluctuate: if, during the interview and according to other sources, the resident's responses were consistently disorganized or incoherent, conversation was rambling or irrelevant, ideas were unclear or flowed illogically, or the resident unpredictably switched from subject to subject. Code 2, b ehavior present, fluctuates: if, during the interview or according to other data sources, the resident's responses fluctuated between disorganized/incoherent and organized/clear. Also code as fluctuating if information sources disagree. Examples 1. The interviewer asks the resi dent, who is often confused, to give the date, and the response is: \"Let's go get the sailor suits!\" The resident continues to provide irrelevant or nonsensical responses throughout the interview, and medical record and staff indicate this is constant. Coding: C1310C would be coded 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate . Rationale: All sources agree that the disorganized thinking is constant. 2. The resident responds that the year is 1837 when asked to give the date. The medical record and staff indicate that the resident is never oriented to time but has coherent conversations. For example, staff reports he often discusses his passion for baseball. Coding: C1310C would be coded 0, behavior not present . Rationale: The resident's answer was related to the question , even though it was incorrect. No other sources report disorganized thinking. 3. The resident was able to tell the interviewer her name, the year and where she was. She was able to talk about the activity she just attended and the residents and staff that also attended. Then the resident suddenly asked the interviewer, \"Who are you? What are you doing in my daughter's home?\" Coding: C1310C wo uld be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates . Rationale: The resident's thinking fluctuated between coherent and incoherent at least once. If as few as one source notes fluctuation, then the behavior should be coded 2 . DEFINITION DISORGANIZED THINKING Evidenced by rambling, irrelevant, or incoherent speech. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-32 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium (cont.) Coding Instructions for C1310D, Altered Level of Consciousness Code 0, behavior not present: if all sources agree that the resident was alert and maintained wakefulness during conversation, interview(s), and activities. Code 1, b ehavior continuously present, did not fluctuate: if, during the interview and according to other sources, the resident was consistently lethargic (difficult to keep awake), stuporous (very difficult to arouse and keep aroused), vigilant (startles easily to any sound or touch), or comatose. Code 2, b ehavior present, fluctuates: if, during the interview or according to other sources, the resident varied in levels of consciousness. For example, was at times alert and responsive, while at other times resident was lethargic, stuporous, or vigilant. Also code as fluctuating if information sources disagree. Coding Tips A diagnosis of coma or stupor does not have to be present for staff to note the behavior in this section. Examples 1. Resident is alert and conversational and answers all questions during the BIMS interview, although not all answers are correct. Medical record documentation and staff report during the 7-day look-back period consistently noted that the resident was alert. Coding: C1310D would be coded 0, behavior not present . Rationale: All evidence indicates that the resident is alert during conversation, interview(s) and activities. 2. The resident is lying in bed. He arouses to soft touch but is only able to converse for a short time before his eyes close, and he appears to be sleeping. Again, he arouses to voice or touch but only for short periods during the interview. Information from other sources indicates that this was his condition throughout the look-back period. Coding: C1310D would be coded 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate . Rationale: The resident's lethargy was consistent throughout the interview, and there is consistent documentation of lethargy in the me dical record during the look -back period. DEFINITIONS ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS VIGILANT - startles easily to any sound or touch; LETHARGIC - repeatedly dozes off when you are asking questions, but responds to voice or touch; STUPOR - very difficult to arouse and keep aroused for the interview; COMATOSE - cannot be aroused despite shaking and shouting. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [C] October 2019 Page C-33 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium (cont.) 3. Resident is usually alert, oriented to time, place, and person. Today, at the time of the BIMS interview, resident is conversant at the beginning of the interview but becomes lethargic and difficult to arouse. Coding: C1310D would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates . Rationale: The level of consciousness fluctuated during the interview. If as few as one source notes fluctuation, then the behavior should be coded 2, fluctuating . CAM Assessment Scoring Methodology The indication of delirium by the CAM requires the presence of: Item A = 1 OR Item B, C or D = 2 AND Item B = 1 OR 2 AND EITHER Item C = 1 OR 2 OR Item D = 1 OR 2 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-1 SECTION D: MOOD Intent: The ite ms in this section address m ood distress, a serious condition that is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the nursing hom e and is associated with significant morbidity. It is particularly important to identify signs and sympto ms of mood distress among nursing home resi dents because these signs and sympto ms can be treata ble. It is important to note that coding the presence of indicators in Section D does not auto matically mean that the resident has a diagnosis of depr ession or other mood disorder. Assessors do not make or assign a diagnosis in Section D; they s imply record the presence or absence of specific clinical mood indicators. Facility staff should re cogniz e thes e indicator s and consider them when developing the resident's individu alized care plan. Depression can be associated with: \u2014 psychological and physical distress (e.g., poor adjustment to the nursing home, loss of independence, chronic illness, inc reased sensiti vity to pain ), \u2014 decreased participation in therapy and activities (e.g., caused by isolation), \u2014 decreased functional status (e.g., resistance to daily care, decreased desire to particip ate in acti vities of daily livin g [ADLs]), and \u2014 poorer outcom es (e.g., decreased appet ite, decreased cognitive status). Findings suggesting mood distress should lead to: \u2014 identifying causes and contributing factors for symptom s, \u2014 identifying interventions (treatm ent, personal support, or environm ental modifications) that cou ld addres s symptom s, and \u2014 ensuring residen t safety. D0100: Should Resident Mood Interview Be Conducted? Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Most residents who are capable of com municating can answer questions about how they feel. O btaining info rmation about mood directly from the resident, som etimes called \"hearing the re siden t's voice,\" is more reliable and accu rate than o bservation alone for identifying a mood disorder. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-2 Resident Conducted? (cont.) Planni ng for Care Symptom- speci fic rom dire ct resident in terviews will allo w for the incorporation of the resident's vo ice in the individualiz ed care plan. If a resident cannot co mmunicate, then Staff M ood Interview (D0500 A-J) should be conducted. Steps for Assessment 1. Interact with the resident using his or her preferred language. Be sure he or she can hear you and/or has access to his or her preferred method for communication. If the resident appears unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. 2. Determine whether the resident is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If rarely/never understood, skip to D0500, Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ-9- OV\u00a9). 3. Review Language item (A1100) to determine if the resident needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with doctors or health care staff (A1100 = 1). If the resident needs or wants an interpreter, complete the interview with an interpreter. Coding In structions Code 0, no: if the interview should not be conducted because the resident is rarely/never understood or cannot respond verbally, in writing, or using another method, or an interpreter is needed but not available. S kip to item D0500, Staff Asses sment of Resident Mood (PHQ-9- OV\u00a9). Code 1, y es: if the resident interview should be conducted because the resident is at least sometimes understood verbally, in writing, or using another method, and if an interpreter is needed, one is available. Continue to item D0200, Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9 \u00a9). Coding Tips and Special Populations Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look-back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident needs an interpreter, every effort should be made to hav e an interpreter present for the PHQ-9 \u00a9 interview. If it is not possib le for a needed inte rprete r to be present on the day of the interview, code D0100 = 0 to indicat e that an interview was not attempte d and com plete items D0500 -D0600. Includes residents who use American Sign Language (ASL). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-3 D0100: Should Resident Mood Interview Be Conducted? (cont.) If the resident interview was not conducted within the look -back period (preferably the day before or the day of) the ARD, item D0100 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code ( a dash \"- \") entered in the resident interview items. Do not complete the Staff Assessment of Resident Mood items (D0500) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Depression can be associated with: \u2014 psychological and physical distress, \u2014 decreased participation in therapy a nd acti vities, \u2014 decreased functional status, and \u2014 poorer outcom es. DEFINITION 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ -9\u00a9) A validated interview that screens for symptoms of depression. It provides a standardized severity score and a rating for evidence of a depressive disorder. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-4 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) Mood disorders are common in nursing homes and are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Planni ng for Care Findings suggesting mood di stress could lead to: \u2014 identifying causes and contributing factors for symptoms and \u2014 identifying interventions (treatment, personal support, or environmental modifications) that could address symptoms. Steps for Assessment Look-back period for this item is 14 days. 1. Conduct the interview preferably the day before or day of the ARD. 2. Interview any resident when D0100 = 1. 3. Conduct the interview in a private setting. 4. If an interpreter is used during resident interviews, the interpreter should not attempt to deter mine the intent behind what is being tra nslated , the outco me of the int erview, or the meaning or significance of the resident's respons es. Interpreters are p eople who translate oral or writte n languag e from one language to another. 5. Sit so that th e resi dent can see your face. Mi nimize glare by directing light sources away from the re sident's face. 6. Be sure the resident can hear you. Residents w ith a hearing i mpairment should be tested using their usual communication devices/techniques, as applicab le. Try an external assistive device (headphones or hearing amplifier) if you have any doubt about hearin g ability. Minimize background noise. 7. If you are ad ministering the PHQ -9\u00a9 in paper form, be sure that the resident can see the print. Provide larg e print or assistive de vice (e.g., page magnifier) if necessary. 8. Explain the reason for the in terview before beginning. Suggested language : \"I am going to ask you some questions about your mood and feelings over the past 2 weeks. I will also ask about so me common problems that are known to go along with feeling down. Som e of the qu estions m ight seem personal, but everyone is asked to answer t hem. This will help us provide you with better care.\" 9. E xplain and /or show the interview response choices. A cue card with the response choices clearly written in la rge print m ight h elp the resident comprehend the response choices. Suggested language : \"I am going to ask you how often you have been bothered by a particular problem over the last 2 weeks. I will give you the choices that you see on this card.\" (Say while pointing to cue car d): \"0-1 days \u2014never or 1 day, 2-6 days\u2014several days, 7-11 days\u2014half or more of the days, or 12-14 days \u2014nearl y ever y day.\" 10. Inter view t he resi dent. Suggested language: \"Over the last 2 weeks, have you been bothered by any of the following problems?\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-5 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) Then, for each question in Resident Mood Interview (D0200): Read the it em as it is w ritten. Do not provide definitio ns because the m eaning must be based on the resident's interpretation. For example, the resident defines for him self what \"tired\" means; the item should be scored based on the resident's i nterpretation. Each questio n must be asked in sequence to assess presence (colu mn 1) and frequency (colu mn 2) before proceeding to the next question. Enter code 9 for any response that is unrelated, inco mprehensible, or incoherent or if the resident's response is not informative with respect to the item being rated; this is considered a nonsensica l response (e.g., when asked the question about \"poor appetite or overeating,\" the resident answer s, \"I always win at poker.\"). For a yes response, as k the residen t to tel l you how ofte n he or sh e was bothered by the symptom over the last 14 days. Use the response choice s in D0200 Colum n 2, Symptom Frequenc y. Start by asking the resident the num ber of days that he or she was bothered by the symptom and read and show cue card w ith frequency categories /descri ptions (0 -1 days\u2014never or 1 day, 2-6 days\u2014several days, 7 -11 days\u2014half or more of the days, or 12-14 days \u2014nearl y ever y day). Coding Instructions for Column 1. Symptom Presence Code 0, no: if resident indicat es symptom s listed are not p resent enter 0. Enter 0 in Column 2 as well. Code 1, y es: if resident indicates sympto ms listed are present enter 1. Enter 0, 1, 2, or 3 in Column 2, Symptom Frequency. Code 9, no response: if the resident was unable or chose not to complete the assessm ent, responded nonsensically and/or the facility was unable to complete the assessm ent. Leave Column 2, Symptom Frequency, blank. Coding Instructions for Column 2. Symptom Frequency Record the resident's responses as they are stated, regardless of whether the resident or the assessor attributes the symptom to something other than mood. Further evaluation of the clinical relevance of reported symptoms should be explored by the responsibl e clinician. Code 0, n ever or 1 day: if the resident indic ates that he or she has never or has only experienced the sy mptom on 1 day. Code 1, 2-6 days (several days): if the resident indicat es that he or she has experienced the sy mptom for 2-6 days. Code 2, 7-11 days (half or mo re of the days): if the resident indicates that he or she has experienced the sy mptom for 7 -11 days. Code 3, 12-14 d ays (nearly every day): if the resident indicat es that he or she has experienced the sy mptom for 12-14 days. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-6 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) Coding Tips and Special Populations For question D0200I, Thoughts Tha t You Woul d Be B etter Off Dead or of Hurting Yourself in Some Way: \u2014 Beginning inter viewers may feel uncomfor table asking th is item because they m ay fear upsetting the resident or m ay feel that the question is too personal. Others may worry that it will giv e the resi dent inappropriate ideas. However, Experienced interviewer s hav e found that most residents who are having this feeling appreciate the opportunity to expres s it. Asking about thoughts of self- harm does not give the person the idea. It does let the provider better understand what the resident is already feeling. The best interviewing approach is to ask the question openly and without hesitation. If the resident uses his or her own words to describ e a sy mptom , this should be briefly explored. If you deter mine that the resident is reporting the intended sy mptom but using his or her own words, ask him to tell you how often he or she was bothered by that symptom. Select only one frequ ency response per item. If the resident has difficulty selecting b etween tw o freq uenc y responses , code fo r the higher frequency. Some items (e.g., item F) contain more than one phrase. If a res ident gives different frequencies for the different parts of a singl e item, select the highest frequency as the score for t hat item. R esidents may respond to questions: \u2014 verbally, \u2014 by pointing to their answers on the cue card, OR \u2014 by writing o ut their answers. Interviewing Tips and Techniques Repeat a question if you think that it has been misund erstood or m isinterpreted. Some residents may be eager to talk with you a nd will stray f rom the topic at hand. When a person strays, you should gently guide the conversation back to the topic. \u2014 Example: S ay, \"That's interesting, now I need to know...\"; \"Let's get back to...\"; \"I understand, can you tell me about....\" Validate your understanding of what the residen t is sayin g by ask ing fo r clarification. \u2014 Example: Say, \"I thin k I hear you sayin g that ...\"; \"Let's see if I understood you correctly.\"; \"You said.... Is that right ?\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-7 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ -9\u00a9) (cont.) If the resident has difficulty selecting a frequency respon se, star t by offerin g a single frequency response and follow with a sequence of more speci fic questions. This is known as unfolding. \u2014 Example: S ay, \" Would you say [na me symptom] bothered you more than half the days in the past 2 weeks?\" If the resident says \"yes,\" show the cue card and ask whether it bothered him or her nearly every day (12-14 days) or on half or m ore of the days (7 -11 days). If the resident says \"no,\" show t he cue card and ask whether it bothered him or her several days (2 -6 days) or never or 1 day (0- 1 mittal respo be expl ored. Residents m ay be reluctant to report sy mptoms and should be gently encouraged to tell you if the symptom bothered him or her, even if it was only some of the ti me. This is known as probing. Probe by asking neutral or nondi rectiv e questions such as: \u2014 \"What do you m ean?\" \u2014 \"Tell me what you have in mind.\" \u2014 \"Tell m e more about that.\" \u2014 \"Please b e more specific.\" \u2014 \"Give m e an exam ple.\" Sometimes respondents give a long answer to interview items. To narrow the answer to the response choices available, it can be usefu l to summari ze their longer answer and then ask them which response option best applies . This is know n as echoing. \u2014 Example: Item D0200E, Poor App etite or Overeating . The resident responds \"the food is always cold and it just doesn't taste like it does at hom e. The doctor won't let me have any salt.\" Possible interviewer response: \"You're telling m e the food isn't what you eat at home and you can't add salt. Ho w often woul d you say that you were bothered by poor appetite or ove r-eating during the last 2 weeks?\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200A, Little Interest or Pleasure in Doing Thing s. The resident, when asked how often he or she has been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things, responds, \"There's nothing to do here, all you do is eat, bathe, and sleep. They don't do anything I like to do.\" Possible interview resp onse: \"You' re saying there isn't m uch to do here and I want to co me back later to talk about some things you like to do. Thinking about how you've been feel ing over the past 2 weeks , how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasur e in doing things.\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200B, Feeling Down, Depressed, or Ho peless . The resident , when asked how often he or she has been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, responds: \"How would you feel if you were here?\" Possible interview resp onse: \"You asked how I would feel, but it is important that I understand your feelings right now. How often would you say that you have been bothered by feeling down, depress ed, or hopeless during the last 2 weeks ?\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-8 D0200: Resident Mood Interview (PHQ-9\u00a9) (cont.) If the resident has difficulty with longer ite ms, separate the item into shorter parts, and provide a chance to respond af ter each part. This method, known as disentangling, is helpful if a residen t has moderate cognitive im pairment but can respond to simple, direct questions. \u2014 Example: Item D0200E, Poo r App etite or Overeating . You can simplify this item by asking: \"In the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite?\" (pause for a response) \"Or overeating ?\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200C, Trouble Falling or Sta ying Aslee p, or Sleeping Too Much. You can break the item down as follows: \"How often are you having problems falling asleep?\" (pause for response) \"Ho w often are you having problem s staying asleep?\" (pause for response) \"How often do you feel you are sleeping too much?\" \u2014 Example: Item D0200H, Moving or Speaking S o Slowly That Other People Could Have Noticed. Or the Opposite\u2014Be ing So Fidg ety or Restles s Tha t You Hav e Bee n Movin g Aroun d a Lo t Mor e tha n Usua l. You can simplify this item by asking: \"How ofte n are you having problem s with moving or speaking so slowly that other people coul d have noticed ?\" (pause for response) \"How often have you felt so fidgety or restless that you move around a lot more than usual?\" D0300: Total Severity Score Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The score does not diagnose a mood disorder or depression but provides a standard score which can be communicated to the resident's physician, other clinicians and m ental hea lth sp ecialists for appropriate follow up. The Total Severity Sco re is a su mmary of the frequency scores on the PHQ-9 \u00a9 that indica tes the extent of potential depression sympto ms and can be useful for knowing when to reques t additio nal assessment by providers or me ntal health specialists. DEFINITION TOTAL SEVERITY SCORE A summary of the frequency scores that indicates the extent of potential depression symptoms. The score does not diagnose a mood disorder, but provides a standard of communication with clinicians and mental health specialists. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page for Care The PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Seve rity Score also provides a way for health care providers and clinician s to easily identif y and track sy mptom s and how t hey are changin g over time. Steps for Assessment After completing D0200 A- I: 1. Add the num eric scores across all frequency item s in Resident Mood Interview (D0200) Column 2. 2. Do not add up the score while you are inter viewing the resident. Instead, focus your full attention on the in terview. 3. The maximum residen t score is 27 (3 x 9). Coding Instructions The interview is succes sfully co mpleted if the resident an swered the freq uency respo nses of at least 7 of the 9 ite ms on the PHQ-9\u00a9. If symptom frequency is blank for 3 or more it ems, the inte rview is de emed NOT complete. Total Severity Score should be code d as \"99 \" and the Staff Assessment o f Mood should be conducted. Enter t he total sco re as a two -digit number. The Total Severity Score will be between 00 and 27 (or \" 99\" if sy mpto m frequency is blank for 3 or more ite ms). The so ftware will calcul ate the Tot al Severity Score. For detailed instructions on m anual calculations and examples, see Appendix E: PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Severity Score Scoring Rules. Coding Tips and Special Populations Responses to PHQ-9\u00a9 can indicate possible depression. Response s can be interpreted as follows: \u2014 Major Depressive Syndro me is suggested if\u2014of the 9 items\u20145 or more items are identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look- back period and at least one of these, (1) little interes t or pleasu re in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless is identified at a fre quency of half or more of the days (7 -11 days) during the look- back period. \u2014 M inor Depressive Syndrom e is suggested if, of the 9 ite ms, (1) feeling down, depressed or hopeless, (2) trou ble falling or staying asle ep, or sleepin g too much , or (3) feeling tired or having little energy are id entified at a frequency of half or m ore of the days (7-11 days) during the look- back period and at least one of these, (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depre ssed, or hopeless is identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7 -11 days). \u2014 In addition, PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Severity Score can be used to track changes in severity over tim e. Total Severity Score can be inte rpreted as follows: 1-4: minim al depression 5-9: m depression 10-14: moderate depression 15-19: moderately severe depression 20-27: severe depression CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-10 D0500: Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ-9-OV\u00a9) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life PHQ-9\u00a9 Resident Mo od Interview is preferred as it improves the detection of a possible mood disorder. However, a sm all percentage of p atien ts are unable or un willing to complete the PHQ -9\u00a9 Resident Mo od Interview . Therefore, staff should complete the PHQ-9\u00a9 Observational Version ( PHQ-9-OV\u00a9) Staff Assessment of Mood in thes e instance s so that an y behaviors, signs, or sy mptoms of mood di stress are identified . Persons unable to complete the PHQ -9\u00a9 Resident Mood Interview may still have a mood disorder. Even if a resident was unable to complete the Resident Mo od Interview , important insights m ay be gained from the responses that wer e obtained during th e interview , as well as observations of the resident's behaviors and affect during the interview. The identification of symptom presence and frequency as well as staf f observations are important in the detection of mood distress, as they m ay info rm need for and type of treatment. It is important to note that coding the presence of indi cators in Section D does not automatically mean that the resident has a diagnosis of depr essio n or othe r mood disorder. Assessors do not m ake or assign a d iagnosis in Section D; they si mply record the presence or abs ence of specific clin ical mood indicators. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [D] October 2019 Page D-11 D0500: Staff Assessment of Resident Mood (PHQ -9-OV\u00a9) (cont.) Alternate means of assessing mood must be used for residents who cannot communi cate or refuse or are unable to particip ate in the PHQ-9\u00a9 Resident Mood Interview . This ensures that inform ation about their mood is not overlooked. Planni ng for Care When the resident is not able to complete the PHQ -9\u00a9, scripted interviews with staff who know the resident well should provide cri tical infor mation for understanding mood and making care planning decisions. Steps for Assessment Look-back period for this item is 14 days. 1. Interview staff from all shifts who know the resident best. Conduct interview in a location that protects resident privacy. 2. The same administration techniq ues outlin ed abo ve fo r the PHQ -9\u00a9 Resident Mood Interview (pages D -4-D-6) and Interviewing Tips & Techniques (pages D-6-D-8) should also be follo wed when staff are interviewed. 3. Encourage staff to report symptom frequency, even i f the staff believes the symptom to be unrelated to depression. 4. Explore unclear responses, focusing the discussion on the sp ecific sy mptom listed on the assessm ent rather than expanding into a lengthy clinical evaluation. 5. If frequency cannot be coded because the residen t has been in the facility for less than 14 days, talk to family or significant other and review trans fer reco rds to inform the selection of a frequency code. Examples of Staff Responses That Indicate Need for Follow -up Questioning with the Staff Member 1. D0500A, Little Interest or Pleasure in Doing Things The resident doesn 't really do m uch here.

Responses can be interpreted as follows: \u2014 Major Depressive Syndrome is suggested if\u2014of the 10 items, 5 or more ite ms are identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look- back period and at least one of these, (1) little interes t or pleasure in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless is identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7 -11 days) during the look-back period. \u2014 Minor Depressive Syndrom e is suggested if\u2014of the 10 items, (1) feeling down, depressed or hopeless, (2) trou ble falling or staying asle ep, or sleepin g too much , or (3) feeling tired or having little energy are id entified at a frequency of half or m ore of the days (7-11 days) during the look- back period and at least one of these, (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depre ssed, or hopeless is identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7 -11 days). \u2014 In addition, PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Severity Score can be used to track changes in severity over tim e. Total Severity Score can be inte rpreted as follows: 1-4: min imal depression 5-9: 10-14: moderate depression 15-19: moderately severe depression 20-30: severe depression CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-1 SECTION E : BEHAVIOR Intent : The items in this section identify behavioral symptoms in the last seven days that may cause distress to the resident, or may be distressing or disruptive to facility residents, staff members or the care environment. These behaviors may place the resident at risk for injury, isolation , and inactivity and may also indicate unrecognized needs, preferences or illness. Behaviors include those that are potentially harmful to the resident himself or herself . The emphasis is identifying behaviors, which does not necessar ily imply a medical diagnosis. Identification of the frequency and the impact of behavioral symptoms on the resident and on others is critical to distinguish behaviors that constitute problems from those that are not problematic . Once the frequency and impact of behavioral symptoms are accurately determined, follow-up evaluation and care plan interventions can be developed to improve the symptoms or reduce their impact. This section focuses on the resident's actions, not the intent of his or her behavior. Because of their interactions with residents, staff may have become used to the behavior and may underreport or minimize the resident's behavior by presuming intent (e.g., \"Mr. A. doesn't really mean to hurt anyone. He's just frightened.\") . Resident intent should not be taken into account when coding for items in this section. E0100: Potential Indicators of Psychosis Item Rationale Health -related Quality of L ife Psychotic sy mptoms may be associated with \u2014 delirium, \u2014 dementia , \u2014 adverse drug effects , \u2014 psychiatric disorders , and \u2014 hearing or vision impairment. Hallucinations and delusions may \u2014 be distressing to residents and families, \u2014 cause disability, \u2014 interfere with delivery of medical, nursing, rehabilitative and personal care, and \u2014 lead to dangerous behavior or possible harm. DEFINITIONS HALLUCINATION The perception of the presence of something that is not actually there. It may be auditory or visual or involve smells, tastes or touch. DELUSION A fixed, false belief not shared by others that the resident holds even in the face of evidence to the contrary . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-2 E0100: Potential Indicators of Psychosis (cont.) Planning for Care Reversible and treatable causes should be identified and addressed promptly . When the cause is not reversible, the focus of management strategies should be to minimize the amount of disability and distress . Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record for the 7-day look-back period. 2. Interview staff members and others who have had the opportunity to observe the resident in a variety of situations during the 7- day look- back period. 3. Observe the resident during conversations and the structured interviews in other assessment sections and listen for statements indicating an experience of hallucinations, or the expression of false beliefs (delusions). 4. Clarify potentially false beliefs : When a resident expresses a belief that is plausible but alleg ed by others to be false (e.g., history indicates that the resident's husband died 20 years ago, but the resident states her husband has been visiting her every day) , try to verify the facts to determine whether there is reason to believe that it could have happened or whether it is likely that the belief is false. When a resident expresses a clearly false belief, determine if it can be readily corrected by a simple explanation of verifiable (real) facts (which may only require a simple reminder or reorient ation) or demonstration of evidence to the contrary. Do not, however, challenge the resident. The resident's response to the offering of a potential alternative explanation is often helpful in determining whether the false belief is held strongly enough to be considered fixed. Coding Instructions Code based on behaviors observed and/or thoughts expressed in the last 7 days rather than the presence of a medical diagnosis. Check all that apply. Check E0100A, h allucinations : if hallucinations were present in the last 7 days . A hallucination is the perception of the presence of something that is not actually there. It may be auditory or visual or involve smells, tastes or touch. Check E0100B , delusions : if delusions were present in the last 7 days. A delusion is a fixed, false belief not shared by others that the resident holds true even in the fa ce of evidence to the contrary. Check E0100Z, none of the above: if no hallucinations or delusions were present in the last 7 days . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-3 E0100: Potential Indicators of Psychosis (cont.) Codi ng Tips and Special Populations If a belief cannot be objectively shown to be false, or it is not possible to determine whether it is false, do not code it as a delusion . If a resident expresses a false belief but easily accepts a reasonable alternative explanation, do not code it as a delusion . If the resident continues to insist that the belief is correct despite an explanation or direct evidence to the contrary, code as a delusion . Examples 1. A resident carries a doll which she believes is her baby and the resident appears upset. When asked about this, she reports she is distressed from hearing her baby crying and thinks she's hungry and wants to get her a bottle. Coding: E0100A would be checked and E0100B would be checked. Rationale : The resident believes the doll is a baby, which is a delusion, and she hears the doll crying , which is an auditory hallucination. 2. A resident reports that he heard a gunshot. In fact, there was a loud knock on the door. When this is explained to him, he accepts the alternative interpretation of the loud noise. Coding: E0100Z would be checked . Rationale : He misinterpreted a real sound in the external environment . Because he is able to accept t he alternative explanation for the cause of the sound, his report of a gunshot is not a fixed false belief and is therefore not a delusion. 3. A resident is found speaking aloud in her room. When asked about this, she states that she is answering a question p osed to her by the gentleman in front of her. Staff note that no one is present and that no other voices can be heard in the environment. Coding: E0100A would be checked . Rationale : The resident reports auditory and visual sensation s that occur in the abse nce of any external stimulus . Therefore, this is a hallucination . 4. A resident announces that he must leave to go to work, because he is needed in his office right away. In fact, he has been retired for 15 years. When reminded of this, he continues to insist that he must get to his office. Coding: E0100B would be checked . Rationale : The resident adheres to the belief that he still works, even after being reminded about his retirement status . Because the belief is held firmly despite an explanation of the real situation, it is a delusion . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-4 E0100: Potential Indicators of Psychosis (cont.) 5. A resident believes she must leave the facility immediately because her mother is w aiting for her to return home. Staff know that, in reality, her mother is deceased and gently remind her that her mother is no longer living. In response to this reminder, the resident acknowl edges, \"Oh yes, I remember now. Mother passed away years ago.\" Coding: E0100Z would be checked . Rationale : The resident's initial false belief is readily altered with a simple reminder, suggesting that her mistaken belief is due to forgetfulness (i.e., memory loss ) rather than psychosis. Because it is not a firmly held false belief, it does not fit the definition of a delusion. E0200: Behavioral Symptom\u2014Presence & Frequency Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life New onset of behavioral symptoms warrants prompt evaluation, assurance of resident safety, relief of distressing symptoms , and compassionate response to the resident. Reversible and treatable causes should be identified and addressed promptly. When the cause is not reversible, the focus of management strategies should be to minimize the amount of disability and distress. Planning for Care Identification of the frequency and the impact of behavioral symptoms on the resident and on others is critical to distinguish behaviors that constitute problems\u2014and may therefore require treatment planning and intervention\u2014from those that are not problematic. These behaviors may indicate unrecognized needs, preferences, or illness. Once the frequency and impact of behavioral symptoms are accurately determined, follow-up evaluation and interventions can be developed to improve the symptoms or reduce their impact. Subsequent assessments and documentation can be compared to baseline to identify changes in the resident's behavior, incl uding response to interventions. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-5 E0200: Behavioral Symptom\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record for the 7- day look- back period. 2. Interview staff, across all shifts and disciplines, as well as others who had close interactions with the resident during the 7- day look- back period, including family or friends who visit frequently or have frequent contact with the resident. 3. Observ e the resident in a variety of situations during the 7- day look- back period. Coding Instructions Code 0, b ehavior not exhibited : if the behavioral symptoms were not present in the last 7 days. Use this code if the symptom has never been exhibited or if it previously has been exhibited but has been absent in the last 7 days. Code 1, behavior of this type occurred 1 -3 days : if the behavior was exhibited 1-3 days of the last 7 days, regardless of the number or severity of episodes that occur on any one of those days. Code 2, b ehavior of this type occurred 4 -6 days, but less than daily : if the behavior was exhibited 4-6 of the last 7 days, regardless of the number or severity of episodes that occur on any of those days. Code 3, b ehavior of this type occurred daily : if the behavior was exhibited daily, regardless of the number or severity of episodes that occur on any of those days. Coding Tips and Special Populations Code based on whether the symptoms occurred and not based on an interpretation of the behavior's meaning, cause or the assessor's judgment that the behavior can be explained or should be tolerated. Code as present , even if staff have become used to the behavior or view it as typical or tolerable. Behaviors in these categories should be coded as present or not present, whether or not they might represent a rejection of care. Item E0200C does not include wandering. Examples 1. Every morning, a nursing assistant tries to help a resident who is unable to dress himself. On the last 4 out of 6 mornings, the resident has hit or scratched the nursing assistant during attempts to dress him. Coding: E0200A would be coded 2, behavior of this type occurred 4- 6 days, but less than daily . Rationale : Scratching the nursing assistant was a physical behavior directed toward others. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-6 E0200: Behavioral Symptom\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) 2. A resident has previously been found rummaging through the clothes in her roommate's dresser drawer. This behavior has not been observed by staff or reported by others in the last 7 days. Coding: E0200C would be coded 0, behavior not exhibited . Rationale : The behavior did not occur during the look-back period. 3. A resident throws his dinner tray at another resident who repeatedly spit food at him during dinner. This is a single, isolated incident. Coding: E0200A would be coded 1, behavior of this type occurred 1- 3 days of the last 7 days . Rationale : Throwing a tray was a physical behavior directed toward others. Although a possible explanation exists, the behavior is noted as present because it occurred. E0300: Overall Presence of Behavioral Symptoms Item Rationale To determine w hether or not additional items E0500, Impact on Resident , and E0600, Impact on Others, are required to be completed . Steps for Assessment 1. Review coding for item E0200 and follow these coding instructions: Coding Instructions Code 0, no: if E0200A, E0200B, and E0200C all are coded 0, not present. Skip to Rejection of Care\u2014 Presence & Frequency item ( E0800). Code 1, y es: if any of E0200A, E0200B, or E0200C were coded 1, 2, or 3. Proceed to complete Impact on Resident item (E0500), and Impact on Others item ( E0600). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-7 E0500: Impact on Resident Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Behaviors identified in item E0200 impact the resident's risk for significant injury, interfere with care or their participation in activities or social interactions . Planning for Care Identification of the impact of the behaviors noted in E0200 may require treatment planning and intervention. Subsequent assessments and documentation can be compared to a baseline to identify changes in the resident's behavior, including response to interventions. Steps for Assessment 1. Consider the previous review of the medical record, staff interviews across all shifts and disciplines, interviews with others who had close interactions with the resident and previous observations of the behaviors identified in E0200 for the 7-day look-back period. 2. Code E0500A, E0500B, and E0500C based on all of the behavioral symptoms coded in E0200. 3. Determine whether those behaviors put the resident at significant risk of phys ical illness or injury, whether the behaviors significantly interfered with the resident's care , and/or whether the behaviors significantly interfered with the resident's participation in activities or social interactions. Coding Instructions for E0500A . Did Any of the Identified Symptom(s) Put the Resident at Significant Risk for Physical Illness or Injury? Code 0, no : if none of the identified behavioral symptom(s) placed the resident at clinically significant risk for a physical illness or injury. Code 1, y es: if any of the identified behavioral symptom(s) placed the resident at clinically significant risk for a physical illness or injury , even if no injury occurred. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-8 E0500: Impact on Resident (cont.) Coding Instructions for E0500B. Did Any of the Identi fied Symptom(s) Significantly Interfere with the Resident's Care? Code 0, no : if none of the identified behavioral symptom(s) significantly interfered with the resident's care. Code 1, yes: if any of the identified behavioral symptom(s) impeded the delivery of essential medical, nursing, rehabilitative or personal care, including but not l imited to assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, feeding , or toileting . Coding Instructions for E0500C. Did Any of the Identified Sy mptom(s) Significantly Interfere with the Resident's Participation in Activities or Social Interactions? Code 0, no : if none of the identified symptom(s) significantly interfered with the resident's participation in activities or social interactions. Code 1, yes: if any of the identified behavioral symptom(s) significantly interfered with or decreased the resident's participation or caused staff not to include residents in activities or social interactions. Coding Tips and Special Populations For E0500A , code based on whether the risk for physical injury or illness is known to occur commonly under similar circumstances (i.e., with residents who exhibit similar behavior in a similar environment) . Physical injury is trauma that results in pain or other distres sing physical symptoms, impaired organ function, physical disability, or other adverse consequences, regardless of the need for medical, surgical, nursing, or rehabilitative intervention. For E0500B, code if the impact of the resident's behavior is impeding the delivery of care to such an extent that necessary or essential care (medical, nursing, rehabilitative or personal that is required to achieve the resident's goals for health and well- being) cannot be received safely, completely , or in a timely way without more than a minimal accommodation, such as simple change in care routines or environment. For E0500C, code if the impact of the resident's behavior is limiting or keeping the resident from engaging in solitary activities or hobb ies, joining groups, or attending programmed activities or having positive social encounters with visitors, other residents, or staff. Examples 1. A resident frequently grabs and scratches staff when they attempt to change her soiled brief, digging her nails into their skin. This makes it difficult to complete the care task. Coding: E0500B would be coded 1, yes . Rationale : This behavior interfered with delivery of essential personal care. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-9 E0500: Impact on Resident (cont.) 2. During the last 7 days, a resident with vascular dementia and severe hypertension, hits staff during incontinent care making it very difficult to change her. Six out of the last seven days the resident refuses all her medication including her antihypertensive. The resident closes her mouth and shakes her head and will not take it even if re-approached multiple times. Coding: E0500A and E0500B would both be coded 1, y es. Rationale: The behavior interfered significantly with delivery of her medical and nursing care and put her at clinically significant risk for physical illness. 3. A resident paces incessantly . When staff encourage him to sit at the dinner table, he returns to pacing af ter less than a minute, even after cueing and reminders. He is so restless that he cannot sit still long enough to feed himself or receive assistance in obtaining adequate nutrition . Coding: E0500A and E0500B would both be coded 1, yes . Rationale : This behavior significantly interfered with personal care (i.e ., feeding) and put the resident at risk for malnutrition and physical illness. 4. A resident repeatedly throws his markers and card on the floor during bingo. Coding: E0500C would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: This behavior interfered with his ability to participate in the activity . 5. A resident with severe dementia has continuous outbursts while awake despite all efforts made by staff to address the issue, including trying to involve the resident in prior act ivities of choice. Coding: E0500C would be coded 1, yes . Rationale : The staff determined the resident's behavior interfered with the ability to participate in any activities. E0600: Impact on Others CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-10 E0600: Impact on Others (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Behaviors identified in item E0200 put others at risk for significant injury, intrude on their privacy or activities and/or disrupt their care or living environments. The impact on others is coded here in item E0600. Planning for Care Identification of the behaviors noted in E0200 that have an impact on others may require treatment planning and intervention. Subsequent assessments and documentation can be compared with a baseline to identify changes in the resid ent's behavior, including response to interventions. Steps for Assessment 1. Consider the previous review of the clinical record, staff interviews across all shifts and disciplines, interviews with others who had close interactions with the resident and previous observations of the behaviors identified in E0200 for the 7-day look-back period. 2. To code E0600, determine if the behaviors identified put others at significant risk of physical illness or injury, intruded on their privacy or activities, and/or interfered with thei r care or living environments. Coding Instructions for E0600A . Did Any of the Identified Symptom(s) Put Others at Significant Risk for Physical Injury? Code 0, no : if none of the identified behavioral symptom(s) placed staff, visitors , or other residents at significant risk for physical injury. Code 1, yes: if any of the identified behavioral symptom(s) placed staff, visitors, or other residents at significant risk for physica l injury. Coding Instructions for E0600B. Did Any of the Identified Symptom(s) Significantly Intrude on the Privacy or Activity of Others? Code 0, no : if none of the identified behavioral symptom(s) significantly intruded on the privacy or activity of othe rs. Code 1, yes: if any of the identified behavioral symptom(s) kept other residents from enjoying privacy or engaging in informal activities (not organized or run by staff). Includes coming in uninvited, invading, or forcing oneself on others' private activities. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-11 E0600: Impact on Others (cont.) Coding Instructions for E0600C. Did Any of the Identified Symptom(s) Significantly Disrupt Care or the Living Environment? Code 0, no : if none of the identified behavioral symptom(s) significantly disrupt ed delivery of care or the living environment. Code 1, yes: if any of the identified behavioral symptom(s) created a climate of excessive noise or interfered with the receipt of care or participation in organized activities by other residents. Coding Tips and Special Populations For E0600A, code based on whether the behavior placed others at significant risk f or physical injury. Physical injury is trauma that results in pain or other distressing physical symptoms, impaired organ function, physical disability or other adverse consequences, regardless of the need for medical, surgical, nursing, or rehabilitative intervention. For E0600B, code based on whether the behavior violates other residents' privacy or interrupts other resi dents' performance of activities of daily living or limits engagement in or enjoyment of informal social or recreational activities to such an extent that it causes the other residents to experience distress (e.g., displeasure or annoyance) or inconvenience, whether or not the other residents complain. For E0600C, code based on whether the behavior interferes with staff ability to deliver care or conduct organized activities, interrupts receipt of care or participation in organized activities by other residents, and/or causes other residents to experience distress or adverse consequences. Examples 1. A resident appears to intentionally stick his cane out when another resident walks by. Coding: E0600A would be coded 1, yes ; E0600B and E0600C would be coded 0, no. Rationale : The behavior put the other resident at risk for falling and physical injury. You may also need to consider coding B and C depending on the specific situation in the environment or care setting. 2. A resident, when sitting in the hallway outside the community activity room, continually yells, repeating the same phrase. The yelling can be heard by other residents in hallways and activity/recreational areas but not in their private rooms. Coding: E0600A would be coded 0, no ; E0600B and E0600C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : The behavior does not put others at risk for significant injury. The behavior does create a climate of excessive noise, disrupting the living environment and the activity of others. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-12 E0600: Impact on Others (cont.) 3. A resident repeatedly enters the rooms of other residents and rummages through their personal belongings . The other residents do not express annoyance. Coding: E0600A and E0600C would be coded 0, no ; E0600B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : This is an intrusion and violates other residents' privacy regardless of whether they complain or communicate their distress. 4. When eating in the dining room, a resident frequently grabs food off the plates of other residents . Although the other resident's food is replaced, and the behavior does not compromise their nutrition, other residents become anxious in ant icipation of this recurring behavior. Coding: E0600A would be coded 0, no ; E0600B and E0600C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : This behavior violates other residents' privacy as it is an intrusion on the personal space and property (food tray). In addition , the behavior is pervasive and disrupts the staff's ability to deliver nutritious meals in dining room (an organized activity). 5. A resident tries to seize the telephone out of the hand of another resident who is attempting to complete a private conversation. Despite being asked to stop, the resident persists in grabbing the telephone and insisting that he wants to use it. Coding: E0600A and E0600C would be coded 0, no ; E0600B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : This behavior is an intrusion on another resident's private telephone conversation. 6. A resident begins taunting two residents who are playing an informal card game, yelling that they will \"burn in hell\" if they don't stop \"gambling.\" Coding: E0600A and E0600C would be coded 0, no ; E0600B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : The behavior is intruding on the other residents' game. The game is not an organized facility event and does not involve care. It is an activity in which the two residents wanted to engage. 7. A resident yells continuously during an exercise group, diverting staff attention so that others cannot participate in and enjoy the activity. Coding: E0600A and E0600B would be coded 0, no ; E0600C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : This behavior disrupts the delivery of physical care (exercise) to the group participants and creates an environment of excessive noise. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-13 E0600: Impact on Others (cont.) 8. A resident becomes verbally threatening in a group discussion activity, frightening other residents. In response to this disruption, staff terminate the discussion group early to avoid eliciting the behavioral symptom. Coding: E0600A and E0600B would be coded 0, no ; E0600C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale : This behavior does not put other residents at risk for significant injury. However, the behavior restricts full participation in the organized activity, and limits the enjoyment of other residents . It also causes fear, thereby disru pting the living environment. E0800: Rejection of Care\u2014Presence & Frequency Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Goals for health and well- being reflect the resident's wishes and objectives for health, function, and life satisfaction that define an acceptable quality of life for that individual. The resident's care preferences reflect desires, wishes, inclinations, or choices for care. Preferences do not have to appear logical or rational to the clinician. Similarly, preferences are not nec essarily informed by facts or scientific knowledge and may not be consistent with \"good judgment.\" It is really a matter of resident choice. When rejection/decline of care is first identified, the team then investigates and determines the rejection/decline of care is really a matter of resident's choice. Education is provided and the resident's choices become part of the plan of care. On future assessments, this behavior would not be coded in this item. A resident might reject/decline care because the care conflicts with his or her preferences and goals . In such cases, care rejection behavior is not considered a problem that warrants treatment to modify or eliminate the behavior. Care rejection may be manifested by verbally declining, statements of refusal, or through physical behaviors that convey aversion to, result in avoidance of, or interfere with the receipt of care. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-14 E0800: Rejection of Care\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) This type of behavior interrupts or interferes with the delivery or receipt of care by disrupting the usual routines or processes by which care is given, or by exceeding the level or intensity of resources that are usually available for the provision of care. A resident 's rejection of care might be caused by an underlying neuropsychiatric, medical, or dental problem. This can interfere with needed care that is consistent with the resident's preferences or established care goals . In such cases, care rejection behavior may be a problem that requires assessment and intervention. Planning for Care Evaluation of rejection of care assists the nursing home in honoring the resident's care preferences in order to meet his or her desired health care goals. Follow-up a ssessment should consider: \u2014 whether established care goals clearly reflect the resident's preferences and goals and \u2014 whether alternative approaches could be used to achieve the resident's care goals. Determine whether a previous discussion identified an objection to the type of care or the way in which the care was provided. If so, determine approaches to accommodate the resident's preferences . Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record . 2. Interview staff, across all shifts and disciplines, as well as others who had close interactions with the resident during the 7-day look-back period. 3. Review the record and consult staff to determine whether the rejected care is needed to achieve the resident's preferences and goals for health and well -being . 4. Review the medical record to find out whether the care rejection behavior was previously addressed and documented in discussions or in care planning with the resident, family , or significant other and determined to be an informed choice consistent with the resident 's values, preferences, or goals; or whether that the behavior represents an objection to the way care is provided, but acceptable alternative care and/or approaches to care have been identifie d and employed. 5. If the resident exhibits behavior that appears to communicate a rejection of care (and that rejection behavior has not been previously determined to be consistent with the resident' s values or goals), ask him or her directly whether the behavior is meant to decline or refuse care. DEFINITIONS REJECTION OF CARE Behavior that interrupts or interferes with the delivery or receipt of care. Care rejection may be manifested by verbally declining or statements of refusal or through physical behaviors that convey aversion to or result in avoidance of or interfere with the receipt of care. INTERFERENCE WITH CARE Hindering the delivery or receipt of care by disrupting the usual routines or processes by which care is given, or by exceeding the level or intensity of resources that are usually available for the provision of care. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-15 E0800: Rejection of Care\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) If the resident indicates that the intention is to decline or refuse, then ask him or her about the reasons for rejecting care and about his or her goals for health care and well -being . If the resident is unable or unwilling to respond to questions about his or her rejection of care or goals for health care and well -being, then interview the family or si gnificant other to ascertain the resident's health care preferences and goals. Coding Instructions Code 0, behavior not exhibited : if rejection of care consistent with goals was not exhibited in the last 7 days. Code 1, b ehavior of this type occurred 1 -3 days : if the resident reject ed care consistent with goals 1 -3 days during the 7 -day look-back period, regardless of the number of episodes that occur red on any one of those days. Code 2, b ehavior of this type occurred 4 -6 days, but less than daily : if the resident rejected care consistent with goals 4 -6 days during the 7 -day look- back period, regardless of the number of episodes that occur red on any one of those days. Code 3, b ehavior of this type occurred daily : if the resident rejected care consistent with goals daily in the 7 -day look-back period, regardless of the number of episodes that occurred on any one of those days. Coding Tips and Special Populations The intent of this item is to identify potential behavioral problems, not situations in which care has been rejected based on a choice that is consistent with the resident's preferences or goals for health and well- being or a choice made on behalf of the resident by a family member or other proxy decision maker . Do not include behaviors that have already been addressed (e.g., by discussion or care planning with the resident or family) and determined to be consistent with the resident's values, preferences, or goals. Residents who have made an informed choice about not wanting a particular treatment, procedure, etc., should not be identified as \"rejecting care.\" Examples 1. A resident with heart failure who recently returned to the nursing home after surgical repair of a hip fracture is offered physical therapy and declines. She says that she gets too short of breath when she tries to walk even a short distance, making physical therapy intolerable. She does not expect to walk again and does not want to try. Her physician has discussed this with her and has indicated that her prognosis for regaining ambulatory function is poor. Coding: E0800 would be coded 0, behavior not exhibited . Rationale : This resident has communicated that she considers physical therapy to be both intolerable and futile. The resident discussed this with her physician. Her choice to not accept physical therapy treatment is consistent with her values and goals for health care. Therefore, this would not be coded as rejection of care. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-16 E0800: Rejection of Care\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) 2. A resident informs the staff that he would rather receive care at home, and the next day he calls for a taxi and exits the nursing facility . When staff try to persuade him to return, he firmly states, \"Leave me alone. I always swore I'd nev er go to a nursing home. I'll get by with my visiting nurse service at home again.\" He is not exhibiting signs of disorientation, confusion, or psychosis and has never been judged incompetent. Coding: E0800 would be coded 0, behavior not exhibited . Rationale: His departure is consistent with his stated preferences and goals for health care. Therefore, this is not coded as care rejection. 3. A resident goes to bed at night without changing out of the clothes he wore during the day. When a nursing assistant offers to help him get undressed, he declines, stating that he prefers to sleep in his clothes tonight. The clothes are wet with urine. This has happened 2 of the past 7 days. The resident was previously fastidious, recently has expressed embarra ssment at being incontinent, and has care goals that include maintaining personal hygiene and skin integrity. Coding: E0800 would be coded 1, behavior of this type occurred 1- 3 days . Rationale : The resident 's care rejection behavior is not consistent with his values and goals for health and well-being. Therefore, this is classified as care rejection that occurred twice. 4. A resident chooses not to eat supper one day, stating that the food causes her diarrhea. She says she knows she needs to eat and does not wish to compromise her nutrition, but she i s more distressed by the diarrhea than by the prospect of losing weight. Coding: E0800 would be coded 1, behavior of this type occurred 1- 3 days . Rationale : Although choosing not to eat is consistent with the res ident's desire to avoid diarrhea, it is also in conflict with her stated goal to maintain adequate nutrition. 5. A resident is given his antibiotic medication prescribed for treatment of pneumonia and immediately spits the pills out on the floor . This resident's assessment indicates that he does not have any swallowing problems. This happened on each of the last 4 days . The resident's advance directive indicates that he would choose to take antibiotics to treat a potentially life-threatening infection . Coding: E0800 would be coded 2, behavior of this type occurred 4- 6 days, but less than daily . Rationale : The behavioral rejection of antibiotics prevents the resident from achieving his stated goals for health care listed in his advance directives. Therefore, the behavior is coded as care rejection. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-17 E0800: Rejection of Care\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) 6. A resident who recently returned to the nursing home after s urgery for a hip fracture is offered physical therapy and declines . She states that she wants to walk again but is afraid of falling . This occurred on 4 days during the look-back period. Coding: E0800 would be coded 2, behavior of this type occurred 4- 6 days . Rationale : Even though the resident's health care goal is to regain her ambulatory status, her fear of falling results in rejection of physical therapy and interferes with her rehabilitation . Thi s would be coded as rejection of care. 7. A resident who previously ate well and prided herself on following a healthy diet has been refusing to eat every day for the past 2 weeks . She complains that the food is boring and that she feels full after just a few bites . She says she wants to eat to maintain her weight and avoid getting sick , but she cannot push herself to eat anymore. Coding: E0800 would be coded 3, behavior of this type occurred daily . Rationale : The resident's choice not to eat is not consistent with her goal of weight maintenance and health. Choosing not to eat may be related to a medical condition such as a disturbance of taste sensation, gastrointestinal illness, endocrine condition, depressive disorder, or medication side effects . E0900: Wandering\u2014Presence & Frequency Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Wandering may be a pursuit of exercise or a pleasurable leisure activity, or it may be related to tension, anxiety, agitation, or searching. Planning for Care It is important to assess for reason for wandering. Determine the frequency of its occurrence, and any factors that trigger the behavior or that decrease the episodes. Assess for underlying tension, anxiety, psychosis, drug-induced psychomotor restlessness, agitation, or unmet need (e.g., for food, fluids, toileting, exercise, pain relief, sensory or cognitive stimulation, sense of security, companionship) that m ay be contributing to wandering. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-18 E0900: Wandering\u2014Presence & Frequency (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record and interview staff to determine whether wandering occurred during the 7-day look-back period. Wandering is the act of moving (walking or locomotion in a wheelchair) from place to place with or without a specified course or known direction. Wandering may or may not be aimless. The wandering resident may be oblivious to his or her physical or safety needs. The resident may have a purpose such as searching to find something, but he or she persists without knowing the exact direction or location of the object, person or place. The behavior may or may not be driven by confused thoughts or delusional ideas (e.g., when a resident believes she must find her mother, who staff know is deceased). 2. If wandering occurred, determine the frequency of the wandering during the 7-day look- back period. Coding Instructions for E0900 Code 0, behavior not exhibited : if wandering was not exhibited during the 7- day look-back period. Skip to Change in Behavioral or Other Symptoms item (E1100). Code 1, b ehavior of this type occurred 1 -3 days : if the resident wandered on 1-3 days during the 7- day look-back period, regardless of the number of episodes that occurred on any one of those days. Proceed to answer Wandering \u2014Impact item (E1000). Code 2, b ehavior of this type occurred 4 -6 days, but less than daily : if the resident wandered on 4 -6 days during the 7- day look-back period, regardless of the number of episodes that occur red on any one of those days. Proceed to answer Wandering \u2014Impact item ( E1000). Code 3, behavior of this type occurred daily : if the resident wandered daily during the 7-day look-back period, regardless of the number of episodes that occur red on any one of those days . Proceed to answer Wandering \u2014Impact item ( E1000). Coding Tips and Special Populations Pacing (repetitive walking with a driven/pressured quality) within a constrained spac e is not included in wandering. Wandering may occur even if resident is in a locked unit . Traveling via a planned course to another specific place (such as going to the dining room to eat a meal or to an activity) is not considered wandering. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-19 E1000: Wandering\u2014Impact Answer this item only if E0900, Wandering\u2014Presence & Frequency, was coded 1 (behavior of this type occurred 1 -3 days), 2 (behavior of this type occurred 4 -6 days, but less than daily), or 3 (behavior of this type occurred daily). Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Not all wandering is harmful. Some residents who wander are at potentially higher risk for entering an unsafe situation. Some residents who wander can cause significant disruption to other residents. Planning for Care Care plans should consider the impact of wandering on resident safety and disruption to others. Care planning should be focused on minimizing these issues. Determine the need for environmental modifications (door alarms, door barriers, etc.) that enhance resident safety if wander ing places the resident at risk. Determine when wandering requires interventions to reduce unwanted intrusions on other residents or disruption of the living environment. Steps for Assessment 1. Consider the previous review of the resident's wandering behaviors identified in E0900 for the 7 -day look-back period. 2. Determine whether those behaviors put the resident at significant risk of getting into potentially dangerous places and/or whether wandering significantly intrudes on the privacy or activities of others based on clinical judgment for the individual resident. Coding Instruc tions for E1000A . Does the Wandering Place the Resident at Significant Risk of Getting to a Potentially Dangerous Place? Code 0, no : if wandering does not place the resident at significant risk. Code 1, y es: if the wandering places the resident at significant risk of getting to a dangerous place (e.g., wandering outside the facility where there is heavy traffic) or encountering a dangerous situation (e.g., wandering into the room of another resident with dementia who is known to become physically aggressive toward intruders). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: October 2019 (cont.) Coding Instructions for E1000B . Does the Wandering Significantly Intrude on the Privacy or Activities of Others? Code 0, no : if the wandering does not intrude on the privacy or activity of others. Code 1, yes: if the wandering intrudes on the privacy or activities of others (i.e., if the wandering violates other residents' privacy or interrupts other residents' performanc e of activities of daily living or limits engagement in or enjoyment of social or recreational activities ), whether or not the other resident complains or communicates displeasure or annoyance. Examples 1. A resident wanders away from the nursing home in his pajamas at 3 a.m. When staff members talk to him, he insists he is look ing for his wife. This elopement behavior had occurred when he was living at home, and on one occasion he became lost and was missing for 3 days, leading his family to choose nursing home admission for his personal safety. Coding: E1000A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale : Wandering that results in elopement from the nursing home places the resident at significant risk of getting into a dangerous situation. 2. A resident wanders away from the nursing facility at 7 a.m. Staff find him crossing a busy street against a red light . When staff tr y to persuade him to return, he becomes angry and says, \"My boss called , and I have to get to the office.\" When staff remind him that he has been retired for many years, he continues to i nsist that he must get to work. Coding: E1000A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale : This resident's wandering is associated with elopement from the nursing home and into a dangerous traffic situation. Therefore, this is coded as placing the resident at significant risk of getting to a place that poses a danger . In addition, delusions would be checked in item E0100. 3. A resident propels himself in his wheelchair into the room of another resident, blocking the door to the other resident's bathroom. Coding: E1000B would be coded 1, yes . Rationale : Moving about in this manner with the use of a wheelchair meets the definition of wandering, and the resident has intruded on the privacy of another resident and has interfered with that residen t's ability to use the bathroom. E1100: Change in Behavioral or Other Symptoms CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-21 E1100: Change in Behavioral or Other Symptoms (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Change in behavior may be an important indicator of \u2014 a change in health status or a change in environmental stimuli, \u2014 positive response to treatment, and \u2014 adverse effects of treatment. Planning for Care If behavior is worsening, assessment should consider whether it is related to \u2014 new health problems, psychosis, or delirium; \u2014 worsening of pre- existing health problems; \u2014 a chan ge in environmental stimuli or caregivers that influences behavior; and \u2014 adverse effects of treatment. If behaviors are improved, assessment should consider what interventions should be continued or modified (e.g., to minimize risk of relapse or adverse eff ects of treatment). Steps for Assessment 1. Review res ponses provided to items E0100-E1000 on the current MDS assessment. 2. Compare with responses provided on prior MDS assessment. 3. Taking all of these MDS items into consideration, make a global assessment of th e change in behavior from the most recent to the current MDS. 4. Rate the overall behavior as same, improved, or worse. Coding Instructions Code 0, s ame: if overall behavior is the same (unchanged). Code 1, improved: if overall behavior is improved. Code 2, worse: if overall behavior is worse. Code 3, N/A: i f there was no prior MDS assessment of this resident. Coding Tips For residents with multiple behavioral symptoms, it is possible that different behaviors will vary in different directions over time . That is, one behavior may improve while another worsens or remains the same. Using clinical judgment, this item should be rated to reflect the overall direction of behavior change, estimating the net effects of multiple behaviors. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [E] October 2019 Page E-22 E1100: Change in Behavioral or Other Symptoms (cont.) Examples 1. On the prior assessment, the resident was reported to wander on 4 out of 7 days. Because of elopement, the behavior placed the resident at significant risk of getting to a dangerous place. On th e current assessment, the resident was found to wander on the unit 2 of the last 7 days but has not attempted to exit the unit. Because the resident is no longer attempting to exit the unit, she is at decreased risk for elopement and getting to a dangerous place. However, the resident is now wandering into the rooms of other residents, intruding on their privacy. This requires occasional redirection by staff. Coding: E1100 would be coded 1, improved . Rationale : Although one component of this resident's wandering behavior is worse because it has begun to intrude on the privacy of others, it is less frequent and less dangerous (without recent elopement) and is therefore improved overall since the last assessment . The fact that the behavior requ ires less intense surveillance or intervention by staff also supports the decision to rate the overall behavior as improved. 2. At the time of the last assessment, the resident was ambulatory and would threaten and hit other residents daily. He recently suffered a hip fracture and is not ambulatory. He is not approaching, threatening, or assaulting other residents. However, the resident is now combative when staff try to assist with dressing and bathing, and is hitting staff members daily. Coding: E1100 would be coded 0, same . Rationale : Although the resident is no longer assaulting other residents, he has begun to assault staff . Because the danger to others and the frequency of these behaviors is the same as before, the overall behavior is rated as unchanged. 3. On the prior assessment, a resident with Alzheimer's disease was reported to wander on 2 out of 7 days and has responded well to redirection. On the most recent assessment, it was noted that the resident has been wandering more frequently for 5 out of 7 da ys and has also attempted to elope from the building on two occasions. This behavior places the resident at significant risk of personal harm. The resident has been placed on more frequent location checks and has required additional redirection from staff. He was also provided with an elopement bracelet so that staff will be alerted if the resident attempts to leave the building . The intensity required of staff surveillance because of the dangerousness and frequency of the wandering behavior has significantly increased. Coding: E1100 would be coded 2, worse . Rationale : Because the danger and the frequency of the resident's wandering behavior have increased and there were two elopement attempts, the overall behavior is rated as worse. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -1 SECTION F: PREFERENCES FOR CUSTOMARY ROUTINE AND ACTIVITIES Intent: The intent of items in this section is to obtain information regarding the resident's preferences for his or her daily routine and activit ies. This is best accomplished when the information is obtained directly from the resident or through family or significant other, or staff interviews if the resident cannot report preferences. The information obtained during this interview is just a portion of the assessme nt. Nursing homes should use this as a guide to create an individualized plan based on the resident's preferences, and is not meant to be all-inclusive. F0300: Should Interview for Daily and Activity Preferences Be Conducted? Item Rationale Health -relate d Quality of Life Most residents capable of communicating can answer questions about what they like. Obtaining information about preferences directly from the resident, sometimes called \"hearing the resident's voice,\" is the most reliable and accurate way of identifying preferences. If a resident cannot communicate, then family or significant other who knows the resident well may be able to provide useful information about preferences. Planning for Care Quality of life can be greatly enhanced when care respects the resident's choice regarding anything that is important to the resident. Interviews allow the resident's voice to be reflected in the care plan. Information about preferences that comes directly from the resident provides specific information for individualized daily care and activity planning. Steps for Assessment 1. Interact with the resident using his or her preferred language. Be sure he or she can hear you and/or has access to his or her preferred method for communication. If the resident appears unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. 2. Determine whether or not resident is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If the resident is rarely or never understood, attempt to conduct the interview with a family member or significant other. 3. If resident is rarely/never understood and a family member or significant other is not available, skip to item F0800, Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences. 4. Conduct the interview during the observation period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -2 F0300: Should Interview for Daily and Activity Preferences Be Conducted? (cont.) 5. Review Language item (A1100) to determine whether or not the resident needs or wants an interpreter. If the resident needs or wants an interpreter, complete the interview with an interpreter. Coding Instructions Code 0, n o: if the interview should not be conducted with the resident. This option should be selected for residents who are rarely/never understood, who need an interpreter but one was not available, and who do not have a family member or significant other available for interview. Skip to F0800, (Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences) . Code 1, y es: if the resident interview should be conducted. This option should be selected for residents who are able to be understood, for whom an interpreter is not needed or is present, or who have a family member or significant other available for interview. Continue to F0400 (Interview for Daily Preferences) and F0500 (Interview for Activity Preferences). Coding Tips and Special Populations Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look-back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident needs an interpreter, every effort should be made to have an interpreter present for the MDS clinical interview. If it is not possible for a needed interpreter to be present on the day of the interview , and a family member or significant other is not available for inte rview, code F0300 = 0 to indicate interview not attempted , and complete the Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences (F0800) instead of the interview with th e resident (F0400 and F0500). If the resident interview was not conducted within the look-back period of the ARD, item F0300 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \"- \") entered in the resident interview items. Do not complete the Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences items (F0700 - F0800) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -3 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Individuals who live in nursing homes continue to have distinct lif estyle preferences. A lack of attention to lifestyle preferences can contribute to depressed mood and increased behavior symptoms. Resident responses that something is important but that they can't do it or have no choice can provide clues for understanding pain, perceived functional l imitations, and perceived environmental barriers. Planning for Care Care planning should be individualized and based on the resident's preferences. Care planning and care practices that are based on resident preferences can lead to \u2014 improved mood, \u2014 enhanced dignity, and \u2014 increased involvement in daily routines and activities. Incorporating resident preferences into care planning is a dynamic, collaborative process. Because r esidents may adjust their preferences in response to events and changes in status, the preference assessment tool is inte nded as a first step in an ongoing dialogue between care providers and the residents. Care plans should be updated as residents' preferences change, paying special attention to preferences that residents state are important. Steps for Assessment: Interview Instructions 1. Interview any resident not screened out by the Should Interview for Daily and Activity Preferences Be Conducted? item (F0 300). 2. Conduct the interview in a private setting. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -4 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences (cont.) 3. Sit so that the resident can see your face. Minimize glare by directing light sources away from the resident's face. 4. Be sure the resident can hear you. Residents with hearing impairment should be interviewed using their usual communication devices/techniques, as applicable. Try an external assistive device (headphones or hearing amplifier) if you have any doubt about hearing ability. Minimize background noise . 5. Explain the reason for the interview before beginning. Suggested language: \"I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daily routines. The reason I'm asking you these questions is that the staff here would like to know what's important to you. This helps us plan your care around your preferences so that you can have a comfortable stay with us. Even if you're only going to be here for a few days, we want to make your stay as personal as possible.\" 6. Explain the interview response choices. Whil e explaining, also show the resident a clearly written list of the response options, for example a cue card . Suggested language: \"I am going to ask you how important various activities and routines are to you while you are in this home. I will ask you to a nswer using the choices you see on this card [read the answers while pointing to can't do or no choice. '\" Explain the \"Important, but can't do or no choice\" response option. Suggested language: \"Let me explain the 'Important, but can't do or no choice' answer. You can select this answer if something would be important to you, but because of your health or because of what's available in this nu rsing home, you might not be able to do it. So, if I ask you about something that is important to you, but you don't think you're able to do it now, answer 'Important, but can't do or no choice.' If you choose this option, it will help us to think about ways we might be able to help you do those things.\" 7. Residents may respond to questions verbally , by pointing to their answers on the cue card, OR by writing out their answers . 8. If resident cannot report preferences, then interview family or significant others. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -5 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences (cont.) Coding Instructions Code 1, v ery important: if resident, family, or significant other indicates that the topic is \" very important.\" Code 2, somewhat important: if resident, family, or significant other indicates that the topic is \"somewhat i mportant.\" Code 3, not very important: if resident , family , or significant other indicates that the topic is \" not very important.\" Code 4, not important at all: if resident , family , or significant other indicates that the topic is \"not important at all .\" Code 5, important, but can't do or no choice: if resident , family, or significant other indicates that the topic is \" important,\" but that he or she is physicall y unable to participate, or has no choice about participating while staying in nursing home because of nursing home resources or scheduling. Code 9, no response or non- responsive: \u2014 If resident , family, or significant other refuses to answer or says he or she does not know. \u2014 If resident does not give an answer to the question for several seconds and does not appear to be formulating an answer. \u2014 If resident provides an incoherent or nonsensical answer that does not correspond to the question. Coding Tips and Special Populations The interview is considered incomplete if the resident gives nonsensical responses or fails to respond to 3 or more of the 16 items in F0400 and F0500. If the interview is stopped because it is considered incomplete, fill the remaining F0400 and F0500 items with a 9 and proceed to F0600, Daily Activity Preferences Primary Respondent. No look-back is provided for resident. He or she is being asked about current preferences while in the nursing home but is not limited to a 7-day look-back period to convey what his/her preferences are. The facility is still obligated to complete the interview within the 7 -day look-back period. DEFINITION NONSENSICAL RESPONSE Any unrelated, incomprehensible, or incoherent response that is not informative with respect to the item being rated. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -6 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences (cont.) Interviewing Tips and Techniques Sometimes respondents give long or indirect answers to interview items. To narrow the answer to the response choices available, it can be useful to summarize their longer answer and then ask them which response option best applies. This is known as echoing. For these questions, it is appropriate to explore residents' answers and try to understand the reason. Examples for F0400A , How Important Is It to You to Choose What Clothes to Wear (including hospital gowns or other garments provided by the facility)? 1. Resident answers, \"It's very important. I've always paid attention to my appearance. \" Coding: F0400A would be coded 1, very important . 2. Resident replies, \"I leave that up to the nurse. You have to wear what you can handle if you have a stiff leg .\" Interviewer echoes, \"You leave it up to the nurses. Would you say that, while you are here, choosing what clothes to wear is [pointing to cue card] very important, somewhat important, not very important, not important at all, or that it's important, but you can't do it because of your leg? \" Resident responds, \" Well, it would be important to me, but I just can't do it. \" Coding: F0400A would be coded 5, important, but can' t do or no choice . Examples for F0400B, How Important Is It to You to Take Care of Your Personal Belongings or Things? 1. Resident answers, \"It's somewhat important. I'm not a perfectionist, but I don't want to have to look for things. \" Coding: F0400B would be coded 2, somewhat important . 2. Resident answers, \"All my important things are at home. \" Interviewer clarifies, \"Your most important things are at home. Do you have any other things while you're here that you think are important to take care of yourself?\" Resident responds, \"Well, my son brought me this CD player so that I can listen to music. It is very important to me to take care of that. \" Coding: F0400B would be coded 1, very important . DEFINITION PERSONAL BELONGINGS OR THINGS Possessions such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, clothing, jewelry, books, toiletries, knickknacks, pictures. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -7 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences (cont.) Examples for F0400C, How Important Is It to You to Choose between a Tub Bath, Shower, Bed Bath, or Sponge Bath? 1. Resident answers, \"I like showers.\" Interviewer clarifies, \"You like showers. Would you say that choosing a shower instead of other types of bathing is very important, somewhat important, not very important, not important at all, or that it's important, but you can't do it or have no choice?\" The resident responds, \"It's very important.\" Coding: F0400C would be coded 1, very important . 2. Resident answers, \"I don't have a choice. I like only sponge baths, but I have to take shower two times a week.\" The interviewer says, \"So how important is it to you to be able to choose to have a sponge bath while you're here?\" The resident responds, \"Well, it is very important, but I don't always have a choice because that's the rule .\" Coding: F0400C would be coded 5, important, but can' t do or no choice . Example for F0400D, How Important Is It to You to Have Snacks Available between Meals? 1. Resident answers, \"I'm a diabetic, so it's very important that I get snacks .\" Coding: F0400D would be coded 1, very important . DEFINITIONS BED BATH Bath taken in bed using washcloths and water basin or other method in bed. SHOWER Bath taken standing or using gurney or shower chair in a shower room or stall. SPONGE BATH Bath taken sitting or standing at sink. TUB BATH Bath taken in bathtub. SNACK Food available between meals, including between dinner and breakfast. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -8 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences (cont.) Example for F0400E, How Important Is It to You to Choose Your Own Bedtime? 1. Resident answers, \"At home I used to stay up and watch TV. But here I'm usually in bed by 8. That's because they get me up so early .\" Interviewer echoes and clarifies, \"You used to stay up later, but now you go to bed before 8 because you get up so early. Would you say it's [pointing to cue card] very important, somewhat important, not very important, not important at all, or that it's important, but you don't have a choice about your bedtime?\" Resident responds, \" I guess it would be important, but I can't do it because they wake me up so early in the morning for therapy and by 8 o'clock at night, I'm tired. \" Coding: F0400E would be coded 5, important, but can' t do or no choice . Example for F0400F, How Important Is It to You to Have Your Family or a Close Friend Involved in Discussions about Your Care? 1. Resident responds, \"They're not involved. They live in the city. Th ey've got to take care of their own families. \" Interviewer replies , \"You said that your family and close friends aren't involved right now. When you think about what you would prefer, would you say that it's very important, somewhat important, not very important, not important at all, or that it is important but you have no choice or can't have them involved in decisions about your care?\" Resident responds, \" It's somewhat important. \" Coding: F0400F would be coded 2, somewhat important . Example for F0400G, How Important Is It to You to Be Able to Use the Phone in Private? 1. Resident answers \"That's not a problem for me, because I have my own room. If I want to make a phone call, I just shut the door.\" Interviewer echoes and clarifies, \"So, you can shut your door to make a phone call. If you had to rate how important it is to be able to use the phone in private, would you say it's very important, somewhat important, not very important, or not important at all? \" Resident responds, \"Oh, it's very important.\" Coding: F0400G would be coded 1, very important . DEFINITION PRIVATE TELEPHONE CONVERSATION A telephone conversation on which no one can listen in, other than the resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -9 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences (cont.) Example for F0400H, How Important Is It to You to Have a Place to Lock Your Things to Keep Them Safe? 1. Resident answers, \"I have a safe deposit box at my bank, and that's where I keep family heirlooms and personal documents.\" Interviewer says, \"That sounds like a good service.

F0500: Interview for Activity Preferences Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Activities are a way for individuals to establish meaning in their lives, and the need for enjoyable activities and pastimes does not change on admission to a nursing home. A lack of opportunity to engage in meaningful and enjoyable activities can result in boredom, depression, and behavior disturbances. Individuals vary in the activities they prefer, reflecting unique personalities, past interests, perceived environmental constraints, religious and cultural background, and changing physical and mental abilities . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -10 F0500: Interview for Activity Preferences (cont.) Planning for Care These questions will be useful for designing individualized care plans that facilitate residents' participation in activities they find meaningful. Preferences may change over time and extend beyond those included here. Therefore, the assessment of activity preferences is intended as a first step in an ongoing informal dialogue between the care provider and resident. As with daily routines, responses may provide insights into perceived functional, emotional, and sensory support needs. Coding Instructions See Coding Instructions on page F-4.

Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Resident interview is preferred as it most accurately reflects what the resident views as important. However, a small percentage of residents are unable or unwilling to complete the interview for Daily and Act ivity Preferences. Persons unable to complete the preference interview should still have preferences evaluated and considered.

F0800: Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [F] October 2019 Page F -16 F0800: Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Alternate means of assessing daily preferences must be used for residents who cannot communicate . This ensures that information about their preferences is not overlooked. Activities allow residents to establish meaning in their lives. A lack of meaningful and enjoyable activities can result in boredom, depression, and behavioral symptoms. Planning for Care Care giving staff should use observations of resident behaviors to understand resident likes and dislikes in cases where the resident , family , or significant other cannot report the resident's preferences . This allows care plans to be individualized to each resident. Steps for Assessment 1. Observe the resident when the care, routines, and activities specified in these items are made available to the resident. 2. Observations should be made by staff across all shifts and departments and others with close contact with the resident. 3. If the resident appears happy or content (e.g., is involved, pays attention, smiles) during an activity listed in Staff Assessment of Daily and Activity Preferences item ( F0800), then that item should be checked. If the resident seems to resist or withdraw when these are made available, then do not check that item.

In addition, on admission, resident and staff opinions regarding functional rehabilitation potential are noted. G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-2 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Almost all nursing home residents need some physical assistance. In addition, most are at risk of further physical decline. The amount of assistance needed and the risk of decline vary from resident to resident. A wide range of physical, neurological , and psychological conditions and cognitive factors can adversely affect physical function. Dependence on others for ADL assistance can lead to feelings of helplessness, isolation, diminished self-worth , and loss of control over one's destiny. As inactivity increases, complications such as pressure ulcers, falls, contractures, depression, and muscle wasting may occur. Planning for Care Individualized care plans should address strengths and weakness, possible reversible causes such as de- conditioning, and adverse side effects of medications or other treatments. These may contribute to needless loss of self -sufficiency. In addition, some neurologic injuries such as stroke may continue to improve for months after an acute event. For some residents, cognitive deficits can limit ability or willingness to initiate or participate in self -care or restrict understanding of the tasks required to complete ADLs. A resident's potential for maximum function is often underestimated by family, staff , and the resident. Individualized care plans should be based on an accurate assessment of the resident's self -performance and the amount and type of support being provided to the resident. Many residents might require lower levels of assistance if they are provided with appropriate devices and aids, assisted with segmenting tasks, or are given adequate time to complete the task while being provided graduated prompting and assistance. This type of supervision requires skill, time , and patience. DEFINITIONS ADL Tasks related to personal care; any of the tasks listed in items G0110A -J and G0120. ADL ASPECTS Components of an ADL activity. These are listed next to the activity in the item set. For example, the components of G0110H (Eating) are eating, drinking, and intake of nourishment or hydration by other means, including tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition and IV fluids for hydration. ADL SELF - PERFORMANCE Measures what the resident actually did (not what he or she might be capable of doing) within each ADL category over the last 7 days according to a performance- based scale. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-3 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) Most residents are candidates for nursing -based rehabilitative care that focuses on maintaining and expanding self-involvement in ADLs. Graduated prompting/task segmentation (helping the resident break tasks down into smaller components) and allowing the resident time to complete an activity can often increase functional independence. Steps for Assessment 1. Review t he documentation in the medical record for the 7-day look- back period. 2. Talk with direct care staff from each shift that has cared for the resident to learn what the resident does for himself during each episode of each ADL activity definition as well as the type and level of staff assistance provided. Rem ind staff that the fo cus is on the 7-day look- back period only. 3. When reviewing records, interviewing staff, and observing the resident, be spe cific in evaluating each component as listed in the ADL activity definition. For example, when evaluating Bed M obility, observe what t he resident is able to do without assistance, and then determine the level of assistance the resident require s from staff for moving to and from a lying position, for turn ing the resident from side to side, and/or for positioning the resident in bed. To cl arify your own understanding and observations about a resident's performance of an ADL activity (bed mobility, locomotion, transfer, etc.), ask probing questions, beginning with the general and proceeding to the more specific. See page G-10 for an example of using probes when talking to staff. Activities of Daily Living Definitions A. Bed mobility: how resident moves to and from lying position, turns side or side, and positions body while in bed or alternate sleep furniture. B. Transfer: how resident moves between surfaces including to or from: bed, chair, wheelchair, standing position ( excludes to/from bath/toilet) . C. Walk in room: how resident walks between locations in his/her room. D. Walk in corridor : how resident walks in corridor on unit. E. Locomotion on unit : how resident moves between locations in his/her room and adjacent corridor on same floor. If in wheelchair, self-sufficiency once in chair. F. Locomotion off unit : how resident moves to and returns from off-unit locations (e.g., areas set aside for dining, activities or treatments). If facility has only one floor , how resident moves to and from distant areas on the floor. If in wheelchair, self- sufficiency once in chair. DEFINITION ADL SUPPORT PROVIDED Measures the most support provided by staff over the last 7 days, even if that level of support only occurred once. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-4 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) G. Dressing : how resident puts on, fastens and takes off all items of clothing, including donning/removing a prosthesis or TED hose. Dressing includes putting on and changing pajamas and housedresses. H. Eating: how resident eats and drinks, regardless of skill. Do not include eating/drinking during medication pass. Includes intake of nourishment by other means (e.g., tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition, IV fluids administered for nutrition or hydration). I. Toilet use: how resident uses the toilet room, commode, bedpan, or urinal; transfers on/off toilet; pad; manages ostomy or catheter; and adjusts clothes. Do not include emptying of bedpan, urinal, bedside commode, catheter bag or ostomy bag. J. Personal hygiene: how resident maintain s personal hygiene, including combing hair, brushing teeth, shaving, applying makeup, washing/drying face and hands ( excludes baths and showers). Coding Instructions For each ADL activity: Consider all episodes of the activity that occur over a 24-hour period dur ing each day of the 7 -day look-back period, as a resident's ADL self -performance and the support required may vary from day to day, shift to shift, or within shifts. There are many possible reasons for these variations to occur , including but not li mited to, mood, medical condition, relationship issues (e.g., willing to perform for a nursing assistant that he or she likes), and medications. The responsibility of the person completing the assessment, therefore, is to capture the total picture of the r esident's ADL self -performance over the 7-day period, 24 hours a day (i.e., not only how the evaluating clinician sees the resident, but how the resident performs on other shifts as well). In order to be able to promote the highest level of functioning among residents, clinical staff must first identify what the resident actually does for himself or herself, noting when assistance is received and clarifying the type (weight -bearing, non- weight -bearing, verbal cueing, guided maneuvering, etc.) and level of assistance (supervision, limited assistance, etc.) provided by all disciplines . If a resident uses special adaptive devices such as a walker, device to assist with donning socks, dressing stick, long-handled reacher, or adaptive eating utensils, code ADL Self - Performance and ADL Support Provided based on the level of assistance the resident requires when using such items . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-5 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) For the purposes of completing Section G, \"facility staff\" pertains to direct employees and facility -contracted employees (e.g. rehabilitation staff, nursing agency staff). Thus, does not include individuals hired, compensated or not, by individuals outside of the facility's management and administration. Therefore, facility staff does not include, for example, hospice staff, nursing/CNA students, etc. Not including these individuals as facility staff supports the idea that the facility retains the primary responsibility for the care of the resident outside of the arranged ser vices another agency may provide to facility residents. The ADL Self -Performance coding level definitions are intended to reflect real world situations where slight variations in level of ADL self -performance are common. To assist in coding ADL Self- Perfo rmance items, facilities may augment the instructions with the algorithm on page G-8. This section involves a two- part ADL evaluation : Self -Performance, which measures how much of the ADL activity the resident can do for himself or herself, and Support Provided, which measures how much facility staff support is needed for the resident to complete the ADL. Each of these sections us es its own scale; therefore, it is recommended that the ADL Self -Performance evaluation (Column 1) be completed for all ADL activ ities before beginning the ADL Support evaluation (Column 2). Coding Instructions for G0110 , Column 1 , ADL Self-Performance Code 0, independent : if resident completed activity with no help or oversight every time during the 7 -day look -back period and the activity occurred at least three times. Code 1, supervision: if oversight, encouragement, or cueing was provided three or more times during the last 7 days. Code 2, limited assistance: if resident was highly involved in activity and received physical help in g uided maneuvering of limb(s) or other non- weight -bearing assistance on three or more times during the last 7 days. Code 3, extensive assistance: if resident performed part of the activity over the last 7 days and help of the following type(s) was provided three or more times : \u2014 Weight -bearing support provided three or more times , OR \u2014 Full staff performance of activity three or more times during part but not all of the last 7 days. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-6 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) Code 4, total dependence: if there was full staff performance of an activity with no participation by resident for any aspect of the ADL activity and the activity occurred three or more times . The resident must be unwilling or unable to perform any part of the activity over the entire 7 -day look-back period. Code 7, a ctivity occurred only once or twice: if the activity occurred fewer than three times . Code 8, a ctivity did not occur : if the activity did not occur or family and/or non- facility staff provided care 100% of the time for that activity over the entire 7 -day look- back period. The Rule of 3 The \"Rule of 3\" is a method that was developed to help determine the appropriate code to document ADL Self-Performance on the MDS. It is very important that staff who complete this section fully understand the components of each ADL, the ADL Self -Performance coding level definitions, and the Rule of 3. In order to properly apply the Rule of 3, the facility must first note which ADL activities occurred, how many times each ADL activity occurred, what type and what level of support was required for each ADL activity over the entire 7- day lo ok-back period. The following ADL Self- Performance coding levels are exceptions to the Rule of 3: \u2014 Code 0, Independent - Coded only if the resident completed the ADL activity with no help or oversight every time the ADL activity occurred during the 7- day l ook- back period and the activity occurred at least three times. \u2014 Code 4, Total dependence - Coded only if the resident required full staff performance of the ADL activity every time the ADL activity occurred during the 7-day look-back period and the activity occurred three or more times . \u2014 Code 7, Activity occurred only once or twice - Coded if the ADL activity occurred fewer than three times in the 7-day look back period. \u2014 Code 8, Activity did not occur - Coded only i f the ADL activity did not occur or family and/or non-facility staff provided care 100% of the time for that activity over the entire 7 -day look-back period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-7 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) Instructions for the Rule of 3: When an ADL activity has occurred three or more times , apply the steps of the Rule of 3 below (keeping the ADL coding level definitions and the above exceptions in mind) to determine the code to enter in Column 1, ADL Self -Performance. These steps must be used in sequence. Use the first instruction encountered that meets the coding s cenario (e.g., if #1 applies, stop and code that level ). 1. When an activity occurs three or more times at any one level , code that level. 2. When an activity occurs three or more times at multiple levels, code the most dependent level that occurred three or more times . 3. When an activity occurs three or more times and at multiple levels, but not three times at any one level , apply the following: a. Conver t episodes of full staff performance to weight -bearing assistance when applying the third Rule of 3, as long as the full staff performance episodes did not occur every time the ADL was performed in the 7 -day look- back period. It is only when every episode is full staff performance that Total dependence (4) can be coded. Remember, that weight -bearing episodes that occur three or more times or full staff performance that is provided three or more times during part but not all of the last 7 days are included i n the ADL Self -Performance coding level definition for Extensive assistance (3). b. When there is a combination of full staff performance and weight -bearing assistance that total three or more times \u2014code extensive assistance (3). c. When there is a combination of full staff performance /weight -bearing assistance, and/or non- weight -bearing assistance that total three or more times \u2014code limited assistance (2). If none of the above are met, code supervision .

Start by counting the number of episodes at each ADL Self -Performance Level. * Exceptions to Rule of 3: - The Rule of 3 does not apply when coding Independent (0), Total Dependence (4) or Activity Did Not Occur (8), since these levels must be EVERY time the ADL occurred during the look- back period. - The Rule of 3 does not apply when Activity Occurred Only Once or Twice (7), since the activity did not occur at least 3 times. Rule of 3: 1. When an activity occurs 3 or more times at any one level, code that level - *note exceptions for Independent (0) and Total Dependence (4). 2. When an activity occurs 3 or more times at multiple levels, code the most dependent level that occurs 3 or more times - *note exceptions for Independent (0) and Total Dependence (4). 3. When an activity occurs 3 or more times and a t multiple levels, but NOT 3 times at any one level , apply the following in sequence as listed - stop at the first level that applies: (NOTE: This 3rd rule only applies if there are NOT ANY LEVELS that are 3 or more episodes at any one level . DO NOT proceed to 3a, 3b or 3c unless this criteria is met.) a. Convert episodes of Total Dependence (4) to Extensive Assistance (3) . b.

Differentiating between guided maneuvering and weight -bearing assistance: determine who is supporting the weight of the resident's extremity or body . For example, if the staff member supports some of the weight of the resident's hand while helping the resident to eat (e.g., lifting a spoon or a cup to mouth), or performs part of the activity for the resident, this is \"weight- bearing\" assistance for this activity. If the resident can lift the utensil or cup, but staff assistance is needed to guide the resident's hand to his or her mouth, this is guided maneuvering. Do NOT record the staff 's assessment of the resident 's potential capability to perform the ADL activity. The assessment of potential capability is covered in ADL Functional Rehabilitation Potential Item (G0900). Do NOT record the type and level of assistance that the resident \"should\" be receiving according to the written plan of care. The level of assistance actually provided might be very different from what is indicated in the plan. Record what actually happened. Some residents are transferred between surfaces, including to and from the bed, chair, and wheelchair, by staff, using a full-body mechanical lift. Whether or not the resident holds onto a bar, strap, or other device during the full- body mechanical lift trans fer is not part of the transfer activity and should not be considered as resident participation in a transfer. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-10 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) Transfers via lifts that require the resident to bear weight during the transfer, suc h as a stand -up lift, should be coded as Extensive Assistance, as the resident participated in the transfer and the lift provided weight -bearing support. How a resident turns from side to side, in the bed, during incontinence care, is a component of Bed Mobility and should not be considered as part of Toileting. When a resident is transferred into or out of bed or a chair for incontinence care or to use the bedpan or urinal, the transfer is coded in G0110B, Transfers. How the resident uses the bedpan or ur inal is coded in G0110I, Toilet use . Do NOT include assistance provided by family or other visitors . Some examples for coding for ADL Support Setup Help when the activity involves the following: \u2014 Bed Mobility \u2014handing the resident the bar on a trapeze, staff raises the \u00bd rails for the resident's use and then provides no further help. \u2014 Transfer\u2014 giving the resident a transfer board or locking the wheels on a wheelchair for safe transfer. \u2014 Locomotion o Walking \u2014handing the resident a walker or cane. o Whe eling \u2014unlocking the brakes on the wheelchair or adjusting foot pedals to facilitate foot motion while wheeling. \u2014 Dressing \u2014retrieving clothes from the closet and laying out on the resident 's bed; handing the resident a shirt. \u2014 Eating \u2014cutting meat and opening containers at meals; giving one food item at a time. \u2014 Toilet Use \u2014handing the resident a bedpan or placing articles necessary for changing an ostomy appliance within reach. \u2014 Personal Hygiene \u2014providing a washbasin and grooming articles. Supervision \u2014 Code S uperv ision for residents seated together or in close proximity of one an other during a meal who receive individual supervision with eating. \u2014 General supervision of a dining room is not the same as individual supervision of a resident and is not captured in the c oding for Eating . Coding activity did not occur, 8: \u2014 Toileting would be coded 8, activity did not occur : only if elimination did not occur during the entire look- back period, or if family and/or non- facility staff toileted the resident 100% of the time over the entire 7 -day look- back period. \u2014 Locomotion would be coded 8, activity did not occur : if the resident was on bed rest and did not get out of bed, and there was no locomotion via bed, wheelchair, or other means during the look- back period or if locomotion assistance was provided by family and/or non- facility staff 100 % of the time over th e entire 7 -day look- back period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-11 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) \u2014 Eating would be coded 8, activity did not occur : if the resident received no nourishment by any route (oral, IV, TPN, enteral) during the 7-day look-back period, if the resident was not fed by facility staff during the 7-day look-back period, or if family and/or non- facility staff fed the resident 100% of the time over the entire 7 -day look- back period. Coding activity occurred only once or twice, 7: \u2014 Walk in corridor would be coded 7, activity occurred only once or twice: if the resident came out of the room and ambulated in the hallway for a weekly tub bath but otherwise stayed in the room during the 7- day look -back period. \u2014 Locomotion off unit would be coded 7, activity occurred only once or twice: if the resident left the vicinity of his or her room only one or two times to attend an activity in another part of the building. Residents with tube feeding, TPN , or IV fluids \u2014 Code extensive assistance (1 or 2 persons): if the resident with tube feeding, TPN, or IV fluids did not participate in management of this nutrition but did participate in receiving oral nutrition. This is the correct code because the staff completed a portion of the ADL activity for the resident (managing the tube feeding, TPN, or IV fluids). \u2014 Code t otally dependent in e ating: only if resident was assisted in eating all food items and liquids at all meals and snacks (including tube feeding delivered totally by staff) and di d not participate in any aspect of eating (e.g., did not pick up finger foods, did not give self tube feeding or assist with swallow or eating procedure) . Example of a Probing Conversation with Staff 1. Example of a probing conversation between the RN Assessment Coordinator and a nursing assistant (NA) regarding a resident 's bed mobility assessment: RN: \"Describe to me how Mrs. L. moves herself in bed. By that I mean once she is in bed, how does she move from sitting up to lying down, lying down to sitting up, turning side to side and positioning herself?\" NA: \"She can lay down and sit up by herself, but I help her turn on her side.\" RN: \"She lays down and sits up without any verbal instructions or physical help?\" NA: \"No, I have to remind her to use her trapeze every time. But once I tell her how to do things, she can do it herself.\" RN: \"How do you help her turn side to side?\" NA: \"She can help turn herself by g rabbing onto her side rail. I tell her what to do. But she needs me to lift her bottom and guide her legs into a good position.\" RN: \"Do you lift her by yourself or does someone help you?\" NA: \"I do it by myself.\" RN: \"How many times during the last 7 days did you give this type of help?\" NA: \"Every day, probably 3 times each day.\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-12 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) In this example, the assessor inquired specifically how Mrs. L. moves to and from a lying position, how she turns from side to side, and how the resident positions herself while in bed. A resident can b e independent in one aspect of bed mobility, yet require extensive assistance in another aspect , so be sure to consider each activity definition fully. If the RN did not probe further, he or she would not have received enough information to make an accurate assessment of the actual assistance Mrs. L . received. This information is important to know and document because accurate coding and supportive documentation provides the basis for reporting on the type and amount of care provided. Coding: Bed M obility ADL assistance would be coded 3 (self -performance) and 2 (support provided), extensive assistance with a one person assist . Examples for G0110A , Bed Mobility 1. Mrs. D . can easily turn and position herself in bed and is able to sit up and lie down without any staff assistance at any time during the 7 -day look-back period. She requires use of a single side rail that staff place in the up position when she is in bed . Coding : G0110A1 would be coded 0, independent . G0110A2 would be coded 1, setup help only . Rationale: Resident is independent at all times in bed mobility during the 7 -day look- back period and needs only setup help. 2. Resident favors lying on her right side. Because she has had a history of skin breakdown, staff must verbally remind her to reposition off her right side daily during the 7-day look-back period. Coding: G0110A1 would be coded 1, supervision . G0110A2 would be coded 0, no setup or physical help from staff . Rationale: Resident req uires staff supervision, cueing, and reminders for repositioning more than three times during the look- back period. 3. Resident favors lying on her right side. Because she has had a history of skin breakdown, staff must sometimes cue the resident and guide (non-weight -bearing assistance) the resident to place her hands on the side rail and encourage her to change her position when in bed daily over the 7-day look- back p eriod. Coding: G0110A1 would be coded 2, limited assistance . G0110A2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: Resident requires cu eing and encouragement with setup and non- weight - bearing physical help daily during the 7 -day look-back period.

Coding: G0110B1 would be coded 0, independent . G0110B2 would be coded 0, no setup or physical help from staff . Rationale: Resident is independent each and every time she transferred during the 7- day look-back period and required no setup or physical help from staff. 2. Staff must supervise the resident as she transfers from her bed to wheelc hair daily. Staff must bring the chair next to the bed and then remind her to hold on to the chair and position her body slowly . Coding: G0110B1 would be coded 1, supervision . G0110B2 would be coded 1, setup help only . Rationale: Resident requires staff supervision, cueing, and reminders for safe transfer. This activity happened daily over the 7-day look-back period. 3. Mrs. H . is able to transfer from the bed to chair when she uses her walker. Staff place the walker near her bed and then assist the r esident with guided maneuvering as she transfers.

Mr. T. is in a physically debilitated state due to surgery. Two staff members must physically lift and transfer him to a reclining chair daily using a mechanical lift. Mr. T. is unable to assist or participate in any way. Coding: G0110B1 would be coded 4, total dependence . G0110B2 would be coded 3, two+ persons physical assist . Rationale: Resident di d not participa te and required two staff to transfer him out of his bed. The resident was transferred out of bed to the chair daily during the 7- day look- back period. 6. Mrs. D . is post -operative for extensive surgical procedures. Because of her ventilator dependent status in addition to multiple surgical sites, her physician has determined that she must remain on total bed rest. During the 7- day look- back period the resident was not moved from the bed. Coding: G0110B1 would be coded 8, activity did not occur . G0110B2 would be coded 8, ADL activity itself did not occur during entire period . Rationale: Activity did not occur. 7. Mr. M . has Parkinson's d isease and needs weight -bearing assistance of two staff to tra nsfer from his bed to his wheel chair. During the 7 -day look- back per iod, Mr. M. was transferred once from the bed to the wheelchair and once from wheelchair to bed.

This occurred multiple times each day during the 7- day look-back period. Coding: G0110I1 would be coded 2, limited assistance . G0110I2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: Resident requi red staff to perform non -weight -bearing activities to complete the task multiple times each day during the 7 -day look-back period. 4. Mrs. M. has had recent bouts of vertigo. During the 7-day look-back period, the resident required one staff member to assist and provide weight- bearing support to her as she transfe rred to the bedside commode four times. Coding: G0110I1 would be coded 3, extensive assistance . G0110I2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: During the 7-day look-back period, the resident required weight- bearing assistance with the support of one staff member to use the commode four times. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-20 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) 5. Miss W . is cognitively and physically impaired . During the 7-day look-back period, she was on strict bed rest. Staff w ere unable to physically transfer her to toilet during this time. Miss W. is incontinent of both bowel and bladder. One staff member was required to provide all the care for her elimination and hygiene needs several times each day . Coding: G0110I1 would be coded 4, total dependence . G0110I2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: Resident did not participate and required one staff person to provide total care for toileting and hygiene each time during the entire 7 -day look- back period. Examples for G0110J, Personal Hygiene 1. The nurse assistant takes Mr. L.'s comb, toothbrush, and toothpaste from the drawer and places them at the bathroom sink. Mr. L. combs his own hair and brushes his own teeth daily. During the 7-day look-back period, he required cueing to brush his teeth on three occasions. Coding: G0110J1 would be coded 1, supervision . G0110J2 would be coded 1, setup help only . Rationale: Staff placed grooming devices at sink for his use, and during the 7-day look- back period staff provided cueing three times. 2. Mrs. J . normally completes all hygiene tasks independently. Three mornings during the 7- day look- back period, however, she was unable to brush and style her hair because of elbow pain, so a staff member did it for her. Coding: G0110J1 would be coded 3, extensive assistance . G0110J2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: A staff member had to complete part of the activity of personal hygiene for the resident 3 out of 7 days during the look- back period . The assistance, although non- weight -bearing, is considered full staff performance of the personal hygiene sub-task of brushing and styling her hair. B ecause th is ADL sub -task was completed for the resident 3 times, but not every time during the last 7 days, it qualifies under the second criterion of the extensive assistance definition . Scenario Examples 1. Scenario: The following dressing assistance was provided to Mr. X during the look-back period: Two times, he required guided maneuvering of his arms to don his shirt; this assistance was non -weight -bearing assistance. Four times, he required the staff to assist him to put his shirt on due to pain in his shoulders. Duri ng these four times that the staff had to assist Mr. X to put his shirt on, the staff had to physically assist him by lifting each of his arms. This component of the dressing activity occurred six times in the 7 -day look-back period. There were two times w here Mr. X required non- weight -bearing assistance and four times where he required weight - bearing assistance, therefore the appropriate code to enter on the MDS is Extensive assistance (3). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-21 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) Ratio nale: This ADL activity component occurred six times in the 7- day look- back period. Mr. X required limited assistance two times and weight -bearing (extensive) assistance four times. Lifting the resident's arms is considered weight -bearing assistance. The A DL activity component occurred three or more times at one level, extensive - thus, this weight -bearing assistance is the highest level of dependence identified that occurred three or more times. The scenario is consistent with the ADL Self-Performance codi ng level definition of Extensive assistance and meets the first Rule of 3. The assessor uses the steps in the Rule of 3 in sequence and stops once one has been identified as applying to the scenario. Therefore the final code that should be entered in Colum n 1, ADL Self -Performance, G0110G - Dressing is Extensive assistance (3). 2. Scenario: The following assistance was provided to Mr s. C over the last seven days: Four times, she required verbal cueing for hand placement during stand- pivot transfers to her whe elchair and three times she required weight -bearing assistance to help her rise from the wheelchair, steady her and help her turn with her back to the edge of the bed. Once she was at the edge of the bed and put her hand on her transfer bar, she was able t o sit. She completed the activity without assistance the 14 remaining instances during the 7- day look- back period. The four times that she required verbal cueing from the staff for hand placement are considered supervision. The three times that the staff h ad to physically support Mrs. C during a portion of the transfer are considered weight -bearing assistance. This ADL occurred 21 times over the 7 -day look- back period. There were three or more times where supervision was required, and three times where weig ht-bearing assistance was required; therefore, the appropriate code to enter on the MDS is Extensive assistance (3). Rationale: The ADL activity occurred 21 times over the 7- day look- back period. Mrs. C required supervision four times and weight -bearing assistance was provided three times during the 7 -day look- back period. The ADL activity also occurred three or more times at multiple levels (four times with supervision, three times with weight-bearing assistance, and 14 times without assistance). Weight -bearing assistance is also the highest level of dependence identified that occurred three or more times. The first Rule of 3 does not apply because the ADL activity occurred three or more times at multiple levels, not three o r more times at any one level. B ecause the ADL activity occurred three or more times at multiple levels, the scenario meets the second Rule of 3 and the assessor will apply the most dependent level that occurred three or more times. Note that this scenario does meet the definition of Extensive assistance as well, since the activity occurred at least three times and there was weight -bearing support provided three times. The final code that should be entered in Column 1, ADL Self - Performance, G0110B - Transfer is Extensive assistance (3). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-22 G0110: of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance ( cont.) 3. Scenario: Mrs. F. was in the nursing home for only one day prior to transferring to another facility. While there, she was unable to complete a component of the eating ADL activity without assistance three times. The following assistance was provided: Twice she requ ired weight -bearing assistance to help lift her fork to her mouth. One time in the evening, the staff fed Mrs. F. because she could not scoop the food on her plate with the fork, nor could she lift the fork to her mouth. The three times that Mrs. F. could not complete the activity, the staff had to physically assist her by either holding her hand as she brought the fork to her mouth, or by actually feeding her. There were two times where the staff provided weight -bearing assistance and one time where they p rovided full staff performance. This component of the ADL eating activity where assistance was required, occurred three times in the look -back period, but not three times at any one level. Based on the third Rule of 3, the final code determination is Exten sive assistance (3). Rationale: Eating occurred three times in the look- back period during the day that Mrs. F was in the nursing home. Mrs. F per formed part of the activity by scooping the food and holding her fork two times, but staff had to assist by l ifting her arm to her mouth resulting in two episode s of weight -bearing assistance. The other time, the staff had to feed Mrs. F. The firs t Rule of 3 does not apply be cause even though the ADL assistance occurred three or more times, it did not occur three times at any one level. The second Rule of 3 does not apply because even though the ADL assistance occurred three or more times it did not occur three or more times at multiple levels. The third Rule of 3 applies since the ADL assistance occurred three ti mes at multiple levels but not three times at any one level. Sub- item \"a\" under the third Rule of 3 states to convert episodes of full staff performance to weight -bearing assistance as long as the full staff performance episodes did not occur every time the ADL was performed in the 7 -day look- back period. Therefore, the one episode of full staff performance is considered weight -bearing assistance and can be added to the other two episodes of weight -bearing assistance. This now totals three episodes of weigh t- bearing assistance. Therefore, according to the application of the third Rule of 3 and the first two sub -items , \"a\" and \"b,\" the correct code to enter in Column 1, ADL Self - Performance, G0110H, Eating is Extensive ass istance (3). Note that none of the ADL Self-Performance coding level definitions apply directly to this scenario. It is only through the application of the third Rule of 3 and the first two sub- items that the facility is able to code this item as extensive assistance. 4. Scenario: Mr. N was ad mitted to the facility, but was sent to the hospital on the 2nd day he was there. The following assistance was provided to Mr. N over the look- back period: Weight -bearing assistance one time to lift Mr. N's right arm into his shirt sleeves when dressing in the morning on day one, non- weight -bearing assistance one time to button his shirt in the morning on day two, and full staff performance one time on day two to put on his pants on after re sting in bed in the afternoon. Mr. N was independent in the evening on day one when undressing and getting his bed clothes on. Based on the application of the third Rule of 3s sub- items, the final code determination is Limited assis tance (2). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-23 of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance ( cont.) Rationale: There was one episode where Mr. N required full staff performance to put his pants on, one episode of weight -bearing assistance to put his right arm into his shirt sleeve, and one episode of non- weight -bearing assistance to button his shirt. The first Rule of 3 does not apply because even though the ADL assistance occurred three times, it did not occur three times at any one level. The second Rule of 3 does not apply because even though the ADL assistance occurred three times it did not occur three times at multiple levels. The third Rule of 3 applies because the activity occurred three times, and at multiple levels but not three times at any one level. The third Rule of 3, sub-item \"a,\" instructs providers to convert episodes of full staff performance to weight -bearing assistance. Therefore, there are now two weight -bearing episodes and one non- weight -bearing episode. The third Rule of 3, sub- item \"b,\" does not apply because even though there are two episodes of weight -bearing assistance, there are not enough weight -bearing episodes to consider it Extensive assistance. There is one episode of non- weight -bearing assista nce that can be accounted for. The third sub- item, \"c,\" under the third Rule of 3 applies because there is a combination of full staff performance/weight -bearing assistance and/or non -weight -bearing assistance that together total three times (two episodes of weight -bearing assistance and one episode of non-weight -bearing assistance). Therefore, the appropriate code is Limited assistance (2) whi ch is the correct code to enter in Column 1, ADL Self -Performance, G0110G, Dressing. Note that none of the ADL Self -Performance coding level definitions apply directly to this scenario. It is only through the application of the third Rule of 3, working thr ough all of the sub- items, that the facility is able to code this item as Limited assistance. 5. Scenario: During the look- back period, Mr. S was able to toilet independentl y without assistance 18 times. The other two times toileting occurred during the 7- day look- back period, he required the assistance of staff to pull the zipper up on his pants. This assistance is classified as non- weight -bearing assistance. The assessor determined that the appropriate code for G0100I, Toilet use was Code 1, Supervision. Rationale: Toilet use occurred 20 times during the look- back period. Non -weight - bearing assistance was provided two times and 18 times the resident used the toilet independently. When the assessor began looking at the ADL Self -Performance coding level definitions, she determined that Independent (i.e., Code 0) cannot be the code entered on the MDS for this ADL activity because in order to be coded as Independent (0), the resident must complete the ADL without any help or oversight from staff every time. Since Mr. S did require assistance to complete the ADL two times, Code 0 does not apply. Code 7, Activity occurred only once or twice, did not apply to this scenario because even though assistance was provided twice during the look- back period, the activity itse lf actually occurred 20 times. The assessor also determined that the assistance provided to the resident does not meet the definition for Limited Assistance (2) because even though the assistance was non -weight -bearing, it was only provided twice in the lo ok-back period, and that the ADL Self -Performance coding level definitions for Codes 1, 3 and 4 did not apply directly to this scenario either. The assessor continued to apply the coding instructions, looking at the Rule of 3. The first Rule of 3 does not apply because even though the ADL activity occurred three or more CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-24 G0110: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assistance (cont.) times, the non- weight -bearing assistance occurred only twice. The second Rule of 3 does not apply because even though the ADL occurred three or more times , it did not occur three times at multiple levels , and the third Rule of 3 does not apply because the ADL occurred three or more times, at the independent level. Since the third Rule of 3 did not apply, the assessor knew not to appl y any of the sub -items. However, the final instruction to the provider is that when neither the Rule of 3 nor the ADL Self-Performance coding level definitions apply, the appropriate code to enter in Column 1, ADL Self -Performance, is Supervision (1); therefore, in G0110I, Toilet use, the code Supervision (1) was entered. G0120: Bathing Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The resident's choices regarding his or her bathing schedule should be accommodated when possible so that facility routine does not conflict with resident's desired routine. Planning for Care The care plan should include interventions to address the resident's unique needs for bathing. These interventions should be periodically evaluated and, if objectives were not met, alternative approaches developed to encourage maintenance of bathi ng abilities. Coding Instructions for G0120 A, Self-Performance Code for the maximum amount of assistance the resident received during the bathing episodes. Code 0, independent: if the resident required no help from staff. Code 1, s upervision: if the resident required oversight help only. Code 2, physical help limited to transfer only: if the resident is able to perform the bathing activity, but required help with the transfer only. DEFINITION BATHING How the resident takes a full body bath, shower or sponge bath, including transfers in and out of the tub or shower. It does not include the washing of back or hair. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-25 G0120: Bathing (cont.) Code 3, p hysical help in part of bathing activity : if the resident required assistance with some aspect of bathing. Code 4, total dependence: if the resident is unable to participate in any of the bathing activity. Code 8, ADL a ctivity itself did not occur during entire period: if the activity did not occur or family and/or non-facility staff provided care 100% of the time for that activity over the entire 7 -day period. Coding Instructions for G0120B , Support Provided Bathing support codes a re as defined ADL Support Provided item ( G0110), Column 2. Coding Tips Bathing is the only ADL activity for which the ADL Self -Performance codes in Item G0110, Column 1 (Self -Performance) , do not apply. A unique s et of self -performance codes is used in the bathing assessment given that bathing may not occur as frequently as the other ADLs in the 7-day look-back period. If a nursing home has a policy that all residents are supervised when bathing (i.e., they are never left alone while in the bathroom for a bath or shower, regardless of resident capability ), it is appropriate to code the resident self -performance as supervision , even if the supervision is precautionary because the resident is still being individually supervised. Support for bathing in this instance would be coded according to whether or not the staff had to actually assist the resident during the bathing activity. Examples 1. Resident received verbal cueing and encouragement to take twice-weekly showers. Once staff walked resident to bathroom, he bathed himself with periodic oversight. Coding : G0120A would be coded 1, supervision . G0120B would be coded 0, no setup or physical help from staff . Rationale: Resident needed only supervision to perform the bathing activity with no setup or physical help from staff. 2. For one bath, the resident received physical help of one person to position self in bathtub. However , because of her fluctuating moods, she received total help for her other bath from one staff member. Coding : G0120A would be coded 4, total dependence . G0120B would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: Coding directions for bathing state, \"code for most dependent in self- performance and support.\" Resident's most dependent episode during the 7-day look- back period was total help with the bathing activity with assist from one staff person. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-26 G0120: Bathing (cont.) 3. On Monday, one staff member helped transfer resident to tub and washed his legs. On Thursday, the resident had physical help of one person to get into tub but washed himself completely. Coding : G0120A would be coded 3, physical help in part of bathing activity. G0120B would be coded 2, one person physical assist . Rationale: Resident's most dependent episode during the 7-day look-back period was assistance with part of the bathing activity from one staff person. G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Individuals with impaired balance and unsteadiness during transitions and walking \u2014 are at increased risk for falls; \u2014 often are afraid of falling; \u2014 may limit their physical and social activity, becoming socially isolated and despondent about limitations ; and \u2014 can become incr easingly immobile. Planning for Care Individuals with impaired balance and unsteadiness should be evaluated for the need for \u2014 rehabilitation or assistive devices ; \u2014 supervision or physical assistance for safety; and/or \u2014 environmental modification. Care plan ning should focus on preventing further decline of function, and/or on return of function, depending on resident- specific goals. DEFINITION INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM Refers to a team that includes staff from multiple disciplines such as nursing, therapy, physicians, and other advanced practitioners. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-27 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Assessment should identify all related risk factors in order to develop effective care plans to maintain current abilities, slow decline , and/or promote improvement in the resident's functional ability . Steps for Assessment 1. Complete this assessment for all residents. 2. Throughout the 7-day look-back period, interdisciplinary team members should carefully observe and document observations of the resident during transitions from sitting to standing, walking, turning, transferring on and off toilet, and transferring from wheelchair to bed and bed to wheelchair (for residents w ho use a wheelchair). 3. If staff have not systematically documented the resident's stability in these activities at least once during the 7- day look-back period, use the following process to code these items: a. Before beginning the activity, explain what the task is and what you are observing for. b. Have assistive devices the resident normally uses available. c. Start with the resident sitting up on the edge of his or her bed, in a chair or in a wheelchair (if he or she generally uses one). d. Ask the resident to stand up and stay still for 3-5 seconds. Moving from seated to standing position (G0300A ) should be rated at this time. e. Ask the resident to walk approximately 15 feet using his or her usual assistive device. Walking (G0300B ) should be rated at this time. f. Ask the resident to turn around. Turning around (G 0300C ) should be rated at this time. g. Ask the resident to walk or wheel from a starting point in his or her room into the bathroom, prepare for toileting as he or she normally does (including taking down pants or other clothes; underclothes can be kept on for this observation), and sit on the toilet. Moving on and off toilet (G0300D ) should be rated at this time. h. Ask residents who are not ambulatory and who use a wheelchair for mobility to transfer from a seated position in the wheelchair to a seated position on the bed. Surface- to- surface transfer should be rated at this time (G 0300E). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-28 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Balance During Transitions and Walking Algorithm Coding Instructions G0300A, Moving from Seated to Standing Position Code for the least steady episode, using assistive device if applicable. Code 0, steady at all times: \u2014 If all of the transitions fro m seated to standing position and from stand ing to seated position observed during the 7 -day look-back period are steady. \u2014 If resident is stable when standing up using the arms of a chair or an assistive device identified for this purpose (such as a walker, locked wheelchair, or grab bar). \u2014 If an as sistive device or equipment is used, the resident appropriately plans and integrates the use of the device into the transition activity. \u2014 If resident appears steady and not at risk of a fall when standing up. Did the activity occur? Code 8 Activity did not occurNo Yes Did the person require physical assistance? Code 2 Not steady Only able to stabilize with staff assistanceYes No Was the person steady with or without an assistive device that is intentionally for and appropriate for the activity? NoCode 0 SteadyYes Code 1 Not Steady but able to stabilize without staff assistanceCMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-29 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Code 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance: \u2014 If any of transitions from seated to standing position or from standing to seated position during the 7- day look-back period are not steady, but the resident is able to stabilize without assistance from staff or object (e.g. , a chair or table). \u2014 If the res ident is unsteady using an assistive device but does not require staff assistance to stabilize. \u2014 If the resident attempts to stand, sits back down, then is able to stand up and stabilize without assistance from staff or object. \u2014 Residents coded in this cate gory appear at increased risk for falling when standing up. Code 2 , not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance: \u2014 If any of transitions from seated to standing or from standing to sitting are not steady, and the resident cannot stabilize without assistance from staff . \u2014 If the resident cannot st and but can transfer unassisted without staff assistance. \u2014 If the resident r eturned back to a seated position or was unable to move from a seated to standing or from standing to sitting position during the look-back period. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at high risk f or falling during transitions. \u2014 If a lift device (a me chanical device operated by another person) is used because the resident requires staff assistance to stabilize, code as 2. Code 8, activity did not occur: if the resident did not move from seated to standing position during the 7-day look-back period. Examples for G0300A , Moving from Seated to Standing Position 1. A resident sits up in bed, stands, and begins to sway, but steadies herself and sits down smoothly into her wheelchair. Coding: G0300A would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance . Rationale: Resident was unsteady, but she was able to stabilize herself without assistance from staff. 2. A resident requires the use of a gait belt and physical assistance in order to stand. Coding: G0300A would be coded 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance . Rationale: Resident required staff assistance to stand during the observation period. DEFINITION UNSTEADY Residents may appear unbalanced or move with a sway or with uncoordinated or jerking movements that make them unsteady. They might exhibit unsteady gaits such as fast gaits with large, careless movements; abnormally slow gaits with small shuffling steps; or wide - based gaits with halting, tentative steps. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-30 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) 3. A resident stands steadily by pushing himself up using the arms of a chair. Coding: G0300A would be coded 0, steady at all times . Rationale: Even though the resident used the arms of the chair to push himself up, he was steady at all times during the activity. 4. A resident locks his wheelchair and uses the arms of his wheelchair to attempt to stand. On the first attempt, he rises about halfway to a standing position then sits back down. On the second attempt, he is able to stand steadily. Coding: G0300A would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance . Rationale: Even though the second attempt at standing was steady, the first attempt suggests he is unsteady and at risk for falling during this transition. Coding Instructions G0300B , Walking (with Assistive Device if Used) Code for the least steady episode, using assistive device if applicable. Code 0, steady at all times: \u2014 If during the 7-day look-back period the resident's walking (with assistive devices if used) is steady at all times. \u2014 If an assistive device or equipment is used, the resident appropriately plans and integrates the use of the device and is steady while walking with it. \u2014 Residents in this category do not appear at risk for falls. \u2014 Residents who walk with an abnormal gait and/or with an assistive device can be steady, and if they are they should be coded in this category. Code 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assis tance: \u2014 If during the 7-day look-back period the resident appears unsteady while walking (with assistive devices if used) but does not require staff assistance to stabilize. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at risk for falling while walking. Code 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance: \u2014 If during the 7-day look- back period the resident at any time appeared unsteady and required staff assistance to be stable and safe while walking. \u2014 If the resident fell when walking during the look-back period. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at high risk for falling while walking. Code 8, activity did not occur: \u2014 If the resident did not walk during the 7-day look-back period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-31 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Exampl es for G0300B , Walking (with Assistive Device if Used) 1. A resident with a recent stroke walks using a hemi -walker in her right hand because of left - sided weakness. Her gait is slow and short- stepped and slightly unsteady as she walks, she leans to the left and drags her left foot along the ground on most steps. She has not had to steady herself using any furniture or grab bars. Coding: G0300B would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance. Rationale : Resident's gait is unsteady with or without an assistive device but does not require staff assistance . 2. A resident with Parkinson's disease ambulates with a walker. His posture is stooped, and he walks slowly with a short-stepped shuffling gait. On some occasions, his gait speeds up, and it appears he has difficulty slowing down. On multiple occasions during the 7- day observation period he has to steady himself using a handrail or a piece of furniture in addition to his walker. Coding: G0300B would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance. Rationale: Resident has an unsteady gait but can stabilize himself using an object such as a handrail or piece of furniture. 3. A resident who had a recent total hip replacement ambulates with a walker. Although she is able to bear weight on her affected side, she is unable to advance her walker safely without staff assistance. Coding: G0300B would be coded 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance. Rationale: Resident requires staff assistance to walk steadily and safely at any time during the observation period. 4. A resident with multi- infarct dementia walks with a short-stepped, shuf fling -type gait. Despite t he gait abnormality, she is steady. Coding: G0300B would be coded 0, steady at all times . Rationale: Resident walks steadily (with or without a normal gait and/or the use of an assistive device) at all times during the observatio n period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-32 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Coding Instructions G0300C, Turning Around and Facing the Opposite Direction while Walking Code for the least steady episode, using an assistive device if applicable. Code 0, steady at all times: \u2014 If all observed turns to face the opposite direction are steady without assistance of a staff during the 7-day look-back period. \u2014 If the resident is stable making these turns when using an assistive device. \u2014 If an assistive device or equipment is used, the resident appropriately plans and integrates the use of the device into the transition activity. \u2014 Residents coded as 0 should not appear to be at risk of a fall during a transition. Code 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance: \u2014 If any transition that involves turning around to face the opposite direction is not steady, but the resident stabilizes without assistance from a staff. \u2014 If the resident is unstable with an assistive device but does not require staff assistance. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at increased risk for falling during transitions. Code 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance: \u2014 If any transition that involves turning around to face the opposite direction is not steady, and the resident cannot stabilize without assistance from a staff. \u2014 If the resident fell when turning around to face the opposite direction during the look-back period. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at high risk for falling during transitions. Code 8, activity did not occur: \u2014 If the resident did not turn around to face the opposite direction while walking during the 7 -day look-back period. Examples for G0300C , Turning Around and Facing the Opposite Direction while Walking 1. A resident with Alzheimer's disease frequently wanders on the hallway. On one occasion, a nursing assistant noted that he was about to fall when turning around. However, by the time she got to him, he had steadied himself on the handrail. Coding: G0300C would be coded 1, Not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance. Rationale: The resident was unsteady when turning but able to steady himself on an object, in this instance, a handrail. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-33 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) 2. A resident with severe arthritis in her knee ambulates with a single -point cane. A nursing assistant observes her lose her balance while turning around to sit in a chair. The nursing assistant is able t o get to her before she falls and lower s her gently into the chair. Coding: G0300C would be coded 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance. Rationale: The resident was unsteady when turning around and would have fallen without staff assistance. Coding for G0300D, Moving on and off Toilet Code for the least steady episode of moving on and off a toilet or portable commode, using an assistive device if applicable. Include stability while manipulating clothing to allow toileting to occur in this rating. Code 0, steady at all times: \u2014 If all of the observed transitions on and off the toilet during the 7-day look- back period are steady without assistance of a staff . \u2014 If the resident is stable when transferring using an assistive device or object identified for this purpose. \u2014 If an assistive device is used (e.g. , grab bar ), the resident appropriately plans and integrates the use of the device into the transition activit y. \u2014 Residents coded as 0 should not appear to be at risk of a fall during a transition. Code 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance: \u2014 If any transitions on or off the toilet during the7- day look-back period are not steady, but the res ident stabilizes without assistance from a staff . \u2014 If resident is unstable with an assistive device but does not require staff assistance. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at increased risk for falling during transitions. Code 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance: \u2014 If any transitions on or off the toilet during the 7- day look- back period are not steady, and the resident cannot stabilize without assistance from a staff . \u2014 If the resident fell when moving on or off the toilet during the look-back period. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at high risk for falling during transitions. \u2014 If lift device is used . Code 8, activity did not occur: \u2014 If the resident did not transition on and off the toilet during the 7 -day look- back period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-34 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Examples for G0300D , Moving on and off Toilet 1. A resident sits up in bed, stands up, pivots and grabs her walker. She then steadily walks to the bathroom where she pivots, pulls down her underwear, uses the grab bar and smoothly sits on the commode using the grab bar to guide her. After finishing, she stands and pivots using the grab bar and smoothly ambulates out of her room with her walker. Coding: G0300D would be coded 0, steady at all times . Rationale: This resident's use of the grab bar was not to prevent a fall after being unsteady, but to maintain steadiness during her transitions. The resident was able to smoothly and steadily transfer onto the toilet, using a grab bar. 2. A resident wheels her wheelchair into the bathroom, stands up, begins to lift her dress, sways, and grabs onto the grab bar to steady herself. When she sits down on the toilet, she leans to the side and must push herself away from the towel bar to sit upright steadi ly. Coding: G0300D would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance . Rationale: The resident was unsteady when disrobing to toilet but was able to steady herself with a grab bar. 3. A resident wheels his wheel chair into the bathroom, stands, begins to pull his pants down, sways, and grabs onto the grab bar to steady himself. When he sits down on the toilet, he leans to the side and must push himself away from the sink to sit upright steadily. When finished, he stands, sways, and then is able to steady himself with the grab bar. Coding: G0300D would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance. Rationale: The resident was unsteady when disrobing to toilet but was able to steady himself with a grab bar. Coding Instructions G0300E , Surface-to-Surface Transfer (Transfer between Bed and Chair or Wheelchair) Code for the least steady episode. Code 0, steady at all times: \u2014 If all of the observed transfers during the 7- day look -back period are steady without assistance of a staff . \u2014 If the resident is stable when transferring using an assistive device identified for this purpose. \u2014 If an assistive device or equipment is used, the resident uses it independently and appropriately plans and integrates the use of the device into the transition activity. \u2014 Residents coded 0 should not appear to be at risk of a fall during a transition. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-35 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Code 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance: \u2014 If any transfers during the look-back period are not steady, but the resident stabilizes without assistance from a staff . \u2014 If the resident is unstable with an assistive device but does not require staff assistance. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at increased risk for falling during transitions. Code 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance: \u2014 If any transfers during the 7-day look-back period are not steady, and the resident can only stabilize with assistance from a staff . \u2014 If the resident fell during a surface- to-surface transfer during the look -back period. \u2014 Residents coded in this category appear at high risk for falling during transitions. \u2014 If a li ft device (a mechanical device that is completely operated by another person) is used, and this mechanical device is being used because the resident requires staff assistance to stabilize, c ode 2 . Code 8, activity did not occur: \u2014 If the resident did not tra nsfer between bed and chair or wheelchair during the 7- day look-back period. Examples for G0300E , Surface-to-Surface Transfer (Transfer Between Bed and Chair or Wheelchair) 1. A resident who uses her wheelchair for mobility stands up from the edge of her bed, pivots, and sits in her locked wheelchair in a steady fashion. Coding: G0300E would be coded 0, steady at all times . Rationale : The resident was steady when transferring from bed to wheelchair . 2. A resident who needs assistance ambulating transfers to his chair from the bed. He is observed to stand halfway up and then sit back down on the bed. On a second attempt, a nursing assistant helps him stand up straight, pivot, and sit down in his chair. Coding: G0300E would be coded 2, not steady, only able to stabilize with staff assistance. Rationale : The resident was unsteady when transferring from bed to chair and required staff assistance to make a steady transfer . 3. A resident with an above-the-knee amputation sits on the edge of the bed and, using his locked wheelchair due to unsteadiness and the nightstand for leverage, stands and transfers to his wheelchair rapidly and almost misses the seat. He is able to steady himself using the nightstand and sit down into the wheelchair without falling to the floor. Coding: G0300E would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabilize without staff assistance. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-36 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking (cont.) Rationale : The resident was unsteady when transferring from bed to wheelchair but did not require staff assistance to complete the activity. 4. A resident who uses her wheelchair for mobility stands up from the edge of her bed, sways to the right, but then is quickly able to pivot and sits in her locked wheelchair in a steady fashion. Coding: G0300E would be coded 1, not steady, but able to stabi lize without staff assistance. Rationale : The resident was unsteady when transferring from bed to wheelchair but was able to steady herself without staff assistance or an object . Additional Example for G0300A -E, Balance during Transitions and Walking 1. A resident sits up in bed, stands up, pivots and sits in her locked wheelchair. She then wheels her chair to the bathroom where she stands, pivots, lifts gown and smoothly sits on the commode. Coding: G0300A, G0300D, G0300E would be coded 0, steady at all times . Rationale : The resident was steady during each activity. G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion I ntent: The intent of G0400 is to determine whether functional limitation in range of motion (ROM) interferes with the resident's activities of daily living or places him or her at risk of injury. When completing this item, s taff should refer back to item G0110 and view the limitation in ROM taking into account activities that the resident is able to perform. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Functional impairment could place the resident at risk of injury or interfere with performance of activities of daily living. Planning for Care Individualized care plans should address possible reversible causes such as de-conditioning and adverse side effects of medications or other treatments. DEFINITION FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION IN RANGE OF MOTION Limited ability to move a joint that interferes with daily functioning (particularly with activities of daily living) or places the resident at risk of injury. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-37 G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record for references to functional range of motion limitation during the 7-day look-back period. 2. Talk with staff members who work with the resident as well as family/significant others about any impairment in functional ROM. 3. Coding for functional ROM limitations is a 3 step process: Test the resident's upper and lower extremity ROM (See #6 below for examples). If the resident is noted to have limitation of upper and/or lower extremity ROM, review G0110 and/or directly observe the resident to determine if the limitation interferes with function or places the resident at risk for injury. Code G0400 A/B as appropri ate based on the above assessment. 4. Assess the resident 's ROM bilaterally at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee, ankle, foot, and other joints unless contraindicated (e.g., recent fracture, joint replacement or pain ). 5. Staff observations of various activities, including ADLs, may be used to determine if any ROM limitations impact the re sident' s functional abilities. 6. Although this item codes for the presence or absence of functional limitation related to ROM; thorough assessment ought to be comprehensive and follow standards of practice for evaluating ROM impairment. Below are some suggested assessment strategies: Ask the resident to follow your verbal instructions for each movement. Demonstrate each movement (e.g., ask the resident to do what you are doing). Actively assist the resident with the movements by supporting his or her extremity and guiding it through the joint ROM. Lower Extremity - includes hip, knee, ankle, and foot While resident is lying supine in a flat bed, instruct the resident to flex (pull toes up towards head) and extend (push toes down away from head) each foot. Then ask the resident to lift his or her leg one at a time, bending it at the knee to a right angle (90 degrees) Then ask the resident to slowly lower his or her leg and extend it flat on the mattress. If assessing lower extremity ROM by observing the resident, the flexion and extension of the foot mimics the motion on the pedals of a bicycle. Extension might also be needed to don a shoe. If assessing bending at the knee, the motion would be similar to lifting of the leg when donning lower body clothing. Upper Extremity - includes shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers For each hand, instruct the resident to make a fist and then open the hand. With resident seated in a chair, instruct him or her to reach with both hands and touch palms to back of head. Then ask resident to touch each shoulder with the opposite hand. Alternatively, observe the resident donning or removing a shirt over the head. If assessing upper extremity ROM by observing the resident, making a fist mimics useful actions for grasping and letting go of utensils. When an individual reaches both hands to the back of the head, this mimics the action needed to comb hair. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-38 G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion (cont.) Coding Tips Do not look at limited ROM in isolation. You must determine if the limited ROM impacts functional ability or places the resident at risk for injury. For example, if the resident has an amputation it does not automatically mean that they are limited in function. He/she may not have a particular joint in which certain range of motion can be tested, however, it does not mean that the resident with an amputation has a limitation in completing activities of daily living, nor does it mean that the resident is automatically at risk of injury. There are many amputees who function extremely well and can complete all activities of daily living either with or without the use of prosthetics. If the resident with an amputation does indeed have difficulty completing ADLs and is at risk for injury, the facility should code this item as appropriate. This item is coded in terms of function and risk of injury, not by diagnosis or lack of a limb or digit. Coding Instructions for G0400A, Upper Extremity (Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Hand); G0400B, Lower Extremity (Hip, Kn ee, Ankle, Foot) Code 0, n o impairment: if resident has full functional range of motion on the right and left side of upper/lower extremities. Code 1, impairment on one side: if resident has an upper and/or lower extremity impairment on one side that inter feres with daily functioning or places the resident at risk of injury. Code 2, impairment on both sides : if resident has an upper and/or lower extremity impairment on both sides that interferes with daily functioning or places the resident at risk of injur y. Examples for G0400A, Upper Extremity (Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Hand) ; G0400B, Lower Extremity (Hip, Knee, Ankle, Foot) 1. The resident can perform all arm, hand, and leg motions on the right side, with smooth coordinated movements. She is able to perform grooming activities (e.g. brush teeth, comb her hair) with her right upper extremity, and is also able to pivot to her wheelchair with the assist of one person. S he is, however, unable to voluntarily move her left side (limited arm, hand and leg motion) as she has a flaccid left hemiparesis from a prior stroke. Coding: G0400A would be coded 1, upper extremity impairment on one side . G0400B would be coded 1, lower extremity impairment on one side. Rationale : Impairment due to left hemiparesis affects both upper and lower extremities on one side. Even though this resident has limited ROM that impairs function on the left side, as indicated above, the resident can perform ROM fully on the right side. Even though there is impairment on one side, the facility should always attempt to provide the resident with assistive devices or physical assistance that allows for the resident to be as independent as possible. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-39 G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion (cont.) 2. The resident had shoulder surgery and can't brush her hair or raise her right arm above her head. The resident has no impairment on the lower extremities. Coding: G0400A would be coded 1, upper extremity impairment on one side. G0400B would be coded 0, no impairment . Rationale : Impairment due to shoulder surgery affects only one side of her upper extremities. 3. The resident has a diagnosis of Parkinson's and ambulates with a shuffling gate. The resident has had 3 falls in the past quarter and often forgets his walker which he needs to ambulate. He has tremors of both upper extremities that make it very difficult to feed himself, brush his teeth or write. Coding : G0400A would be coded 2, upper extremity impairment on both sides . G0400B would be coded 2, lower extremity impairment on both sides . Rationale: Impairment due to Parkinson's disease affects the resident at the upper and lower extremities on both sides. G0600: Mobility Devices Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining independence is important to an individual's feelings of autonomy and self-worth. The use of devices may assist the resident in maintaining that independence. Planning for Care Resident ability to move about his or her room, unit or nursing home may be directly related to the use of devices. It is critical that nursing home staff assure that the resident's independence is optimized by making available mobility devices on a daily basis, if needed . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-40 G0600: Mobility Devices (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record for references to locomotion during the 7-day look-back period. 2. Talk with staff members who work with the resident as well as family/significant others about devices the resident used for mobility during the look-back period. 3. Observe th e resident during locomotion. Coding Instructions Record the type(s) of mobility devices the resident normally uses for locomotion (in room and in facility). Check all that apply: Check G0600A, c ane/crutch: if the resident used a cane or crutch, including single prong, tripod, quad cane, etc. Check G0600B, walker: if the resident used a walker or hemi -walker, including an enclosed frame-wheeled walker with/without a posterior seat and lap cushion. Also check this item if the resident walks while pushing a wheelchair for support. Check G0600C, wheelchair (manual or electric) : if the resident normally sits in wheelchair when moving about. Include hand-propelled, motorized, or pushed by another person. Do not include geri- chairs, reclining chairs wit h wheels, positioning chairs, scooters, and other types of specialty chairs. Check G0600D, l imb prosthesis: if the resident used an a rtificial limb to replace a missing extremity . Check G0600Z, n one of the above: if the resident used none of the mobility devices listed in G0600 or locomotion did not occur during the look-back period. Examples 1. The resident uses a quad cane daily to walk in the room and on the unit. The resident uses a standard push wheel chair that she self -propels when leaving the unit due to her issues with endurance. Coding: G0600A, use of cane/crutch , and G0600C, wheelchair, would be checked. Rationale : The resident uses a quad cane in her room and on the unit and a wheelchair off the unit. 2. The resident has an artificial leg that is applied each morning and removed each evening. Once the prosthesis is applied the resident is able to ambulate independently. Coding: G0600D, limb prosthesis , would be checked. Rationale : The resident use s a leg prosthesis for ambulating. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-41 G0900: Functional Rehabilitation Potential Complete only on OBRA Admission Assessment (A0310A = 1) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Attaining and maintaining independence is important to an individual' s feelings of autonomy and self- worth. Independence is also important to health status, as decline in function can trigger all of the complications of immobility, depression, and social isolation. Planning for Care Beliefs held by the resident and staff that the resident has the capacity for greater independence and involvement in self- care in at least some ADL areas may be important clues to assist in setting goals. Even if highly independent in an activity, the resident or staff may believe the resident can gain more independence (e.g., walk longer distances, shower independently). Disagreement between staff beliefs and resident beliefs should be explored by the interdisciplinary team. Steps for Assessment: Interview Instructions for G0900A, Resident Believes He or She Is Capable of Increased I ndependence in at Least Some ADLs 1. Ask if the resident thinks he or she could be more self- sufficient given more time. 2. Listen to and record what the resident believes, even if it appears unrealistic. It is sometimes helpful to have a conversation with the resident that helps him/her break down this question. For example, you might ask the resident what types of things staff assist him with and how much of those activities the staff do for the resident. Then ask the resident, \"Do you think that you could get to a point where you do more or all of the activity yourself?\" Coding Instructions for G0900A , Resident Believes He or She Is Capable of Increased Independence in at Least Some ADLs Code 0, n o: if the resident indicate s that he or she believes he or she will probably stay the same and continue with his or her current needs for assistance. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [G] October 2019 Page G-42 G0900: Functional Rehabilitation Potential (cont.) Code 1, y es: if the resident indicate s that he or she thinks he or she can improve. Code even if the resident's expectation appears unrealistic. Code 9, u nable to determine: if the resident cannot indicate any beliefs about his or her functional rehabilitation potential. Example for G0900A , Resident Believes He or She Is Capable of Increased Independence in at Least Some ADLs 1. Mr. N . is cognitively impaired and receives limited physical assistance in locomotion for safety purposes. However, he believes he is capable of walking alone and often gets up and walk s by himself when staff are not looking. Coding: G0900A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale : The resident believes he is capable of increased independence . Steps for Assessment for G0900B , Direct Care Staff Believe Resident Is Capable of Increased Independence in at Least Some ADLs 1. Discuss in interdisciplinary team meeting. 2. Ask staff who routinely care for or work with the resident if they think he or she is capable of greater independence in at least some ADLs. Coding Instructions for G0900B , Direc t Care Staff Believe Resident Is Capable of Increased Independence in at Least Some ADLs Code 0, n o: if staff believe the resident probably will stay the same and continue with current needs for assistance. Also code 0 if staff believe the resident is likely to experience a decrease in his or her capacity for ADL care performance. Code 1, y es: if staff believe the resident can gain greater independence i n ADLs or if staff indicate they are not sure about the potential for improvement, because that indicates some potential for improvement. Example for G0900B , Direct Care Staff Believe Resident Is Capable of Increased Independence in at Least Some ADLs 1. The nurse assistant who totally feeds Mrs. W. has noticed in the past week that Mrs. W. has made several attempts to pick up finger foods. She believes Mrs. W. could become more independent in eating if she received close supervision and cueing in a small group for restorative care in eating. Coding: G0900B would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: Based upon observation of the resident, the nurse assistant believes Mrs. W. is capable of increased independence. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-1 SECTION GG: FUNCTIONAL ABILITIES AND GOALS Intent: This section includes items about functional abilities and goals. It includes items focused on prior function, admission performance, discharge goals, and discharge performance. Functional status is assessed based on the need for assistance when performing self -care and mobility activities. GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities Item Rationale Knowledge of the resident's functioning prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury may inform treatment goals. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident or his or her family about, or review the resident's medical records describing, the resident's prior functioning with everyday activities. Coding Instructions Code 3, Independent: if the resident completed the activities by himself or herself, with or without an assistive device, with no assistance from a helper. Code 2, Needed Some Help: if the resident needed partial assistance from another person to complete the activities. Code 1, Dependent: if the helper completed the activities for the resident, or the assistance of two or more helpers was required for the resident to complete the activities. Code 8, Unknown: if the resident's usual ability prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury is unknown. Code 9, Not Applicable: if the activities were not applicable to the resident prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-2 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) Coding Tips Record the resident's usual ability to perform self-care, indoor mobility (ambulation), stairs, and functional cognition prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. If no information about the resident's ability is available after attempts to interview the resident or his or her family and after reviewing the resident's m edical record, code as 8 , Unknown. Examples for Coding Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities 1. Self-Care: Ms. R was admitted to an acute care facility after sustaining a right hip fracture and subsequently admitted to the SNF for rehabilitation. Prior to the hip fracture, Ms. R was independent in eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. Ms. R used a raised toilet seat because of arthritis in both knee joints. Both she and her family indicated that there were no safety concerns when she performed these everyday activities in her home. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Prior to her hip fracture, the resident completed the self- care tasks of eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet safely without any assistance from a helper. The resident may use an assistive device, such as a raised toilet seat, and still be coded as independent. 2. Self-Care: Mr. T was admitted to an acute care facility after sustaining a stroke and subsequently admitted to the SNF for rehabilitation. Prior to the stroke, Mr. T was independent in eating and using the toilet; however, Mr. T required assistance for bathing and putting on and taking off his shoes and socks. The assistance needed was due to severe arthritic lumbar pain upon bending, which limited his ability to access his feet. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: Mr. T needed partial assistance from a helper to complete the activities of bathing and dressing. While Mr. T did not need help for all self- care activities, he did need some help. Code 2 is used to indicate that Mr. T needed some help for self- care. 3. Self-Care: Mr. R was diagnosed with a progressive neurologic condition five years ago. He lives in a long-term nursing facility and was recently hospitalized for surgery and has now been admitted to the SNF for skilled services. According to Mr. R's wife, prior to the surgery, Mr. R required complete assistance with self- care activities, including eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 1, Dependent. Rationale: Mr. R's wife has reported that Mr. R was completely depen dent in self -care activities that included eating, bathing, dressing, and using the toilet. Code 1, Dependent, is appropriate based upon this information. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-3 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) 4. Self-Care: Mr. F was admitted with a diagnos is of stroke and a severe communication disorder and is unable to communicate with staff using alternative communication devices. Mr. F had been living alone prior to admission. The staff has not been successful in contacting either Mr. F's family or his friends. Mr. F's prior self- care abilities are unknown. Coding: GG0100A would be coded 8, Unknown. Rationale: Attempts to seek information regarding Mr. F's prior functioning were made; however, no information was available. This item is coded 8, Unknown. 5. Indoor Mobility (Ambulation): Mr. C was admitted to an acute care hospital after experiencing a stroke. Prior to admission, he used a cane to walk from room to room. In the morning, Mr. C' s wife would provide steadying assistance to Mr. C when he walked from room to room because of joint stiffness and severe arthritis pain. Occasionally, Mr. C required steadying assistance during the day when walking from room to room. Coding: GG01 00B would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: The resident needed some assistance (steadying assistance) from his wife to complete the activity of walking in the home. 6. Indoor Mobility (Ambulation): Approximately three months ago, Mr. K had a cardiac event that resulted in anoxia, and subsequently a swallowing disorder. Mr. K has been living at home with his wife and developed aspiration pneumonia. After this most recent hospitalization, he was admitted to the SNF for a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and severe deconditioning. Prior to the most rece nt acute care hospitalization, Mr. K needed some assistance when walking. Coding: GG0100B would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: While the resident experienced a cardiac event three months ago, he recently had an exacerbation of a prior condition that required care in an acute care hospital and skilled nursing facility. The resident's prior functioning is based on the time immediate ly before his most recent condition exacerbation that required acute care. 7. Indoor Mobility (Ambulation): Mrs. L had a stroke one year ago that resulted in her using a wheelchair to self -mobilize, as she was unable to walk. Mrs. L subsequently had a second stroke and was transferred from an acute care unit to the SNF for skilled services. Coding: GG0100B would be coded 9, Not Applicable. Rationale: The resident did not ambulate immediately prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation (the second stroke). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-4 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) 8. Stairs : Prior to admission to the hospital for bilateral knee surgery, followed by his recent admission to the SNF for rehabilitation, Mr. V experienced severe knee pain upon ascending and par ticularly descending his internal and external stairs at home. Mr. V required assistance from his wife when using the stairs to steady him in the event his left knee would buckle. Mr. V's wife was interviewed about her husband's functioning prior to admiss ion, and the therapist noted Mr. V's prior functional level information in his medical record. Coding: GG0100C would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: Prior to admission, Mr. V required some help in order to manage internal and external stairs. 9. Stairs: Mrs. E lived alone prior to her hospitalization for sepsis and has early stage multiple sclerosis. She has now been admitted to a SNF for rehabilitation as a result of deconditioning. Mrs. E reports that she used a straight cane to ascend and descend her indoor stairs at home and small staircases within her community. Mrs. E reports that she did not require any human assistance with the activity of using stairs prior to her admission. Coding: GG0100C would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Mrs. E reported that prior to admission, she was independent in using her internal stairs and the use of small staircases in her community. 10. Stairs: Mr. P has expressive aphasia and difficulty communicating . SNF staff have not received any response to thei r phone messages to Mr. P's family members requesting a return call. Mr. P has not received any visitors since his admission. The medical record from his prior facility does not indicate Mr. P's prior functioning. There is no information to code item GG010 0C, but there have been attempts at seeking this information. Coding: GG0100C would be coded 8, Unknown. Rationale: Attempts were made to seek information regarding Mr. P's prior functioning; however, no information was available. 11. Functional Cognition: Mr. K has mild dementia and recently sustained a fall resulting in complex multiple fractures requiring multiple surgeries. Mr. K has been admitted to the SNF for rehabilitation. Mr. K's caregiver reports that when living at home, Mr. K needed reminders to ta ke his medications on time, manage his money, and plan tasks, especially when he was fatigued. Coding: GG0100D would be coded 2, Needed Some Help. Rationale: Mr. K required some help to recall, perform, and plan regular daily activities as a result of cognitive impairment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-5 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities (cont.) 12. Functional Cognition: Ms. L recently sustained a brain injury from a fall at home. Prior to her recent hospitalization, she had been living in an apartment by herself. Ms. L's cognition is currently impaired. Ms. L's cousin, who had visited her frequently prior to her recent hospitalization, indicated that Ms. L did not require any help with taking her prescribed medications, planning her daily activities, and managing money when shopping. Coding: GG0100D would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Ms. L's cousin, who frequently visited Ms. L prior to her sustaining a brain injury, reported that Ms. L was independent in taking her prescribed medications, planning her daily activities, and managing money when shopping, indicating her independence in using memory and problem-solving skills. 13. Functional Cognition: Mrs. R had a stroke , resulting in a severe communication disorder. Her family members have not returned phone calls requesting information about Mrs. R's prior functional status, and her medical records do not include information about her functional cognition prior to the stroke. Coding: GG0100D would be coded 8, Unknown. Rationale: Attempts to seek information regarding Mrs. R's prior functioning were made; however, no information was available. GG0110. Prior Device Use Item Rationale Knowledge of the resident's routine use of devices and aids immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury may inform treatment goals. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident or his or her family or review the resident's medical records to determine the resident's use of prior devices and aids. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-6 GG0110. Prior Device Use (cont.) Coding Instructions Check all devices that apply. Check Z, None of the above: if the resident did not use any of the listed devices or aids immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Coding Tips For GG0110D, Prior Device Use - Walker: \"Walker\" refers to all types of walkers (for example, pickup walkers, hemi-walkers, rolling walkers, and platform walkers). GG0110C, Mechanical lift, includes sit- to-stand, stand assist, stair lift, and full-body- style lifts. Example for Coding Prior Device Use 1. Mrs. M is a bilateral lower extremity amputee and has multiple diagnoses, including diabetes, obesity, and peripheral vascular disease. She is unable to walk and did not walk prior to the current episode of care, which started because of a pressure ulcer and respiratory infection. She uses a motorized wheelchair to mobilize. Coding: GG0110B would be checked. Rationale: Mrs. M used a motorized wheelchair prior to the current illness/injury. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-7 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission (Start of Medicare Part A Stay) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-8 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Interim Performance (Interim Payment Assessment - Optional) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-9 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Discharge (End of Medicare Part A Stay) Item Rationale During a Medicare Part A SNF stay, residents may have self -care limitations on admission. In addition, residents may be at risk of further functional decline during their stay in the SNF . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 10 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Assess the resident's self -care performance based on direct observation, incorporating resident self -report s and reports from qualified clinicians, care staff , or family documented in the resident's medical record during the three -day assessment period . CMS anticipates that an interdisciplinary team of qualified clinicians is involved in assessing the resident during the three- day assessment period. For Section GG, the admission assessment period is the first three days of the Part A s tay starting with the date in A2400B, the Start of Most Recent Medicare S tay. On admission, these items are completed only when A0310B = 01 (5- Day PPS assessment). For the Interim Payment Assessment (A0310B=08), the assessment period for Section GG is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and two days prior). 2. Resident s should be allowed to perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. 3. For the purposes of completing Section GG, a \" helper \" is defined as facility staff who are direct employees and facility -contracted employees (e.g. , rehabilitation staff, nursing agency staff). Thus, \"helper\" does not include individuals hired, compensated or not, by individuals outside of the facility' s management and administration such as hospice staff, nursing/ certified nu rsing assistant students, etc. Therefore, when helper assistance is required because a resident's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, consider only facility staff when scoring according to the amount of assistance provided. 4. Activities may be completed with or without assistive device(s ). Use of assistive device(s) to complete an activity should not affect coding of the activity. 5. The admission functional assessment, when possible, should be conducted prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to reflect the resident's true admission baseline functional status. If treatment has started, for example, on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatmen t should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. 6. Refer to facility, Federal , and State policies and procedures to determine which staff members may complete an assessment. Resident assessments are to be done in compliance with facility, Federal , and State requirements. DEFINITION USUAL PERFORMANCE A resident's functional status can be impacted by the environment or situations encountered at the facility. Observing the resident's interactions with others in different locations and circumstances is important for a comprehensive understanding of the resident's functional status. If the resident's functional status varies, record the resident's usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the resident's best performance and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance. QUALIFIED CLINICIAN Healthcare professionals practicing within their scope of practice and consistent with Federal, State, and local law and regulations.

Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding I nstruct ions When coding the resident's usual performance and discharge goal(s), use the six-point scale, or use one of the four \"activity was not attempted\" codes to specify the reason why an activity was not attempted. Code 06, Independent : if the resident completes the activity by him/herself with no assist ance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance: if the helper sets up or cleans up ; resident completes activ ity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For example, the resident requires assistance cutting up food or opening container, or requires se tup of hygiene item(s) or assisti ve device(s). Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance: if the helper provides verbal cues or touching/ steadying /contact guard assistance as resident completes activity. Assistance may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. For example, the resident requires verbal cueing, coaxing, or general supervision for safety to complete activity; or resident may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steadying assist during the activity. Code 03, Part ial/mode rate assistance: if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, holds, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. Code 02, Subs tantial/maxi mal assistance: if the helpe r does MORE THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent : if the helper does ALL of the ef fort. Resident does none of the effort to complete the activity ; or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the resident to complete the activity. Code 07, Resident refused: if the resident refused to complete t he act ivity. Code 09, Not applicable: if the activity was not attempted and the resident did not perform this activ ity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations: if the resident did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment and weather constraints. Code 88, Not attempted due to med ical condi tion or safety concerns : if the activity was not atte mpted due to medical condition or safety concer ns.

Decision Tree Use this decision tree to code the resident's performance on the assessment instrument. If helper assistance is required because the resident's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, score according to the amount of assistance provided. Only use the \"activity not attempted codes\" if the activity did not occur; that is, the resident did not perform the activity and a helper did not perform that activity for the resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 13 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Assessment Period Admission: The 5 -Day PPS assessment (A0310B = 01) is the first Medicare-required assessment to be completed when the resident is admitted for a SNF Part A stay. o For the 5- Day PPS assessment, code the resident's functional status based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs soon after the resident's admission. This functional assessment must be completed within the first three days (3 calendar days) of the Medicare Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Mos t Recent Medicare Stay , and the following two days, ending at 11:59 PM on day 3. The admission function scores are to reflect the resident's admission baseline status and are to be based on an assessment. The scores should reflect the resident's status prior to any benefit from interventions. The assessment should occur, when possible, prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine the resident's true admission baseline status. Even if treatment started on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. Interim Performance (Optional): The Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) is an optional assessment that may be completed by providers in order to report a change in the resident 's PDPM classification. For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6-point scale and activity not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and the 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. Discharge: The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required to be completed when the resident's Medicare Part A Stay ends (as documented in A2400C, End of Most Recent Medicare Stay), either as a standalone assessment when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resi dent remains in the facility; or may be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Medicare Part A stay ends on the day of, or one day before the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). Please see Chapter 2 and Section A of the RAI Manual for additional details reg arding the Part A PPS Discharge assessment. o For the Discharge assessment (i.e., standalone Part A PPS or combined OBRA/Part A PPS), code the resident's discharge functional status, based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs as close to the time of the r esident 's discharge from Medicare Part A as possible. This functional assessment must be completed within the last three calendar days of the resident 's Medicare Part A stay, which includes the day of discharge from Medicare Part A and the two days prior to the day of discharge from Medicare Part A . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 14 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Coding Tips: Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance General Coding Tips When reviewing the medical record, interviewing staff , and observing the resident , be familiar with the definition for each activity (e.g., eating , oral hygiene) . For example, when assessing Eating (item GG0130A) , determine the type and amount of assistance required to bring food and/or liquid to the mouth and swallow food and/or liquid once the meal is placed before the resident. Residents with cognitive impairments/limitations may need physical and/or verbal assistance when completing an activity. Code based on the resident's need for assistance to perform the activity safely (for example, choking risk due to rate of eating, amount of food placed into mouth, risk of falling). If the resident does not at tempt the activity and a helper does not complete the activity for the resident during the entire assessment period , code the reason the activity was not attempted. For example, code as 07 if the resident refused to attempt the activity ; code as 09 if the activity is not applicable for the resident (the activity did not occur at the time of the assessment and prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation); code as 10 if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to environmental limitatio ns; or code as 88 if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to medical condition or safety concerns. An activity can be completed independently with or without devices. If the resident uses adaptive equipment and uses the device independently when performing an activity, enter code 06, Independent. If two or more helpers are required to assist the resident to complete the activity, code as 01, Dependent. To clarify your own understanding of the resident's performance of an activity, ask probing questions to the care staff about the resident, beginning with the general and proceeding to the more specific. See examples of probing questions at the end of this section. A dash (\"- \") indicates \"No information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Documentation in the medical record is used to support assessment coding of Section GG. Data entered should be consistent with the clinical assessment documentation in the resident's medical record. This assessment can be conducted by appropriate healthcare personnel as defined by facility policy and in accordance with State and Federal regulations. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 15 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance When coding the resident's usual performance, \"effort\" refers to the type and amount of assistance a helper provides in order for the activity to be completed. The six-point rating scale definitions include the following types of assistance: setup/cleanup, touching assistance, verbal cueing, and lifting assistance. Do not record the resident's best performance, and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance during the asses sment period. Code based on the resident's performance. Do not record the staff's assessment of the resident's potential capability to perform the activity. If the resident performs the activity more than once during the assessment period and the resident' s performance varies, coding in Section GG should be based on the resident's \"usual performance,\" which is identified as the resident's usual activity/performance for any of the Self -Care or Mobility activities, not the most independent or dependent performance over the assessment period. Therefore, if the resident's Self -Care performance varies during the assessment period, report the resident's usual performance, not the resident's most independent performance and not the resident's most dependent perform ance. A provider may need to use the entire three -day assessment period to obtain the resident's usual performance. Coding Tips for GG0130A, Eating GG0130A, Eating involves bringing food and liquids to the mouth and swallowing food. The administration of tube feedings and parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding this activity. The following is guidance for some situations in which a resident receives tube feedings or parenteral nutrition: o If the resident does not eat or drink by mouth and relies solely on nutrition and liquids through tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) because of a new (recent - onset) medical condition, code GG0130A as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Assistance with tube feedings or TPN is not considered when coding Eating. o If the resident does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the assessment, and the resident did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illne ss, injury, or exacerbation, code GG0130A as 09, Not applicable - Not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Assistance with tube feedings or parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding Eating . o If the resident eats and drinks by mouth, and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings or parenteral nutrition, code Eating based on the amount of assistance the resident requires to eat and drink by mouth. A ssistance with tube feedings or parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding Eating .

If the resident eats finger foods using his or her hands, then code Eating based upon the amount of assistance provided. If the resident eats finger foods with his or her hands independently, for example, the resident would be coded as 06, Independent. Examples for Coding Admission , Interi m, or Discharge Performance Note: The following are coding examples for each S elf-Care item. Some examples describe a single observation of the person completing the activity; other examples describe a summary of several observations of the resident completing an activity across different times of the day and different days. Examples for GG0130A, Eating 1. Eating: Ms. S has m ultiple s clerosis , affecting her endurance and strength. Ms. S prefers to feed herself as much as she is capable. During all meals, a fter eating three -fourths of t he meal by herself , Ms. S usually becomes extremely fatigued and requests assistance from the certified nursing assistant to feed her the remainder of the meal. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The certified nursing assistant provides less than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of eating for all meals . 2. Eating: Mr. M has upper extremity weakness and fine motor impairments. The occupational therapist places an ad aptive device onto Mr. M's hand that supports the eating utensil within his hand. At the start of each meal Mr. M can bring food and liquids to his mouth. Mr. M then tires and the certified nursing assistant feeds him more than half of each meal. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provides more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of eating at each meal . 3. Eating: Mr. A eats all meals without any physical assistance or supervision from a helper. He has a gastrostomy tube (G-tube), but it is no longer used , and it will be removed later today. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 06, Independent. Rationale: The resident can independently complete the activity without any assistance from a helper for this a ctivity. In this scenario, the presence of a G-tube does not affect the eating score. 4. Eating: The dietary aide opens all of Mr. S's cartons and containers on his food tray before leaving the room. There are no safety concerns regarding Mr. S's ability to eat. Mr. S eats the food himself, bringing the food to his mouth using appropriate utensils and swallowing the food safely. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 05, Setup or clean -up assistance. Rationale: The helper provided setup assistance prior to the eating activity.

Eating: Mrs. H does not have any food consistency restrictions, but often needs to swallow 2 or 3 times so that the food clears her throat due to difficulty with pharyngeal peristalsis. She requires verbal cues from the certified nursing assistant to use the compensator y strategy of extra swallows to clear the food. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: Mrs. H swallows all types of food consistencies and requires verbal cueing (supervision) from the helper. 6. Eating: Mrs. V has had difficulty seeing on her left side since her stroke. During meals, the certified nursing assistant has to remind her to scan her entire meal tray to ensure she has seen all the food. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance . Rationale: The helper provides verbal cue ing assistance during meals as Mrs. V completes the activity of eating . Supervision, such as reminders, may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. 7. Eating: Mrs. N is impulsive. While she eats, the certified nursing assistant provides verbal and tactile cueing so that Mrs. N does not lift her fork to her mouth until she has swallowed the food in her mouth. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance . Rationale: The resident requires supervision and touching assistance in order to eat safely. 8. Eating: Mr. R is unable to eat by mouth since he had a stroke one week ago. He receives nutrition through a gastrostomy tube (G-tube), which is administered by nurses. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns . Rationale: The resident does not eat or drink by mouth at this time due to his recent - onset stroke. This item includes eating and drinking by mouth only. Since eating and drinking did not occur due to his recent-onset medical condition, the activity is coded as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition and safety concerns. Assistance with G -tube feedings is not considered when coding this item. 9. Eating: Mr. F is fed all meals by the certified nursing assistant, because Mr. F has severe arm weakness and he is unable to assist. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The helper does all of the effort for each meal. The resident does not contribute any effort t o complete the eating activity.

Eating : Mr. J had a stroke that affects his left side. He is left- handed and feed s himself more than half of his meal s, but tires easily. Mr. J requests assistance from the certified nursing assistant with the remainder of his meal s. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The certified nursing assistant provides less than half the effort for the resident to co mplete the activity of eating. 11. Eating: Mrs. M has osteoporosis, which contributed to the fracture of her right wrist and hip during a recent fall. She is right-handed. Mrs. M starts eating on her own, but she does not have the coordination in her left hand to manage the eating utensils to feed herself without great effort. Mrs. M tires easily and cannot complete eating the meal. The certified nursing assistant feeds her more than half of the meal. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provides more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of eating. Coding Tip for GG0130B, Oral hygiene If a resident does not perform oral hygiene during therapy, determine the resident's abilities based on performance on the nursing care unit. Examples for GG0130B , Oral hygiene 1. Oral hygiene: In the morning and at night, Mrs. F brushes her teeth while sitting on the side of the bed. Each time, the certified nursing assistant gather s her toothbrush, toothpaste, water, and an empty cup and puts them on the bedside table for her before leaving the room. Once Mrs. F is finished brushing her teeth, which she does without any help, the certified nursing assistant returns to gather her items and dispose of the waste. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 05, Setup or c lean-up a ssistance . Rationale: The helper provides setup and clean- up assistance. The resident brushes her teeth without any help. 2. Oral hygiene: Before bedtime, the nurse provides steadying assistance to Mr. S as he walks to the bathroom. The nurse applies toothpaste onto Mr. S's toothbrush. Mr. S then brushes his teeth at the sink in the bathroom without physical assistance or supervision. Once Mr. S is done brushing his teeth and washing his hands and face, the nurse returns and provides steadying assistance as the resident walks back to his bed. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 05, Setup or c lean-up a ssistance . Rationale : The helper provides setup assistance (putting toothpaste on the toothbrush) every evening before Mr. S brushes his teeth. Do not consider assistance provided to get to or from the bathroom to score Oral hygiene.

Oral hygiene: At night, t he certified nursing assistant provides Mrs. K water and toothpaste to clean her dentures. Mrs. K cleans her upper denture plate . Mrs. K then cleans half of her lower denture plate, but states she is tired and unable to finish cleaning her lower denture plate. The certified nursing ass istant finishes cleaning the lower denture plate and Mrs. K replaces the dentures in her mouth. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provided less than half the effort to complete oral hygiene . 4. Oral h ygiene: Mr. W is edentulous (without teeth) and his dentures no longer fit his gums. In the morning and evening, Mr. W begins to brush his upper gums after the helper applies toothpaste onto his toothbrush. He brushes his upper gums , but cannot finish due to fatigue. The certified nursing assistant completes the activity of oral hygiene by brushing his back upper gums and his lower gums. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 02, Substantial/m aximal a ssistance . Rationale : The resident begins the activity. The helper completes the activity by performing more than half the effort. 5. Oral h ygiene: Mr. G has Parkinson's disease, resulting in tremors and incoordination. The certified nursing assistant retrieves all oral hygiene items for Mr. G and applies toothpaste to his toothbrush. Mr. G requires assistance to guide the toothbrush into his mouth and to steady his elbow while he brushes his teeth. Mr. G usually starts by brushing his upper and lower front teeth and the certified nursing assistant c ompletes the activity by brushing the rest of his teeth . Coding: GG0130B would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provided more than half the effort for the resident to complete the activity of oral hygiene. 6. Oral hygiene: Ms. T has Lewy body dementia and multiple bone fractures. She does not understand how to use oral hygiene items nor does she understand the process of completing oral hygiene. The certified nursing assistant brushes her teeth and explains each step of the activity to engage cooperation from Ms. T; however, she requires full assistance for the activity of oral hygiene. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The helper provides all th e effort for the activity to be complete d.

The occupational therapist remains with Ms. K providing verbal cues until she has completed the task of brushing her teeth. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides verbal cues to assist the resident in completing the activity of brushing h er teeth. 9. Oral hygiene: Mrs. N has early stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. She starts brushing her teeth and completes cleaning her upper teeth and part of her lower teeth when she becomes fatigued and asks the certified nursing assistant to help her finish the rest of the brushing. Coding: GG0130B would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provided less than half the effort to complete oral hygiene . Coding Tips for GG0130C, Toileting hygiene Toileting hygiene includes managing undergarments, clothing, and incontinence products and performing perineal cleansing before and after voiding or having a bowel movement. If the resident does not usually use undergarments, then assess the resident's need for assistance to manage lower body clothing and perineal hygiene. Toileting hygiene takes place before and after use of the toilet, commode, bedpan, or urinal. If the resident completes a bowel toileting program in bed, code Toileting hygiene based on the resident's need for assistance in managing clothing and perineal cleansing. If the resident has an indwelling urinary catheter and has bowel movements, code the Toilet hygiene item based on the amount of assistance needed by the resident before and after moving his or her bowels. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 21 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) for GG0130C , Toileting hygiene 1. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. J uses a bedside commode. The certified nursing assistant provides steadying (touching) assistance as Mrs. J pulls down her pants and underwear before sitting down on the commode . When Mrs. J is finished voiding or having a bowel movement, the certified nursing assistant provides steadying assistance as Mrs. J wipes her perineal area and pulls up her pants and underwear without assistance . Coding: GG0130C would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides steadying (touching) assistance to the resident to complete toileting hygiene . 2. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. L uses the toilet to void and have bowel movements. Mrs. L is unsteady, so t he certif ied nursing assistant walks into the bathroom with her in case she needs help. During the assessment period , a staff member has been present in the bathroom, but has not needed to provide any physical assistance with managing clothes or cleansing. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 04, Supervision or touching a ssistance . Rationale: The helper provides supervision as the resident performs the toilet hygiene activity . The resident is unsteady and the staff provide supervision for safety reasons. 3. Toileting hygiene: Mrs. P has urinary urgency. As soon as she gets in the bathroom, she asks the certified nursing assistant to lift her gown and pull down her underwear due to her balance problems . After voiding, Mrs. P wipes herself , pulls her underwear back up, and adjusts her gown. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 03, Partial/m oderate assistance . Rationale : The helper provides more than touching assistance. The resident performs more than half the effort; the helper does less than half the effort. The resident completes two of the three toileting hygiene tasks . 4. Toileting hygiene: Mr. J is morbidly obese and has a diagnosis of debility . He requests the use of a bedpan when voiding or having bowel movements and requires two certified nursing assistants to pull down his pants and underwear and mobilize him onto and off the bedpan. Mr. J is unable to complete any of his perineal /perianal hygiene. Both certified nursing assistants help Mr. J pull up his underwear and pants. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The assistance of two helpers was needed to complete the activity of toileting hygiene.

Toileting hygiene: M r. C has Parkinson's disease and significant tremors that cause intermittent difficulty for him to perform perineal hygiene after having a bowel movement in the toilet. He wa lks to the bathroom with close supervision and lowers his pants, but asks the certified nursing assistant to help him with perineal hygiene after moving his bowels. He then pulls up his pants without assistance. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 03, Partial/m oderate assistance . Rationale: The helper provides less than half the effort. The resident performs two of the three toileting hygiene tasks by himself . Walking to the bathroom is not considered when scoring toileting hygiene. 6. Toileting hygiene: Ms. Q has a progressive neurological disease that affects her fine and gross motor coordination, balance, and activity tolerance. She wears a hospital gown and underwear during the day. Ms. Q uses a bedside commode as she steadies herself in standing with one hand and initiates pulling down her underwear with the other hand but needs assistance to complete this activity due to her coordination impairment. After voiding, Ms. Q wipes her perineal area without assistance while sitting on the commode. When Ms. Q has a bowel movement, a certified nursing assistant performs perineal hygiene as Ms. Q needs to steady herself with both hands to stand for this activity. Ms. Q is usually too fatigued at this point and requires full assistance to pull up her underwear. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provided more than half the effort needed for the resident to complete the activity of toileting hygiene. Coding Tips for GG0130E, Shower/bathe self Shower/bathe self includes the ability to wash, rinse, and dry the face, upper and lower body, perineal area, and feet. Do not include washing, rinsing, and drying the resident's back or hair. Shower/bathe self does not include transferring in/out of a tub/shower. Assessment of Shower/bathe self can take place in a shower or bath or at a sink (i.e., full body sponge bath). If the resident bathes himself or herself and a h elper sets up materials for bathing/showering, then code as 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. If the resident cannot bathe his or her entire body because of a medical condition, then code Shower/bathe self based on the amount of assistance needed to comple te the activity. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 23 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Examples for GG0130E, Shower/bathe self 1. Shower/bathe self: Mr. J sits on a tub bench as he washes, rinses, and dries himself. A certified nursing assistant stays with him to ensure his safety, as Mr. J has had instances of losing his sitting balance. The certified nursing assistant also provides lifting assistance as Mr. J gets onto and off of the tub bench. Coding: GG0130E would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides supervision as Mr. J washes, rinses, and dries himself. The transfer onto or off of the tub bench is not considered when coding the Shower/bathe self activity. 2. Shower/bathe self: Mrs. E has a severe and progressive neurological condition that has affected her endurance as well as her fine and gross motor skills. She is transferred to the shower bench with parti al/moderate assistance. Mrs. E showers while sitting on a shower bench and washes her arms and chest using a wash mitt. A certified nursing assistant then must help wash the remaining parts of her body, as a result of Mrs. E's fatigue, to complete the acti vity. Mrs. E uses a hand-held showerhead to rinse herself but tires halfway through the task. The certified nursing assistant dries Mrs. E's entire body. Coding: GG0130E would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper assists Mrs. E with more than half of the task of showering, which includes bathing, rinsing, and drying her body. The transfer onto the shower bench is not considered in coding this activity. 3. Shower/bathe self: Mr. Y has limited mobility resulting from his multiple and complex medical conditions. He prefers to wash his body while sitting in front of the sink in his bathroom. A helper assists with washing, rinsing, and drying Mr. Y's arms/hands, upper legs, lower legs, buttocks, and back. Coding: GG0130E wo uld be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper completed more than half the activity. Bathing may occur at the sink.

Coding Tips for GG0130F, Upper body dressing, GG0130G, Lower body dressing, and GG0130H, Putting on/taking off footwear For upper body dressing, lower body dressing, and putting on/taking off footwear, if the resident dresses himself or herself and a helper retrieves or puts away the resident's clothing, then code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. When coding upper body dressing and lower body dressing, helper assistance with buttons and/or fasteners is considered touching assistance. If donning and doffing an elastic bandage, elastic stockings, or an orthosis or prosthesis occurs while the resident is dressing/undressing, then count the elastic bandage/elastic stocking/orthotic/prosthesis as a piece of clothing when determining the amount of assistance the resident needs when coding the dressing item. The following items are considered a piece of clothing when coding the dressing items: o Upper body dressing examples: thoracic-lumbar- sacrum orthosis (TLSO), abdominal binder, back brace, stump sock/shrinker, upper body support device, neck support, hand or arm prosthetic/orthotic. o Lower body dressing examples: knee brace, elastic bandage, bandages, foot orthotics, orthopedic walking boots, compression stockings (considered footwear because of dressing don/doff over foot). Upper body dressing items used for coding include bra, undershirt, T-shirt, button-down shirt, pullover shirt, dresses, sweatshirt, sweater, nightgown (not hospital gown), and pajama top. Upper body dressing cannot be assessed based solely on donning/doffing a hospital gown. Lower body dressing items used for coding include underwear, incontinence brief, slacks, shorts, capri pants, pajama bottoms, and skirts. Footwear dressing items used for coding include socks, shoes, boots, and running shoes. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 25 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim /Discharge (Start/Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) For residents with bilateral lower extremity amputations with or without use of prosthe ses, the activity of putting on/taking off footwear may not occur. For example, the socks and shoes may be attached to the prosthe sis associated with the upper or lower leg. o If the resident performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury, code as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. o If the resident did not perform the activity of putting on/taking off foot wear immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury because the resident had bilateral lower -extremity amputations and the activity of putting on/taking off footwear was not performed during the assessment period, code as 09, Not applicable - Not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. For residents with a single lower extremity amputation with or without use of a prosthe sis, the activity of putting on/taking off footwear could apply to the intact limb or both the limb with the prosthe sis and the intact limb. o If the resident performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear for the intact limb only, then code based upon the amount of assistance needed to compl ete the activity. o If the resident performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear for both the intact limb and the prosthetic limb, then code based upon the amount of assistance needed to complete the activity. Examples for GG0130F, Upper body dre ssing 1. Upper body dressing: Mrs. Y has right- side upper extremity weakness as a result of a stroke and has worked in therapy to relearn how to dress her upper body. During the day, she requires a certified nursing assistant only to place her clothing next to her bedside. Mrs. Y can now use compensatory strategies to put on her bra and top without any assistance. At night she removes her top and bra independently and puts the clothes on the nightstand, and the certified nursing assistant puts them away in her dresser . Coding: GG0130F would be coded 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Rationale: Mrs. Y dresses and undresses her upper body and requires a helper only to retrieve and put away her clothing, that is, setting up the clothing for her use. The description refers to Mrs. Y as \"independent\" (when removing clothes), but she needs setup assistance, so she is not independent with regard to the entire activity of upper body dressing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 26 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Upper body dressing: Mrs. Z wears a bra and a sweatshirt most days while in the SNF. She requires assistance from a certified nursing assistant to initiate the threading of her arms into her bra. Mrs. Z completes the placement of the bra over her chest. The helper hooks the bra clasps. Mrs. Z pulls the sweatshirt over her arms, head, and trunk. When undressing, Mrs. Z removes the sweatshirt , with the helper assisting her with one sleeve. Mrs. Z slid es the bra off, once it has been unclasped by the helper. Coding: GG0130F would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provides assistance with threading Mrs. Z's arms into her bra and hooking and unhooking her bra clasps and assistance with removing one sleeve of the sweatshirt. Mrs. Z performs more than half of the effort. 3. Upper body dressing: Mr. K sustained a spinal cord injury that has affected both movement and strength in both upper extremities. He places his left hand into one- third of his left sleeve of his shirt with much time and effort and is unable to continue with the activity. A certified nursing assistant then completes the remaining upper body dressing for Mr. K. Coding: GG0130F would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: Mr. K can perform a small portion of the activity of upper body dressing but requires assistance by a helper for more than half of the effort of upper body dressing. Examples for GG0130G, Lower body dressing 1. Lower body dressing: Mr. D is required to follow hip precautions as a result of recent hip surgery. The occupational therapist in the acute care hospital instructed him in the use of adaptive equipment to facilitate lower body dressing. He requires a helper to retrieve his clothing from the closet. Mr. D uses his adaptive equipment to assist in threading his legs into his pants. Because of balance issues, Mr. D needs the helper to steady him when standing to manage pulling on or pulling down his pants/undergarments. Mr. D also needs some assistance to put on and take off his socks and shoes. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A helper steadies Mr. D when he is standing and performing the activity of lower body dressing, which is supervision or touching assistance. Putting on and taking off socks and shoes is not considered when coding lower body dressing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 27 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Lower body dressing: Mrs. M has severe rheumatoid arthritis and multiple fractures and sprains due to a fall. She has been issued a knee brace, to be worn during the day. Mrs. M threads her legs into her garments, and pulls up and down her clothing to and from just below her hips. Only a little assistance from a helper is needed to pull up her garments over her hips. Mrs. M requires the helper to fasten her knee brace because of grasp and fine motor weakness. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper provides only a little assistance when Mrs. M is putting on her lower extremity garments and fastenin g the knee brace. The helper provides less than half of the effort. Assistance putting on and removing the knee brace she wears is considered when determining the help needed when coding lower body dressing. 3. Lower body dressing: Mrs. R has peripheral neuropathy in her upper and lower extremities. Each morning, Mrs. R needs assistance from a helper to place her lower limb into, or to take it out of (don/doff), her lower limb prosthesis. She needs no assistance to put on and remove her underwear or slacks. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper performs less than half the effort of lower body dressing (with a prosthesis considered a piece of clothing). The helper lifts, holds, or supports Mrs. R's trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort for the task of lower body dressing. Examples for GG0130H, Putting on/taking off footwear 1. Putting on/taking off footwear: Mr. M is undergoing rehabilitation for right-side upper and lower body weakness following a stroke. He has made significant progress toward his independence and will be discharged to home tomorrow. Mr. M wears an ankle-foot orthosis that he puts on his foot and ankle after he puts on his socks but before he puts on his shoes. He always places his AFO, socks, and shoes within easy reach of his bed. While sitting on the bed, he needs to bend over to put on and take off his AFO, socks, and shoes, and he occas ionally loses his sitting balance, requiring staff to place their hands on him to maintain his balance while performing this task. Coding: GG0130H would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: Mr. M puts on and takes off his AFO, socks, and shoes by himself; however, because of occasional loss of balance, he needs a helper to provide touching assistance when he is bending over. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 28 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Putting on/taking off footwear: Mrs. F was admitted to the SNF for a neurologic condition and experiences visual impairment and fine motor coordination and endurance issues. She requires setup for retrieving her socks and shoes, which she prefers to keep in the closet. Mrs. F often drops her shoes and socks as she attempts to put them onto her feet or as she takes them off. Often a certified nursing assistant must first thread her socks or shoes over her toes, and then Mrs. F can compl ete the task. Mrs. F needs the certified nursing assistant to initiate taking off her socks and unstrapping the Velcro used for fastening her shoes. Coding: GG0130H would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: A helper provides Mrs. F with assistance in initiating putting on and taking off her footwear because of her limitations regarding fine motor coordination when putting on/taking off footwear. The helper completes more than half of the effort with this activity. Examples of Probing Conversations with Staff 1. Eating: Example of a probing conversation between a nurse and a certified nursing assistant regarding the resident's eating abilities : Nurse: \"Please d escribe to me how Mr. S eats his meals. Once the food and liquid are presented to him, does he use utensils to bring food to his mouth and swallow ?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"No, I have to feed him.\" Nurse: \"Do you always have to physically feed him or can he sometimes do some aspect of the eating activity with encouragem ent or cues to feed himself?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"No , he can't do anything by himself. I scoop up each portion of the food and bring the fork or spoon to his mouth. I try to encourage him to feed himself or to help guide the spoon to his mouth but he can't hold the fork. I even tried encouraging him to eat food he could pick up with his fingers, but he will not eat unless he is completely assisted for food and liquid.\" In this example, the nurse inquired specifically how Mr. S requires assistance to eat his meals . The nurse as ked about instructions and physical assist ance. If this nurse had not asked probing questions, he/she may not have received enough information to make an accurate assessment of the assis tance Mr. S received. Accurate coding is important for reporting on the type and amount of care provided. B e sure to consider each activity definition fully. Coding: GG01 30A would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The resident requires complete assistance from the certified nursing assistant to eat his meals. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 29 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 2. Oral hygiene: Example of a probing conversation between a nurse deter mining a resident's oral hygiene score and a certified nursing assistant regarding the resident's oral hygiene routine: Nurse: \"Does Mr s. K help with brushing her teeth ?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"She can help clean her teeth .\" Nurse: \"How much help does she need to brush her teeth?\" Certified nursing assistant : \"She usually gets tired after starting to brush her upper teeth. I have to brush most of her teeth.\" In this example, the nurse inquired specifically how Mr s. K manages her oral hygiene. The nurse as ked about physical assist ance and how the resident performed the activity. If this nurse had not ask ed probing questions, he/she would not have received enough information to make an accurate assessment of the actual assist ance Mr s. K received. Coding: GG01 30B would be coded 02, Substantial/ maximal assistance. Rationale: The certified nursing assistant provides more than half the effort to complete Mrs. K's oral hygiene. Discharge Goal s: Coding Tips Discharge goals are coded with each Admission (Start of SNF PPS Stay) assessment. For the SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP), a minimum of one self -care or mobility discharge goal must be coded. However, facilities may choose to complete more than one self-care or mobility discharge goal. C ode the resident's discharge goal(s) using the six- point scale. Use of the \"activity was not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s). Use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self-care or mobility goals that were not coded . Of note, at least one Discharge Goal must be indicated for either Self -Care or Mobility. Using the dash in this allowed instance after the coding of at least one goal does not affect Annua l Payment Update ( APU) determination. Licensed , qualified clinicians can establish a resident's Discharge Goal(s) at the time of admission based on the resident's prior medical condition, admission assessment self- care and mobility status , discussions with the resident and family, professional judgment, the professional's standard of practice, expected treatments, the resident's motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the resident's discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the resident's care plan. If the admission performance of an activity was coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern during the admission assessment, a D ischarge G oal may be entered using the 6 -point scale if the resident is expected to be able to perform the activity by discharge. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 30 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Discharge Goal: Coding Examples 1. Discharge Goal Code Is Higher than 5- Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code If the qualified clinician determines that the resident is expected to make gains in function by discharge, the code reported for D ischa rge G oal will be higher than the admission performance code. 2. Discharge Goal Code Is the Same as 5- Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code The qualified clinician determines that a medically complex resident is not expected to progress to a higher level of functioning during the SNF Medicare Part A stay; however, the qualified clinician determines that the resident would be able to maintain her admission functional performance level. The qualified clinician discusses functional status goals with the resident and her family and they agree that maintaining functioning is a reasonable goal. In this example, the Discharge Goal is coded at the same level as the resident's admission performance code. Oral Hygiene 5 -Day PPS Assessment Admission Perf ormance: In this example, the qualified clinician anticipates that the resident will have the same level of function for oral hygiene at admission and discharge. The resident's 5-Day PPS admission performance code is coded and the Discharge Goal is coded at the same level. Mrs. E has stated her preference for participation twice daily in her oral hygiene activity. Mrs. E has severe arthritis, Parkinson's disease, diabetic neuropathy, and renal failure. These conditions result in multiple impairments (e.g., limited endurance, weak grasp, slow movements, and tremors). The qualified clinician observes Mrs. E's 5- Day PPS admission performance and discusses her usual performance with qualified clinicians, caregivers, and family to determine the necessary interven tions for skilled therapy (e.g., positioning of an adaptive toothbrush cuff, verbal cues, lifting, and supporting Mrs. E's limb). The qualified clinician codes Mrs. E's 5 -Day PPS assessment admission performance as 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. The h elper performs more than half the effort when lifting or holding her limb. Oral Hygiene 5 -Day PPS Assessment Discharge Goal : The qualified clinician anticipates Mrs. E's discharge performance will remain 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Due to Mrs. E's progressive and degenerative condition, the qualified clinician and resident feel that, while Mrs. E is not expected to make gains in oral hygiene performance, maintaining her function at this same level is desirable and achievable as a Discharge Goal. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 31 GG0130: Self- Care (3 -day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) 3. Discharge Goal Code I s Lower than 5- Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code The qualified clinician determines that a resident with a progressive neurologic condition is expected to rapidly decline and that skilled therapy services may slow the decline of function. In this scenario, the D ischarge Goal code is lower than the resident's 5- Day PP S assessment admission performance code. Toileting Hygiene: Mrs. T's participation in skilled therapy is expected to slow down the pace of her anticipated functional deterioration. The resident's D ischarge G oal code will be lower than the 5- Day PPS Admission P erformance code. Toileting Hygiene 5 -Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance: Mrs. T has a progressive neurological illness that affects her strength, coordination, and endurance. Mrs. T prefers to use a bedside commode rather than incontinence undergarments for as long as possible. The certified nursing assistant currently supports Mrs. T while she is standing so that Mrs. T can release her hand from the grab bar (next to her bedside commode) and pull down her underwear before sitting onto the bedside commode. When Mrs. T has finished voiding, she wipes her perineal area. Mrs. T then requires the helper to support her trunk while Mrs. T pulls up her underwear. The qualified clinician codes the 5 -Day PPS assessment admission performance as 03, Partial/m oderate assistance. The certified nursing assistant provides less than half the effort for Mrs. T's toileting hygiene. Toileting Hygiene Discharge Goal: By discharge, it is expected that Mrs. T will need assistance with toileting hygiene and that the helper will perform mor e than half the effort. The qualified clinician codes her D ischarge G oal as 02 , Substantial/maximal assistance.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 37 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Item Rationale During a Medicare Part A SNF stay, residents may have mobility limitations on admission. In addition, residents may be at risk of further functional decline during their stay in the SNF . Steps for Assessment 1. Assess the resident's mobility performance based on direct observation, incorporating resident self-report s and reports from qualified clinicians, care staff, or family documented in the resident's medical record during the three- day assessment period. CMS anticipates that a multidisciplinary team of qualified clinicians is involved in assessing the resident during the three-day assessment period. For Section GG, the assessment period is the first three days of the Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare S tay. On admission, these items are completed only when A0310B = 01 (5- Day PPS assessment). For the Interim Payment Assessment (A0310B=08), the assessment period for Section GG is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and two days prior). 2. Resident s should be allowed t o perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. 3. For the purposes of completing Section GG, a \" helper \" is defined as facility staff who are direct employees and facility - contracted employees (e.g., rehabilitation staff, nursing agency staff). Thus, does not include individuals hired, compensated or not, by individuals outside of the facility's management and administration , such as hospice staff, nursing/certified nursing assistant students, etc. Therefore, when helper assistance is required because a resident's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, only consider facility staff when scor ing according to amount of assistance provided. 4. Activities may be completed with or without assistive device(s). Use of assistive device(s) to complete an activity should not affect coding of the activity. 5. The admission functional assessment, when possible, should be conducted prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to reflect the resident's true admission baseline functional status. If treatment has started, for example, on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. 6. Refer to facility, Federal, and State policies and procedures to determine which SNF staff members may complete an assessment. Resident assessments are to be done in compliance with facility, F ederal, and State requirements. DEFINITION USUAL PERFORMANCE A resident's functional status can be impacted by the environment or situations encountered at the facility. Observing the resid ent's interactions with others in different locations and circumstances is important for a comprehensive understanding of the resident' s functional status. If the resident's functional status varies, record the resident 's usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the resident 's best performance and do not record the resident 's worst performance, but rather record the resident 's usual performance . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 38 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding I nstruct ions When coding the resident's usual performance and the resident's discharge goal(s), use the six -point scale, or one of the four \"activity was not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88), to specify the reason why an activity was not attempted. Code 06, Independent : if the resident completes the activity by him/herself with no assist ance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance: if the helper sets up or cleans up ; resident completes activ ity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For exa mple, the resident requires placement of a bed rail to facilitate rolling, or requires set up of a leg lifter or other assisti ve devices. Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance: if the helper provides verbal cues or touching/ steadying /contact guard assista nce as resident completes activ ity. Assista nce may be provided throughout the act ivity or intermittently. For example, the resident requires ver bal c ueing, coax ing, or gener al supervision for safe ty to complete the activity; or resident may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steady ing assistance during the activity. Code 03, Part ial/mode rate assistance: if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, hold s, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. For example, the resident requires assista nce s uch as partial weigh t-bearing assista nce, b ut HELPER does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Code 02, Subs tantial/maxi mal assistance: if the helper does MORE THAN HALF the e ffort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent : if the helper does ALL of the ef fort. Resident does none of the effort to complete the activity . Or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the resident to complete the activity. Code 07, Resident refused: if the resident refused to complete t he act ivity. Code 09, Not applicable: if the activity was not attempted and the resident did not perform this activ ity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations: if the resident did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment and weather constraints. Code 88, Not attempted due to med ical condi tion or safety concerns : if the activity was not atte mpted due to medical co ndition or safety concer ns. For additional information on coding the resident's performance on the assessment instrument, refer to the Decision Tree on page GG -12. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 39 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding Tips Admission: The 5 -Day PPS assessment (A0310B = 01) is the first Medicare -required assessment to be completed when the resident is admitted for a SNF Part A stay. o For the 5- Day PPS assessment, code the resident's functional status based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs soon after the resident's admission. This functional assessment must be completed within the first three days (three calendar days) o f the Medicare Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare Stay , and the following two days, ending at 11:59 PM on day 3. The admission function scores are to reflect the resident's admission baseline status and are to be b ased on an assessment. The scores should reflect the resident's status prior to any benefit from interventions. The assessment should occur prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine the resident's true admission baseline status. Even if treatment started on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. Interim Performance (Optional): The Interim P ayment Assessment (IPA) is an optional assessment that may be completed by providers in order to report a change in the resident 's PDPM classification. For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6-point scale and activity not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and the 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. Discharge: The Part A PPS Dischar ge assessment is required to be completed when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends as documented in A2400C, End of Most Recent Medicare Stay, either as a standalone assessment when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility; or may be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Medicare Part A stay ends on the day of , or one day before , the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). Please see Chapter 2 and Section A of the RAI Manual for additional details regarding the Part A PPS Discharge assessment. o For the Discharge assessment, (i.e., standalone Part A PPS or combined OBRA/Part A PPS), code the resident's discharge functional status, based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs as close to the time of the resident's discharge from Medicare Part A as possible. This functional assessment must be completed within the last three calendar days of the resident 's Medicare Part A stay, which includes the day of discharge from Medicare Part A and the two days prior to the day of discharge from Medicare Part A . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 40 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Admission , Interim, and Discharge Performance Coding Tips General Coding Tips When reviewing the medical record, interviewing staff, and observing the resident , be familiar with the definition for each activity . For example, when assessing GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, determine the type and amount of assistance required as the resident walks 50 feet and negotiates two turns . If the resident does not attempt the activity and a helper does not complete the activity for the resident during the entire assessment period , code the reason the activity was not attempted. For example, code as 07, if the resident refused to attempt the activity ; code as 09, if the activity is not applicable for the resident (the activity did not occur at the time of the assessment , and prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury ); code as 10, if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to environmental limitations; or code as 88, if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to a medical condition or safety concerns. An activity can be completed independently with or without devices. If the resident has adaptive equipment, retrieves the equipment without assistance, and performs the activity independently using the device, enter code 06, Independent. If two or more helpers are required to assist the resident to complete the activity, code as 01, Dependent. To clarify your own understanding and observations about a resident's performance of an activity, ask probing questions, beginning with the general and proceeding to the more specific. See examples of using probes when talking with staff at the end of this section. A dash (\"- \") indicates \"No information.\" CMS expects das h use to be a rare occurrence. Documentation in the medical record is used to support assessment coding of Section GG. Data entered should be consistent with the clinical assessment documentation in the resident's medical record. This assessment can be conducted by appropriate healthcare personnel as defined by facility policy and in accordance with local, State, and Federal regulations. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG- 41 GG0170: M obility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance When coding the resident's usual performance, \"effort\" refers to the type and amount of assistance a helper provides in order for the activity to be completed. The six-point rating scale definitions include the following types of assistance: setup/cleanup, touching assistance, verbal cueing, and lifting assistance. Do not record the resident's best performance, and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance during the assessment period. Code based on the resident's performance. Do not record the staff's assessment of the resident's potential capability to perform the activity. If the resident performs the activity more than once during the assessment period and the resident's performance varies, coding in Section GG is based on the resident's \"usual performance,\" which is identified as the resident's usual activity/performance for any of the Self -Care or Mobility activities, not the mos t independent or dependent performance over the assessment period. A provider may need to use the entire three- day assessment period to obtain the resident's usual performance. Examples and Coding Tips for Admission , Interim, or Discharge Performance Note: The following are coding examples and coding tips for mobility item s. Some examples describe a single observation of the person completing the activity; other examples describe a summary of several observations of the resident completing an activity across different times of the day and different days. Examples for GG0170A, Roll left and right 1. Roll left and right: Mrs. R has a history of skin breakdown. A nurse instructs her to turn onto her right side, providing step- by-step instructions to use the bedrail, bend her left leg, and then roll onto her right side. Mrs. R attempts to roll with the use of the bedrail, but indicates she cannot perform the task. The nurse then rolls her onto her right side. Next, Mrs. R is instructed to return to lying on her back, which she successfully completes. Mrs. R then requires physical assistance from the nurse to roll onto her left side and to return to lying on her back to complete the activity. Coding: GG0170A would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale : The nurse provides more than half of the effort needed for the resident to complete the activity of rolling left and right. This is because the nurse provides physical assistance to move Mrs. R's body weight to turn onto her right side. The nurse provides the same assistance when Mrs. R turn s to her left side and when she returns to her back. Mrs. R is able to return to lying on her back from her right side by herself.

Coding Tips for GG0170I -G0170L Walking Items Walking activities do not need to occur during one session. Allowing a resident to rest between activities or completing activities at different time s during the day or on different days may facilitate completion of the activities. When coding GG0170 walking items, do not consider the resident's mobility performance when using parallel bars. Parallel bars are not a portable assistive device. If safe, assess and code walking u sing a portable walking device. The turns included in item GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, are 90-degree turns. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the right or two 90- degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left and one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person's ability level and can include use of an assistive device (for example, cane). Examples for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet 1. Walk 10 feet : Mrs. C has resolving sepsis and has not walked in three weeks because of her medical condition. A physical therapist determines that it is unsafe for Mrs. C to use a walker, and the resident only walks using the parallel bars. On day 3 of the Admission assessment period, Mrs. C walks 10 feet using the parallel bars while the therapist provides substantial weight-bearing support throughout the activity. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Rationale : When assessing a resident for GG0170 walking items, do not consider walking in parallel bars, as parallel bars are not a portable assistive device. If the resident is unable to walk without the use of parallel bars because of his or her medical condition or safety concerns, use code 88, Activity not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. 2. Walk 10 feet: Mr. L had bilateral amputations three years ago, and prior to the current admission he used a wheelchair and did not walk. Currently Mr. L does not use prosthetic devices and uses only a wheelchair for mobility. Mr. L's care plan includes fitting and use of bilateral lower extremity prostheses. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 09, Not applicable, not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury . Rationale: When assessing a resident for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet, consider the resident's status prior to the current episode of care and current three- day assessment status. Use code 09, Not applicable, because Mr. L did not walk prior to the current episode of care and did not walk during the three-day assessment period. Mr. L's care plan includes fitting and use of bilateral prostheses and walking as a goal. A discharge goal for any admission performance item skipped may be entered if a discharge goal is determined as part of the resident's care plan.

Walk 10 feet: Mrs. C has Parkinson's disease and walks with a walker. A physical therapist must advance the walker for Mrs. C with each step. The physical therapist assists Mrs. C by physically initiating the stepping movement forward, advancing Mrs. C's foot, during the activity of walking 10 feet. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: A helper provides more than half the effort as the resident completes the activity. 4. Walk 10 feet : Mr. O has bilateral upper extremity tremors, lower extremity weakness, and Parkinson's disease. A physical therapist assistant guides and steadies the shaking, rolling walker forward while cueing Mr. O to take larger steps. Mr. O requires steadying at the beginning of the walk and progressively requires some of his weight to be supported for the last two feet of the 10-foot walk. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provides less than half the effort required for the resident to compl ete the activity, Walk 10 feet. While the helper guided and steadied the walker during the walk, Mr. O supported his own body weight with his arms and legs and propelled his legs forward for 8 of the 10 feet. The helper supported part of Mr. O's weight only for 2 of the 10 feet; thus Mr. O contributed more than half the effort. 5. Walk 10 feet: Mrs. U has an above- the-knee amputation and severe rheumatoid arthritis. Once a nurse has donned her stump sock and prosthesis, Mrs. U is assisted to stand and uses her rolling walker while walking. The nurse places his hand on Mrs. U's back to steady her toward the last half of her 10-foot walk. Coding: GG0170I would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A helper provides touching assistance in order for the resident to complete the activity of Walk 10 feet.

Coding Tips for GG0170R and GG0170S, Wheelchair Items The intent of the wheelchair mobility items is to assess the ability of residents who are learning how to self- mobilize using a wheelchair or who used a wheelchair prior to admission. Use clinical judgment to determine whether a resident's use of a wheelchair is for self-mobilization as a result of the resident's medical condition or safety. Do not code wheelchair mobility if the resident uses a wheelchair only when transported between locations within the facility or for staff convenience (e.g., because the resident walks slowly). Only code wheelchair mobility based on an assessment of the resident's ability to mobilize in the wheelchair. If the resident walks and is not learning how to mobilize in a wheelchair, and only uses a wheelchair for transport between locations within the facility or for staff convenience (e.g., because the resident walks slowly) , code the wheelchair gateway items at admission and/or discharge\u2014GG0170Q1 and/or GG0170Q3, Does the resident use a wheelchair/scooter? \u2014as 0, No, and skip all remaining wheelchair questions. Admission assessment for wheelchair items should be coded for residents who used a wheelchair prior to admission. o The responses for gateway admission and discharge wheelchair items (GG0170Q1 and GG0170Q3) do not have to be the same on the Admission and Discharge assessments. If a wheelchair is used for transport purposes only, then GG0170Q1 and/or GG0170Q3, Does the resident use a wheelchair or scooter? is coded as 0, No; then follow the skip pattern to continue coding the assessment. o Example of using a wheelchair for transport convenience: A resident is transported in a wheelchair by staff between her room and the therapy gym or by family to the facility cafeteria, but the resident is not expected to use a wheelchair after discharge. The turns included in item GG0170R (wheeling 50 feet with two turns) are 90- degree turns. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the right or two 90-degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left and one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person's abilit y level.

Coding: GG01 70S would be coded 06, Independent. Rationale: The resident navigates in the corridor for at least 150 feet without assistance. Discharge Goals: Coding Tips Discharge goals are coded with each Admission (Start of SNF PPS Stay) assessment. For the SNF QRP, a minimum of one self-care or mobility goal must be coded. However, facilitie s may choose to complete more than one self- care or mobility discharge goal. Code the resident's discharge goal(s) using the six -point scale. Use of \"activity not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s). The use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self -care or mobility goals that were not coded. Using the dash in this allowed instance after the coding of at least one goal does not affect APU determination . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ GG] October 2019 Page GG-67 GG0170: Mobility (3-day assessment period) Admission/Interim/ Discharge (Start/ Interim/End of Medicare Part A Stay) (cont.) Licensed qualified clinicians can establish a resident's discharge goal(s) at the time of admission based on the resident's prior medical condition, Admission assessment self - care and mobility status, discussions with the resident and family, professional judgment, the profe ssion's practice standards, expected treatments, resident motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the resident's discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the resident's care plan. If the performance of an activity was coded 88 , Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns, during the Admission assessment, a discharge goal may be coded using the six -point scale if the resident is expected to be able to perform the activ ity by discharge. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [H] October 2019 Page H-1 SECTION H: BLADDER AND BOWEL Intent: The inte nt of the items in t his section is to gather in formation on the use of bowel and bladder appliances, the use of and response to urinary toileting progra ms, urinary and bowel continence, bowel training progra ms, and bowel patterns. Each residen t who is incon tinent or a t risk of developing incontinence should be ident ified, assessed , and provide d wit h individualized treatment (medications, non- medicinal treat ments and/or devices) and services to achieve or maintain as normal elimina tion function a s possible. H0100: Appliances Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life It is important to know what appliances are in use and the history and rationale for such use. External catheters should fit well and be comfortable, minimize leakage, m aintain skin integrity, and prom ote resident dignity. Indwelling catheters should not be used unless there is valid m edical justificati on. Assessment should include consideration of the risk and benefits of an indwelling catheter, the anticipated duration of use, and considerati on of com plicat ions resulting from the use of an indwelling catheter. Complications can include an increased risk of urinary tract infection , blockag e of the catheter with assoc iated bypassin g of urine, expulsion of the catheter, pain, discomfort, and bleeding. Osto mies (and periostom al skin) should be free of redness , tendern ess, excoriation , and breakdown. Appliances should fit well, be comfortable, and promote resident dignity. Planning for Care Care planning should include interventions that are consistent with the resident's goals and m inimize complicatio ns associated with appliance use. DEFINITIONS INDWELLING CATHETER A catheter that is maintained within the bladder for the purpose of continuous drainage of urine. SUPRAPUBIC CATHETER An indwelling catheter that is placed by a urologist directly into the bladder through the abdomen. This type of catheter is frequently used when there is an obstruction of urine flow through the urethra. NEPHROSTOMY TUBE A catheter inserted through the skin into the kidney in individuals with an abnormality of the ureter (the fibromuscular tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) or the bladder. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [H] October 2019 Page H-2 H0100: Appliances (cont.) Care planning should be based on an assessment and evaluation of the resident's history, physical examination, physician orders, progress notes, nurses' notes and flow sheets, pharmacy and lab reports, voiding history, resident's overall condition, risk factors and information about the resident's continence status, catheter status, environmental facto rs related to continence programs, and the resident's response to catheter/continence services. Steps for Assessment 1. Examine the residen t to note the p resence of any urinary o r bowel appliances. 2. Review the medical record, including bladder and bowel records, for docum entation of current or past use of urinar y or bowe l appliances. Coding Instructions Check next to each appliance that was used at any time in the past 7 days. Select none of the above if none of the appliances A-D were used in the past 7 days. H0100A, indwelling catheter (including suprapubic catheter and nephrostom y H0100D, intermittent catheterizati on H0100Z, none of the above Coding Tips and Special Populations Suprapubic catheters and nephrostomy tubes should be coded as an indwell ing catheter (H0100A) only and not as an osto my (H0100C). Condom catheters (males) and external urinary pouches (females) are often used int ermittently or at night only; these should be coded as external catheters. Do not code gastrostom ies or other feeding ostom ies in this section. Only appliances used for eli mination are coded here. Do not include one -time catheterization for urine speci men during look- back period as intermittent catheterization. DEFINITIONS EXTERNAL CATHETER Device attached to the shaft of the penis like a condom for males or a receptacle pouch that fits around the labia majora for females and connected to a drainage bag. OSTOMY Any type of surgically created opening of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract for discharge of body waste. UROSTOMY A stoma for the urinary system used in cases where long-term drainage of urine through the bladder and urethra is not possible, e.g., after extensive surgery or in case of obstruction. ILEOSTOMY A stoma that has been constructed by bringing the end or loop of small intestine (the ileum) out onto the surface of the skin. COLOSTOMY A stoma that has been constructed by connecting a part of the colon onto the anterior abdominal wall. INTERMITTENT CATHETERIZATION Insertion and removal of a catheter through the urethra for bladder drainage. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [H] October 2019 Page H-3 H0100: Appliances (cont.) Self-catheterizations that are performed by the resident in the facility should be coded as intermittent catheterization (H0100D). This includes self -catheterizations using clean technique. H0200: Urinary Toileting Program Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life An individualized, resident -centered toileting program may decrease or prevent urinary incontinence, m inimizing or avoiding the negative consequences of incontinence. Deter mining the type of urinary incontinenc e can allow staff to provide more individualized progra mming or interventions to enhance t he resident's quality of life and functiona l status. Many incontinent residents (including those with dementia) respond to a toileting progra m, especially during the day. Planning for Care The steps toward ensuring that the residen t receives appropriate treat ment and services to restore as much bladder function as possible are \u2014 deter mining if the resident is currently experiencing some level of incontinence or is at risk of developing urinary incontinence; \u2014 completing an accurate, thorough assess ment of factors that may predispose the residen t to having urinar y incontinence ; and \u2014 implementing appropriate, individualized interventions and modifying them as appropriate. If the toileting program or bladder retrai ning leads to a decrease or resolution of incontinence, the program should be m aintained. Research has shown that one quarter to one t hird of residents will have a decrea se or resolution of incontinence in response to a toileting progra m. If inconti nence is n ot decreas ed or resolved w ith a toileting tr ial, co nsider whether ot her rever sible or treatable causes are pre sent. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items 2019 Page H-4 H0200: Urinary Toileting Program (cont.) Residents m ay need to be referred to practitioners who specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect bladder function. Residents w ho do not respond to a toileting trial and for whom other reversible or treatable causes are n ot found should receive supportive manage ment (such as checking the resident for incontinence and changing his or her brief if needed and providing good skin care). Steps for Assessment: H0200A, Trial of a Toileting Progr am The look -back period f or this item is since the most recent admission/entry or reentry or since urinary incontinence was first noted within the facility. 1. Review the medical record for evi dence of a trial of an individualized, resident -centered toiletin g program . A toileting trial should include observations of at least 3 days of toileting patterns with prompting to toile t and of recor ding results in a bladder record or voiding diary. Toileting progra ms may have different na mes, e.g., habit training/scheduled voiding, bl adder rehabilitation/bladder retraining. 2. Review records of voiding patterns (such as frequency, volum e, duration, n ightti me or dayti me, quality of strea m) over several days for t hose who are experien cing incontinence. 3. Voiding records help detect urinary patterns or interv als between in continenc e episodes and f acilita te providing care to avoid or reduce the frequency of episodes. 4. Simply tracking continence status using a bladder record or voiding diary should not be con sidered a trial of an individualized, resident -centered toileting program. 5. Residents should be reevalua ted whenever there is a change in cognition, ph ysical ability, or urinary tract function. Nursing hom e staff m ust use clinical judg ment to deter mine when it is appropri ate to reevalu ate a residen t's ability to participate in a toileting trial or, if the toileting trial was unsuccessful, the need for a trial of a different toileting program. DEFINITIONS BLADDER REHABILITATION/ BLADDER RETRAINING A behavioral technique that requires the resident to resist or inhibit the sensation of urgency (the strong desire to urinate), to postpone or delay voiding, and to urinate according to a timetable rather than to the urge to void. PROMPTED VOIDING Prompted voiding includes (1) regular monitoring with encouragement to report continence status, (2) using a schedule and prompting the resident to toilet, and (3) praise and positive feedback when the resident is continent and attempts to toilet. HABIT TRAINING/ SCHEDULED VOIDING A behavior technique that calls for scheduled toileting at regular intervals on a planned basis to match the resident's voiding habits or needs. CHECK AND CHANGE Involves checking the resident's dry/wet status at regular intervals and using incontinence devices and products. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items 2019 Page H-5 Toileting Program (cont.) Steps for Assessment : H0200B, Response to Trial Toileting Program 1. Review the resident's responses as recorded during the toileting trial, noting any change in the num ber of incontinence episodes or degree of wetness the resident experiences. Steps for Assessment: H0200C, Current Toileting Program or Trial 1. Review the medical record for evi dence of a toileting program being used to m anage incontinence during the 7 -day look- back per iod. N ote the num ber of days during the look- back period that the toileting program was i mplemented or carried out. 2. Look for docum entation in the m edical record s howing that the following three require ments have been met: implementation of an individualized, resident -specific toileting program that was based on an assess ment of the reside nt's unique voidin g pattern ; evidence that the indivi dualized program was communicated to staff and the resident (as appropriate) verbally and through a care pl an, flow records , and a writte n report ; and notations of the resident's response to the toileting program and s ubsequent evaluations, as needed . 3. Guidance for developing a toileting program may be obtained from sources found in Appendi x C. Coding Instructions H0200A, Toileting Program Trial Code 0, no: if for any reason the resident did not undergo a toileting trial. This includes residen ts who are co ntinent of urine with or without toile ting assistance, or who use a permanent catheter or osto my, as well as residen ts who prefer not to participate in a trial. Skip to Uri nary Continence item (H0300). Code 1, yes: for residents who underwent a trial of an individualized, resident -centered toileting program at l east once since the most recent admission/entry or reentry or since urinary incontinence was first noted within the facility . Code 9, unable to determine: if records cannot be obtaine d to deter mine if a trial toileting program has been attem pted. If code 9, skip H0200B and go to H0200C, Current Toileting Program or Tria l. Coding Instructions H0200B, Toileting Program Trial Response Code 0, no improv ement: if the frequency of resident's urinary incontinence did not decrea se during the toileting trial. Code 1, decreas ed wetness : if the resident's urinary incontinence frequency decreased, but the resident remained inconti nent. There is no quantitative definition of improve ment. However, the i mprove ment should be clinically m eaningful \u2014for example, having at least one less incontinent void per day than before the toileting program was implemented. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items 2019 inent): if the resident becomes completely conti nent of urine, with no episodes of urinary incontinence during t he toile ting tria l. (For resi dents who have undergone more than one toileting program trial during their stay, use the most recent trial to co mplete this ite m.) Code 9, unable to determin e or trial in progress: if the respo nse to the toileting trial cannot be determined because infor mation cannot be found or because the trial is still in progress. Coding Instructions H0200C, Current Toileting Program Code 0, no: if an individualized resident -centered toileting program (i.e., prompted voiding, scheduled toileting, or bladder training) is used less than 4 days of the 7- day look- back period to manage the resident' s urinar y continence. Code 1, yes: for residents who are being m anaged, during 4 or more days of the 7-day look- back period, with som e type of s ystematic toileting program (i.e., bladder rehabilitation/bladder retraining, prompted voiding, habit training/scheduled voiding). Some residents prefer to not be awakened to t oilet. If that resident, however, is on a toileting program during the day, code \"yes.\" Coding Tips for H0200A -C Toileting ( or trial to ileting) progra ms refer to a specific ap proach that is organized, planned, docum ented, monitored, and evaluat ed that is consistent with the nursing hom e's policies and procedures and curren t standard s of practice. A toileting p rogra m does not refer to \u2014 simply trac king contine nce status, \u2014 changing pads or wet gar ments, and \u2014 random assistance with toileting or hygiene. For a resident currently undergoing a trial of a toile ting progra m, \u2014 H0200A would be coded 1, yes, \u2014 H0200B would be coded 9, unable to determine or trial in progress , and \u2014 H0200C would be coded 1, yes. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items 2019 Page H-7 H0200: Urinary Toileting Program (cont.) Example s 1. Mrs. H. has a diagnosis of advanced Alzhei mer's disease. She is dependent on th e staff for her ADLs, does not have the cogni tive ability to void in the toilet or other appropriate receptacle, and is totally incontinent. Her voiding assessm ent/diary indicates no pattern to her incontinence. Her care plan states that due to her total incontinence, staff shoul d follo w the facility standard policy for in conti nence , whic h is to check an d chang e ever y 2 hour s while awake and apply a superabsorbent brief at bedtime so as not to disturb her sleep. Coding: H0200A would be coded as 0, no. H0200B and H0200C would be skipped. Rationale: Based on this resident's voiding assessm ent/diar y, there was no patt ern to her incontinence. There fore, H0200A would be coded as 0, no. Due to total incontinence a toileting program is not appropriate for this resident. Since H 0200A is coded 0, no, skip to H0300, Urinar y Continenc e. 2. Mr. M., who has a diagnosis of congestive hea rt failure (CHF) and a history of left-sided hemiplegia from a previous stroke, has had an in crease in u rinary inco ntinence. The tea m has assessed him for a reversible cause of the incontinence and has evaluated his voiding pattern using a voiding assessment/diary. After com pleting the assess ment, it was deter mined that incontinence episodes could be reduced. A plan was developed and i mplemented that called for toileting every hour for 4 hours a fter receivi ng his 8 a.m. diuretic, then every 3 hours until bedti me at 9 p. m. The team has communicated this approac h to the resid ent and the care team and has placed these int erventions in the care plan . The team will r eeval uate the resident's response to the plan after 1 month and adjus t as needed. Coding: H0200A would be coded as 1, yes . H0200B would be coded as 9, unable to determine or trial in progress . H0200C would be coded as 1, current toileting program or trial. Rationale: Based on this resident's voiding assessment/diar y, it was determined that this resident could benefit from a toileting program. Therefore H0200A is coded as 1, yes. Based on the assess ment it was deter mined that incon tinence episo des could be reduced, therefore H0200B is coded as 9, unable to deter mine or trial in progress. An individualized plan has been developed, i mplemented, and com municated to the resident and staff, therefore H0200C is coded as 1, current toileting program or trial. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [H] October 2019 Page H-8 H0300: Continence Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Incontinence can \u2014 interfere with particip ation in activities, \u2014 be socially embarrassing and lead to increased feelings of dependency, \u2014 increase risk of long -term institu tionalization, \u2014 increas e risk of skin rashe s and breakdown, \u2014 increase ris k of repeated urinary tract infections, and \u2014 increase the risk of falls and injuries resulting from atte mpts to reach a toilet unassi sted. Planni ng for Care For many residents, incontinence can be resolved or minimized by \u2014 identifying and treating underlying pot entiall y reversibl e causes , including medication side effects, urinary tract infection, constipation and fecal impaction, and immobility (especially among those with the new or recen t onset of incontinence); \u2014 eliminating environm ental physical barriers to accessing commodes, bedpans, and urinals ; and \u2014 bladder retraining, prompted voidi ng, or schedule d toileting. For residents whose incontinence does not have a reversibl e cause and who do not respond to retraining, prompted voiding, or scheduled toileting, the interdisciplinary team should establish a plan to m aintain skin dryness and minimize exposure to urine. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record for bladder or incontinence records or flow sheets, nursing assessm ents and progress notes, physician history, and physical exam ination. 2. Inter view the resident if he or she is capable of reliably reporting his or her continence. Speak with fa mily m embers or significant others if the resident is not able to report on contine nce. 3. Ask direc t care staff who routi nely work with t he resident on all shifts about incon tinence episodes. DEFINITIONS URIN ARY INCON TINENCE The in ry loss CONTINENCE Any void that occu rs volunt arily, or as the result toileting, or sche 2019 Page H-9 Continence (cont.) Coding Code 0, always continent: if throughout the 7-day look- back period the resident has been continent of urine, wi thout any episodes of inconti nence. Code 1, occasion ally incon tinent: if during the 7-day look-back period the residen t was incontinent less th an 7 ep isodes. This includes incontinence of any amount of urine sufficie nt to dampen undergar ments, briefs, or pads during daytime or nighttim e. Code 2, frequen tly incontinen t: if during the 7-day look- back period, the resident was incontinent of urine during seven or m ore episodes but had at least one continent void. This includes inco ntinence of any amount of urine, dayti me and nightti me. Code 3, always incontinent: if during the 7-day look-back period, the resident had no continent voids. Code 9, not rated: if during the 7-day look- back period the resident had an indwelling bladder catheter, condom catheter, ostom y, or no urine output (e.g., is on chronic dialysis with no urine output ) for the entir e 7 days. Coding Tips and Special Populations If inter mittent cat heterization is used to drain the bladder, code conti nence level based on contine nce between cat heterizations. Examples 1. An 86-year-old fe male resident has had longstanding stress -type incontinence for m any years. W hen she has an upper respiratory i nfectio n and is coughing , she involuntarily loses urine. However, during the current 7-day look- back period, the resident has been free of respiratory sy mptoms and has not had an episode of incontinence. Coding: H0300 would be coded 0, always continent . Rationale: Even though the resident has known inter mittent stre ss incontinence, she was continent during the current 7-day look- back period. 2. A resident w ith m ulti-infarct d ementia is in conti nent of urine on three occasions on da y one of observation, continent of uri ne in response to toileting on days two and three, and has one urinary incontinence episode during each of the nights of days four, five, six, and se ven of the look- back period. Coding: H0300 would be coded as 2, frequently incontinent . Rationale: The resident had seven docu mented episodes incontinence over The crite rion for \"frequent\" incontinence has been set at seven or more episodes over the 7 -day look- back period with at least one continent void. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS 2019 Page H-10 Continence (cont.) 3. A resident w ith Parkinson's disease is severely immobile, and cannot be transferred to a toilet. He is unable to use a urinal and is m anaged by adult brief s and bed pad s that are regularly changed. He did not have a conti nent void durin g the 7-day look- back period. Coding: would be coded as 3, always incontinent . Rationale: The resident has no urinary continent episodes and cannot be toileted due to severe disability or discomfort. Inconti nence is managed by a check and change in protocol . 4. A resident had one continent urinary void during the 7-day look- back period, after the nursing assistant assisted him to the toilet a nd helped with clothing. All other voids were incontinent. Coding: H0300 would be coded as 2, frequently incontinent . Rationale: The resident had at least one conti nent void durin g the look-back period.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [H] October 2019 Page H-12 H0500: Bowel Toileting Program Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A syste matically i mplemented bowel t oileting program may decrease or prevent bo wel incontinence, m inimizing or avoiding the negative consequences of incontinence . Many incontinent residents respond to a bowel toileting progra m, especially during the day. Planning for Care If the bowel toileting p rogram leads to a decrease or resolution of incontinence, the program should be m aintained. If bowel incontinence is not decreased or resolved with a b owel toileting trial, con sider whether ot her reversible or treata ble causes are p resent. Residents w ho do not respond to a bowel toileti ng trial and f or whom other reversible or treatable causes are n ot found should receive supportive m anage ment (such as a regular check and change program with good skin care). Residents w ith a colostomy or colectom y ma y need their diet monitored to promote healthy bo wel eli mination and careful m onitor ing of skin to preven t skin irritation and breakdown. When developing a toileting program the provider may want to consider assessing the resident for adequate fluid intake, adequate fiber in the diet, exercise, and scheduled ti mes to attempt bowel mov ement (New man, 2009). Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medical record for evi dence of a bow el toileting program being used to manage bowel incontinence during the 7- day look- back period. 2.

DEFINITION CONSTIPATION If the resident has two or fewer bowel movements during the 7-day look-back period or if for most bowel movements their stool is hard and difficult for them to pass (no matter what the frequency of bowel movements). DEFINITION FECAL IMPACTION A large mass of dry, hard stool that can develop in the rectum due to chronic constipation. This mass may be so hard that the resident is unable to move it from the rectum. Watery stool from higher in the bowel or irritation from the impaction may move around the mass and leak out, causing soiling, often a sign of a fecal impaction.

Coding Instructions Complete only if A0310B = 01 or 08 Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category that best describes the primary reason for the Medicare Part A stay ; then proceed to I0020B and enter the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for that condition, including the decimal. While certain conditions described below represent acute diagnoses, SNFs should not use acute diagnosis codes in I0020B. Sequelae and other such codes should be used instead. Include the primary medical condition coded in this item in Section I: Active Diagnoses in the last 7 days. \u2014 Code 01 , Stroke , if the resident's primary medical condition category is due to stroke. Examples include ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vascular accident (CVA), and other cerebrovascular disease. \u2014 Code 02 , Non- Traumatic Brain Dysfunction, if the resident's primary medical condition category is non -traumatic brain dysfunction. Examples include Alzheimer's disease, dementia with or without behavioral disturbance, malignant neoplasm of brain, and anoxic brain damage. \u2014 Code 03 , Traumatic Brain Dysfunction, if the resident's primary medical condition category is traumatic brain dysfunction. Examples include trauma tic brain injury, severe concussion, and cerebral laceration and contusion. \u2014 Code 04 , Non- Traumatic Spinal Cord Dysfunction, if the resident's primary medical condition category is non- traumatic spinal cord injury. Examples include spondylosis with myelopat hy, transverse myelitis, spinal cord lesion due to spinal stenosis, and spinal cord les ion due to dissection of aorta. \u2014 Code 05, Traumatic Spinal Cord Dysfunction, if the resident's primary medical condition category is due to traumatic spinal cord dysfunction. Examples include paraplegia and quadriplegia following trauma. \u2014 Code 06 , Progressive Neurological Conditions , if the resident's primary medical condition category is a progressive neurological condition. Examples include multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. \u2014 Code 07 , Other Neurological Conditions , if the resident's primary medical condition category is other neurological condition. Examples include cerebral palsy, polyneuropathy, and myasthenia gravis. \u2014 Code 08 , Amputation, if the resident' s primary medical condition category is an amputation. An example is acquired absence of limb. \u2014 Code 09 , Hip and Knee Replacement , if the resident's primary medical condition category is due to a hip or knee replacement. An example is total knee replacement. If hip replacement is secondary to hip fracture, code as fracture. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-3 I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category (cont.) \u2014 Code 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma, if the resident's primary medical condition category is fractures and other multiple trauma. Examples include hip fracture, pelvic fracture, and fracture of tibia and fibula. \u2014 Code 11, Other Orthopedic Conditions , if the resident's primary medical condition category is other orthopedic condition. An example i s unspecified disorders of joint. \u2014 Code 12, Debility, Cardiorespiratory Conditions , if the resident's primary medical condition category is debility or a cardiorespiratory condition. Exa mples include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and other malaise and fatigue. \u2014 Code 13, Medically Complex Conditions, if the resident's primary medical condition category is a medically complex condition. Examples include diabetes, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, open wounds, pressure ulcer/injury, infection, and disorders of fluid, electrolyte, and acid- base balance. Examples of Primary Med ical Condition 1. Ms. K is a 67 -year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes who is admitted after a stroke. The diagnosis of stroke, as well as the history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes, is documented in Ms. K's history and physical by the admitting physician. Coding: I0020 would be coded 01, Stroke. I0020B would be coded as I69.051 The physician's history and physical documents the diagnosis stroke as the reason for Ms. K's admission. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. 2. Mrs. E is an 82- year-old female who was hospitalized for a hip fracture wit h subsequent total hip replacement and is admitted for rehabilitation. The admitting physician documents Mrs. E's primary medical condition as total hip replacement (THR) in her medical record. The hip fracture resulting in the total hip replacement is als o documented in the medical record in the discharge summary from the acute care hospital. Coding: I0020 would be coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. I0020B would be code d as S72.062D (Displaced articular fracture of the head of the left femur). Rationale: Medical record documentation demonstrates that Mrs. E had a total hip replacement due to a hip fracture and required rehabilitation. Because she was admitted for rehabilitation as a result of the hip fracture and total hip replacement, Mrs. E's primary medical condition category is 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-4 I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category (cont.) 3. Mrs. H is a 78- year-old female with a history of hypertension and a hip replacement 2 years ago. She was admitted to an extended hospitalization for idiopathic pancreatitis. She had a central line placed during the hospitalization so she could receive TPN (total parenteral nutrition). She also received regular blood glucose monitoring and treatment with insulin when she became hyperglycemic. During her SNF stay, she is being transitioned from being NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving her nutrit ion parenterally to being able to tolerate oral nutrition. The hospital discharge diagnoses of idiopathic pancreatitis, hypertension, and malnutrition were incorporated into Mrs. H's SNF medical record. Coding: I0020 would be coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. I0020B would be coded as K85.00 (Idiopathic acute pancreatitis without necrosis or infection) . Rationale: Mrs. H had hospital care for pancreatitis immediately prior to her SNF stay. Her principal diagnosis of pancreatitis was included in the summary from the hospital. The surgical placement of her central line does not change her care to a surgical category because it is not considered to be a major surgery. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-5 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Day s CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-6 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-7 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont. ) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Disease processes can have a significant adverse effect on an individual's health status and quality of life. Planning for Care This section identifies active diseases and infections that drive the current plan of care . Steps for Assessment There are two look -back periods for this section: Diagnosis identification (Step 1) is a 60- day look- back period. Diagnosis status: Active or Inactive (Step 2) is a 7 -day look- back period (except for Item I2300 UTI, which does not use the active 7 -day look- back period) . 1. Identify diagnoses: The disease conditions in this section require a physician -documented diagnosis (or by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 60 days . Medical record sources for physician diagnoses include progress notes, the most rec ent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, diagnosis/ problem list, and other resources as available. If a diagnosis/problem list is used, only diagnoses confirmed by the physician should be entered. Although open communication rega rding diagnostic information between the physician and other members of the interdisciplinary team is important, it is also essential that diagnoses communicated verbally be documented in the medical record by the physician to en sure follow -up. Diagnostic information , including past history obtained from family members and close contacts , must also be documented in the medical record by the physician to en sure validity and follow -up. 2. Determine whether diagnoses are active: Once a diagnosis is identified, it must be determined if the diagnosis is active . Active diagnoses are diagnoses that have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional, cognitive, or mood or behavior status, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7- day look- back period. Do not include conditions that have been resolved, do not affect the resident's current status, or do not drive the resident's plan of care during the 7- day look- back period, as these would be considered inactive diagnoses . DEFINITIONS ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Physician -documented diagnoses in the last 60 days that have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional status, cognitive status, mood or behavior, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7-day look-back period. FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS Loss of range of motion, contractures, muscle weakness, fatigue, decreased ability to perform ADLs, paresis, or paralysis. NURSING MONITORING Nursing Monitoring includes clinical monitoring by a licensed nurse (e.g., serial blood pressure evaluations, medication management, etc.). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-8 I: Act ive Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont. ) Item I2300 UTI, has specific coding criteria and does not use the active 7 -day look- back. Please refer to Page I -12 for specific coding instructions for Item I2300 UTI. Check the following information sources in the medical record for th e last 7 days to identify \"active\" diagnoses: transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, recent discharge summaries, nursing assessments, nursing care plans, medication sheets, doctor's orders, consults and official diagnostic reports, and other sources as available. Coding Instructions Code diseases that have a documented diagnosis in the last 60 days and have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional status, cognitive status, mood or behavior status, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7- day look -back period (except Item I2300 UTI, which does not use the active diagnosis 7- day look -back. Please refer to Item I2300 UTI, Page I -12 for specific coding instr uctions). Document active diagnoses on the MDS as follows: \u2014 Diagnoses are listed and Vision. \u2014 Examples of diseases are included for some disease categories. Diseases to be coded in these categories are not meant to be limited to only those listed in the examples. For example, I0200, Anemia , includes anemia of any etiolog y, including those listed (e.g., aplastic , iron deficiency, pernicious, sickle cell). Check off each active disease. Check all that apply. If a disease or condition is not specifically listed, enter the diagnosis and ICD code in item I8000, Additional active diagnosis. Computer specifications are written such that the ICD code should be automatically justified. The important element is to ensure that the ICD code's decimal point is in its own box and should be right justified (ali gned with the right margin so that any unused boxes and on the left.) If an individual is receiving aftercare following a hospitalization , a Z code may be assigned. Z codes cover situations where a patient requires continued care for healing, recovery, or long -term consequences of a disease when initial treatment for that disease has already been performed. When Z codes are used , another diagnosis for the related primary medical condition should be checked in items I0100- I7900 or entered in I8000.

There may be specific documentation in the medical record by a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist of active diagnosis. \u2014 The physician may specifically indicate that a condition is active. Specific documentation may be found in progress notes, most recent history and physical, transfer notes, hospital discharge summary, etc. \u2014 For example, the physician documents that the resi dent has inadequately controlled hypertension and will modify medications. This would be sufficient documentation of active disease and would require no additional confirmation. In the absence of specific documentation that a disease is active, the following indicators may be used to confirm active disease: \u2014 Recent onset or acute exacerbation of the disease or condition indicated by a positive study, test or procedure, hospitalization for acute symptoms and/or recent change in therapy in the last 7 days . Examples of a recent onset or acute exacerbation include the following : new diagnosis of pneumonia indicated by chest X -ray; hospitalization for fractured hip; or a blood transfusion for a hematocrit of 24 . Sources may include radiological reports, hospital discharge summaries, doctor's orders, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I-12 I: Active Di agnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) \u2014 Symptoms and abnormal signs indicating ongoing or decompensated disease in the last 7 days. For example, intermittent claudication (lower extremity pain on exertion) in conjunction with a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease would indicate active disease. Sometimes signs and symptoms can be nonspecific and could be caused by several disease pro cesses. Therefore, a symptom must be specifically attributed to the disease. For example, a productive cough would confirm a diagnosis of pneumonia if specifically noted as such by a physician. Sources may include radiological reports, nursing assessments and care plans, progress notes, etc. \u2014 Listing a disease/diagnosis (e.g., arthritis) on the resident's medical record problem list is not sufficient for determining active or inactive status. To determine if arthritis, for example, is an \"active\" diagnosis, the reviewer would check progress notes (including the history and physical) during the 7- day look- back period for notation of treatment of symptoms of arthritis, doctor's orders for medications for arthritis , and documentation of physical or other therapy for functional limitations caused by arthritis. \u2014 Ongoing therapy with medications or other interventions to manage a condition that requires monitoring for therapeutic efficacy or to monitor potentially severe side effects in the last 7 days . A medication indicates active disease if that medication is prescribed to manage an ongoing condition that requires monitoring or is prescribed to decrease active symptoms associated with a condition. This includes medications used to limit disease progression and complications. If a medication is prescribed for a condition that requires regular staff monitoring of the drug's effect on that condition (therapeutic efficacy), then the prescription of the medication would indicate active disease. It is expected that nurses monitor all medications for adverse effects as part of usual nursing practice. For coding purposes, this monitoring relates to management of pharmacotherapy and not to management or monitoring of the underlying disease. Item I2300 Urinary tract infection (UTI): \u2014 The UTI has a look- back period of 30 days for ac tive disease instead of 7 days. \u2014 Code only if both of the following are met in the last 30 days : 1. It was determined that the resident ha d a UTI using evidence -based criteria such as McGeer , NHSN, or Loeb in the last 30 days , AND 2. A physician documented UTI diagnosis (or by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 30 days . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I -13 I: Active Di agnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) \u2014 In accordance with requirements at \u00a7483.80(a) Infection Prevention and Control Program, the facility must establish routine, ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of surveillance data to identify infections. The facility's surveillance system must include a data collection tool and the use of nationally recognized surveillance criteria. Facilities are expected to use the s ame nationally recognized criteria chosen for use in their Infection Prevention and Control Program to determine the presence of a UTI in a resident. \u2014 Example: if a facility chooses to use the Surveillance Definitions of Infections (updated McGeer criteria) as part of the facility's Infection Prevention and Control Program, then the facility should also use the same criteria to determine whether or not a resident has a UTI. \u2014 If the diagnosis of UTI was made prior to the resident's admission, entry, or reentry into the facility, it is not necessary to obtain or evaluate the evidence -based criteria used to make the diagnosis in the prior setting. A documented physician diagnosis of UTI prior to admission is acceptable. This information may be included in the hospital transfer summary or other paperwork. \u2014 When the resident is transferred, but not admitted, to a hospital (e.g., emergency room visit, observation stay) the facility must use evidence -based criteria to evaluate the resident and determine if th e criteria for UTI are met AND verify that there is a physician -documented UTI diagnosis when completing I2300 Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). \u2014 Resources for evidence- based UTI criteria: Loeb criteria: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12098745_Development_of_Minimum_ Criteria_for_the_Initiation_of_Antibiotics_in_Residents_of_Long- Term - Infections in LTC (updated McGeer criteria): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538836/ National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN): https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ltc/uti/index.html In response to questions regarding the resident with colonized MRSA, we consulte d with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) who provided the following information: A physician often prescribes empiric antimicrobial therapy for a suspected infection after a culture is obtained, but prior to receiving the culture results . The confirmed diagnosis of UTI will depend on the culture results and other clinical assessment to determine appropriateness and continuation of antimicrobial therapy. This should not be any different, even if the resident is known to be colonized with an antibiotic re sistant organism . An appropriate culture will help to ensure the diagnosis of infection is correct, and the appropriate antimicrobial is prescribed to treat the infection. The CDC does not CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I -14 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) recommend routine antimicrobial treatment for the purposes of attempting to eradicate colonization of MRSA or any other antimicrobial resistant organism. The CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has released infection prevention and cont rol guidelines that contain recommendations that should be applied in all healthcare settings. At this site you will find information related to UTIs and many other issues related to infections in LTC. http://www.cdc.gov/hai/ Item I5100 Quadriplegia : \u2014 Quadriplegia primarily refers to the paralysis of all four limbs, arms and legs, caused by spinal cord injury. \u2014 Coding I5100 Quadriplegia is limited to spinal cord injuries and must be a primary diagnosis and not the result of another condition. \u2014 Functional quadriplegia refers to complete immobility due to severe physical disability or frailty. Conditions such as cerebral palsy, stroke, contractures, brain disease, advanced dementia, etc. can also cause functional paralysis that may extend to all limbs hence, the dia gnosis functional quadriplegia. For individuals with these types of severe physical disabilities, where there is minimal ability for purposeful movement, their primary physician -documented dia gnosis should be coded on the MDS and not the resulting paralysis or paresis from that condition. For example, an individual with cerebral palsy with spastic quadriplegia should be coded in I4400 Cerebral Palsy, and not in I5100, Quadriplegia. Examples of Active Disease 1. A resident is prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. The resident requires regular blood pressure monitoring to determine whether blood pressure goals are achieved by the current regimen. Physician progress note documents hypertens ion. Coding: Hypertension item ( I0700 ), would be checked . Rationale: This would be considered an active diagnosis because of the need for ongoing monitoring to en sure treatment efficacy. 2. Warfarin is prescribed for a resident with atrial fibrillation to dec rease the risk of embolic stroke. The resident requires monitoring for change in heart rhythm, for bleeding , and for anticoagulation. Coding: Atrial would be checked . Rationale: This would be considered an active diagnosis because of the need for ongoing monitoring to en sure treatment efficacy as well as to monitor for side effects related to the medication. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [I] October 2019 Page I -15 I: Active Di agnoses in the Last 7 Days (cont.) 3. A resident with a past history of healed peptic ulcer is prescribed a non- steroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID) medication for arthritis. The physician also prescribes a proton- pump inhibitor to decrease the risk of peptic ulcer NSAID treatment. I3700) , would be checked . Rationale : Arthritis would be considered an active diagnosis because of the need for medical therapy. Given that the resident has a history of a healed peptic ulcer without current symptoms, the proton- pump inhibitor prescribed is preventive and therefore PUD would not be coded as an active disease. 4. The resident had a stroke 4 months ago and continues to have left -sided weakness, visual problems , and inappropriate behavior. The resident is on aspirin a nd has physical therapy and occupational therapy three times a week. The physician's note 25 days ago lists stroke. Coding: Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or Stroke item ( I4500) , would be checked . Rationale : The physician note within t he last 30 days indicates stroke, and the resident is receiving medication and therapies to manage continued symptoms from stroke. Examples of Inactive Diagnoses (do not code) 1. The admission history states that the resident had pneumonia 2 months prior to this admission . The resident has recovered completely , with no residual effects and no continued treatment during the 7 -day look back period. Coding: Pneumonia item ( I2000 ), wou ld not be checked . Rationale : The pneumonia diagnosis would not be considered active because of the resident's complete recovery and the discontinuation of any treatment during the look-back period. 2. The problem list includes a diagnosis of c oronary artery disease (CAD). The resident had an angioplasty 3 years ago, is not symptomatic, and is not taking any medication for CAD. Coding: CAD item ( I0400), would not be checked . Rationale : The resident has had no symptoms and no treatment during the 7- day look- back period; thus , the CAD would be considered inactive. 3. Mr. J fell and fractured his hip 2 years ago. At the time of the injury, the fracture was surgically repaired. Following the surgery, the resident received sev eral weeks of physical therapy in an attempt to restore him to his previous ambulation status, which had been independent without any devices. Although he received therapy serv ices at that time, he now requires assistance to stand from the chair and uses a walker. He also needs help with lower body dressing because of difficulties standing and leaning over. Coding: Hip Fracture item ( I3900 ), would not be checked . Rationale : Although the resident has mobility and self -care limitations in ambulation and ADLs due to the hip fracture, he has not received therapy services during the 7- day look- back period; thus , Hip Fracture would be considered inactive. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 1 SECTION J: HEALTH CONDITIONS Intent: The inte nt of the ite ms in t his se ction is to docum ent a nu mber of health conditions that impact the resident's functional status and qual ity of life. The ite ms incl ude an assessm ent of pain which uses an i nterview with the resi dent or staff if the r esident is u nable to participate. The pain ite ms assess the presence of pain, pain frequency, effect on function, intensity, m anage ment and control. Ot her ite ms in the section assess dyspnea, tobacco use, prognosis, problem conditions, falls , prior surgery, and surgery requiring active SNF care . J0100: Pain Management (5 -Day Look Back) Item Rationale Heal th-related Quality of Life Pain can cause suffering and is ass ociated with inacti vity, social withdrawal, depression, and functional decline. Pain can interfere with par ticipation in rehabilitation. Effective pain m anag ement interventions can help to avoid these adverse outcom es. Planni ng for Care Goals for pain m anag ement for m ost residents should be to achieve a consistent l evel of com fort while maintai ning as m uch function as possible. Identification of pain m anage ment interventions facilitates r eview of the e ffectiveness of pain manage ment and revision of the plan if goals are not met. Residents m ay have m ore than one source of pain and will need a c omprehensive, indi vidualized m anagem ent regimen. Most residents with m oderate to severe pain will require regularly d osed pain m edication, and som e will require additional P RN (as -needed) pain m edications for breakthrough pain. Some resid ents with inte rmittent or m ild pain may have orders for P RN dosing only. DEFINITION PAIN MEDICATION REGIMEN Pharmacological agent(s) prescribed to relieve or prevent the recurrence of pain. Include all medications used for pain management by any route and any frequency during the look - back period. Include oral, transcutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, rectal , intravenous injections or intraspinal delivery. This item does not include medications that primarily target treatment of the underlying condition, such as chemotherapy or steroids, although such treatments may lead to pain reduction. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 2 J0100: Pain Management (cont.) Non-medication pain (non- pharmacologic) interventions for pain can be i mportant adjuncts to pain treatment regi mens. Interventions m ust be included as pa rt of a care pl an that ai ms to prevent or relieve pain and includes monitoring for effectiveness and revision of care plan if stated goals are not m et. There m ust be docum entation that the inte rvention was rec eived and its effecti veness was assessed. It does not have to have been s uccessful to be counted. Steps for Assessment 1. Review m edical record to deter mine if a pain re gimen exists. 2. Review the m edical record a nd interview staff and direct caregivers to deter mine what, if any, pain m anagem ent interventions the resident r eceived du ring the 5 -day look- back period. Include infor mation from all disciplines. Coding Instructions for J0100A -C Determine all inter ventions for pain provided to the reside nt during the 5- day look -back period. A nswer these items even if the resident currently denies pain. Coding Instructions for J0100A, Been on a Scheduled Pain Medication Regimen Code 0, no: if the m edical record does not contain docum entation that a scheduled pain m edication was received. Code 1, yes: if the medical record contai ns docum entation that a scheduled pain m edication was received. Coding Instructions for J0100B, Received PRN Pain Medication Code 0, no: if the medical record does not c ontain docum entation that a PRN medication was received or offered. Code 1, yes: if the medical record contai ns docu mentation that a P RN medicati on was either recei ved OR was offered but declined. DEFINITIONS SCHEDULED PAIN MEDICATION REGIMEN Pain medication order that defines dose and specific time interval for pain medication administration. For example, \"once a day,\" \"every 12 hours.\" PRN PAIN MEDICATIONS Pain medication order that specifies dose and indicates that pain medication may be given on an as needed basis, including a time interval, such as \"every 4 hours as needed for pain\" or \"every 6 hours as needed for pain.\" NON -MEDICATION PAIN INTERVENTION Scheduled and implemented non-pharmacological interventions include, but are not limited to, biofeedback, application of heat/cold, massage, physical therapy, nerve block, stretching and strengthening exercises, chiropractic, electrical stimulation, radiotherapy, ultrasound and acupuncture. Herbal or alternative medicine products are not included in this category. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 3 J0100: Pain Management (cont.) Coding Instructions for J0100C, Received Non-medication Intervention for Pain Code 0, no: if the medical record does not contain docum entation that a non- medication pain intervention was received. Code 1, yes: if the medical record contai ns doc umentation that a non- medication pain intervention was scheduled as part of the care plan and it is docum ented that the intervention was actually received and assessed for efficacy. Coding Tips Code only pain m edication regi mens without PRN pain m edications in J0100A. Code receipt of PRN pain m edications in J0100B. For coding J0100B code only residents with P RN pain medication regi mens here. If the resident has a scheduled pain medication J0100A should be coded. Examples 1. The resi dent's m edical record doc uments that she received the following pain m anage ment in the past 5 days: Hydrocodone/acetam inophen 5/500 1 tab PO e very 6 hours. Disc ontinued on day 1 of look- back period. Acetam inophen 500m g PO every 4 hours. S tarted on day 2 of look- back period. Cold pack to left shoulder applied by PT BID. PT notes that reside nt reports significant pain i mprove ment after cold pack applied. Coding: J0100A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: Medical record indicated that res ident received a scheduled pain medication during the 5- day look- back period. Coding: J0100B would be coded 0, no. Rationale: No docum entation was found in the medical record that resident received or was offered and declined any PRN medications during the 5 -day look- back period. Coding: J0100C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: The medical record indicates that the resident received scheduled non- medication pain intervention (cold pack to the left shoulder) during the 5- day look- back period. 2. The resi dent's medical record i ncludes the following pain manage ment docum entation: Morphine sulfate controlled- release 15 m g PO Q 12 hours: Resident refused every dose of medication during the 5 -day look- back period. No other pain m anag ement interventions were docu mented. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 4 J0100: Pain Management (cont.) Coding: J0100A would be coded 0, no. Rationale: The m edical record docum ented that the resident did not receive scheduled pain medication during the 5 -day look- back period. Residents m ay refuse scheduled m edication s; however, m edications are not consi dered if the resident refuses the dose. Coding: J0100B would be coded 0, no. Rationale: The m edical record contained no docum entation that the resident received or was offered and declined any PRN medications during the 5 -day look- back period. Coding: J0100C would be coded 0, no. Rationale: The m edical record contains no docu mentation that the res ident received non -medication pain intervention during the 5- day look- back period. J0200: Should Pain Assessment Interview Be Conducted? Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Most residents who are capable of com municating can answer questions about how they feel. Obtaining info rmation about pain directly from the resident, som etimes called \"hearing the res ident's voice,\" is more reliable and accurate than o bservation alone for identifying pain. If a resident cannot co mmunicate (e.g., verbal, gesture, written), t hen staff observations for pain be havior (J0800 and J0850) will be us ed. Planni ng for Care Inter view allows the re sident's voice to be reflected in the care plan. Infor mation about pain that com es directly from the resident provides sy mptom -specific infor mation for individualized care planning. Steps for Assessment 1. Interact with the resident using his or her preferred language. Be sure he or she can hear you and/or has access to his or her preferred method for communication. If the resident appears unable to communic ate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 5 J0200: Should Pain Assess ment Interview Be Conducted? (cont.) 2. Determine whether or not the resident is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If the resident is rarely/never understood, skip to item J0800, Indicators of Pain or Possible Pain. 3. Review Language item (A1100) to determine whether or not the resident needs or wants an interpreter. If the resident needs or wants an interpreter, complete the interview with an interpreter. Coding Instructions Attempt to complete the interview if the resident is at lea st sometimes understood and an interpreter is pre sent or not required. Code 0, no: if the resident is rarely/never unders tood or an interpreter is required but not available. Skip to I ndicators of Pain or Possible Pain item (J0800). Code 1, yes: if the resident is at least so metimes understood and an interpreter is present or not required. Cont inue to Pain Presen ce item (J0300). Coding Tips and Special Populations Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look- back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done within the look-back period of the ARD (except when an interpreter is needed/requested and unavailable), item J0200 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \" -\") entered in the resident interview items J0300- J0600. Item J0700, Should the Staff Assessment for Pain be Conducted, is coded 0, No. Do not complete the Staff Assessment for Pain items (J0800- J0850) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. If it is not possible for an interpreter to be present during the look-back period, code J0200 = 0 to indicate intervi ew not atte mpted and com plete Staff Assessment of Pain item (J0800), instead of the Pain Int erview items (J0300- J0600). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 6 J0300- J0600: P ain Assessment Interview Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The effects of unrelieved pain i mpact the individual in ter ms of functional decline, complications of immobility, skin breakdown and infections. Pain signi ficantly ad versely a ffects a person 's quality of life and is tig htly linked to depression, di minished self -confidence and s elf-esteem , as well as an increase in behavior pr oblems, particula rly for cognitively -impaired r esidents. Some older adults li mit their a ctivities in or der to avoid having pain. Their report of lower pain fr equency m ay reflect their avoidance of activity more than it reflects adequate pain manage ment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 7 J0300- J0600: P ain Assessment Interview (cont.) Planni ng for Care Directly asking the resident about pain rather than relying on the r esident to volunteer the infor mation or relying on clinical observa tion significantly improves the detection of pain. Resident self -report is the m ost reliable m eans for asses sing pain. Pain assess ment provides a basis for evaluation, treatment need, and response to treatment. Assessing w hether pain interferes with sleep or ac tivitie s provides additional understanding of the functional impact of pain and potential care planning i mplications. Assessm ent of pain provides insight into the n eed to adjus t the timing of pain interventions to better cover sleep or preferred activities. Pain assess ment pro mpts discussion about factors that aggravate and alleviate pain. Similar pain stimuli can have var ying impact on different individuals. Consiste nt use of a stan dardi zed pain inten sity sc ale improves the va lidity and reliability of pain asses sment. Using the sam e scale in different s ettings may improve continuity of care. Pain intensity scales allow providers to e valuate whether pain is responding to pain medication regi men(s) and/or non- pharmacological intervention(s). Steps for Assessment: Basic Interview Instructions for Pain Assessment Interview (J0300 -J0600) 1. Interview any resident not screened out by the S hould Pain Assessment Interview be Conducted? item (J0200). 2. The Pain Assess ment Interview for resident s consists of four ite ms: the pri mary q uestion Pain Prese nce item (J0300), and three follow -up questions Pain Frequency item (J0400); Pain Effect on Function item (J0500); and Pain Intensity item (J0600). If the resident is unable to answer the pri mary question on Pain Presence item J0300, skip to the Staff Assessment for Pain beginning with Indicators of Pain or P ossible Pain item (J0800). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 8 J0300- J0600: P ain Assessment Interview (cont.) 3. The look- back period on these ite ms is 5 days. B ecause this item asks the resident to recall pain during the past 5 days, this assess ment should be conducted close to the end of the 5 - day look- back period; preferably on the day be fore, or the day of the ARD. This should more accurately capture pain episodes that occur during t he 5- day look- back period. 4. Conduct the interview in a private setting. 5. Be sure the resident can hear you. Residents w ith hearing impair ment should be tested using their usual co mmunication devices/techniques, as applicable. Try an external assistive device (headphones or hearing a mplifier) if you have any doubt about hearing ability. Mini mize background noise. 6. Sit so that t he resi dent can see your face. Minimize glare by directing li ght sources away from the resident's face. 7. Give an introduction be fore starting the intervie w. Suggested language: \"I'd like to ask you some questions about pain. The reason I am asking these questions is to understand how often you have pain, how severe it is, and how pain affects your daily activities. This will help us to develop the best pla n of care to help manage your pain.\" 8. Directly ask the resident each item in J0300 throu gh J0600 in the order provided. Use other ter ms for pain or follow -up discussion if the resident seem s unsure or hesitant. S ome residents avoid use of the term \"pain\" but m ay report that they \"hurt.\" Residents m ay use other ter ms such as \"aching\" o r \"burning\" to descri be pain. 9. If the resident chooses not to answer a particul ar item , accept his/ her refusal, code 9 , and move on to the next item. 10. If the resident is unsure about whether the pain occurred in the 5- day ti me interv al, prompt the resident to think about the m ost recent episode of pain and try to deter mine whether it occurred wit hin the look- back period. J0300: Pain Presence (5- Day Look Back) DEFINITION PAIN Any type of physical pain or discomfort in any part of the body. It may be localized to one area or may be more generalized. It may be acute or chronic, continuous or intermittent, or occur at rest or with movement. Pain is very subjective; pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is and exists whenever he or she says it does. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 9 J0300: P ain Presence (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident : \"Have you h ad pain or hurting at any ti me in the last 5 days?\" Coding Instructions for J0300, Pain Presence Code for the presence or absence of pain regardless of pain management efforts during t he 5-day look -back period. Code 0, no: if the resident responds \"no\" to any pain in the 5- day look- back period. Code 0, no: even if the reason for no pain is that the resident received pain m anage ment interventions. If coded 0, the pain i nterview is co mplete. Skip to S hortness of Breath item (J1100). Code 1, yes: if the resident responds \"yes\" to pain at any time during the look- back period. If coded 1, proceed to ite ms J0400, J0500, J0600 AND J0700. Code 9, unable to answer: if the resident is unable to answer, does not respond, or gives a nonsensical response. If coded 9, skip to the Staff Assessment for Pain beginning w ith Indicators of Pain or Possible P ain item (J0800). Coding Tips Rates of self -reported pain are higher than observed rates. Although so me observers have expressed concern that residents m ay not com plain and m ay deny pain, the regular and objective use of self -report p ain scales enhances resid ents' willingness to report. Examples 1. When asked about pain, Mrs. S. responds, \" No. I have been taking the pain m edication regularly, so fortunately I have had no pain.\" Coding: J0300 would be coded 0, no. The assessor would skip to Shortness of Breath item (J1100). Rationale: Mrs. S. reports having no pain during the look- back period. Even though she received pain m anagem ent interventions during the look- back period, the item is coded \"No,\" because there was no pain. 2. When asked about pain, Mr. T. responds, \"No pain, but I have had a terrible burning sensation all down m y leg.\" Coding: J0300 would be coded 1, yes. The assessor would proceed to Pain Frequency item (J0400). Rationale: Although Mr. T.'s initial response is \"no,\" the comments indicate that he has experienced pain (burning sens ation) during the look- back period. DEFINITION NONSENSICAL RESP ONSE Any unrelated, incomprehen sible, or incoherent response that is not informative with respect to the item being coded. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 10 J0300: Pain Presence (cont.) 3. When asked about pain, Ms. G. responds, \"I was on a train in 1905.\" Coding: J0300 would be coded 9, unabl e to respo nd. The assess or would skip to Indicators of Pain item (J0800). Rationale: Ms. G. has provided a nonsensical answer to the question. T he assess or will complete the Staff Ass essment for Pain beginning with In dicators of P ain item (J0800). J0400: Pain Frequency (5-Day Look Back ) Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident: \"How much of the ti me have you experienced pain or hurting over the last 5 days ?\" Staff may present response options on a written sheet or cue card. This can help the resident respond to the ite ms. 2. If the resident provides a related response but does not use t he provided response scale, help clarify the best response by echoing (repeating) the resident's own comment and providing related response options. This interview approach frequently helps the resident clarify which response option he or sh e prefers. 3. If the resident, despite clarifying state ment and repeating response options, continues to have difficulty selecting between two of the provided responses, then select the more frequent of the two. Coding Instructions Code for pain frequency dur ing the 5- day look -back period. Code 1, almost constantly: if the resident responds \"almost constantly\" to the question. Code 2, frequen tly: if the resident responds \"frequently\" to the question. Code 3, occasion ally: if the re sident responds \"occas ionally\" to the question. Code 4, rarely: if the resident responds \"rarely\" to the question. Code 9, unable to answer: if the resident is unable to respond, does not respond, or gives a nonsensical response. Pr oceed to item s J0500, J0600 AND J0700. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 11 J0400: Pain Frequency (cont.) Coding Tips No predeter mined definitions are offered to the resident related to frequency of pain. \u2014 The response should be based on the reside nt's interpretation of the frequency options. \u2014 Facility policy should provide standardized tools to use throughout the facility in assessing pain to ensure consistency in interpr etation and docum entation of the resident's pain. Examples 1. When asked about pain, Mrs. C. responds, \"All the ti me. It has been a terrible week. I have not been a ble to get comfortable for more than 10 minutes at a ti me since I started physical therapy four days ago.\" Coding: J0400 would be coded 1, almost constantly . Rationale: Mrs. C. describes pain that has oc curred \" all the tim e.\" 2. When asked about pain, Mr. J. responds, \"I don' t know if it is frequent or occasional. My knee starts throbbing every ti me they m ove m e from the bed or the wheelchair.\" The interviewer says: \"Your knee throbs eve ry time they move you. If you had to choose an answer, would you say that you have pain frequently or occasionall y?\" Mr. J. is still unable to choose be tween frequently and occasionally. Coding: J0400 would be coded 2, frequently. Rationale: The interviewer appropriately ech oed Mr. J.'s com ment and provided related response options to help him clarify which response he preferred. Mr. J. re mained unable to de cide between frequently and occas ionally. The i nterviewer t herefore coded for the higher frequency of pain. 3. When asked about pain, Miss K. responds: \"I can't re member. I think I had a headache a few times in the past co uple of days, but they ga ve m e acetaminophen and the headaches went away.\" The int erviewer cl arifies by echoing what M iss K. said: \"You've h ad a headache a few times in the past couple of days and the headaches went away when you were given acetam inophen. If you had to choose from the answers, would you say you had pain occasio nally or rarel y?\" Miss K. re be coded 3, After the interviewer c larified the resident's choice using echoing, the resident selected a response option. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 12 J0400: Pain Frequency (cont.) 4. When asked about pain, Ms. M. responds, \"I would say rarely. Since I started using the patch , I don't have m uch pain at all, but four days ago the pa in cam e back. I think they were a bit overdue in putting on the new patch, so I had so me pain f or a little while th at day.\" Coding: J0400 would be coded 4, rarely . Rationale: Ms. M. selected the \"rarely\" response option. J0500: Pain Effect on Function ( 5-Day Look Back) Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the re sident each of the two questions e xactly as they are written. 2. If the resident's response does not lead to a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, repeat the resident's response and then try to narrow the focus of the response. For exa mple, if the resident responded to the question, \"Has pain m ade it hard for you to sl eep at night ?\" by saying, \"I always have trouble sleeping,\" then the assessor might reply, \"You always have trouble sleeping. Is it your pain that makes it hard for you to sleep? Coding Instructions for J0500A, Over the Past 5 Days, Has Pain Made It Hard for You to Sleep at Night? Code 0, no: if the resident responds \"no,\" indic ating that pain did not interfere with sleep. Code 1, yes: if the resident responds \"yes,\" indicating that pain interfered with s leep. Code 9, unable to answer: if the resident is unable to answer the question, does not respond or gives a nonsensical response. Proceed to ite ms J0500B, J0600 AND J0700. Coding Instructions for J0500B, Over the Past 5 Days, Have You Limited Your Day -to-day Activities because of Pain? Code 0, no: if the resident indicates that pain d id not interfere with daily activities. Code 1, yes: if the resident indicates that p ain int erfered with d aily activities. Code 9, unable to answer: if the resident is unable to answer the question, does not respond or gives a nonsensical response. Proceed to ite ms J0600 AND J0 700. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 13 J0500: Pain Effect on Function ( 5-Day Look Back) (cont.) Examples for J0500A, Over the Past 5 Days, Has Pain Made It Hard for You to Sleep at Night? 1. Mrs. D. responds, \"I had a little back pain from being in the wheelchair all day, but it felt so much better when I went to bed. I slept like a baby.\" Coding: J0500A would be coded 0, no . Rationale: Mrs. D. reports no sleep proble ms related to pain. 2. Mr. E. resp onds , \"I ca n't sleep at all in this place.\" The interviewer clarifies by saying, \"You can't sleep here. W ould you say that was because pain m ade it hard for you to sleep at night ?\" Mr. E. responds, \"No. It has nothing to do with m e. I have no pain. It is because everyone is making so much noise.\" Coding: J0500A would be coded 0, no. Rationale: Mr. E. reports that his sleep problems are not related to pain. 3. Miss G. responds, \"Yes, the back pain m akes it h ard to sleep. I have to ask for extra pain medicine, and I still wake up several ti mes during the night because m y back hurts so much.\" Coding: J0500A would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: The resident reports pain- related sleep proble ms. Examples for J0500B, Over the Past 5 Days, Have You Limited Your Day-to-day Activities because of Pain? 1. Ms. L. responds, \"No, I had som e pain on W ednesday, but I didn't want to miss the shopping trip, so I went.\" Coding: J0500B would be coded 0, no. Rationale: Although Ms. L. reports pain, she did not li mit her activity because of it. 2. Mrs. N. res ponds, \"Yes, I haven't been able to play the piano, because m y shoulder hurts.\" Coding: J0500B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Mrs. N. re ports lim iting her ac tivitie s because of pain. 3. Mrs. S. responds, \"I don't know. I have not tried to knit since my finger swelled up yester day, because I am afraid it m ight hurt even more than it does now.\" Coding: J0500B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Resident avoided a usual activity beca use of fear that her pain would increase. 4. Mr. Q. responds , \"I don't like painful activities.\" Interviewer repeats question and Mr. Q. responds, \"I designed a plane one ti me.\" Coding: J0500B would be coded 9, unable to answer. Rationale: Resident has provided a nonsensical answer to the question. Proceed to items J0600 AND J0700. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 14 J0600: Pain Intensity (5- Day Look Back) Steps for Assessment 1. You m ay use either Numeric Rati ng Scale item (J0600A) or Verbal Descriptor Scale item (J0600B) to interview the res ident about pain intensity. For each res ident, try to use the sa me scale u sed on prior asse ssments. 2. If the resident is unable to answer using one scale, the other scale should be atte mpted. 3. Record either the Numeric Rating Scale item (J0600A) or the Verbal Descriptor Scale item (J0600B). Leave the response f or the unused scale blank. 4. Read th e question and item choices slowly. W hile reading, you m ay show the resident the response options (the Numeric Rati ng Scale or V erbal Descriptor Scale) clearly printed on a piece of paper, such as a cue card. Use lar ge, clear print. For the Numeric Rati ng Scale, say, \"Please rate your wor st pain over the last 5 days with zero being no pain, and ten as the worst pain you can imagine.\" For Verbal Descriptor Scal e, say, \"Please rate the intensity of your worst pain over the last 5 days.\" 5. The resident m ay provi de a verbal response, point to the written response, or both. Coding Instructions for J0600A. Numeric Rating Scale (00-10) Enter the two digit number (00- 10) indicated by the reside nt as corresp onding to t he inten sity of his or her w orst pain during the 5- day look -back period, where zero is no pain, and 10 is the worst pain imaginable. Enter 99 if unable to an swer. If the Nu meric Rating S cale is not used, leave the response box blank. Coding Instructions for J0600B. Verbal Descriptor Scale Code 1, mild: if resident indicates that his or her pain is \" mild.\" Code 2, moder ate: if resident indicates that his or her pain is \" moderate.\" Code 3, severe: if resident indicates that his or her pain is \"severe.\" Code 4, very severe, horribl e: if resident indic ates th at his or her pain is \"very severe or horrible.\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 15 J0600: Pain Intensity (cont.) Code 9, unable to answer: if resident is unable to a nswer, chooses not to respond, does not respond or gives a nonsensical response. Proceed to item J0700. If the Verbal Descript or Scale is not used, leave the response box blank. Examples for J0600A. Numeric Rating Scale (00-10) 1. The nurse asks Ms. T. to rate he r pain on a scale of 0 to 10. Ms. T. states that she is not sure, because s he has shoulder pain and knee pain, and sometimes it is really ba d, and som etimes it is OK. The nurse re minds Ms. T. to think abou t all the p ain she had during the last 5 days and select the nu mber that des cribes her worst pain. She repor ts that her pain is a \"6.\" Coding: J0600A would be coded 06. Rationale: The resident said her pain was 6 on the 0 to 10 scale. Because a 2- digit number is required, it is entered as 06. 2. The nurse asks Mr. S. to rate his pain, rev iews u se of the scale, and provides the 0 to 10 visual aid . Mr. S. says, \"My pa in doesn't have any num bers.\" The nurse explains that the numbers help the staff understand how severe his pain is, and repeats that the \"0\" end is no pain and the \"10\" end is the worst pain i maginable. Mr. S. replies, \"I don't know where it would fall.\" Coding: Item J0600A would be coded 99, unable to answer . The int erviewer would go on to ask about pain intensity using the Verbal Descriptor Scale item (J0600B). Rationale: The resident was unable to select a n umber or point to a location on the 0- 10 scale that repres ented h is level of pain intensity. Examples for J0600B. Verbal Descriptor Scale 1. The nurse asks Mr. R. to rate his pain using the verbal descriptor s cale. He looks at the response options presented using a cue card and says his pain is \"severe\" so metimes, but most of the tim e it is \" mild.\" Coding: J0600B would be coded 3, severe . Rationale: The resident said hi s worst pain was \"Severe.\" 2. The nurse asks Ms. U. to rate her pain, revi ews use of the verbal descriptor scale, and provides a cue card as a visual aid. Ms. U. says, \"I'm not sure whether it's mild or moderate.\" The nurse re minds Ms. U. to think about her worst pain during the last 5 days. Ms. U. says \"At its worst, it was m oderate.\" Coding: Item J0600B would be coded 2, moder ate. Rationale: The resident indicated that her worst pain was \"Moderate.\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 16 J0700: Should the Staff Assess ment for Pain be Conducted? (5-Day Look Back) Item Rationale Item J0700 closes the pain interview and deter mines if the resident inte rview was complete or incomplete and based on this deter mination, w hether a sta ff assess ment needs to be com pleted. Health -related Quality of Life Resident interview for pain is pr eferred because it improves the detection of pain. However, a s mall percentage of residents a re unable or unwilling to complete the pain i nterview. Persons una ble to co mplete t he pain int erview may still have pain. Planni ng for Care Resident self -report is the m ost reliable m eans of assessing pain. However, when a resident is unable to provide the infor mation, staff assess ment is necessary. Even though the resident was unable to com plete the interview, important insights m ay be gained from the responses that were ob tained, observing behaviors and observing the resident's affect during the intervie w. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's responses to ite ms J0200- J0400. 2. The Staff A ssessment for Pain should only be co mpleted if the Pain Assessme nt Interview (J0200- J0600) was not completed. Coding Instructions for J0700. Should the Staff Assessment for Pain be Conducted? This item is to be coded at the completion of items J0400 -J0600. Code 0, no: if the resident co mpleted the Pain Assessme nt Inter view item (J0400 = 1, 2, 3, or 4. Skip to Shortness of Breath (dyspnea) item (J1100). Code 1, yes: if the r esident was unable to c omplete the P ain Assessment Inter view (J0400 = 9). Continue to Indicators of Pain or P ossible Pain item (J0800). DEFINITION COMPL ETED INTERVIEW The pain interview is successfully completed if the resident reported no pain (answered No to J0300), or if the resident reported pain (J0300=yes) and the follow - up question J0400 is answered. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 17 J0800: Indicator s of Pain (5- Day Look Back) Complete t his item only if the Pain Assessment Interview (J0200- J0600) was not completed. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Residents w ho cannot verbally communicate about their pain are at particularly high risk for underdetection and undertreat ment of pain. Severe cog nitive i mpairment m ay af fect the ability of residents to v erbally communicate, li miting the availabi lity of self-reported infor mation about pain. In t his populati on, fewer co mplaints m ay not m ean less pain. Individuals who are unable to verbally com municate m ay be more likely to use alternative m ethods of expres sion to communicate their pain. Even in this population som e verbal co mplaints of pain m ay be m ade and should be taken seriously. Planni ng for Care Consiste nt approach to observation impr oves the accuracy of pain asses sment for residents who are unable to verbally communicate their pain. Particular attention should be paid to using the indicators of pain during activities when pain is m ost likely to be de monstrated ( e.g., bathing, transferring, dressing, walking and potentially during eating). Staff m ust carefu lly m onitor, track, and do cument any possible signs and sy mptom s of pain. Identification of these pain indicat ors can: \u2014 provide a basis for m ore co mprehensive pain assess ment, \u2014 provide a basis for deter mining appropriate treat ment, and \u2014 provide a basis for ongoing m onitoring of pa in presence and treat ment response. If pain indicators are present, assess ment should identify aggrava ting/alleviating factors related to pa in. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 18 J0800: Indicator s of Pain (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the medi cal record for docum entation of each in dicator of pain listed in J0800 that occurred during the 5 -day look- back period. If the record docu ments the presence of any of the signs and symptom s listed, confirm your record review with the d irect care staff on all shifts who work most closely with the resident during activities of daily living (ADL). 2. Interview staff because the m edical record m ay fail to note all observable pain behaviors. F or any in dicators that were not noted as present in medical record review, interview di rect care staf f on a ll shif ts who work with the resident during ADL. A sk directly about the presence of each in dicator that was not noted as being pre sent in the record. 3. Observe residen t during care activities. If you observe additional indicators of pain during the 5- day look -back period, code the corresponding items. Observatio ns for pain i ndicat ors m ay be m ore sensiti ve if the resident is observed during ADL, or wound care. Coding Instructions Check all t hat apply in the past 5 days based on staff observation of pain indicators. If the medical record revi ew and the int erview with direct care providers and observation on all shifts provide no evidence of pain indicators, Check J0800Z, None of these signs observed or documented , and proceed to Shortness of Breath item (J1100). Chec k J0800A, nonverbal sounds: included but not li to if crying, whining, gasping, m oaning, or groaning were observed or reported during t he look- back period.

Chec k J0800Z, none of these signs observed or docum ented: if none of these signs were observed or reported during the look- back period. Coding Tips Behavior change, depressed m ood, r ejection of care and decreased activity participation may be related to pain. T hese behaviors and sympto ms are identi fied in other se ctions and not reported here as pain screening item s. However, the contribution of pain should be considered when following up on those sy mptom s and beha viors. Examples 1. Mr. P. has advanced de mentia and is unable to verbally communicate. A note in his m edical record docu ments that he has been awake du ring the last night crying and rubbing his elbow. When you go to his room to interview the certified nurse aide (CNA) caring for hi m, you observe Mr. P. gri macing and clenching his teeth. The CNA r eports that he has been moaning and said \"ouch\" when she tried to m ove his ar m. Coding: Nonverbal Sounds item (J0800A); Vocal Compl aints of Pain item (J0800B); Facial Expressions item (J0800C); and Protective Body Movements or Postures item (J0800D), would be checked . Rationale: Mr. P. has de monstrated vocal com plaints of pain (ouch), nonverbal sounds (crying and moaning), facial expression of pain (gri macing and clenched teet h), and protective body movements (rubbing his elbow). 2. Mrs. M. has end -stage Parkinson's disease and is unable to verbally communicate. There is no docum entation of pain in her m edical r ecord during the 5- day look- back period. T he CNAs caring for her report that on som e mornings she m oans and winces when her ar ms and legs are moved during m orning care. During direct observation, you note that Mrs. M. cries and attempts to pull her hand away when the CNA tries to open the contracted hand to wash it. Coding: Nonverbal Sounds items (J0800A); Facial Expressions item (J0800C); and Protective Body Movements or Postures item (J0800D), would be checked . Rationale: Mrs. M. has de monstrated nonverbal sounds (crying, m oaning); facial expression of pain (wince), and protecti ve body move ments (atte mpt to withdraw). 3. Mrs. E. has been unable to verbally c ommunicate following a m assive cerebrovascul ar accident ( CVA) several months ago and has a Stage 3 press ure ulcer. There is no docum entation of pain in her m edical record. The CNA who cares for her reports that she does not seem to have any pain. You observe t he resident during her pressure ulcer dressing change. During the treat ment, you observe gr oaning, facial gri maces, and a wrinkled forehead. Coding: Nonverbal Sounds item (J0800A), and Facial Expressions item (J0800C), would be check ed. Rationale: The resident has de monstrated nonverbal sounds (groaning) and facial expression of pain (wrinkled forehead and gri macing). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 20 J0800: Indicator s of Pain (cont.) Examples (cont.) 4. Mr. S. is in a persiste nt veget ative st ate following a trau matic brain injury. He is unable to verbally communicate. There is no docum entation of pain in his m edical record during the 5-day look- back period. The CNA r eports that he appears comfortable whenever she cares for hi m. You observe the CNA providing m orning care and transferring him from bed to chair. No pain indicators are observed at any time.

Rationale: All steps for the assessm ent have been followed and no pain indicators have been documented, reported or directly observed. J0850: Frequency of Indicator of Pain or Possible Pain (5-Day Look Back) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Unrelie ved pain adve rsely affects f unction and mobility contrib uting to dependence, skin breakdown, contracture s, and weight loss. Pain signi ficantly ad versely a ffects a person 's quality of life and is tig htly linked to depression, di minished self -confidence and s elf-esteem , as well as to an increase in behavior pr oblems, particula rly for cognitively impaired r esidents. Planni ng for Care Assessm ent of pain frequency provides: \u2014 A basis for evaluating treat ment need and response to treat ment. \u2014 Information to aide in i denti fying opti mum timing of treat ment. Steps for Assessment 1. Review m edical record and interview staff and direct caregivers to deter mine the num ber of days the resident either co mplained of pain or showed evidence of pain as described in J0800 over the past 5 days. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 21 J0850: Frequency of Indicator of Pain or Possible Pain (cont.) Coding Instructions Code for pain frequency over the last 5 days. Code 1: if based on staff observation, the resident co mplained or showed evidence of pain 1 to 2 days. Code 2: if based on staff observati on, the resident co mplained or showed evidence of pain on 3 to 4 of the last 5 days. Code 3: if based on staff observati on, the resident co mplained or showed evidence of pain on a daily basis. Examples 1. Mr. M. is an 80- year old m ale with advan ced de mentia. During the 5- day look- back period, Mr. M. was noted to be gri macing and verbali zing \"ouch\" over the past 2 days when his right shoulder was m oved. Coding: Item J0850 would be coded 1, indicators of pain observed 1 to 2 days. Rationale: He has demonstrated vocal co mplaints of pain (\"ouch\"), facial expression of pain (gri macing) on 2 of the last 5 days. 2. Mrs. C. is a 78- year old f emale with a h istory of CVA with expressive aphasia and dementia. During the 5 -day look- back period, the resident w as noted on a daily basis to be rubbing her right knee and gri macing. Coding: Item J0850 would be coded 3, indicators of pain observed daily. Rationale: The resident was obser ved with a facial expression of pain (gri macing) and protective body m ovements (rubbing her knee) every day during the look- back period. J1100: Shortness of Breath (d yspnea) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Shortness of breath can be an extrem ely dis tressing sy mptom to residents and lead to decreased i nteraction and quality of life. Some resid ents co mpensate f or shor tness of li miting acti vity. T hey so metimes compensate for shortness of breath when ly ing flat by elevating the head of the bed and do not alert care givers to the problem. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- Shortness Breath (d yspnea) (cont.) Planni ng for Care Shortness of breath can be an indication of a change in condition requiring further assessm ent and should be explored. The care pl an should add ress underl ying illnesses that m ay exacerbate s ymptom s of shortness of breath as well as sy mptom atic treatment for shortness of breath when it is not quickly reversible. Steps for Assessment Interview the resident about shor tness of breath. Many residents, including those with m ild to moderate dem entia, m ay be able to provide feedback about t heir own symptom s. 1. If the resident is not exp eriencing shortness of breath or trouble breathing during the interview, ask the resident i f shortness of breath occurs when he or she engages in certain activities. 2. Review the m edical record for staff docu mentation of the presence of shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Interview staff on all shifts, a nd family/significant other regarding resident history of shortness of breath, allergies or other environm ental t riggers of shortness of breath. 3. Observe the resident for shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Signs of shortness of breath include: increas ed respirat ory rate, p lip a prolonged expiratory phase, audible respirations and gasping for air at rest, int errupted spe ech patt ern (o nly able to say a few words before taking a breath) a nd use of shoulder and other accessory muscles to breathe. 4. If shortness of breath or troubl e breathing is observed, note whether it occurs with certain positio ns or acti vities. Coding Instructions Check all t hat apply during the 7- day look -back period. Any evidence of the presence of a symptom of short ness of breath should be captured in this item. A resident may have any combination of these symptoms. Chec k J1100A: if shortness of breath or trouble breathing is pr esent w hen the resi dent is engaging in activity. S hortness of breath could be prese nt during a ctivity as lim ited as turning or movi ng in bed during daily care or with m ore strenuous activity such as transferring, walking, or bathing. If the resident avoids activity or is unable to engage in activity because of shortness of breath, then code this as pr esent. Chec k J1100B: if shortness of breath or trouble breathing is pr esent w hen the resi dent is sitting at rest. Chec k J1100C: if shortness of breath or trouble breathing is pr esent w hen the resi dent attempts to lie flat. Also code this as present if the resident avoids lying flat because of shortness of breath. Chec k J1100Z: if the resident reports no shortness of breath or trouble breathing and the m edical record and s taff interviews indic ate that shortness of breath appears to be absent or well controlled with current m edication. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 23 J1100: Shortness of Breath (d yspnea) (cont.) Examples 1. Mrs. W . has diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure. She is on 2 liters of oxygen and daily respira tory treat ments. W ith oxyge n she is able to ambulate and participate in m ost group activiti es. She reports feeling \"winded\" when going on outings that require walking one or m ore blocks and has been observed having to stop to rest several ti mes under such circum stances. Rece ntly, she describes feeling \"out of breath\" when she tries to lie do wn. Coding: J1100A and J1100C would be checke d. Rationale: Mrs. W. reported being short of breath when lying down as well as during outings that required ambul ating lo nger di stances. 2. Mr. T. has used an inhaler for years. He is not typically noted to be short of breath. T hree days ago, during a respiratory illness, he had m ild trouble with his breathi ng, even when sitting in bed. His shortness of breath also caused him to limit group ac tivities. Coding: J1100A and J1100B would be checke d. Rationale: Mr. T. was short of breath at rest and was noted to avoid activities because of shortness of breath. J1300: Current Tobacco Use Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The negative effects of smoking can shorten life expectancy and crea te health proble ms that inte rfere with daily activities and adversely affect quality of life. Planni ng for Care This item opens the door to negotiation of a plan of care with the r esident that includes support for smoking cessation. If cessation is declined, a care pl an that allows safe and environm ental accom modation of resident preferences is needed. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the re sident if he or she used tobacco in any fo rm during the 7 -day look- back period. 2. If the re sident states that he or she u sed tobacco in som e form during the 7- day look- back period, code 1, yes . DEFINITION TOBACCO USE Includes tobacco used in any form. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 24 J1300: Current Tobacco Use (cont.) 3. If the resident is una ble to ans wer or indicates t hat he or s he did not use tobacco of any kind during the look- back period, review the m edical record and interview staff for any indication of tobacco use by the res ident during t he look- back period. Coding Instructions Code 0, no: if there are no indications that the reside nt used any fo rm of tobacco. Code 1, yes: if the resident or a ny other sour ce ind icates that the r esident used t obacco in som e form during the look- back period. J1400: Prognosis Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Residents w ith conditio ns or dis eases that m ay result in a life expectancy of less t han 6 m onths have special needs and may bene fit from pallia tive or hospi ce services in the nursing ho me. Planni ng for Care If life expectancy is less than 6 m onths, interdisciplinary team care planning should be based on the resident's preferences for goals and interventions of care whene ver possi ble. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the m edical record for docu mentation by the physician that the resident's condition or chronic disease may result in a life expectancy of less than 6 mo nths, or that they h ave a t erminal illness. 2. If the physician states that the resident's life expectancy may be less than 6 m onths, request that he or she docum ent this in the me dical record. Do not code until there is documentation in the m edical record. 3. Review the m edical record to deter mine whether the resident is receiving hospice services. DEFINITION CONDITION OR CHRONIC DISEASE THAT MAY RESULT IN A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF LESS THAN 6 MONTHS In the physician' s judgment, the residen t has a diagnosis or combination of clinical conditio ns that have advanced (or will continue to deteriorate) to a point that the average resident with that level of illness would not be expected to survive more than 6 months. This judgment should be substantiated by a physician note. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact life expectancy for a single resident. Physician judgment shou ld be based on typical or average life expectancy of residents with similar level of disease burden as this resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 25 J1400: Prognosis (cont.) Coding Instructions Code 0, no: if the m edical record does not contain physician docu mentation that the resident is ter minally ill and the r esident is not rec eiving h ospice s ervices. Code 1, yes: if the medical record includes physician docum entation: 1) that the resident is ter minally ill; or 2) the r esident is receiving hospice services. Examples 1. Mrs. T. has a diagnosis of heart failure. During the past few months, she has had three hospital adm issions for acute heart f ailure. Her heart has beco me significantly weaker despite m aximum treat ment with m edications and oxygen. Her physician has discussed her deteriorating condition with her and her fa mily and has documented that her prognosis for survi val beyond the next couple of months is poor. Coding: J1400 would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: The physician docum ented that her life expectancy is likely to be less than 6 m onths. 2. Mr. J. was diagnosed with non- small cell lung cancer that is metastatic to his bone. He is not a candidate for surgical or curative treat ment. With his consent, Mr. J. has been referred to hospice by his physician, who docum ented that his life expectancy was less than 6 m onths. Coding: J1400 would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: The physician referred the resident to hospice and docum ented that his life expectancy is likely to be less than 6 m onths. J1550: Problem Conditions DEFINITIONS HOSPICE SERVICES A program for terminally ill persons where an array of services is provided for the palliation and management of terminal illness and related conditions. The hospice must be licensed by the state as a hospice provider and/or certified under the Medicare program as a hospice provider. Under the hospice program benefit regulations, a physician is required to document in the medical record a life expectancy of less than 6 months, so if a resident is on hospice the expectation is that the documentation is in the medical record. TERMINALLY ILL \"Terminally ill\" means that the individual has a medical prognosis that his or her life expectancy is 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal co urse. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 26 J1550: Problem Conditions (cont.) Intent: This item provides an opportunity for sc reening in t he areas of fever, vo miting, fluid deficits, and internal bleeding. Clinical screen ings provide indications for further evaluation, diagnosis and clini cal care planning. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Timely assess ment is needed to identify underlying causes and risk for complications. Planni ng for Care Implementation of care plans to treat underlying causes and avoid complications is critic al. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the m edical record, interview staff on all shifts and observe the resident for any indication that the resident h ad vom iting, fever, potential sig ns of dehydration, or internal bleeding during the 7- day look- back period. Coding Instructions Check all that apply (blue box) J1550 A, fever J1550 B, vomiting J1550 C, dehydrated J1550 D, internal bleeding J1550 Z, none of the above Coding Tips Fever: Fever is defined as a tem perature 2.4 degrees F higher than baseline. The resident's baseline tem perature should be e stablished prior to the Assessm ent Reference Date. Fever assessment prior to establishin g base line temper ature: A temperature of 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) on adm ission (i.e., prior to the establish ment of the ba seline te mperature) would be considered a fever. Vomiting: Regurgitation of sto mach contents; may be caused by m any factors (e.g., drug toxicity, infection, psychogenic). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 27 J1550: Problem Conditions (cont.) Dehy drated: Check this item if the resi dent pr esents with two or m ore of the following potential indicato rs for dehydration: 1. Resident ta kes in less t han the r ecommended 1,500 m l of fluids daily (water or liquids in beverages and water in foods with high fluid content, such as gelatin and soups). Note: The recomm ended intake lev el has been changed from 2,500 m l to 1,500 m l to reflect curre nt pract ice standards. 2. Resident has one or m ore potential clinical signs (indicato rs) of dehydration, including but not limited to dry mucous m embranes, poor skin turgor, cracked lips, thirst, sunken eyes, dark urine, new onset or increased confusion, fever, or abnor mal laboratory values (e.g., elevated hemoglobin and he matocrit, potassium chloride, sodium , albumin, blood urea nitrogen, or urine specific gravity). 3. Resident's fluid loss exceeds the amount of fluids he or she takes in (e.g., loss from vomiting, fev er, diarrhea that ex ceeds fluid re placement). Internal Bleeding : Bleeding m ay be frank (such as br ight red blood) or occult (such as guai ac positive sto ols). Clinic al indicat ors include black, t arry sto ols, vom iting ffee grounds,\" he maturia (blood in moptysis (coughing up blood), and severe epistaxis (nosebleed) that requires pack ing. However, nose bleeds that are easily controlled, m enses, or a urinalysis that shows a s mall amount of red blood cells should not be coded as internal bleeding. J1700: Fall History on Admission/Entry or Reentry Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Falls a re a l eading cau se of injury, morbidity, and mortality in older adults. A previous fall, especially a recent fall, rec urrent falls, and falls with s ignificant i njury are the m ost important predictors of risk for future falls and injurious falls. Persons with a hist ory of falling m ay limit activities because of a fear of falling and should be evaluated for reversible causes of falling. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 28 J1700: Fall History on Admission (cont.) Planni ng for Care Deter mine the potential need for further ass essment and intervention, includi ng evaluation of the resident's need for rehabilitation or assistive devices. Evaluate the physical environ ment as well as staffing needs for residents who are at risk fo r falls. Steps for Assessment The period of review is 180 days (6 months) prior to admission, looking back from the resident's entry date (A1600 ). 1. Ask the resident and fa mily or significant other about a history of falls in the m onth prior to adm ission and in the 6 months prior to adm ission. This would include any fall, no matter where it occurred. 2. Review int er-facility tr ansfer information (if the reside nt is being ad mitted from another f acilit y) for evidence of falls. 3. Review all relevant m edical rec ords received fr om facilities where t he res ident resided during the previous 6 months; also review an y other m edical records received for evidence of one or m ore falls. Coding Instructions for J1700A, Did the Resident Have a Fall Any Time in the Last Month Prior to Admission/Entry or Reentr y? Code 0, no: if resident and fa mily report no falls and transfer records and m edical records do not docum ent a fall in the month preceding the resident's entry date item (A1600). Code 1, yes: if resident or fa mily report or t ransfer recor ds or m edical records docu ment a fall in the month preceding t he resident's entry date item (A1600). Code 9, unable to determine: if the resident is unable to provide the infor mation or if the resident and fa mily are not avail able o r do not have the infor mation and m edical record in formation is i nadequate to deter mine whether a fall occurred. DEFINITION FALL Unintentional chan ge in position coming to rest on the ground, floor or onto the next lower surface (e.g., onto a bed, chair, or bedsi de mat). The fall may be witnessed, reported by the resident or an observer or identified when a resident is found on the floor or ground. Falls include any fall, no matter whether it occurr ed at home, while out in the comm unity, in an acute hospital or a nursing home. Falls are not a result of an overwhelming external force (e.g., a resident pushes another resident). An intercep ted fall occurs when the resident would have fallen if he or she had not caught him/herself or had not been intercep ted by another person - this is still considered a fall. CMS understands that challenging a resident's balance and training him/her to recover from a loss of balance is an intentional therapeutic intervention and does not consider anticipated losses of balance that occur during supervised therapeutic interventions as intercepted falls. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 29 J1700: Fall History on Admission (cont.) Coding Instructions for J1700B, Did the Resident Have a Fall Any Time in the Last 2 -6 Months prior to Admission/Entry or Reentry? Code 0, no: if resident and fa mily report no falls and transfer records and medical records do not docum ent a fall in the 2 -6 months prior to the r esident 's entry date item (A1600). Code 1, yes: if resident or fa mily report or transfer recor ds or m edical records docum ent a fall in the 2 -6 months prior to the resident's entry date item (A1600). Code 9, unable to determine: if the resident is unable to provide the infor mation, or if the resident and fa mily are not available or do not have the infor mation, and m edical record in formation is inadequate to deter mine whether a fall occurred. Coding Instructions for J1700C. Did the Resident Have Any Fracture Related to a Fall in the 6 Months prior to Admission/Entry or Reentry? Code 0, no: if resident and fa mily report no fractures related to f alls and trans fer records and m edical records do not docum ent a fracture related to fall in the 6 months (0- 180 days) preceding the resident 's entry date item (A1600). Code 1, yes: if resident or fa mily report or transfer records or medical records docum ent a fracture r elated to fall in the 6 m onths (0- 180 days) preceding the resident's entry date item (A1600). Code 9, unable to determine: if the resident is unable to provide the infor mation, or if the resident and family are not available or do not have the infor mation, and medical record infor mation is inadequa te to deter mine whether a fall occurred. Examples 1. On ad mission interview, Mrs. J. is asked about falls and says she has \"not really fallen.\" However, she goes on to say that when she went shopping with her d aughter about 2 w eeks ago, her walker got tangled with the shopping cart and she slipped down to the floor. Coding: J1700A would be coded 1, yes . Rationale: Falls caused by slipping m eet the definition of falls. DEFINITION FRACTURE RELATED TO A FALL Any documented bone fracture (in a problem list from a medical record, an x- ray report, or by history of the resident or caregiver) that occurred as a direct result of a fall or was recogn ized and later attribut ed to the fall. Do not include fractures caused by trauma related to car crashes or pedestrian vers us car accidents or impact of another person or object against the resid ent. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 30 J1700: Fall History on Admission (cont.) 2. On ad mission interview a resid ent denies a history of fall ing. However, her daughter says that she found her m other on the floor near her toilet twice about 3 -4 months ago. Coding: J1700B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: If the individual is found on the floor, a fall is assu med to have occurred. 3. On ad mission int erview, Mr. M. and his f amily deny any hi story of falling. However, nursing notes in the transferring hos pital record docu ment that Mr. M. re peatedly t ried to get out of bed unassisted at night to go to the bat hroom and was found on a m at placed at his bedside to prevent inj ury the week prior to nursing hom e transfer. Coding: J1700A would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Medical records from an outside facility d ocument that Mr. M. was found on a m at on the floor. This is defined as a fall. 4. Medical records note that Miss K. had hip surgery 5 m onths prior to admission to the nursing home. Miss K.'s daughter says the surgery was needed to fix a broken hip due to a fall. Coding: Both J1700B and J1700C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Miss K. had a fall related fracture 1 -6 months prior to nursing hom e entry. 5. Mr. O.'s hospital transfer rec ord includes a history of ost eoporosis and vertebral com pression fractures. The record does not m ention falls, and Mr. O. denies any history of falling. Coding: J1700C would be coded 0, no. Rationale: The fractures were not related to a fall. 6. Ms. P. has a history of a \"Colles' fracture\" of her left wrist about 3 weeks before nursing home admission. Her son recalls t hat the fracture occurred when Ms. P. tripped on a rug and fell forward on her outstretched hands. Coding: Both J1700A and J1700C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: Ms. P. had a f all-related fracture less than 1 m onth prior to e ntry.

Planni ng for Care Identification of residents w ho are at high risk of falling is a top priority f or care planning. A pre vious fall is the m ost important predictor of risk for future falls. Falls m ay be an indicator of functional decline and developm ent of other serious conditions such as delirium , adverse drug reactions, dehydration, and infections. External risk factors in clude m edication side e ffects, use of applianc es and restraints, and environm ental conditions. A fall should sti mulate evaluation of the resident's need for rehabilitation, a mbulation aids, m odification of the physical environm ent, or additional monitoring (e.g., toileting, to avoid incontinence). Steps for Assessment 1. If this is the first assessme nt/entry or reentry (A0310E = 1), review the m edical record for the time period from the ad mission date to the ARD. 2. If this is n ot the f irst assessment/entry or reentry (A0310E = 0) , the review period is from the day after the ARD of the last MDS assessm ent to the ARD of the current assess ment. 3. Review all available so urces for any fall sin ce the last assessm ent, no m atter wheth er it occur red while o ut in the commu nity, in an ac ute hospit al, or in t he nursing hom e. Include medical records generated in any health care setting since last assess ment. 4. Review nursing hom e incident reports, fall logs and the m edical record (physician, nursing, therapy, and nursing assistant notes). 5. Ask the resident and fa mily about falls during the look- back period. Resident and fa mily reports of falls should be captured here whethe r or not these incidents are docum ented in the medical record. Coding Instructions Code 0, no: if the resident has not had any fall since the l ast asse ssment. Skip to Swallowing Disorder item (K0100 ) if the assessment being completed is an OBRA assessment.

Planni ng for Care Identification of residents who are at high risk of falling is a top priority f or care planning. Falls indicate functional de cline and other serious conditions such as deliriu m, adverse drug reactions, dehydration, and infections. External ris k factors include medication side effects, use of appliances and restraints, and environm ental conditions. A fall should sti mulate evaluation of the resident's need for rehabilitation or a mbulation aids and of the need for monitoring or modification of the physical environm ent. It is important to ensure the accuracy of the level of injury resulting from a fall. Since injuries can present themselves later than the time of the fall, the assessor may need to look beyond the ARD to obtain the accurate informati on for the complete picture of the fall that occurs in the look back of the MDS . DEFINITION INJURY RELATED TO A FALL Any documented injury that occurred as a result of, or was recognized within a short period of time (e.g., hours to a few days) after the fall and attributed to the fall. DEFINITIONS INJURY (EXCEPT MAJOR) Includes skin tears, abrasions, lacerations, superficial bruises, hematomas, and sprains; or any fall -related injury that causes the resident to complain of pain. MAJOR INJURY Includes bone fractures, joint dislocations, closed head injuries with altered consciousness, subdur al hematoma. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 33 J1900: Number of Falls Since Adm ission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. If this is the first assessment (A0310E = 1), review the m edical record for the ti me period from the ad mission date to the ARD. 2. If this is not the f irst assessment (A0310E = 0), t he review period is from the day a fter the ARD of the la st MDS assess ment to the ARD of the curre nt assessment. 3. Review all available so urces for any fall sin ce the last assessm ent, no m atter wheth er it occur red while o ut in the community, in an ac ute hospit al, or in t he nursing hom e. Include medical records generated in any health care setting since last assess ment. All relevant records re ceived f rom acute and pos t-acute f acilities where the resi dent w as ad mitted during the look- back period should be reviewed for evidence of one or m ore falls. 4. Review nursing hom e incident reports and m edical record (physician, nursing, therapy, and nursing assistant notes) for falls and level of injury. 5. Ask the resident, staff, and f amily about f alls during the look- back period. Resident and family reports of falls should be capt ured here, whether or not these incidents are docum ented in the m edical record. 6. Review any follow -up medical information received pertaining to the fall, even if this information is received after the ARD (e.g., emergency room x -ray, MRI, CT s can results), and ensure that this information is used to code the assessment . Coding Instructions for J1900 Determine the number of falls that occurred since admission/entry or reentry or prior assessment (OBRA or S cheduled P PS) and code the level of fall- related inju ry for each. Code each fall only once. If the resi dent h as m ultiple in juries in a single fall, c ode the f all for the highest level of injury. Coding Instructions for J1900A, No Injury Code 0, none: if the resident had no injurious fall since the adm ission/entry or reentry or prior assess ment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). Code 1, one: if the resident had one non- injurious fall since ad mission/entry or reentry or prior assess ment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). Code 2, two or more: if the resident had t wo or more non- injurious falls since admission/entry or reentry or prior assessm ent (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). Coding Instructions for J1900B, Injury (Except Major) Code 0, none: if the resident had no injur ious f all (ex cept m ajor) since ad mission/entry or reentry or prior assess ment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). Code 1, one: if the resident had one injurious f all (ex cept m ajor) since ad mission/ entry or reentry or prior assess ment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 34 J1900: Number of Falls Since Adm ission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent (cont.) Code 2, two or more: if the resident had t wo or more injurious fa lls (exce pt major) since ad mission/entry or reentry or p rior assessm ent (OBRA o r Scheduled PPS). Coding Instructions for J1900C, Major Injury Code 0, none: if the resident had no m ajor injur ious fall since ad mission/entry or reentry or prior assess ment (OBRA o r Scheduled PPS). Code 1, one: if the resident had one m ajor injurious fall since ad mission/entry or reentry or prior assess ment (OBRA o r Scheduled PPS). Code 2, two or more: if the resident had t wo or more major inju rious f alls si nce admission/entry or reentry or prior assessm ent (OBRA or Scheduled PPS). Coding Tip If the level of injury directly related to a fall that occurred during the look- back period is identified after the ARD and is at a different injury level than what was originally coded on an assessment that was submitted to the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES ) Assessment Submission and Processing ( ASAP ) system , the assessment must be modified to update the level of injury that occurred with that fall. Examples 1. A nursing note states that Mrs. K. slipped out of her wheelchair onto the floor while at the dining room table. Before being assisted back into her chair, a range of motion assessm ent was co mpleted that indic ated no injury. A skin assessment conducted shortly after the fall also revealed no injury . Coding: J1900A would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Slipping to the floor is a fall. No injury was noted. 2. Nurse's notes describe a situation in which Ms. Z. went out with her fa mily for dinner. When they returned, her son stated t hat while at the restaurant, she f ell in the bathro om. No injury was noted when she returned from dinner. Coding: J1900A would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Falls during the nursing hom e stay, e ven if on outings, are captured here. 3. A nurse's note describes a resident w ho, while being treated for pneum onia, cli mbed over his bedrails and fell to the f loor. He had a cut over his left eye and som e swelling on his arm. He was sent to the em ergency room , where X -rays revealed no injury and neurological checks revealed no chan ges in m ental status. Coding: J1900B would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Lacerations and swelli ng without fractu re are classified as injury (ex cept major). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 35 J1900: Number of Falls Since Adm ission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent (cont.) 4. A resident fell, lacerated his head, and h ead CT scan indicated a subdural he matoma. Coding: J1900C would be coded 1, one. Rationale: Subdural he matoma is a m ajor injury. T he injury occurred as a result of a fall. 5. Mr. R. fell on his right hip in the facility on the ARD of his Quarterly MDS and complained of mild right hip pain. The initial x -ray of the hip did not show any injury. The nurse completed Mr. R's Quarterly assessment and coded the assessment to reflect this information. The assessm ent was submitted to QIES AS AP. Three days later, Mr. R. compl ained of increasing pain and had difficulty ambulating, so a follow -up x-ray was done. The follow -up x-ray showed a hairline fracture of the right hip. This injury is noted by the physician to be attributed to the recent f all that occurred during the look- back period of the Quarterly assessment. Original Coding: J1900B, Injury (except major) is coded 1, one and J1900C , Major Injury is coded 0, none . Rationale: Mr. R. had a fall -related injury that caused him to complain of pain. Modification of Quarterly assessment: J1900B, Injury (except major) is coded 0, none and J1900C, Major Injury, is coded 1, one . Rationale: The extent of the injury did not pres ent itse lf right after the fall; however, it was directly related to the fall that occurred during the look- back period of the Quarterly assessment. Since the assessment had been submitted to QIES ASAP and the level of injury documented on the submitted Quarterly was now found to be different based on a repeat x -ray of the resident's hip, the Quarterly assessment needed to be modified to accurately reflect the injury sustained during that fall. J2000: Prior Surgery Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission can affect a resident's recovery. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 36 J2000: Prior Surgery (cont.) Planning for Care This item identifies whether the resident has had major surgery during the 100 days prior to the start of the Medicare Part A stay . A recent history of major surgery can affect a resident's recovery. Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident and his or her family or significant other about any surgical procedures in the 100 days prior to admission. 2. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the resident had major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care during the previous 100 da ys, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, progress notes, and other resources as available. Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the resident did not have major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Code 1, Yes: if the resident had major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Code 8, Unknown: if it is unknown or cannot be determined whether the resident had major surgery during the 100 days prior to admission. Coding Tips Generally, major surgery f or item J2000 refers to a procedure that meets the following criteria: 1. the resident was an inpatient in an acute care hospital for at least one day in the 100 days prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 2. the surgery carried some degr ee of risk to the resident's life or the potential for severe disability. Examples 1. Mrs. T reports that she required surgical removal of a skin tag from her neck a month and a half ago. She had the procedure as an outpatient. Mrs. T reports no other surger ies in the last 100 days. Coding: J2000 would be coded 0, No . Rationale: Mrs. T's skin tag removal surgery did not require an acute care inpatient stay; therefore, the skin tag removal does not meet the required criteria to be coded as major surgery. Mrs. T did not have any other surgeries in the last 100 days. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 37 J2000: Prior Surgery (cont.) 2. Mr. A's wife informs his nurse that six months ago he was admitted to the hospital for five days following a bowel resection (partial colectomy) for diverticulitis. Mr. A's wife reports Mr. A has had no other surgeries since the time of his bowel resection. Coding: J2000 would be coded 0, No . Rationale: Bowel resection is a major surgery that has some degree of risk for death or severe disability, and Mr. A required a five -day hospitalization. However, the bowel resection did not occur in the last 100 days; it happened six months ago, and Mr. A has not undergone any surgery since that time . 3. Mrs. G. was admitted to the facility for wound care related to dehiscence of a s urgical wound subsequent to a complicated cholecystectomy . The attending physician also noted diagnoses of anxiety, diabetes, and morbid obesity in her medical record. She was transferred to the facility immediately following a four-day acute care hospital stay. Coding: J2000 would be coded 1, Yes . Rationale: In the last 100 days, Mrs. G underwent a complicated cholecystectomy, which required a four -day hospitalization. She additionally had comorbid diagnoses of diabetes, morbid obesity, and anxiety contributing some additional degree of risk for death or severe disability . J2100: Recent Surgery Requiring Active SNF Care Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the inpatient stay that preceded the resident 's Part A admission can affect a resident's recovery. Planning for Care This item identifies whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. A recent history of major surgery can affect a resident's recovery. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 38 J2100: Recent Surgery Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident and his or her family or significant other about any surgical procedures that occurred during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. 2. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately precede d the resident 's Part A admission. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, progress notes, and other resources as available. Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the resident did not have major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. Code 1, Yes : if the resident had major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. Code 8, Unknown: if it is unknown or cannot be determined whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient hospital stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. Coding Tips Generally, major surgery for item J2100 refers to a procedure that meets the following criteria: 1. the resident was an inpatient in an acute care hospital for at least one day in the 30 days prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 2. the surgery carried some degree of risk to the resident's life or the potential for severe disability. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 39 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the inpatient stay that preceded the resident 's Part A admission can affect a resident's recovery. Planning for Care This item identifies whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident 's Part A admission. A recent history of major surgery can affect a resident's recovery. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 40 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Identify recent surgeries: The surgeries in this section must have been documented by a physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 30 days and must have occurred during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission. Medical record sources for recent surgeries include progress notes, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, diagnosis/problem list, and other resources as available. Although open communication regarding resident information between the physician and other members of the interdisciplinary team is important, it is also essential that resident information communicated verbally be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure follow -up. Surgery informat ion, including past history obtained from family members and close contacts, must also be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure validity and follow -up. 2. Determine whether the surgeries require active care during the SNF stay: Once a recent surgery is identified, it must be determined if the surgery requires active care during the SNF stay. Surgeries requiring active care during the SNF stay are surgeries that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF diagnosis, as coded in I0020B. Do not include conditions that have been resolved, do not affect the resident's current status, or do not drive the resident's plan of care during the 7- day look -back period, as these would be considered surgeries that do not require active care during the SNF stay . Check the following information sources in the medical record for the last 30 days to identify \"active\" surgeries: transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, recent discharge summaries, nursing assessments, nursing care plans, medication sheets, doctor's orders, consults and official diagnostic reports, and other sources as available. Coding Instructions Code surgeries that are documented to have occurred in the last 30 days, and during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission, that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF diagnosis, as coded in I0020B . Check off each surgery requiring active SNF care as defined above, as follows: \u2014 Surgeries are listed by major surgical category: Major Joint Replacement, Spinal Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurologic Surgery, Cardiopulmonary Surgery, Genitourinary Surgery, Other Major Surgery .

There may be specific documentation in the medical record by a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assis tant, or clinical nurse specialist. \u2014 The physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) may specifically indicate that the SNF stay is for treatment related to the surgical intervent ion. Specific documentation may be found in progress notes, most recent history and physical, transfer notes, hospital discharge summary, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 43 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) In the rare circumstance of the absence of specific documentation that a surgery requires active SNF care, the following indicators may be used to confirm that the surgery requires active SNF care: The inherent complexity of the services prescribed for a resident is such that they can be perfor med safely and/or effectively only by or under the general supervision of skilled nursing. For example: \u2014 The management of a surgical wound that requires skilled care (e.g., managing potential infection or drainage). \u2014 Daily skilled therapy to restore functional loss after surgical procedure s. \u2014 Administration of medication and monitoring that requires skilled nursing. Examples of surgeries requiring active SNF care and related to the primary SNF diagnosis 1. Mrs. V was hospitalized for gram -negative pneumonia. Since this was her second episode of pneumonia in the past six months, a diagnostic bronchoscopy was pe rformed while in the hospital. She also has Parkinson's dis ease and rheumatoid arthritis. She was discharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment for her pneumonia and requires daily skilled care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions, and the I0020B SNF ICD-10 code is J15.6, Pneumonia due to other aerobic Gram -negative bacteria. There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. V did not receive any major surgery during the prior inpatient stay , and she was admitted to the SNF for continued care due to pneumonia. 2. Mrs. O, a diabetic, was hospitalized for sepsis from an infection due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus that developed after outpatient bunion surgery . A central line was placed to administer antibiotics. She was discharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is A41.01 (Sepsis due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ). There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Neither the placement of a central line nor the outpatient bunion surgery is considered to be a major surger y, but the resident was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 44 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) 3. Mrs. H was hospitalized for severe back pain from a compression fracture of a lumbar vertebral body, which was caused by her age -related osteoporosis. She was treated with a kyph oplasty that relie ved her pain. She was transferred to a SNF after discharge because of her mild dementia and need to regulate her anticoagulant treatment for atrial fibrillation. Coding: I0020 is coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD-10 code is M80.08XD (Age-related osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, vertebra(e), subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing). There was no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. H was treated with a kyphoplasty during the inpatient stay prior to SNF admission. Although kyphoplasty is a minor surgery and does not require SNF care in and of itself, the resident has other conditions requiring skilled care that are unrelated to the kyphoplasty surgery. 4. Mrs. J had a craniotomy to drain a subdural hematoma after suffering a fall at home. She has COPD and uses oxygen at night. In addition, she has moderate congestive heart failure, is moderately overweight , and has hypothyroidism. After a six -day hospital stay, she was discharged to a SNF for continuing care. The hospital discharge summary indicated that the patient had a loss of consciousness of 45 minutes. Coding: I0020 is coded 07, Other Neurological Conditions. T he I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S06.5X2D (Traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes, subsequent encounter). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2600, Neuro surgery - brain, surrounding tissue or blood vessels , would be che cked. Rationale: The craniotomy surgery during the inpatient stay immediately preceding the SNF stay requires continued skilled care and skilled monitoring for wound care, as well as therapies to address any deficits that led to her fall or any functional deficits resulting from her fall. 5. Mr. D was admitted to an acute care hospital for cytoreductive surgery for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic renal cell carcinoma and post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is C 79.01 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of the right kidney and renal pelvis ). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2810, Genitourinary surgery - the kidneys, ureter, adrenals , and bladder - open, laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. D was treated with a surgical procedure, genitourinary surgery of the kidney, and admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic kidney cancer and post-surgical care . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [J] October 2019 Page J- 45 J2300 - J5000: Recent Surgeries Requiring Active SNF Care (cont.) 6. Mr. G was admitted to an acute care hospital for severe abdominal pain. He was found to have diverticulitis of the small intestine with perforation and abscess without bleeding. He had surgery to repair the perforation. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is K5 7.00 (Diverticulitis of intestine with perforation and absc ess without bleeding ), and J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2910, Major surgery - the GI tract and abdominal contents from the esophagus to the anus, the biliary tree, gall bladder, liver, pancreas, spleen - open or laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. G was treated with a surgical procedure, repair of the small intestine perforation, which is a major surgical procedure. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care. 7. Mr. W underwent surgical repair for a left fractured hip (i.e., subtrochanteric fracture) during an inpatient hospitalization. He was admitted to the SNF for post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded as Code 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S72.22XD (Displaced subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, subsequent encounter for closed fracture with routine healing) and J2100 is coded as 1, Yes. J2510, Ortho surgery - repair fractures of pelvis, hip, leg, knee, or ankle , would be checked. Rationale: This i s major surgery requiring skilled nursing care to provide wound care and to monitor for early signs of infection or blood clots , for which Mr. W was admitted to the SNF .

K0300: Weight Los s Item Rationale Health-related Quality of Life Weight loss can result in debility and adversely affect health, safety, and quality of life. For persons with morbid obesity, controlled and careful weight loss can improve mobility and health status. For persons with a large volume (fluid) overload, contr olled and careful diuresis can improve health status. Planning for Care Weight loss may be an i mportant i ndicat or of a change in the resi dent's health status or environm ent. If signi ficant weight loss is noted, the int erdisciplinary team should re view f or possible causes of changed intake, changed c aloric need, change in m edica tion (e.g., diur etics), or changed f luid volum e status. Weight should be m onitor ed on a contin uing basis; weight loss sho uld be asses sed and care planned a t the time of detec tion and not dela yed until the next MDS assessm ent.

The resulting figure represents a 5% loss from the weight 30 days ago. If the resident's current weight is equal to or less than the resulting figure, the resident has lost more than 5% body weight. 10% WEIGHT LOSS IN 180 DAYS Start with the resident's weight closest to 180 days ago and multiply it by .90 (or 90%). The resulting figure represents a 10% loss from the weight 180 days ago. If the resident's current weight is equal to or less than the resulting figure, the resident has lost 10% or more body weight.

If the res ident is losing a signi ficant amount of w eight, the f acility sho uld not wait f or the 30- or 180- day ti meframe to add ress the proble m. Weight changes of 5% i n 1 m onth, 7.5% in 3 m onths, or 10% in 6 m onths should prom pt a thorough a ssessm ent of the resident's nutr itional status. To code K0300 as 1, ye s, the exp ressed goal of the weight loss diet or t he expected weight loss of edem a through t he use of diuretics must be docum ented. On occasio n, a resi dent with nor mal BMI or even low BMI is placed on a diabe tic or otherwise calorie-restricted diet. In this in stance, the inte nt of the diet is not to induce weight loss, and it would not be consi dered a phy sician-ordered weight -loss regi men. Examples 1. Mrs. J has been on a ph ysician order ed cal orie-restricted diet for the past year. She and her physic ian agreed to a plan of weight reduc tion. Her cu rrent w eight is 169 lbs. Her we ight 30 days ago was 172 lbs. Her weight 180 days ago was 192 lbs. Coding: K0300 would be coded 1, yes, on physician- prescribed weight - loss regimen . Rationale : 30-day c alculation: 172 x 0.95 = 163.4. Since the resident's current w eight of 169 lbs is more than 163.4 l bs, which is t he 5% poi nt, she has not lost 5% bod y weight in the last 30 days. 180-day c alculat ion: 192 x .90 = 172.8. Since t he resi dent's curre nt wei ght of 169 lbs is less than 172.8 lbs, which is the 10% point, she has lost 10% or m ore of body weight in t he las t 180 da ys.

Mr. K. has been able to take some fluids orally ; however, due to his progressing multiple sclerosis, his dysphagia is not allowing him to remain hydrated enough. Therefore, he received the following fluid amounts over the last 7 days via supplemental tube feedings while in the hospital and after he was admitted to the nursing home. While in the Hospital While in the Nursing Home Mon. 400 cc Fri. 510 cc Tues. 520 cc Sat. Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [K] October 2019 Page K -17 Intake by Artifi cial Route (cont.) Coding: K0710B2 would be coded 2, 501 cc/day or more, and K0710B3 would be coded 1, 500 cc/day or less. Rationale: The total fluid intake within the last 7 days while Mr. K. was a resident of the nursing home was 1,520 cc (510 cc + 520 cc + 490 cc = 1,520 cc). Average fluid intake while a resident totaled 507 cc (1,520 cc divided by 3 days). 507 cc is greater than 500 cc, therefore code 2, 501 cc/day or more is correct for K0710B2, While a Resident . The total fluid intake during the entire 7 days (includes fluid intake while Mr. K. was in the hospital AND while Mr. K. was a resident of the nursing home) was 3,420 cc (1,900 cc + 1,520 cc). Average fluid intake during the entire 7 days was 489 cc (3,420 cc divided by 7 days). 489 cc is less than 500 cc, therefore code 1, 500 cc/day or less is correct for K0710B3, During Entire 7 Days .

DEFINITIONS CAVITY A tooth with a discolored hole or area of decay that may have debris in it. BROKEN NATURAL TEETH OR TOOTH FRAGMENT Very large cavity, tooth broken off or decayed to gum line, or broken teeth (from a fall or trauma). ORAL LESIONS A discolored area of tissue (red, white, yellow, or darkened) on the lips, gums, tongue, palate, cheek lining, or throat. EDENTULOUS Having no natural permanent teeth in the mouth. Complete tooth loss. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [L] October 2019 Page L-2 L0200: Denta l (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Ask the resident about the presence of chewing proble ms or mouth or facial pain/discom fort. 2. Ask the resident, fa mily, or significant other whether the resident has or recently had denture s or partials . (If resident or family/significant othe r report s that the resident recently had dentures or partials, but they do not have them at the facility, a sk for a reason.) 3. If the resident has dentures or partials, exam ine for loose fit. Ask him or her to remove, and exa mine for chips, cracks, and clean liness. Removal of dentures and/or partials is necessary for adequate assessm ent. 4. Conduct exam of the resident's lips and oral cavity with dentures or partials re moved, if applicable. Use a lig ht source t hat is adequate to visualize the back of the mouth. Visually observe and feel all oral surfaces including lips, g ums, tongue, palate, m outh f loor, a nd cheek lining. Check for abnor mal mouth tissue, abnor mal teeth, or infla med or bleeding gum s. The assessor should use his or her gloved fingers to adequat ely feel for masses or loose teeth. 5. If the resident is unable to self-report, then observe him or her while eating with dentures or partials, if indicated, to deter mine if chewing proble ms or m outh pain are present. 6. Oral exam ination of residents who are uncoope rative and do not allow for a thorough oral exam may result in m edical conditions being m issed. Referral for dental evaluation should be considered for these residents and any resid ent who exhibits dental or oral issues. Coding Instructions Check L0200A, broken or loosely fitting full or partia l denture: if the denture or partial is chipped, crac ked, uncleanab le, or loose. A denture is coded as loose if the resident complains that it is loose, the denture visibly moves when the resident opens his or her m outh, or the denture m oves when the re sident tries to ta lk. Check L0200B, no natural teeth or tooth fragment(s) (edentul ous): if the resident is edentulous /lacks a ll natural teeth or parts of teeth. Check L0200C, abnormal mout h tissue (ulcers, masses , oral lesions): select if any ulcer, mass, or oral lesion is noted o n any oral s urface. Chec k L0200D, obvious or likely cavity or broken natural teeth: if any cavit y or broke n tooth is seen. Check L0200E, inflamed or bleeding gums or loose natural teeth: if gums appear irritated, red, sw ollen, or bleeding. Teeth are coded as loose if they readily move when light pressure is applied with a fingertip. Check L0200F, mouth or facial pain or disco mfort with chewing : if the resident reports any pain in the m outh or face, or disco mfort with chewing. Check L0200G, unable to examine: if the resident's mouth cannot be exam ined. Check L0200Z, none of the above: if none of conditions A through F is present. DEFINITION S ORAL MASS A swollen or raised lump, bump, or nodule on any oral surface. May be hard or soft, and with or without pain. ULCER Mouth sore, blister or eroded area of tissue on any oral surface. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [L] October 2019 Page L-3 L0200: Denta l (cont.) Coding Tips Mouth or facial pain coded for this item should also be coded in Section J, items J0100 through J0850, in any items in which the coding requirements of Section J are met. The dental status for a resident who has some, but not all, of his/her natural teeth that do not appear damaged (e.g., are not broken, loose, with obvious or likely cavity) and who does not have any other conditions in L0200A -G, should be coded in L0200Z, none of the above. Many residents have dentures or partials that fit well and work properly. However, for individualized care planning purposes, consideration should be taken for these residents to make sure that they are in possession of their dentures or partials and that they are being utilized properly for meals, snacks, medication pass, and social activities. Additionally, the dentures or partials should be properly cared for with regular cleaning and by assuring that they continue to fit properly throughout the resident's stay.

This s ection a lso not es other skin ulcers, wo unds, or le sions, and documents so me treat ment c ategories rel ated to skin inj ury or avoi ding i njury. It is importa nt to recognize and evalu ate each r esident's r isk factors and to i denti fy and e valua te all areas a t risk of constant pressur e. A co mplete assessm ent of skin is e ssential to an e ffecti ve pressure ul cer prevention and skin t reatment progra m. Be cert ain to include in the assess ment proce ss, a holis tic approach. It is im perative t o deter mine the et iology of all wounds and le sions, as this w ill deter mine a nd dire ct the prope r treatment and m anag ement of the wound. CMS is aware of the array of terms used to describe alterations in skin integrity due to pressure. Some of these terms include: pressure ulcer, pressure injury, pressure sore, decubitus ulcer, and bed sore. Acknowledging that clinicians may use and documentation may reflect any of these terms, it is acceptable to code pressure- related skin conditions in Section M if different terminology is recorded in the clinical record, as long as the primary cause of the skin alteration is related to pressure. For example, if the medical record reflects the presence of a Stage 2 pressure injury, it should be coded on the MDS as a Stage 2 pressure ulcer. M0100: Determination of Pr essur e Ulcer/Injury Risk Item Rationale Health-related Quality of Life Pressure ul cers/injuries occur when tiss ue is com pressed between a b ony pro minence and an exter nal surface. In ad dition to pr essure, she ar force, and friction are i mportant contributor s to press ure u lcer/injury develo pment. The underl ying hea lth of a resi dent's soft tissue affects how much press ure, shear force, or friction is needed to da mage tissue. Skin and s oft tissue changes asso ciated with aging, illness, sm all blood ves sel a nd m alnutr ition in . Additiona extern al factors, such as excess m oisture, microclimate, and t issue exposure to urine or f eces, can i ncrea se risk. Planning for Care The care pl anning proc ess should i nclude efforts to sta bilize, reduce, or rem ove underl ying risk factor s; to monitor t he impact of the int erventions; and to modify the interventions as appro priate bas ed on the in divid ualized needs of the resi dent. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -2 M0100: Determination of Pr essur e Ulcer/Injury Risk (cont.) Throughout this s ection, terminology re ferring to \"healed \" versus \"unheale d\" ulcers refers to whether or not the ulcer is \"closed \" versus \"open.\" When considering this, recognize th at Stage 1, Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), a nd unstagea ble press ure u lcers a lthou gh \"closed\" (i .e., may be c overed with tissue, esch ar, slough, e tc.) would not be conside red \"healed .\" Facilities should be aw are that the resident is at higher risk of having the area of a closed pressu re ulcer open up due to da mage, inj ury, or pressu re, because of the loss of tensile stren gth of the overl ying tissue. T ensile strength of the skin overl ying a c losed press ure ulcer is 80% of normal skin ten sile strength. Fa cilities should put preve ntative m easur es in pla ce that will m itigate the opening of a closed ulcer d ue to the f ragility of the overl ying tissue. Step s for Asses smen t 1. Review the medical rec ord, inc luding skin ca re flow sheets or other skin tracking f orms, nurses' no tes, and pressu re ulcer/injury risk ass essments. 2. Speak with the treatment nurse and dire ct care staff on all shifts to conf irm conclusions f rom the medical r ecord review and observa tions of the resident. 3. Examine the reside nt and determine whether any ulcers, injuries, scars, or no n-removable dressing s/devices a re present. Assess key a reas f or assess bony prominences (e.g., elbows and ankles) and skin th at is under br aces or subje cted to pressur e (e.g., ears f rom oxygen tubi ng).

Ex amples of non-removable dressing s/devices include a pri mary surgic al dressing, a ca st, or a br ace. DEFINITION HEALED PRESSURE ULCER Completely closed, fully epithelialized, covered completely with epithelial tissue, or resurfaced with new skin, even if the area continues to have some surface discoloration. DEFINITIONS PRESSURE ULCER / INJURY RISK FACTOR Examples of risk factors include immobility and decreased functional ability; co-morbid conditions such as end-stage renal disease, thyroid disease, or diabetes; drugs such as steroids; impaired diffuse or localized blood flow; resident refusal of care and treatment; cognitive impairment; exposure of skin to urinary and fecal incontinence; microclimate , malnutrition, and hydration deficits; and a healed ulcer.

M0210: Unheal ed Pressure Ul Quality of Life Pressure ul cers/injuries and ot her wounds or lesions affect qual ity of life for resi dents becau se they m ay limit activity, m ay be pain ful, and m ay require time- consum ing treat ments an d dressing changes. Planning for Care The pressu re ulc er/injury definitions used i n the RAI Manual have been a dapted f rom those r ecommended by the National P ressure Ulc er Advisory P anel (NPUAP ) 2016 Pres sure Injury Staging System. An existing pressu re ulcer/injury identifies residen ts at risk for further co mplica tions or s kin injury. R isk factors des cribed in M0100 should be addressed. For MDS assessm ent, init ial nu merical staging of pressu re ulcers and t he initial numerical staging of ulcers af ter debride ment, or DTI that declares itself, should be coded in t erms of what is asses sed (seen or p alpated, i.e. vis ible tissue, palpab le bone ) during t he look-back p eriod. Nursing hom es may adopt the NPUAP guid elines in th eir clinical pra ctice and nur sing docum entation. However, sinc e CMS has adapted t he NPUAP guidelin es for MDS purposes, the de finitions do not perfectly correlate with each stage as de scribed by N PUAP. The refore, you must code the MDS a ccording to the ins tructions in thi s manual. DEFINITION PRESSURE ULCER /INJURY A pressure ulcer /injury is localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue , usually over a bony prominence, as a result of intense and/or prolonged pressure or pressure in combination with shear. The pressure ulcer/injury can present as intact skin or an open ulcer and may be painful. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] (cont.) Pressure ul cer/injury staging i s an assess ment system that provides a descri ption and classification based on visual appearance and/or anatomic depth of soft tissue da mage. This tissue damage can be visib le or p alpable in the ulcer bed. Pressu re ulcer/injury staging also informs expectations f or healing times. The comprehensive care plan should be reevaluated to e nsure that appropriate preventative measures and pressure ulcer/injury management principles are being adhered to when new pressure ulcers/injuries develop or when existing pressure ulcers/injuries worsen. Step s for Assessment 1. Review the m edical rec ord, inc luding skin ca re flow sheets or other skin t racking f orms. 2. Speak with direct care staff and the treat ment nur se to con firm conclusi ons f rom the m edical record review. 3. Examine the resident and deter mine whether any skin ul cers/injuries are p resent. Key areas f or press ure u lcer/injury development include the s acrum, coccyx, t rochant ers, ischial tuberos areas, such as deformities, skin under braces, and s kin subje cted to excess p ressure, she ar, or friction, are also at risk for pressure ulcers /injuries . Without a fu ll body s kin assessm ent, a press ure u lcer/injury can be m issed. Examine the resident in a well -lit room. Adequa te lighting is important f or det ecting skin changes. For any press ure ulce rs/injuries identified, m easure and record the d eepest anatomical stage. 4. Identify any known or li kely uns tageable pres sure ulcers /injuries . Coding Instructions Code based the pres ence of any pressure ulc er/injury (regardle ss of stage) in the past 7 days. Code 0, no: if the res ident did not have a pr essure ul cer/injury in the 7-day lo ok-back M1030, Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers . Code 1, yes: if the r esident had a ny pressu re ulcer /injury (Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, or unstagea ble) in the 7 -day look-back p eriod. Proceed to M0300, Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers /Injuries at Each Stage. Coding Tips If an ulc er/injury arises from a combination of factors that are primarily caused by pressure, then the area should be included in this section as a pressure ulcer /injury . Oral Muco sal ulcers caused by pres sure should not be coded in Sect ion M. These u lcers are captured in item L0200C, Abnor mal mouth tissue . Mucosal pressure u lcers are not s taged using the s kin pressu re ulcer staging s ystem because anato mical t issue c omparisons cannot be made. Therefore, mucosal ulcers (for example, those related to nasogastric tubes, nasal oxygen tubing, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, etc.) should not be coded here. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M Ulcers (cont.) If a pressu re ulcer is su rgical ly closed with a f lap or gra ft, it should be c oded as a su rgical wound and not as a pr essure ul cer. If the f lap or graft fails, c ontinue to code it a s a surgic al wound until he aled. Residents w ith diabetes mellitus ( DM) can have a press ure, venous, ar terial, or di abetic neuropat hic ulcer. The pri mary etio logy should be conside red when coding whether a resident with DM has an ulc er/injury that is caused b y pressu re or other factors. If a resi dent with DM has a heel ulcer/injury from pressure and t he ulcer /injury is present in the 7 -day look- back period, code 1 and proce ed to code items in M0300 as a ppropri ate for the pressu re ulcer/injury . If a resi dent with DM has an ulc er on the plantar (bottom) sur face of the f oot clos er to the metatarsals a nd the ul cer is pre sent in the 7 -day look-back pe riod, code 0 and proceed to M1040 to c ode the u lcer as a dia betic foot ulcer. It is not likely that pressure is the primary cause of the resident's ulcer when the ulcer is in this location. Scabs and e schar a re different b oth physic ally and chemical ly. Eschar is a col lection of dead t issue within t he wound that is flush with t he sur face of the wound. A scab is m ade up of dried blood ce lls and serum, sits on the top of the skin, and f orms over exposed wounds such as wounds with gran ulating s urfaces (like p ressure etc.). A scab is eviden ce of wound healing. A pres sure ul cer that was staged as a 2 and now has a scab indicates it is a heal ing st age 2, and th erefore, s taging should n ot change. Es char ch aracte ristics and t he lev el of damage it causes to tissues is what makes it easy to d istinguish f rom a scab. It is ex tremely important t o have sta ff who are t rained in wound assessment and who are a ble to distinguish scabs from eschar. If two pressure ulcers/injuries occur on the same bony prominence and are separated, at least superficially, by skin, then count them as two separate pressure ulcers/injuries. Stage and measure each pressure ulcer/injury separately. If a resident had a pressu re ulcer /injury that healed during t he look-back p eriod of the current assessment, do not code the ulcer/injury on the assessment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -7 Current Number of Unheal ed Pr essure U lcers/Injuries at Each Stage Steps f or completing M 0300A -G Step 1: Determi ne Deepest Anatomical Stag e For each pr essure u lcer, determine t he deepes t anatomical st age. Do not reverse or back stage. Consider c urrent and hi storic al levels of tissue involvement. 1. Observe and palpa te the base of any i denti fied pr essure u lcers present to de termine the anato mic depth of soft tissue da mage involved. 2. Ulcer s taging should be based on the ulcer 's deepest an atomic soft tissue da mage that i s visib le or p alpable. If a pressu re ulcer's tissues a re obscu red such tha t the depth of soft tissue damage cannot be obse rved, it is co nsidered to be unstagea ble (see Step 2 below). Review the history of each pres sure ul cer in the m edical r ecord. If the pressu re ulcer has ever been classified at a higher n umerical sta ge than what is obser ved now, it should con tinue t o be classified at the highe r num erical stage. Nursing homes that c arefully doc ument and t rack pressu re ulcers wi ll be a ble to m ore accur ately code this item . 3. Pressure ulcers do not heal in a reverse sequence, that is, the body does not replace the types and la yers of tissue (e.g., muscle, fat, and dermis) that were lost during pressure ulcer development before they re -epithelialize. Stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers fill with granulation tissue. This replacement tissue is never as strong as the tissue that was lost and hence is more prone to future breakdown. 4. Clinical standards do not support reverse staging or backstaging as a way to document healing, as it does not accurately characterize what is occurring physiologically as the ulcer heals. For example, over time , even though a Stage 4 pressure ulcer has been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the tissues that were lost (muscle, fat, dermis) will never be replaced with the same type of tissue. Previous standards using reverse stagin g or backstaging would have permitted identification of such a pressure ulcer as a Stage 3, then a Stage 2, and so on, when it reached a depth consistent with these stages. Clinical standards now would require that this ulcer continue to be documented as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer until it has completely healed. Nursing homes can document the healing of pressure ulcers using descriptive characteristics of the wound (i.e., depth, width, presence or absence of granulation tissue, etc.) or by using a validated pressure ulcer healing tool. Once a pressure ulcer has healed, it is documented as a healed pressure ulcer at its highest numerical stage\u2014in this example, a healed Stage 4 pressure ulcer. For care planning purposes, this healed Stage 4 pressure ulcer would remain at increased risk for future breakdown or injury and would require continued monitoring and preventative care. DEFINITIONS EPITHELIAL TISSUE New skin that is light pink and shiny (even in persons with darkly pigmented skin). In Stage 2 pressure ulcers, epithelial tissue is seen in the center and at the edges of the ulcer. In full thickness Stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers, epithelial tissue advances from the edges of the wound.

Step 2: Identify Unstageable Pressure Ulcers 1. Visual ization of the wound bed is ne cessary f or accurate staging. 2. If, after careful cleansing of the pressure ulcer/injury, a pressure ulcer's/injury's anatomical tissues remain obscured such that the extent of soft tissue damage cannot be observed or palpated, the pressure ulcer/injury is considered unstageable. 3. Pressure ul cers that have eschar (tan, black, or br own) or sloug h (ye llow, t an, gray, gr een or brown) ti ssue present s uch that the a natomic depth of soft tissue da mage cannot be vi sualized or palpa ted in the wound bed, should be . 4. If the wound bed is only partially covered by esc har or s lough, and the an atomical dep th of tissue da mage can be v palpat ed, num erically s tage the ulcer and do not code th is as unstag eable. 5. A pressure injury with intact skin th at is a deep t issue inj ury ( DTI) should not be coded as a Stage 1 p ressure injury . It should be c oded as cers/injuries covered by a non- removable dre ssing/device (e.g., primary surgical dressing, cast) should be coded as uns tageable. \"Known\" refers to when documentation is available that says a pressure ulcer/injury exists under the non- removable dressing/device. Step 3: Determine \"Present on Admission\" For each pressure u lcer/injury , determine if the press ure ulcer /injury was present at the time of a dmission/e ntry or reentry and not acquired w hile the res ident was in t he care of the nursing home. Consider curre nt and histor ical levels of tissue invol vement. 1. Review the medical record for the history of the ulcer /injury . 2. Review f or location and stage a t the time of admission/e ntry or ree ntry. 3. If the pres sure ulcer/injury was present on adm ission/ent ry or re entry and s ubsequent ly increas ed in num erical stage during t he residen t's stay, the pre ssure ulce r is c oded at t hat higher s tage, and that hi gher stage shou ld not be considered as \"present on admission .\" 4. If the pres sure ulcer/injury was present on adm ission/en try or re entry and becomes unstageable due to slough or eschar, during t he residen t's stay, the pre ssure ulce r/injury is coded at M0300F and shou ld not be coded as \"present on admission .\" 5. If the press ure ul cer/injury was unstageable on admission/en try or re entry, then becomes numerically stagea ble later, it should be consid ered as \"pre sent on ad mission\" at t he stage at which it first beco mes numerically s tageable . If it subsequentl y incr eases in num erical stage, that hi gher stage shou ld not be coded as \"present on admission.\" DEFINITION ON ADMISSION As close to the actual time of admission as possible.

If a resi dent who has a pr essure ulc er/injury that was originally acquired in the facility is hospi talized and r eturns with th at pressu re ulcer/injury at the sam e numerical stage, the pressure ul cer/injury should not be coded as \"present on admission\" because it w as present and acquired a t the f acility prior to the hospit alization. 7. If a resident who has a pressure ulcer /injury that was \"present on admission\" (not acquired in the facility) is hospitalized and returns with that pressure ulcer /injury at the same numerical stage, the pressure ulcer is still coded as \"present on admission\" because it was originally acquired outside the facility and has not changed in stage. 8. If a resident who has a pressu re ulcer/injury is hospitalized and the ulcer /injury increases in numerical stage or becomes unstageable due to sl ough or eschar during the hospi talization, it should be coded as \"pres ent on admi ssion\" upon reentry. 9. If a pressure ulcer was numerically staged, then became unstageable, and is subsequently debrided sufficiently to be numerically staged, compare its numer ical stage before and after it was unstageable. If the numerical stage has increased, code this pressure ulcer as not present on admission. 10. If two pres sure ul cers m erge, that were both \"present on admission,\" continue to code the merged pressure ulcer as \"present on admission.\" Although two m erged pressu re ulcers might increas e the overa ll surface area of the ulcer, there needs to be an i ncrease in nu merical stage or a change to unstageable due to slough or eschar i n order f or it to be cons idered not \"pres ent on admission.\" CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -10 M0300: Current Number of Unheal ed Pr essure U lcers/Injuries at Each Stage ( cont.)

This is a facility acquired pressure ulcer and was not \"present on admission.\" Ms. K is hospitalized and returns to the facility with the same stage 2 pressure ulcer. This pressure ulcer was originally acquired in the nursing home and should not be considered as \"present on admission\" when she returns from the hospital. 2. Mr. J is a new admission to the facility and is admitted with a stage 2 pressure ulcer. This pressure ulcer is considered as \" present on admission\" as it was not acquired in the facility . Mr. J is hospitali zed and returns with the same stage 2 pressure ulcer, unchanged from the prior admission/entry. This pressure ulcer is still considered \"present on admission\" because it was originally acquired outside the facility and has not changed.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -16 M0300C: Stage 3 Pressure Ulcers (cont.) Examples 1. A pressure ulcer descr ibed as a Stage 2 was noted and docum ented in the r eside nt's m edical record on a dmission. On a later assessment, the wound is not ed to be a f ull thickne ss ulcer without ex posed bone, t endon, or m uscle, thus i t is now a St age 3 press ure ulce r. Coding: The cur rent S tage 3 press ure ul cer would be coded at M0300C 1 as 1, and at M0300C 2 as 0, not present on admission/ entry or reentry. Rationale: The desig nation of \"present on adm ission\" r equires th at the pressu re ulcer be at t he same location and not have inc reased in num erical stage or become unstageable or eschar . This pressu re ulcer worsened from Stage 2 to Stage 3 after ad mission. M0300C1 is coded as 1 and M0300C2 is coded as 0 on the current assessment because the ulcer was not a Stage 3 pressure ulcer on admission. 2. A resident develops a St age 2 press ure ul cer whi le at t he nur sing facility. The resi dent is hospit alized due to pne umonia f or 8 days and r eturns with a Stage 3 pres sure ul cer in the same locati on. Coding: The pressure ulcer would be coded at M0300 C1 as 1, and at M0300 C2 as 1, on admission/ entry or reentry . Rationale: Even thoug h the re sident had a p ressure ul cer in the sam e anato mical locat ion pr ior to transfer, because the pressu re ulcer increased in num erical stage to St age 3 during hos pitalization, it should be coded as Stage 3, pr esent on adm ission/e ntry or reentry. 3. On a dmission, the re sident has t hree s mall Stage 2 pressu re ulcers on her coccyx. Two weeks later, the coccyx is assessed. Two of the Stage 2 pressur e ulcers have m erged and the t hird has in creased in num erical stage to a S tage 3 press ure ul cer. Coding: The two m erged press ure ulcers wou ld be coded at M0300B1 as 1, and at M0300B2 as 1, present on admission/entry or reentry . The Stage 3 pressure ulcer would be coded at M0300C1 as 1, and at M0300C2 as 0, not present on admission/entry or reentry . Rationale: Two of the pressu re ulcers on the coccyx have m erged, but have rem ained at the same stage as they were at the time of admission ; therefore , M0300B1 and M0300B2 would be coded as 1 ; the pressure ulcer that increased in num erical stage to a Stage 3 is coded in M0300C1 as 1 and in M0300C2 as 0 , not present on ad mission/ entry or ree ntry si nce the S tage 3 ulc er was not pre sent on admission/en try or re entry and developed a deeper level of tissue damage in the time since admission . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -17 M0300C: Stage 3 Pressure Ulcers (cont.) 4. A resident developed two Stage 2 p ressure ulc ers during he r stay; o ne on the coccyx and the other on the left lateral malleolus. At some point she is hospi talized and r eturns with t wo pressu re ulcers. One is the previous Stage 2 on t he coccyx, which has not change d; the othe r is a new St age 3 on the l eft trocha nter. The Stage 2 previous ly on the le ft lateral malleolus has heal ed. Coding: The Stage 2 pressu re ulcer would be coded at M0300B1 as 1, and at M0300B2 as 0, not present on admission/entry or reentry ; the Stage 3 pressure ul cer would be coded at M0300C1 as 1, and at M0300C2 as 1, present on admission/entry or reentry . Rationale: The Stage 2 pressu re ulcer on coccyx was p resent p rior to hospit alization; the Stage 3 pressu re ulcer dev eloped during hos pitalization and is coded in M0300C2 as present on a dmission/e ntry or r eentry. The Stage 2 pressur e ulcer on t he left late ral m alleolus h as healed and is th erefore no longer c oded here. 5. A resident is admitted to a nursing facility with a short leg cast to the right lower extremity. He has no visible wounds on admission but arrives with documentation that a pressure ulcer exists under the cast. Two weeks after admission to the nursing facilit y, the cast is removed by the physician. Following the removal of the cast, the right heel is observed and assessed as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer, which remains until the subsequent assessment. Coding : Code M0300C1 as 1, and M0300C2 as 1, present on admissio n/entry or reentry. Rationale : The resident was admitted with a documented unstageable pressure ulcer/injury due to non- removable dressing/device. The cast was removed , and a S tage 3 pressure ulcer was assessed. Because this is the first time the ulcer has been numerically staged, this stage will be coded as present on admission/entry or reentry. 6. Mrs. P was admitted to the nursing facility with a blood -filled blister on the right heel. After further assessment of the surrounding tissues, it is determined that the heel blister is a DTI. Three weeks after admission, the right -heel blister is drained and conservatively debrided at the bedside. After debridement, the right heel is staged as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. On the subsequent assessment, the right heel r emains at Stage 3. Coding : Code M0300C1 as 1, and M0300C2 as 1, present on admission/entry or reentry. Rationale : This resident was admitted with an unstageable DTI that subsequently was debrided and could be numerically staged. The first numerical stage was 3 , and it remained a S tage 3 for the subsequent assessment ; therefore it is coded as present on admission/entry or reentry. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -18 M0300C: Stage 3 Pressure Ulcers (cont.) 7. Mr. H was admitted with a known pres sure ulcer/injury due to a non- removable dressing. Ten days after admission , the surgeon remove d the dressing , and a Stage 2 pressure ulcer was identified. Two weeks later the pressure ulcer is determined to be a full thickness ulcer and is at that point Stage 3. It remain ed Stage 3 at the time of the next assessment. Coding: Code M0300C1 as 1, and M0300C2 as 0, not present on admission/entry reentry. Rationale: This resident was admitted with an unstageable pressure ulcer due to non- removable dressing or device. The dressing was removed to reveal a S tage 2 pressure ulcer , and this is the first numerical stage. Subsequent to this first stage , the ulcer worsen ed to Stage 3 and therefore is not coded as present on admission/entry or reentry .

M0300F2 Enter the number of these unstageable pressure ulcers related to slough and/or eschar that were first noted at the time of admission/entry AND \u2014for residents who are reentering the facility after a hospital stay that were acquired during the hospitalization (i.e., the unstageable pressure ulcer related to slough and/or eschar was not acquired in the nursing facility prior to admission to the hospital). Enter 0 if no unstage able pres sure ulcers related to slough and/or e schar were first noted at the time of admission /entry or reentry. Coding Tips Pressure ul cers th at are covered with slough and/ or eschar , and the wound bed cannot be visualized, should be coded a s unstagea ble because t he true anato mic depth of soft tissue da mage (and there fore stage) cann ot be det ermined. Only until enough slough and/or e schar is removed to expos e the an atomic depth of soft tissue da mage involved, can the s tage of the wound be det ermined. Stable e schar (i.e., dry, a dherent, int act witho ut erythema or f luctuanc e) on the he s na tural ( biolo gical) fter caref ul clinical con sideration, inclu ding ru ling isc hemia, and consul tation with the resident's physic ian, or nurse pr actitioner, sician as sistant, or c linical nurse spe cialist if allowable under st ate licensu re law s. Once the pr essure u lcer is debrided of slough and/or esc har s uch that the a natomic depth of soft tissue damage involved can be deter mined, then code the ulc er for the r eclassified stage. The pressu re ulcer does not ha ve to be c ompletely d ebrided or fre e of all slo ugh and/or e schar tissue in or der for reclassification of stage to o ccur. DEFINITION FLUCTUANCE Used to describe the texture of wound tissue indicative of underlying unexposed fluid. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -23 M0300F : Uns tageable Pr essure Ulcers Related to Sl ough and /or Eschar ( cont.) Examples 1. A resident is admitted with a sa cral pressu re ulcer that is 100% cove red with black eschar. Coding: The press ure ulcer would be coded at M0300F 1 as 1, and at M0300F2 as 1, present on admission/ entry or reentry . Rationale: The press ure ulce r dep th is not obs ervable because the p ressure ul cer is covered w ith eschar. T his pre ssure ulcer is uns tageable and was present on ad mission. 2. A pressure ulcer on the s acrum was present on admission and was 100% c overed with black eschar. On the ad mission assessm ent, it was coded as unstag eable and pr esent on a dmission. The pressu re ulce r is later deb rided using cons ervative m ethods and a fter 4 weeks t he ulce r has 50% to 75% esch ar present. T he assessor c an now see t hat the da mage extends d own to the bone. Coding: The ulc er is reclas sified a s a Stage 4 pressu re ulcer. On the subsequent MDS, it is coded at M0300D 1 as 1, and at M0300 D2 as 1, present on admission /entry or reentry. Rationale: After debr idement, is no long er unsta geable because bone is visible in the wound bed. There fore, t his ul cer can be cl assified as a S tage 4 press ure ulcer and s hould be code d at M0300D. 3. Miss J. was ad mitted wit h one s mall Stage 2 pres sure ul cer. Despite treatment, it is not improving. In fact, it n ow appears deeper than origi nally o bserved, and t he wound bed is covered w ith slough. Coding: Code M0300F1 as 1, and M0300F 2 as 0, not present on admission /entry or reentry. Rationale: The press ure ulce r dep th is not obs ervable because it is cov ered with slough. This pressu re ulcer is un stageable and is not coded in M0300F2 as present on admission/ entry or reentry becau se it can no longer be coded as a Stage 2. 4. Mr. M. was admitted to the nursing facility with eschar tissue covering both the right and left heels, as well as a Stage 2 pressure ulcer on the cocc yx. Mr. M's pressure ulcers were reassessed before the subsequent assessment, and the Stage 2 coccyx pressure ulcer had healed. The left -heel eschar bec ame fluctuant, show ed signs of infection, ha d to be debrided at the bedside, and was subsequently numeri cally staged as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. The right -heel eschar remain ed stable and dry (i.e., remained unstageable). Coding : Code M0300D1 as 1, and M0300D2 as 1, present on admission/entry or reentry . Code M0300F1 as 1, and M0300F2 as 1, present on admission/entry or reentry. Rationale: Mr. M was admitted with an unstageable pressure injur y due to slough/eschar on each heel. One of the heels was subsequently debrided, and the first numerical stage was S tage 4 ; thus this is coded as present on admissi on/entry or reentry. The other heel eschar remained unstageable, and is coded as present on admission/entry or reentry.

For the pur poses of coding, deter mine that the l esion being as sessed i s primarily a res ult of pressu re and that other c onditions have been r uled out. If pressure is n ot the pri mary cause, do not code here. 3. Examine the area adjace nt to, or s urrounding, an inta ct blister for evidenc e of tissue da mage. If the t issue adjacent to, or surroundi ng, the bl ister does not show signs of tissue d amage (e.g., col or change, tende rness, bogg iness or f irmness, war mth or coolne ss), do not c ode as a deep tiss ue injury. 4. In dark -skinned indi viduals, t he ar ea of injury is probably not purpl e/maroon, but r ather darker than t he surroundi ng tissue. 5. Deter mine the num ber o f pressure injuries t hat a re unstageable related to deep tissue injury. 6.

M1040 H Moisture Associated Skin Damag e (MASD) MASD is also re ferred and are risk factors for pressure ulcer/injury development. P rovision of optimal skin care and early iden tification and tr eatment of minor cases of MASD can help avoid prog ression and skin breakdown. MASD without skin erosion is characterized by red/bright red color (hyperpigmentation), and the surrounding skin may be white (hypopigmentation). The skin damage is usually blanchable and diffuse and has irregular edge s. Inflammation of the skin may also be present. MASD with skin erosion has superficial/partial thickness skin loss and may have hyper - or hypopigmentation; the tissue is blanchable and diffuse and has irregular edges. Inflammation of the skin may also be present. Necrosis is not found in MASD. If pressure and moisture are both present, code the skin damage as a pressure ulcer/injury in M0300.

Scenari os for Pr essure Ulcer Codi ng Exam ple M0100 -M1200 1. Mrs. P was a dmitted to the nursing hom e on 10/23/2019 f or a Medic are stay. In com pleting the PPS 5 -day assessm ent (ARD of 10/28/2019) , it was noted t hat the resident had a he ad-to- toe skin assessm ent and her skin was intact, but u pon assess ment using the Braden scal e, was found to be at risk for skin breakdown. T he reside nt was noted to ha ve a Stage 2 pres sure ulcer that was ident ified on her c occyx on 11/1/2019. Th is Stage 2 p ressure ulcer was n oted to ha ve pink ti ssue with so me epith elialization present in the wound bed. D imensions of the ulcer were len gth 01.1 c m, width 00.5 c m, and no m easurable d epth. Mrs. P does not have any a rterial or venous ulce rs, wounds, or ski n proble ms. She is re ceiving ulcer care w ith application of a dres sing appl ied to the coccy geal u lcer. M rs. P. also ha s pressu re reducing devices on b oth her bed a nd chair and has been placed on a 1\u00bd hour turning and repos itioning schedule per t issue tolerance. In order to stay closer to her family, Mrs. P was discharged to another nursing home on 11/5/2019. This was a planned discharge (A0310G = 2), and her OBRA Discharge assessment was coded at A0310F as 10, Discharge assessment - return not anticipated. 5-Day PPS: Coding: M0100 B (Formal assess ment inst rument), Check box.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [M] October 2019 Page M -40 Scenarios for Pressure Ulcer Coding (cont.) Rationale: The resi dent had a f ormal ass essment using t he Braden scal e and also had a head -to-toe skin ass essment com pleted. Pres sure was via ormal assessm ent. Upon asses sment the res ident's skin was noted to be int act, theref ore, M0210 was coded 0 . M1030 was coded 0 due to the resident not ha ving any of these condi tions. M1040 Z was checked since none of these pro blems were noted. M1200 Z was checked because no ne of these tr eatments were provi ded.

M0300 G1 (Unstagea ble - Deep t issue injury), Code 0 and skip to M1030 (Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers). Rationale: The res ident has a pressure ulcer. On the 5- day PPS assessm ent, the resident's skin was noted to be int act; however, on the Discharge assessment , it was noted that the resi dent h ad a new Stage 2 pressu re ulcer. Since the resident has had both a 5-day PPS and Discharge assessment completed, t he Discharge assessment would be coded 0 at A0310E . This is beca use the Discharge assessment is not t he first as sessment si nce the most recent admission/ entry or reent ry. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -1 SECTION N: MEDICATIONS Intent : The intent of the items in this section is to record the number of days , during the last 7 days (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days) that any type of injection, insulin , and/or select medications were received by the resident. In addition, an Antipsychotic Medication Review has been included. Including this information will assist facilities to evaluate the use and management of these medications. Each aspect of antipsych otic medication use and management has important associations with the quality of life and quality of care of residents receiving these medications. N0300: Injections Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Frequency of administration of medication via injection can be an indication of stability of a resident's health status and/or complexity of care needs. Planning for Care Monitor for adverse effects of injected medications. Although antigens and vaccines are not considered to be medication s per s e, it is important to track when they are given to monitor for localized or systemic reactions. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medication administration records for the 7- day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). 2. Review documentation from other health care locations where the resident may have received injections while a resident of the nursing home (e.g., flu vaccine in a physician's office , in the emergency room - as long as the resident was not admitted). 3. Determine if any medications were received by the resident via injection. If received, determine the number of days during the look- back period they were received. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -2 N0300: Injections (cont.) Coding Instructions Record the number of days during the 7- day look -back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days) that the resident received any type of medication, antigen, vaccine, etc., by injection. Insulin injections are counted in this item as well as in Item N0350. Count the number of days that the resident received any type of injection while a resident of the nursing home . Record the number of days that any type of injection ( e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal) was received in Item N0300. Coding Tips and Special Populations For subcutaneous pumps , code only the number of days that the resident actually required a subcutaneous inje ction to restart the pump. If an antigen or vaccination is provided on one day, and another vaccine is provided on the next day, the number of days the resident received injections would be coded as 2 days . If two i njections were administered on the same day , the number of days the resident received injections would be coded as 1 day. Examples 1. During the 7- day look- back period, Mr. T. received an influenza shot on Monday, a PPD test (for tuberculosis) on Tuesday, and a Vitamin B 12 injection on Wednesday. Coding: N0300 would be coded 3 . Rationale: The resident received injections on 3 separate days during the 7-day look- back period. 2. During the 7- day look- back period, Miss C . received both a n influenza shot and her vitamin B12 injection on Thursday. Coding: N0300 would be coded 1 . Rationale: The resident received injections on one day during the 7- day look- back period. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -3 N0350: Insulin Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Insulin is a medication used to treat diabetes mellitus (DM). Individualized meal plans should be created with the resident's input to ensure appropriate meal intake. Residents are more likely to be compliant with their DM diet if they have input related to food choices. Planning for Care Orders for insulin may have to change depending on the resident's condition (e.g., fever or other illness) and/or laboratory results. Ensure that dosage and time of injections take into account meals, activity, etc., based on individualized resident assessment. Monitor for adverse effects of insulin injections (e.g., hypoglycemia) . Monitor HbA1c and blood glucose levels to ensure appropriate amounts of insulin are being administered. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medication administration records for the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). 2. Determine if the resident received insulin injections during the look -back perio d. 3. Determine if the physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws ) changed the resident's insulin orders during the look- back period. 4. Count the number of days insulin injections were received and/or insulin orders changed . Coding Instructions for N0350A Enter in Item N0350A, the number of days during the 7- day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days) that insulin injections were received . Coding Instructions for N0350B Enter in Item N0350B, the number of days during the 7-day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days) that the physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant , or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws ) changed the resident's insulin orders. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -4 N0350: Insulin (cont.) Coding Tips and Special Populations For sliding scale orders: \u2014 A sliding scale dosage schedule that is written to cover different dosages depending on lab values does not count as an order change simply because a different dose is admini stered based on the sliding scale guidelines. \u2014 If the sliding scale order is new, discontinued, or is the first sliding scale order for the resident, these days can be counted and coded. For subcutaneous insulin pumps , code only the number of days that the resident actually required a subcutaneous injection to restart the pump. N0410: Medications Received CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -5 N0410: Medications Received (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Medications are an integral part of the care provided to residents of nursing homes. They are administered to try to achieve various outcomes, such as curing an illness, diagnosi ng a disease or condition, arresting or slowing a disease 's progress , reducing or eliminating symptoms , or prevent ing a disease or symptom. Residents taking medications in these medication categories and pharmacologic classes are at risk of side effects that can adversely affect health, safety, and quality of life. While assuring that only those medications required t o treat the resident's assessed condition are being used, it is important to assess the need to reduce these medications wherever possible and ensure that the medication is the most effective for the resident's assessed condition. As part of all medicatio n management, it is important for the interdisciplinary team to consider non-pharmacological approaches. Educating the nursing home staff and providers about non- pharmacological approaches in addition to and/or in conjunction with the use of medication may minimize the need for medications or reduce the dose and duration of those medications. DEFINITIONS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE An unpleasant symptom or event that is caused by or associated with a medication, impairment or decline in an individual's physical condition, mental, functional or psychosocial status. It may include various types of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and interactions (e.g., medication- medication, medication- food, and medication- disease). NON - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION Approaches that do not involve the use of medication to address a medical condition. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -6 N0410: Medications Received (cont.) Planning for Care The indications for initiating, withdrawing, or withholding medication(s), as well as the use of non-pharmacological interventions, are determined by assessing the resident's underlying condition, current signs and symptoms, and preferences and goals for treatment. This includes, where possible, the identification of the underlying cause(s), since a diagnosis alone may not war rant treatment with medication. Target symptoms and goals for use of these medications should be established for each resident. Progress toward meeting the goals should be evaluated routinely. Possible adverse effects of these medication s should be well understood by nursing staff. Educate nursing home staff to be obser vant for these adverse effects. Implement s ystematic monitoring of each resident taking any of these medications to i dentify adverse consequences early. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record for documentation that any of these medications were received by the resident during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). 2. Review documentation from other health care settings where the resident may have received any of these medications while a resident of the nursing home (e.g., valium given in the emergency room). Coding Instructions N0410A -H: Code medications according to the pharmacological classification, not how they are being used. N0410A, A ntipsychotic: Record the number of days an antipsychotic medication was received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or sinc e admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days) . N0410B, Antianxiety: Record the number of days an anxiolytic medication was received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission /entry or reentry if less than 7 days). DEFINITIONS DOSE The total amount/strength/ concentration of a medication given at one time or over a period of time. The individual dose is the amount/strength/ concentration received at each administration. The amount received over a 24- hour period may be referred to as the \"daily dose.\" MONITORING The ongoing collection and analysis of information (such as observations and diagnostic test results) and comparison to baseline and current data in order to ascertain the individual's response to treatment and care, including progress or lack of progress toward a goal. Monitoring can detect any improvements, complications , or adverse consequences of the condition or the treatments and support decisions about adding, modifying, continuing, or discontinuing any interventions. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N Medications Received (cont.) N0410C, Antidepressant: Record the number of days an antidepressant medication was received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission /entry or reentry if less than 7 days). N0410D, Hypnotic: Record the number of days a hypnotic medication was received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). N0410E, Anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin, heparin, or low - molecular weight heparin): Record the number of days an anticoagulant medication was received b y the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission /entry or reentry if less than 7 days). Do not code antiplatelet medications such as aspirin /extended release, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel here. N0410F, Antibiotic: Record the number of days an antibiotic medication w as received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission /entry or reentry if less than 7 days). N0410G, Diuretic: Record the number of days a diuretic medication was received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). N0410H, Opioid: Record the number of days an opioid medication was received by the resident at any time during the 7 -day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). Coding Tips and Special Populations Code medications in Item N0410 according to the medication 's therapeutic category and/or pharmacological classification, not how it is used . For exa mple, although oxazepam may be prescribed for use as a hypnotic, it is c ategorized as an antianxiety medication. Therefore, in this section, i t would be code d as an antianxiety medication and not as a hypnotic. Medications that have more than one therapeut ic category and/or pharmacological classification should be coded in all categories/classifications assigned to the medication, regardless of how it is being used. For example, prochlorperazine is dually classified as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic. Therefore , in this section, it would be coded as an antipsychotic, regardless of how it is used. Include any of these medications given to the resident by any route ( e.g., PO , IM, or IV) in any setting ( e.g., at the nursing home , in a hospital emergency room ) while a resident of the nursing home . Code a medication even if it was given only once during the look- back period. Count long -acting medications, such as fluphenazine dec anoate or haloperidol decanoate, that are given every few weeks or monthly only if they are given during the 7- day look- back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days) . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -8 N0410: Medications Received (cont.) A transdermal patch is designed to release medication over a period of time (typically 3 - 5 days); therefore, transdermal patches would be considered long -acting medications for the purpose of coding the MDS, and only the days the staff attaches the patch to the skin are counted for the MDS. For example, if, during the 7- day look- back period, a fentanyl patch was applied on days 1, 4, and 7, N0410H Opioid would be coded 3, because the application occurred on 3 days during the look- back period. Combination medications should be coded in all categories /pharmacologic classes that constitute the combination . For example, if the resident receives a single tablet that combines an antipsychotic and an antidepressant, then both antipsychotic and antidepressant categories should be coded . Over -the-counter sleeping medications are not coded as hypnotics , as they are not c ategorized as hypnotic medications . In circumstances where reference materials vary in identifying a medication's therapeutic category and/or pharmacological classification, consult the resources/links cited in this section or consult the medication package insert, which is available through the facility's pharmacy or the manufacturer's website. When residents are having difficulty sleeping, nursing home staff should explore non- pharmacological interventions ( e.g., sleep hygiene approaches that individualiz e the sleep and wake times to accommodate the person's wishes and prior customary routine) to try to improve sleep prior to initiating pharmacologic interventions . If residents are currently on sleep - enhancing medications, nursing home staff can try non- pharmacologic interventions to help reduce the need for these medications or elimin ate them. Many psychoactive medicatio ns increase confusion, sedation, and falls . For those residents who are already at risk for these conditions, nursing home staff should develop plans of care that address these risks. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a form of adverse consequence. It may be either a secondary effect of a medication that is usually undesirable and different from the thera peutic effect of the medication or any response to a medication that is noxious and unintended and occurs in doses for prophylaxis, diagnosis , or treatment. The term \"side effect\" is often used interchangeabl y with ADR; however, side effects are but one of five ADR categories, the others being DEFINITION SLEEP HYGIENE Practices, habits and environmental factors that promote and/or improve sleep patterns. DEFINITIONS GRADUAL DOSE REDUCTION (GDR) Step-wise tapering of a dose to determine whether or not symptoms, conditions, or risks can be managed by a lower dose or whether or not the dose or medication can be discontinued. MEDICATION INTERACTION The impact of medication or other substance (such as nutritional supplements including herbal products, food, or substances used in diagnostic studies) upon another medication. The interactions may alter absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination. These interactions may decrease the effectiveness of the medication or increase the potential for adverse consequences. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Medications Received (cont.) hypersensitivity, idiosyncr atic response, toxic reactions, and adverse medication interactions. A side effect is an expected, well -known reaction that occurs with a predictable frequency and may or may not constitute an adverse consequence. Doses of psychoactive medications differ in acute and long -term treatment. Doses should always be the lowest possible to achieve the desired therapeutic effects and be deemed neces sary to maintain or improve the resident 's function, well -being, safety, and quality of life . Duration of treatment should also be in accordance with pertinent literature, including clinical practice guidelines. Since medication issues continue to evolve a nd new medications are being approved regularly, it is important to refer to a current authoritative source for detailed medication information , such as indications and precautions, dosage, moni toring, or adverse consequences. During the first year in whic h a resident on a psychoactive medication is admitted, or after the nursing home has initiated such medication, nursing home staff should attempt to taper the medication or perform gradual dose reduction (GDR) as long a s it is not medically contraindicated . Information on GDR and tapering of medications can be found in the State Operations Manual, Appendix PP, Guidance to Surveyors for Long Term Care Facilities (the State Operations Manual can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/index.html ). Prior to discontinuing a psychoactive medication , residents may need a GDR or tapering to avoi d withdrawal syndrome (e.g., for medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [ TCAs ], etc.) . Residents who are on antidepressants should be closely monitored for worsening of depression and/or suicidal ide ation/ behavior, especially during initiation or change of dosage in therapy . Stopping antidepressants abruptly puts one at higher risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. Anticoagulants must be monitored with dosage frequency determined by clinical circumstances and duration of use . Certain anticoagulants require monitoring via laboratory results (e.g., Prothrombin Time [ PT]/International Normalization Ratio [INR]). \u2014 Multiple medication interactions ex ist with use of anticoagulants (information on common medication -medication interactions can be found in the State Operations Manual, Appendix PP, Guidance to Surveyors for Long Term Care Facilities [the State Operations Manual can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/index.html ]), which may significantly increase PT/INR results to levels associated with life -threatening bleeding, or decrease PT/INR results to ineffective levels, or increase or decrease the serum concentration of the interacting medication. Anticoagulants such as Target Specific Oral Anticoagulants (TSOACs), which may or may not require laboratory monitoring, should be coded in N0410E, Anticoagulant. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -10 N0410: Medications Received (cont.) Herbal and alternative medicine products are considered to be dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These products are not regulated by the FDA (e.g., they are not r eviewed for safety and effectiveness like medications) and their composition is not standardized (e.g., the composition varies among manufacturers). Therefore, they should not be counted as medications (e.g., melatonin, chamomile, valerian root). Keep in m ind that, for clinical purposes, it is important to document a resident's intake of such herbal and alternative medicine products elsewhere in the medical record and to monitor their potential effects as they can interact with medications the resident is c urrently taking. For more information consult the FDA website http://www.fda.gov/food/dietarysupplements/usingdietarysupplements/ . Opioid medications can be an effective in tervention in a resident's pain management plan, but also carr y risks such as overuse and constipation. A thorough assessment and root-cause analysis of the resident's pain should be conducted prior to initiation of an opioid medication and re -evaluation of the resident's pain, side effects , and medication use and plan should be ongoing. Example 1. The Medication Administration Record for Mrs. P. reflects the following: Risperidone 0.5 mg PO BID PRN: Received once a day on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Lorazepam 1 mg PO QAM: Received every day. Temazepam 15 mg PO QHS PRN : Received at bedtime on Tuesday and Wednesday only. Coding: Medications in N04 10, would be coded as follows : A. Antipsychotic = 3, risperidone is an antipsychotic medication , B. Antianxiety = 7, lorazepam is an antianxiety medication , and D. Hypnotic = 2, temazepam is a hypnotic medication . Please note: if a resident is receiving medications in all three categories simultaneously there must be a clear clinical indication for the use of these medications. Administration of these types of medications, particularly in this combination, could be interpreted as chemically restraining the resident.

N0450: Antipsychotic Medication Review CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -12 N0450: Antipsychotic Medication Review (cont.) Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Lif e The use of unnecessary medications in long term care settings can have a profound effect on the resident's quality of life . Antipsychotic medications are associated with increased risks for adverse outcomes that can affect health, safety, and quality of life . In addition to assuring that antipsychotic medications are being utilized to treat the resident's condition, it is also important to assess the need to reduce these medications whenever possible. Planning for Care Identify residents receiv ing antipsychotic medications to ensure that each resident is receiving the lowest possible dose to achieve the desired therapeutic effects. Monitor for appropriate clinical indications for continued use . Implement a system to ensure gradual dose reductions (GDR) are attempted at recommended intervals unless clinically contraindicated. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medication administration records to determine if the resident received an antipsychotic medication since admission/entry or reentr y or the prior OBRA asses sment, whichever is more recent . 2. If the resident received an antipsychotic medication , review the medical record to determine if a gradual dose reduction has been attempted . 3. If a gradual dose reduction was not attempted, r eview the medical record to determine if there is physician documentation that the GDR is clinically contraindicated . Coding Instructions for N0450A Code 0, no : if antipsychotics were not received: Skip N0450B, N0450C, Code 1, y es: if antipsychotics were received on a routine basis only: Continue to N0450B, Has a GDR been attempted? Code 2, y es: if antipsychotics were received on a PRN basis only: Continue to N0450B, Has a GDR been attempted? Code 3, y es: if antipsychotics were received on a routine and PRN basis : Continue to N0450B, Has a GDR been attempted? CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -13 N0450: Antipsychotic Medication Review (cont.) Coding Tips and Special Populations Any medication that has a pharmacological classification or therapeutic category of antipsychotic medication must be recorded in this section, regardless of why the medication is being used. Coding Instructions for N0450B Code 0, no : if a GDR has not been attempted. Skip to N0450D , Physician documented GDR as clinically contraindicated . Code 1, y es: if a GDR has been attempted. Continue to N0450C , Date of last attempted GD R. Coding Instructions for N0450C Enter the date of the last attempted Gradual Dose Reduction . Coding Tips and Special Populations (N0450B and N0450C) Within the first year in which a resident is admitted on an antipsychotic medication or after the facility has initiated an antipsychotic medication, the facility must attempt a GDR in two separate quarters (with at least one month between the attempts), unless physi cian documentation is present in the medical record indicating that a GDR is clinically contraindicated. After the first year, a GDR must be attempted at least annually, unless clinically contraindicated (see F758 in Appendix PP of the State Operations Manual). In N0450B and N0450C, include GDR attempts conducted since the resident was admitted to the facility, if the resident was receiving an antipsychotic medication at the time of admission, OR since the resident was started on the antipsychotic medicatio n, if the medication was started after the resident was admitted. Do not include gradual dose reductions that occurred prior to admission to the facility (e.g., GDRs attempted during the resident's acute care stay prior to admission to the facility). If the resident was admitted to the facility with a documented GDR attempt in progress and the resident received the last dose(s) of the antipsychotic medication of the GDR in the facility, then the GDR would be coded in N0450B and N0450C. If the resident recei ved a dose or doses of an antipsychotic medication that was not part of a documented GDR attempt, such as if the resident received a dose or doses of the medication PRN or one or two doses were ordered for the resident for a specific day or procedure, thes e are not coded as a GDR attempt in N0450B and N0450C. Discontinuation of an antipsychotic medication, even without a GDR process, should be coded in N0450B and N0450C as a GDR, as the medication was discontinued. When an antipsychotic medication is discon tinued without a gradual dose reduction, the date of the GDR in N0450C is the first day the resident did not receive the discontinued antipsychotic medication. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -14 N0450: Antipsychotic Medication Review (cont.) Do not count as a GDR an antipsychotic medication reduction performed for the purpose of switching the resident from one antipsychotic medication to another. The start date of the last attempted GDR should be entered in N0450C, Date of last attempted GDR. The GDR start date is the first day the resident received the reduced dose of the antipsychotic medication. In cases in which a resident is or was receiving multiple antipsychotic medications on a routine basis and one medication was reduced or discontinued, record the date of the reduction attempt or discontinuation in N0450C. If multiple dose reductions have been attempted since admission OR since initiation of the antipsychotic medication, record the date of the most recent reduction attempt in N0450C. Federal requirements regarding GDRs are found at 42 CFR 483.45(d) Unnecessary drugs and 483.45(e) Psychotropic drugs. Coding Instructions for N0450D Code 0, no : if a GDR has not been documented by a physician as clinically contraindicated . Skip N0450E Date physician documented GDR as clinically contraindicated . Code 1, y es: if a GDR has been documented by a physician as clinically contraindicated. Continue to N0450E, D ate physician documented GDR as clinically contraindicated . Coding Instructions for N0450E Enter date the physician documented GDR attempts as clinically contraindicated . Coding Tips and Special Populations (N0450D and N0450E) In this section, the term physician also includes physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse s pecialist. In N0450D and N0450E, include physician documentation that a GDR attempt is clinically contraindicated since the resident was admitted to the facility, if the resident was receiving an antipsychotic medication at the time of admission, OR since the residen t was started on the antipsychotic medication, if the medication was started after the resident was admitted to the facility. Physician documentation indicating dose reduction attempts are clinically contraindicated must include the clinical rationale for why an attempted dose reduction is inadvisable. This decision should be based on the fact that tapering of th e medication would not achieve the desired therapeutic effects and the current dose is necessary to maintain or improve the resident's function, well -being, safety, and quality of life. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -15 N2001: Drug Regimen Review Intent: The intent of the drug regimen review items is to document whether a drug regimen review was conducted upon the resident's admission (start of Skilled Nursing Facility [SNF] Prospective Payment System [PPS] stay) and throughout the resident's stay (through Part A PPS discharge) and whether any clinically significant medication i ssues identified were addressed in a timely manner. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Potential and actual resident medication adverse consequences and errors are prevalent in health care settings and often occur during transitions in care. Adverse consequences related to medications may result in serious harm or death, emergency department visits, and rehospitalizations and affect the resident's health, safety, and quality of life. Drug regimen review i s intended to improve resident safety by identifying and address ing potential and actual clinically significant medication issues at the time of a resident's admission (start of SNF PPS stay) and throughout the resident's stay (through Part A PPS discharge) . Planning for Care Drug regimen review is an important component of the overall management and monitoring of a resident's medication regimen. Prevention and timely identification of potential and actual medication -related adverse consequences reduces the resident's risk for harm and improves quality of life. Educate staff in proper medication administration techniques and adverse effects of medications, as well as to be observant for these adverse effects. Implement a system to ensure that each resident 's medication usage is evaluated upon admission and on an ongoing basis and that risks and problems are identified and acted upon. DEFINITION DRUG REGIMEN REVIEW A drug regimen review includes medication reconciliation, a review of all medications a resident is currently using, and a review of the drug regimen to identify, and if possible, prevent potential clinically significant medication adverse consequences. The drug regimen review includes all medications, prescribed and over the counter (OTC), nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products, administered by any route. It also includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -16 N2001: Drug Regimen Review (cont.) Steps for Assessment Complete if A0310B = 01. 1. Complete a drug regimen review upon admission (start of SNF PPS stay) or as close to the actual time of admission as possible to identify any potential or actual clinically significant medication issues. 2. Review medical record documentation to determine w hether a drug regimen review was conducted upon admission (start of SNF PPS stay), or as close to the actual time of admission as possible, to identify any potential or actual clinically significant medication issues. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care, the resident's most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, medication lists/records, clinical progress notes, and other resources as available. Discussions (including with the acute care hospital, other staff and clinicians responsible for completing the drug regimen review, the resident, and the resident's family/significant other) may supplement and/or clarify the information gleaned from the reside nt's medical records. 3. Clinically significant medication issues may include, but are not limited to: Medication prescribed despite documented medication allergy or prior adverse reaction. Excessive or inadequate dose. Adverse reactions to medication. Ineffective drug therapy. Drug interactions (serious drug- drug, drug -food, and drug- disease interactions). Duplicate therapy (for example, generic- name and brand -name equivalent drugs are coprescribed). Wrong resident, dru g, dose, route, and time errors. Medication dose, frequency, route, or duration not consistent with resident's condition, manufacturer's instructions, or applicable standards of practice. Use of a medication without evidence of adequate indication for use . Presence of a medical condition that may warrant medication therapy (e.g., a resident with primary hypertension does not have an antihypertensive medication prescribed). Omissions (medications missing from a prescribed regimen). Nonadherence (purposeful or accidental). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -17 N2001: Drug Regimen Review (cont.) Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if no clinically significant medication issues were identified during the drug regimen review. Code 1, Yes : if one or more clinically significant medication issues were identified during the drug regimen review. Code 9, NA: if the resident was not taking any medications at the time of the drug regimen review. Coding Tips A dash ( -) value is a valid response for this item; however, CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. The drug regimen review includes all medications , prescribed and over the counter (OTC), including nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products, administered by any route. The drug regimen review also includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen. Examples 1. The admitting nurse reviewed and compared the acute care hospital discharge medication orders and the physician's admission medication orders for Ms. D. The nurse interviewed Ms. D, who confirmed the medications she was taking for her current medical conditions. The nur se found no discrepancies between the acute care hospital discharge medications and the admitting physician's medication orders. After the nurse contacted the pharmacy to request the medication, the pharmacist reviewed and confirmed the medication orders a s appropriate for Ms. D. As a result of this collected and communicated information, the nurse determined that there were no potential or actual clinically significant medication issues. Coding: N2001 would be coded 0, No \u2014No issues found during review. DEFINITIONS POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEDICATION ISSUE A clinically significant medication issue is a potential or actual issue that, in the clinician's professional judgment, warrants physic ian (or physician- designee) communication and completion of prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next cal endar day at the latest . \"Clinically significant\" means effects, results, or consequences that materially affect or are likely to affect an individual's mental, physical, or psychosocial well -being, either positively, by preventing a condition or reducing a risk, or negatively, by exacerbating, causing, or contributing to a symptom, illness, or decline in status. Any circumstance that does not require this immediate attention is not considered a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue for the purpose of the drug regimen review items. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -18 N2001: Drug Regimen Review (cont.) Rationale: The admitting nurse reviewed and compared Ms. D's discharge medication records from the acute care hospital with the physician's admission medication orders, collaborated with the pharmacist, and interviewed the resident. The nurse determined there were no potential or actual clinically significant medication issues. 2. Mr. H was admitted to the nursing facility after undergoing cardiac surgery for mitral valve replacement. The acute care hospital discharge information indicated that Mr. H had a mechanical mitral heart valve and was to continue receiving anticoagulant medication. While completing a review and comparison of Mr. H's discharge records from the hospital with the physician's adm ission medication orders and admission note, the nurse noted that the admitting physician had ordered Mr. H's anticoagulation medication to be held if the international normalized ratio (INR) was below 1.0, however, the physician's admission note indicated that the desired therapeutic INR parameters for Mr. H was 2.5 -3.5. The nurse questioned the INR level listed on the admitting physician's order, based on t he therapeutic parameters of 2.5-3.5 documented in the physician's admission note, which prompted the nurse to call the physician immediately to address the issue. Coding: N2001 would be coded 1, Yes \u2014Issues found during review. Rationale: The admitting nurse reviewed and compared Mr. H's discharge health care records from the acute care hospital with the nursing facility physician's admission medication orders and admission note. The nurse identified a discrepancy between the physician's docum ented therapeutic INR level (2.5 -3.5) for Mr. H in the admission note and the physician's order to hold anticoagulation medication for an INR level of 1.0. The nurse considered this discrepancy to be a potential clinically significant medication issue that could lead to potential clotting issues for Mr. H. N2003: Medication Follow-up Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Integral to the process of safe medication administration practice is timely communication with a physician when a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue has been identified. Physician -prescribed/ recommended actions in response to identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues must be completed by the clinician in a time frame that maximizes the reduction in risk for medication errors and resident harm. DEFINITION MEDICATION FOLLOW - UP The process of contacting a physician to communicate an identified medication issue and completing all physician- prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day at the latest . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -19 N2003: Medication Follow -up (cont.) Planning for Care When a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue is identified, prompt communication with the physician and implementation of prescribed actions is necessary to protect the health and safety of the resident. Steps for Assessment This item is c ompleted if one or more potential or actual clinically significant medication issues were identified during the admission drug regimen review (N2001 = 1). 1. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the following criteria were met for any pot ential or actual clinically significant medication issues that were identified upon admission: Two-way communication between the clinician(s) and the physician was completed by midnight of the next calendar day, AND All physician -prescribed/ -recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day. Medical record sources include medical records received from facilities where the resident received health care, the resident's most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, medication lists/records, clinical progress notes, and other resources as available. Discussions (including with the acute care hospital, other staff and clinicians responsible for completing the drug regimen review, the resident, and the resident's family/significant other) may supplement and/or clarify the information gleaned from the resident's medical records . Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the facility did not contact the physician and complete prescribed/recommended actions in response to each identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issue by midnight of the next calendar day. Code 1, Yes: if the facility contacted the physician AND completed the prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day after each potential or actual clinically significant medication issue was identified. Coding Tips If the physician prescribes/ recommends an action that will take longer than midnight of the next calendar day to complete, then code 1, Yes, should still be entered, if by midnight of the next calendar day the DEFINITION CONTACT WITH PHYSICIAN Communication with the physician to convey an identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issue, and a response from the physician to convey prescribed/recommended actions in response to the medication issue. Communication can be in person, by telephone, voice mail, electronic means, facsimile, or any other means that appropriately conveys the resident's st atus. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -20 N2003: Medication Follow -up (cont.) facility has taken the appropriate steps to comply with the prescribed/recommended action. \u2014 Example of a physician -recommended action that would take longer than midnight of the next calendar day to complete : o The physician writes an order instructing the clinician to monitor the medication issue over the next three days and call if the problem persists. \u2014 Examples of by midnight of the next calendar day : o A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 10:00 AM on 9/12/2017. The physician -prescribed/ -recommended action is completed on or before 11:59 PM on 9/13/2017. o A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 11:00 PM on 9/12/2017. The physician -prescribed/ -recommended action is completed on or before 11:59 PM on 9/13/2017. A dash ( -) value is a valid response for this item; however, CMS expe cts dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. Mr. P was admitted to the nursing facility with active diagnoses of pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. The acute care facility medication record indicated that Mr. P was on a seven -day course of antibiotics and had three remaining days of this treatment plan. The nurse reviewing the discharge records from the acute care facility and the nursing facility admission medication orders noted that Mr. P had an order for an anticoagulant medication that required INR m onitoring, as well as the antibiotic. On the date of admission, the nurse contacted the physician responsible for Mr. P and communicated a concern about a potential increase in Mr. P's INR with this combination of medications that could place him at greate r risk for bleeding. The physician provided orders for laboratory testing so that Mr. P's INR levels would be monitored over the next three days, starting that day. However, the nurse did not request the first INR laboratory test until after midnight of th e next calendar day. Coding: N2003 would be coded 0, No. Rationale: A potential clinically significant medication issue was identified during the drug regimen review; the staff did contact the physician before midnight of the next calendar day, but did not complete, to the extent possible, the physician -prescribed actions related to the INR laboratory test until after midnight of the next calendar day. 2. Ms. S was admitted to the facility from an acute care hospital. During the admitting nurse's review of Ms. S's hospital discharge records, it was noted that Ms. S had been prescribed metformin. However, laboratory tests at admission indicated that Ms. S ha d a serum creatinine of 2.4, consistent with renal insufficiency. The admitting nurse contacted the physician to ask whether this medication would be contraindicated with Ms. S's current serum creatinine level. Three hours after Ms. S's admission to the fa cility, the physician provided orders to discontinue the metformin and start Ms. S on a short -acting sulfonylurea for ongoing diabetes management. These medication changes were implemented within the hour. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -21 N2003: Medication Follow -up (cont.) Coding: N2003 would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: A potential clinically significant medication issue was identified during the drug regimen review; the physician communication occurred, and the nurse completed the physician -prescribed actions, by midnight of the next c alendar day. N2005: Medication Intervention Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Integral to the process of safe medication administration practice is timely communication with a physician when a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue has been identified. Physician -prescribed/ -recommended actions in response to identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues must be completed by the clinician in a time frame that maximizes the reduction in risk for me dication errors and resident harm. Potential or actual clinically significant medication issues can occur throughout the resident's stay. Planning for Care Every time a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue is identified throughout t he resident's stay, it must be communicated to a physician, and the physician -prescribed/ -recommended actions must be completed by the clinician in a time frame that maximizes the reduction in risk for medic ation errors and resident harm. Steps for Assessm ent The observation period for this item is from the date of admission (start of SNF PPS stay) through discharge (Part A PPS discharge). 1. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the following criteria were met for any potential and actual clinically significant medication issues that were identified upon admission or at any time during the resident's stay: Two-way communication between the clinician(s) and the physician was completed by midnight of the next calendar day, AND All physician -prescribed/ -recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -23 N2005: Medication Intervention (cont.) Examples 1. At the end of the resident's Part A PPS stay, the discharging nurse reviewed Ms. T's medical records, from the time of admission (start of SNF PPS stay) through her entire Part A PPS stay (Part A PPS discharge) and noted that a clinically significant medication issue was documented during the admission assessment. Ms. T's medical records indicated that a nurse had attempted to contact the assigned physician several times about the clinically significant medication issue. After midnight of the second calendar day, the physician communi cated to the nurse, via telephone, orders for changes to Ms. T's medications to address the clinically significant medication issue. The nurse implemented the physician's orders. Upon further review of Ms. T's medical records, the discharging nurse determi ned that no additional issues had been recorded throughout the remainder of Ms. T's stay. Coding: N2005 would be coded 0, No \u2014the facility did not contact the physician and complete prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day each time a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue was identified since the resident's admission (start of SNF PPS stay). Rationale: Coding of this item includes all potential or actual clinically significant medication issues identified at any time during the resident's stay. When reviewing Ms. T's medical record at discharge, the nurse found that a clinically significant medication issue was identified during the admission (start of SNF PPS stay) drug regimen review, but the facility did not communicate with the physician and complete prescribed actions by midnight of the next calendar day. A lthough no other potential or actual clinically significant medication issues were identified during the remainder of the resident's stay, the facility did not communicate with the physician and complete prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day each time a potential or actual clinically significa nt medication issue was identified durin g the resident's SNF PPS stay. 2. At discharge, the nurse completing a review of Ms. K's medical records found that two clinically significant medication issues had been identified during the resident's stay. During the admission drug regimen review, the admitting nurse had identified a clinically significant medication issue, contacted the physician, and implemented new orders provided by the physician on the same day. Another potentially significant medication issue wa s identified on day 12 of Ms. K's stay; the nurse communicated with the physician and carried out the orders within one hour of identifying the potential issue. Both medication issues identified during Ms. K's stay were communicated to the physician and re solved by midnight of the next calendar day after identification. There were no other clinically significant medication issues identified during Ms. K's stay. Coding: N2005 would be coded as 1, Yes \u2014all potential or actual clinically significant medication issues identified at any time during the resident's stay (admission through discharge) were communicated to the physician and prescribed/recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day after each issue was identified. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [N] October 2019 Page N -24 N2005: Medic ation Intervention (cont.) Rationale: While a medication issue was identified as a clinically significant medication issue at admission, it was resolved by midnight of the next day. During Ms. K's stay, an additional clinically significant medication issue was identified; it too was resolved by midnight of the follow ing day. Each time a clinically significant medication issue was identified (at admission and during the stay), it was communicated to the physician and resolved through completion of prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day afte r identification. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -1 SECTION O : SPECIAL TREATMENTS, PROCEDURES, AND PROGRAMS Intent: The intent of the items in this section is to identify any special treatments, procedures, and programs that the r esident received during the specified time periods. O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs Facilities may code treatments, programs and procedures that the resident performed themselves independently or after set- up by facility staff. Do not code ser vices that were provided solely in conjunction with a surgical procedure or diagnostic procedure, such as IV medications or ventilators. Surgical procedures include routine pre- and post-operative procedures. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life The treatments , procedures, and programs listed in Item O0100, Special Treatments , Procedures, and Programs , can have a profound effect on an individual's health status, self-image, dignity, and quality of life. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -2 O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs (cont.) Planning for Care Reevaluation of special treatments and procedures the resident received or performed, or programs that the resident was involved in during the 14- day look- back period is important to ensure the continued a ppropriateness of the treatments, procedures, or programs. Residents who perform any of the treatments, programs, and/or procedures below should be educated by the facility on the proper performance of these tasks, safety and use of any equipment needed, a nd be monitored for appropriate use and continued ability to perform these tasks. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether or not the resident received or performed any of the treatments, procedures, or programs within the last 14 days. Coding Instructions for Column 1 Check all treatments, pro cedures, and pro grams received or performed by the resident prior to admission/ entry or reentry to the facility and within the 14 -day look- back period. Leave Column 1 blank if the resident was admitted /entered or reentered the facility more than 14 days ago. If no items apply in the last 14 days, check Z , none of the above . Coding Instructio ns for Column 2 Check all treatments, pro cedures, and pro grams received or performed by the resident after admission/ entry or reentry to the facility and within the 14 -day look- back period. Coding Tips Facilities may code treatments, programs and procedur es that the resident performed themselves independently or after set -up by facility staff. Do not code services that were provided solely in conjunction with a surgical procedure or diagnostic procedure, such as IV medications or ventilators. Surgical proc edures include routine pre - and post -operative procedures. O0100A , Chemotherapy Code any type of chemotherapy agent administered as an antineoplastic given by any route in this item. Each medication should be evaluated to determine its reason for use before coding it here. Medications coded here are those actually used for cancer treatment. For example, megestrol acetate is classified as an antineoplastic drug. One of its side effects is appetite stimulation and weight gain. If megestrol acetate is being given only for appetite stimulation, do not code it as chemotherapy in this item, as the resident is not receiving the medication for chemotherapy purposes in this situation. Hormonal and other agents administered to prevent the recurrence or slow the growth of cancer should not be coded in this item, as they are not considered chemotherapy for the purpose of coding the MDS . IVs, IV medication, and blood transfusions administered during chemotherapy ar e not recorded under items K0510A (Parenteral/IV), O0100H (IV Medications), or O0100 I (Transfusions). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -3 O0100: Special Treatments, P rocedures, and Programs (cont.) Example: Ms. J was diagnosed with estrogen receptor -positive breast cancer and was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. After her cancer treatment, Ms. J was prescribed tamoxifen (a selective estrogen receptor modulator) to decrease the risk of recurrence and/or decrease the growth rate of cancer cells. Since the hormonal agent is being admin istered to decrease the risk of cancer recurrence, it cannot be coded as chemotherapy. O0100B, Radiation Code intermittent radiation therapy , as well as radiation administered via radiation implant in this item. O0100C , Oxygen therapy Code continuous or intermittent oxygen administered via mask, cannula, etc., delivered to a resident to relieve hypoxia in this item. Code oxygen used in Bi -level Positive Airway Pressure/Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP/CPAP) here. Do not code hyperbaric oxygen for wound therapy in this item. This item may be coded if the resident places or removes his/her own oxygen mask, cannula. O0100D , Suctioning Code only tracheal and/or nasopharyngeal suctioning in this item. Do not code oral suctioning here. This item may be coded if the resident performs his/her own tracheal and/or nasopharyngeal suctioning. O0100E, Tracheostomy care Code cleansing of the tracheostomy and/or cannula in this item. This item may be coded if the resident performs his/her own tracheostomy care. O0100F, Invasive Mechanical Ventilator (ventilator or respirator) Code any type of electrically or pneumatically powered closed -system mechanical ventilator support device that ensure s adequate ventilation in the resident who is or who may become (such as during weaning attempts) unable to support his or her own respiration in this item. During invasive mechanical ventilation the resident's breathing is controlled by the ventilator. Residents receiving closed -system ventilation include those residents recei ving ventilation via an endotracheal tube (e.g., nasally or orally intubated) or tracheostomy. A resident who has been weaned off of a respirator or ventilator in the last 14 day s, or is currently being weaned o ff a respirator or ventilator, should also be coded here. Do not code this item when the ventilator or respirator is used only as a substitute for BiPAP or CPAP. Example: Mrs. J is connected to a ventilator via tracheostomy (invasive mechanical ventilation) 24 hours a day, because of an irreversible neurological injury and inability to breathe on her own. O0100F should be checked, as Mrs. J is using an invasive mechanical ventilator because she is unable to initiate spontaneous breathing on her own and the ventilator is controlling her breathing. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -4 Special Treatments, P rocedures, and Programs (cont.) O0100G, Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilator (BiPAP/CPAP) Code any type of CPAP or BiPAP respiratory support devices that prevent airways from closing by delivering slightly pressuriz ed air through a mask or other device continuously or via electronic cycling throughout the breathing cycle. The BiPAP/CPAP mask/device enables the individual to support his or her own spontaneous respiration by providing enough pressure when the individua l inhales to keep his or her airways open, unlike ventilators that \"breathe\" for the individual. If a ventilator or respirator is being used as a substitute for BiPAP/CPAP, code here. This item may be coded if the resident places or removes his/her own BiP AP/CPAP mask/device. Example: Mr. M has sleep apnea and requires a CPAP device to be worn when sleeping. The staff set -up the water receptacle and humidifier element of the machine. Mr. M puts on the CPAP mask and starts the machine prior to falling asleep. O0100G should be checked as Mr. M is able to breath e on his own and wears the CPAP mask when he is sleeping to manage his sleep apnea. O0100H , IV medications Code any drug or biological given by intravenous push, epidural pump, or drip through a central or peripheral port in this it em. Do not code flushes to keep a n IV access port patent, or IV fluids without medication here. Epidural, intrathecal, and baclofen pumps may be coded here, as they are similar to IV medications in that they must be monitored frequently and they involve continuous administration of a substance. Subcutaneous pumps are not coded in this item. Do not include IV medications of any kind that were administered during dialysis or chemotherapy. Dextrose 50% and/or Lactated Ringers given IV are not considered medica tions, and should not be coded here. To determine what products are considered medications or for more information consult the FDA website: The Orange Book, http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/ The National Drug Code Directory, http://www.fda.gov/drugs/informationondrugs/ucm142438.htm O0100I , Transfusions Code transfusions of blood or any blood products (e.g., platelets , synthetic blood products ), that are administered directly into the bloodstream in this item. Do not include transfusions that were administered during dialysis or chemotherapy. O0100J, Dialysis Code peritoneal or renal dialysis which occurs at the nursing home or at another facility , record treatments of hemofiltration, Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration (SCUF), Continuous Hemofiltration (CAVH), and Ambulatory Peritoneal Dia lysis (CAPD) in this item. IVs, IV medication, and blood transfusions administered during dialysis are considered part of the dialysis procedure and are not to be coded under items K0510A (Parenteral/IV), O0100H (IV medications), or O0100I (transfusions). This item may be coded if the resident performs his/her own dialysis. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -5 P rocedures, and Programs (cont.) O0100K , Hospice care Code residents identified as being in a hospice program for terminally ill persons where an array of services is provided for the palliation and management of terminal illness and related conditions. The hospice must be licensed by the state as a hospice provider and/or certified under the Medicare program as a hospice provider. O0100M , Isolation for active infectious disease (does not include standard precautions) Code only when the resident requires transmission- based precautions and single room isolation (alone in a separate room ) because of active infection (i.e., symptomatic and/or have a positive test and are in the contagious stage) with highly transmissible or epidemiologically significant pathogens that have been acquired by physical contact or ai rborne or droplet transmission. Do not code this item if the resident only has a history of infectious disease (e.g., s/p MRSA or s/p C-Diff - no active symptoms). Do not code this item if the precautions are standard precautions, because these types of precautions apply to everyone. Standard precautions include hand hygiene compliance, glove use, and additionally may include masks, eye protection, and gowns. Examples of when the isolation criterion would not apply include urinary tract infections, encapsulat ed pneumonia, and wound infections. Code for \" single room isolation\" only when all of the following conditions are met: 1. The resident has active infection with highly transmissible or epidemiologically significant pathogens that have been acquired by physic al contact or airborne or droplet transmission. 2. Precautions are over and above standard precautions. That is, transmission- based precautions (contact, droplet, and/or airborne) must be in effect. 3. The resident is in a room alone because of active infection and cannot have a roommate. This means that the resident must be in the room alone and not cohorted with a roommate regardless of whether the roommate has a similar active infection that requires isolation. 4. The resident must remain in his/her room. This re quires that all services be brought to the resident (e.g. rehabilitation, activities, dining, etc.). The following resources are being provided to help the facility interdisciplinary team determine the best method to contain and/or prevent the spread of infectious disease based on the type of infection and clinical presentation of the resident related to the specific communicable disease. The CDC guideline s also outline isolation precautions and go into detail regarding the different types of Transmission- Based Precautions (Contact, Droplet, and Airborne). 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html SHEA/APIC Guideline: Infection Prevention and Control in the Long Term Care Facility http://www.apic.org/Resource_/TinyMceFileManager/Practice_Guidance/id_APIC - SHEA_GuidelineforICinLTCFs.pdf CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -6 O0100: Special Treatments, P rocedures, and Programs (cont.) As the CDC guideli ne notes , there are psychosocial risks associated with such restriction, and it has been recommended that psychosocial needs be balanced with infection control needs in the long-term care setting. If a facility transports a resident who meets the criteria for single room isolation to another healthcare setting to receive medically needed services (e.g. dialysis, chemotherapy, blood transfusions, etc.) which the facility does not or cannot provide, they should follow CDC guidelines for transport of patients with communicable disease, and may still code O0100M for single room isolation since it is still being maintained while the resident is in the facility. Finally, when coding for isolation, the facility should review the resident's status and determine if the criteria for a Significant Change of Status Assessment (SCSA) is met based on the effect the infection has on the resident's function and plan of care. The definition and criteria of \"significant change of status\" is found in Chapter 2, Section 2.6, 03. Significant Change i n Status Assessment (SCSA) (A0310A = 04). Regardless of whether the resident meets the criteria for an SCSA, a modification of the resident's plan of care will likely need to be completed. O0100Z, None of the above Code if none of the above treatments, procedures, or programs were received or performed by the resident . O0250: Influenza Vaccine Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life When infected with influenza, older adults and persons with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications and are more likely than the general population to require hospitalization. An institutional I nfluenza A outbreak can result in up to 60 percent of the population becoming ill, with 25 percent of those affected developing complications severe enough to result in hospitalization or death. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -7 O0250: Influenza Vaccine (cont.) Influenza -associated mortality results not only from pneumonia, but also from subsequent events arising from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular , and other chronic or immuno compromising diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza. Planning for Care Influenza vaccines have been proven effective in preventing hospitalizations. A vaccine, like any other medicine, could possibly cause serious problem s, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from inactivated influenza vaccine are very rare. The viruses in inactivated influenza vaccine have been killed, so individuals cannot get influenza from the vaccine. \u2014 Mild problems: soreness, redness or swelling where the shot was given; hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough; fever; aches; headache; itching; and/or fatigue. If these problems occur, they usually begin soon aft er the shot and last 1- 2 days. \u2014 Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. In 1976, a type of inactivated influenza (swine flu) vacci ne was associated with Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, influenza vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current influenza vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinate d. This is much lower than the risk of severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting the influenza vaccine. People with mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -8 O0250: Influenza Vaccine (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether an i nfluenza vaccin e was received in the facility for this year's influenza vaccination season. If vaccination status is unknown, proceed to the next s tep. 2. Ask the resident if he or she received an i nfluenza vaccine outside of the facility for this year's i nfluenza vaccination season. If vaccination status is still unknown, proceed to the next step. 3. If the resident is unable to answer, then ask the same question of the responsible party/legal guardian and/or primary care physician. If influenza vaccination status is still unknown, proceed to the next step . 4. If influenza vaccin ation status cannot be det ermined, administer the influenza vaccin e to the resident according to standards of clinical practice . Coding Instructions for O0250A , Did the r esident receive the influenza vaccine in this facility for this year's influenza vaccination season? Code 0, n o: if the resident did NOT receive the influenza vaccine in this facility during this year's influenza vaccination season . Proceed to If i nfluenza vaccine not received, state reason ( O0250C) . Code 1, yes: if the resident did receive the influenza vaccine in this facility during this year's influenza season. Continue to Date influenza v accine r eceived (O0250B) . Coding Instructions for O0250B , Date influenza v accine received Enter the date that the influenza vaccine was received. Do not leave any boxes blank. \u2014 If the month contains only a single digit, fill in the first box of the month with a \"0\". For example, January 17, 2014 should be entered as 01- 17-2014. \u2014 If the day only contains a single digit, then fill the first box of the day with the \"0\". For example, October 6, 2013 should be entered as 10- 06-2013. A full 8 character date is required. \u2014 A full 8 character date is required. If the date is unknown or the information is not available, only a single dash needs to be entered in the first box. Coding Instructions for O0250C , If influenza vaccine not received, state reason If the resident has not received the i nfluenza vaccine for this year's i nfluenza vaccination season (i.e., O0250A=0), code the reason from the following list: Code 1, Resident not in this facility during this year's influenza vaccination season: resident was not in this facility during this year's influenza vaccination season. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -9 O0250: Influenza Vaccine (cont.) Code 2, Received outside of this facility: includes influenza vaccinations admini stered in any other setting (e.g. , physician office, health fair, grocery store, hospital, fire station) during this year's influenza vaccination season . Code 3, Not eligible \u2014medical contraindication: if influenza vaccine not received due to medical contraindications . Influenza vaccine is contraindicated for a resident with severe reaction (e.g., respiratory distress) to a previous dose of influenza vaccine or to a vaccine component. Precautions for influenza vaccine include moderate to severe acute illness with or without fever (influenza vaccine can be administered after the acute illness) and history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome within six weeks after previous influenza vaccination. Code 4, Offered and declined: resident or responsible party/legal guardian has been informed of the risks and benefits of receiving the influenza vaccine and chooses not to accept vaccin ation . Code 5, Not offered: resident or responsible party/legal guardian not offered the influenza vaccine. Code 6, Inability to obtain influenza vaccine due to a declared shortage: vaccine is unavailable at th is facility due to a declared influenza vaccine shortage. Code 9, None of the above: if none of the listed reasons describe why the influenza vaccine was not administered. This code is also used if the answer is unknown. Coding Tips and Special Populations Once the influenza vaccination has been administered to a resident for the current influenza season, this value is carried forward until the new influenza season begins. Influenza can occur at any time, but most influenza occurs from October through May. However, residents should be immunized as soon as the vaccine becomes available and continue until influenza is no longer circulating in your geographic area. Information about the current i nfluenza season can be obtained by accessing the CDC Seasonal Influenza (Flu) website. This website provides information on influenza activity and has an interactive map that shows geographic spread of influenza: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm , http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/usmap.htm . Facilities can also contact their local health department website for local influenz a surveillance information. The annual supply of inactivated influenza vaccine and the timing of its distribution cannot be guaranteed in any year. Therefore, in the event that a declared influenza vaccine shortage occurs in your geographical area, residen ts should still be vaccinated once the facility receives the influenza vaccine. A \"high dose\" inactivated influenza vaccine is available for people 65 years of age and older. Consult with the resident's primary care physician (or nurse practitioner) to determine if this high dose is appropriate for the resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -10 O0250: Influenza Vaccine (cont.) Examples 1. Mrs. J. received the influenza vaccine in the facility during this year's influenza vaccination season, on January 7, 20 14. Coding: O0250A would be coded 1, yes ; O0250B would be coded 01- 07-2014 , and O0250C would be skipped. Rationale: Mrs. J. received the vaccine in the facility on January 7, 2014, during this year's inf luenza vaccination season. 2. Mr. R. did not receive the influenza vaccine in the facility during this year's influenza vaccination season due to his known allergy to egg protein. Coding: O0250A would be coded 0, no ; O0250B is skipped, and O0250C would be coded 3, not eligible -medical contraindication . Rationale: Allergies to eg g protein is a medical contraindication to receiving the influenza vaccine, therefore, Mr. R did not receive the vaccine. 3. Mrs. T. received the influenza vaccine at her doctor's office during this year's i nfluenza vaccination season . Her doctor provided documentation of receipt of the vaccine to the facility to place in Mrs. T .'s medical record. He also provided documentation that Mrs. T. was explained the benefits and risks of the influenza vaccine prior to administration. Coding: O0250A would be coded 0, no; and O0250C would be coded 2, received outside of this facility . Rationale: Mrs. T. received the influenza vaccine at her doctor's office during this year's i nfluenza vaccination season . 4. Mr. K. wanted to receive the influenza vaccine if it arrived prior to his scheduled discharge on October 5th. Mr. K. was discharged prior to the facility receiving their annual shipment of influenza vaccine, and therefore, Mr. K. did not receive the influenza vaccine in the facility. Mr. K. was encouraged to receive the influenza vaccine at his next scheduled physician visit. Coding: O0250A would be coded 0, no ; O02 50B is skipped, and O02 50C would be coded 9, none of the above . Rationale: Mr. K. was unable to receive the influenza vaccine in the facility due to the fact that the facility did not receive its shipment of influenza vaccine until after his discharge. None of the codes in O0250C, Influenza vaccine not received, state reason , are applicable. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -11 O0300: Pneumococcal Vaccine Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Pneumococcus is one of the leading causes of community -acquired infections in the United States, with the highest disease burden among the elderly. Adults 65 years of age and older and those with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease and have higher case- fatality rates. Pneumococcal vaccines can help reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. Planning for Care Early detection of outbreaks is essential to control outbreaks of pneumococ cal disease in long-term care facilities. Individuals living in nursing homes and other long- term care facilities with an identified increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease or its complications, i.e., those 65 years of age and older with certain me dical conditions, should receive pneumococcal vaccination. Conditions that increase the risk of invasi ve pneumococcal disease include decreased immune function; damaged or no spleen; sickle ce ll and other hemoglobinopathies; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak; cochlear implants ; and chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, liver , and kidneys , including dialysis, diabetes, alcoholism, and smoking . Determining the rate of p neumococcal vaccination and causes for non- vaccination assists nursing homes in reaching the Healthy People 2020 (http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=23 ) national goal of 90% immunization among nursing home residents . Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether any pneumococcal vaccine s have been received. If vaccination status is unknown, proceed to the next step. 2. Ask the resident if he or she received any pneumococcal vaccines outside of the facility . If vaccination status is still unknown, proceed to the next step. 3. If the resident is unable to an swer, ask the same question of the responsible party/legal guardian and/or primary care physician. If vaccination status is still unknown, proceed to the next step. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -12 O0300: Pneumococcal Vaccine (cont.) 4. If pneumococcal vaccination status cannot be determined, administer the recommended vaccine (s) to the resident, according to the standards of clinical practice. If the resident has had a severe allergic reaction to a pneumococcal vaccine or its components, the vaccine should not be administered. If the resident has a moderate to severe acute illness, the vaccine should be administered after the illness. If the resident has a minor illness (e.g., a cold) check with the resident's physician before administering the vaccine. Coding Instructions O 0300A , Is the Resident's Pneumococcal Vaccination Up to Date? Code 0, n o: if the resident's pneumococcal vaccination status is not up to date or canno t be determined. Proceed to i tem O0300B , If P neumococcal vaccine not r eceived, state reason . Code 1, yes: if the resident's pneumococcal vaccination status is up to date. Skip to O0400, Therapies . Coding Instructions O 0300B , If Pneumococcal Vaccine N ot Received, State Reason If the resident has not received a pneumococcal vaccine, code the reason from the following list: Code 1, Not eligible : if the resident is not eligible du e to medical contraindications , including a life -threatening allergic reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine or any vaccine component(s) or a physician order not to immunize. Code 2, Offered and declined: resident or responsible party/legal guardian has been informed of what is being offered and chooses not to accept the pneumococcal vaccine. Code 3, Not offered: resident or responsible party/legal guardian not offered the pneumococcal vaccine. Coding Tips Specific guidance about pneumococcal vaccine recommendations and timing for adults can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/downloads/pneumo- vaccine- timing.pdf . \"Up to date\" in item O0300A means in accordance with current Advisory Committee on Immuni zation Practices (ACIP) recommendations. For up- to-date information on timing and intervals between vaccines, please refer to ACIP vaccine recommendations available at \u2014 https://www.cdc.g ov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html \u2014 http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip- recs/index.html CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -13 O0300: Pneumococcal Vaccine (cont.) \u2014 https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/vaccination.html If a resident has received one or more pneumococcal vaccination s and is indicated to get an additional pneumococcal vaccination but is not yet eligible for the next vaccination because the recommended time interval between vaccines has not lapsed , O0300A is coded 1, yes, indicating the resident's pneumococcal vaccination is up to date. Examples 1. Mr. L., who is 72 years old, received the PCV13 pne umococcal vaccine at his physician's office last year. He had previously been vaccinated with PPSV23 at age 66. Coding: O0300A would be coded 1, yes ; skip to O0400, Therapies . Rationale: Mr. L , who is over 65 years old has received the recommended PCV13 an d PPSV23 vaccines . 2. Mrs. B, who is 95 years old, has never received a pneumococcal vaccine. Her physician has an order stating that she is NOT to be immunized. Coding: O0300A would be coded 0, no ; and O0300B would be coded 1, not eligible . Rationale: Mrs. B. has never received the pneumococcal vaccine; therefore, her vaccine is not up to date. Her physician has written an order for her not to receive a pneumococcal vaccine, thus she is not eligible for the vaccine. 3. Mrs. A, who has congestive heart failure, received PPSV23 vaccine at age 62 when she was hospitalized for a broken hip. She is now 78 years old and was admitted to the nursing home one week ago for rehabilitation. She was offered and given PCV13 on admission. Coding: O0300A would be coded 1, yes ; skip to O0400, Therapies . Rationale: Mrs. A received PPSV23 before age 65 years because she has a chronic heart disease and received PCV13 at the facility because she is age 65 years or older. She should receive another dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year after PCV13 and 5 years after the last PPSV23 dose (i.e., Mrs. A should receive 1 dose of PPSV23 at age 79 years, but is currently up to date because she must wait at least 1 year since she received PCV13). 4. Mr. T. , who has a long history of smoking cigarett es, received the pneumococcal vaccine at age 62 when he was living in a congregate care community. He is now 6 4 years old and is being admitted to the nursing home for chemotherapy and respite care. He has not been offered any additional pneumococcal vaccines. Coding: O0300A would be coded 0, no ; and O0300B would be coded 3, Not offered . Rationale: Mr. T received 1 dose of PPSV23 vaccine prior to 65 years of age because he is a smoker. Because Mr. T is now immunocompromised, he should receive PCV13 for this indication. He will also need 1 dose of PPSV23 8 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years after his last dose of PPSV23 (i.e., Mr. T is eligible to receive PCV13 now and 1 dose of PPSV23 at age 67).

Item Ratio nale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining as much independence as possible in activities of daily living , mobility , and communication is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems , and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and duration of, the therapy services provided to residents. Rehabilitation ( i.e., via Speech -Language Pathology Services and Occupational and Physical T herap ies) and respiratory, psychological, and recreational therapy can help residents to attain or maintain their highest level of well- being and improve their quality of life.

Coding Tips and Special Populations Therapy Start D ate: 1. Look at the date at A1600. 2. Determine whether the resident has had skilled rehabilitation therapy at any time from that date to the present date. 3. If so, enter the date that the therapy regimen started; if there was more than one therapy regimen since the A1600 date, enter the start date of the most recent therapy regimen. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -18 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Psychological Therapy is provided by any licensed mental health professional, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and clinical nurse specialists in mental health as allowable under applicable state laws. Psychiatric technicians are not considered to be licensed mental health professionals and their services may not be counted in this item. Minutes of Therapy Includes only therapies that were provided once the individual is actually living/being cared for at the long -term care facility. Do NOT include therapies that occurred while the person was an inpatient at a hospital or recuperative/rehabilitation center or other long - term care facility, or a recipient of home care or community -based services. If a resident returns from a hospital stay, an initial evaluation must be performed after entry to the facility, and only those therapies that occurred since admission/reentry to the facility and after the initial evaluation shall be counted. The therapist's time spent on documentation or on initial evaluation is not included. The therapist's time spent on subsequent reev aluations, conducted as part of the treatment process, should be counted. Family education when the resident is present is counted and must be documented in the resident's record. Only skilled therapy time (i.e., requires the skills, knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist and all the requirements for skilled therapy are met) shall be recorded on the MDS. In some instances, the time during which a resident received a treatment modality includes partly skilled and partly unskilled time; only time tha t is skilled may be recorded on the MDS. Therapist time during a portion of a treatment that is non- skilled; during a non-therapeutic rest period; or during a treatment that does not meet the therapy mode definitions may not be included. The time required to adjust equipment or otherwise prepare the treatment area for skilled rehabilitation service is the set -up time and is to be included in the count of minutes of therapy delivered to the resident. Set -up may be performed by the therapist, therapy assistan t, or therapy aide. Respiratory therapy \u2014only minutes that the respiratory therapist or respiratory nurse spends with the resident shall be recorded on the MDS. This time includes resident evaluation/assessment, treatment administration and monitoring , and set up and removal of treatment equipment. Time that a resident self -administers a nebulizer treatment without supervision of the respiratory therapist or respiratory nurse is not included in the minutes recorded on the MDS. Do not include administration of meter ed-dose and/or dry powder inhalers in respiratory minutes . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items October 2019 Page O -19 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Set-up time shall be recorded under the mode for which the resident receives initial treatment when he/she receives more than one mode of therapy per visit. \u2014 Code as individual minutes when the resident receives only individual therapy or individual therapy followed by another mode(s); \u2014 Code as concurrent minutes when the resident receives only concurrent therapy or concurrent therapy followed by another mode(s); and \u2014 Code as group minutes when the resident receives only group therapy or group therapy followed by another mode(s). For Speech -Language Pathology Services (SLP) and Physical (PT) and Occupational Therapies (OT) include only skilled therapy services. Skilled therapy services must meet all of the following conditions (Refer to Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapters 8 and 15, for detailed requirements and policies): \u2014 for Part A, services must be ordered by a physician. For Part B the plan of care must be certified by a physician following the therapy evaluation; \u2014 the services must be directly and specifically related to an active written treatment plan that is approved by the physician after any needed consultation with the qualified therapist and is based on an initial evaluation performed by a qualified therapist prior to the start of therapy services in the facility; \u2014 the services must be of a level of complexity and sophistication, or the condition of the resident must be of a nature that requires the judgment, knowledge, and skills of a therapist; \u2014 the services must be provided with the expectation, based on the assessment of the resident's restoration potential made by the physician, that the condition of the patient will improve mate rially in a reasonable and generally predictable period of time; or, the services must be necessary for the establishment of a safe and effective maintenance program; or, the services must require the skills of a qualified therapist for the performance of a safe and effective maintenance program. \u2014 the services must be considered under accepted standards of medical practice to be specific and effective treatment for the resident's condition; and, \u2014 the services must be reasonable and necessary for the treatmen t of the resident's condition; this includes the requirement that the amount, frequency, and duration of the services must be reasonable, and they must be furnished by qualified personnel. Include services provided by a qualified occupational/physical the rapy assistant who is employed by (or under contract with) the long -term care facility only if he or she is under the direction of a qualified occupational/physical therapist. Medicare does not recognize speech -language pathology assistants; therefore, ser vices provided by these individuals are not to be coded on the MDS. For purposes of the MDS, when the payer for therapy services is not Medicare Part B, follow the definitions and coding for Medicare Part A. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -20 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Record the actual mi nutes of therapy. Do not round therapy minutes (e.g., reporting) to the nearest 5 th minute . The conversion of units to minutes or minutes to units is not appropriate. Please note that therapy logs are not an MDS requirement but reflect a standard clinical practice expected of all therapy professionals. These therapy logs may be used to verify the provision of therapy services in accordance with the plan of care and to validate information reported on the MDS assessment. When therapy is provided, s taff need to document the different modes of therapy and set up minutes that are being included on the MDS. It is important to keep records of time included for each. When submitting a part B claim, minutes reported on the MDS may not match the time report ed on a claim. For example, therapy aide set -up time is recorded on the MDS when it precedes skilled therapy; however, the therapy aide set -up time is not included for billing purposes on a therapy Part B claim. For purposes of the MDS, providers should re cord services for respiratory, psychological, and recreational therapies (Item O0400D, E, and F) when the following criteria are met: \u2014 the physician orders the therapy; \u2014 the physician's order includes a statement of frequency, duration, and scope of treatmen t; \u2014 the services must be directly and specifically related to an active written treatment plan that is based on an initial evaluation performed by qualified personnel (See Glossary in Appendix A for definitions of respiratory, psychological and recreational therapies); \u2014 the services are required and provided by qualified personnel (See Glossary in Appendix A for definitions of respiratory, psychological and recreational therapies); \u2014 the services must be reasonable and necessary for treatment of the resident's condition. Non-Skilled Services Services provided at the request of the resident or family that are not medically necessary (sometimes referred to as family -funded services) shall not be counted in i tem O0400 Therapies , even when performed by a therapist or an assistant . As noted above, therapy services can include the actual performance of a maintenance program in those instances where the skills of a qualified therapist are needed to accomplish this safely and effectively. However, w hen the performance o f a maintenance program does not require the skills of a therapist because it could be accomplished safely and effectively by the patient or with the assistance of non- therapists (including unskilled caregivers ), such services are not considered therapy services in this context . Sometimes a nursing home may nevertheless elect to have licensed professionals perform repetitive exercises and other maintenance treatments or to supervise aides performing these maintenance services even when the involvement of a qualified therapist is not medically necessary. In these situations, the services shall not be coded as therapy in item O0400 Minutes , since the specific interventions would be considered restorative nursing care when performed by nurses or aides. Servic es provided by therapists, licensed or not, that are not specifically listed in this manual or on the MDS item set shall not be coded as therapy in Item 0400. These services should be documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -21 O0400: Therapies (cont.) In sit uations where the ongoing performance of a safe and effective maintenance program does not require any skilled services, o nce the qualified therapist has designed the maintenance program and discharged the resident from a rehabilitation (i.e., skille d) therapy program, the services performed by the therapist and the assistant are not to be reported in item O0400A, B, or C Therapies . The services may be reported on the MDS assessment in i tem O0500 Restorative Nursing Care , provided the requirements for restorative nursing program are met. Services provided by therapy aides are not skilled services (see therapy aide section below). When a resident refuses to participate in therapy, it is important for care planning purposes to identify why the resident is refusing therapy. However, the time spent investigating the refusal or trying to persuade the resident to participate in treatment is not a skilled service and shall not be included in the therapy minutes. Co-treatment For Part A: When t wo clinicians (therapists or therapy assistants), each from a different discipline, treat one resident at the same time with different treatments, both disciplines may code the treatment session in full. All policies regarding mode, modalities and student supervision must be followed as well as all other federal, state, practice and facility policies. For example, if two therapists (from different disciplines) were conducting a group treatment session, the group must be comprised of two to six participants who were doing the same or similar activities in each discipline. The decision to co- treat should be made on a case by case basis and the need for co - treatment should be well documented for each patient . Because co -treatment is appropriate for specific cli nical circumstances and would not be suitable for all residents, its use should be limited. For Part B: Therapists, or therapy assistants, working together as a \"team\" to treat one or more patients cannot each bill separately for the same or different service provided at the same time to the same patient. CPT codes are used for billing the services of one therapist or therapy assistant. The therapist cannot bill for his/her services and those of another therapist or a therapy assistant, when both provide the same or different services, at the same time, to the same patient(s). Where a physical and occupational therapist both provide services to one patient at the same time, only one therapist can bill for the entire service or the PT and OT can divide the service units. For example, a PT and an OT work together for 30 minutes with one patient on transfer activities. The PT and OT could each bill one unit of 97530. Alternatively, the 2 units of 97530 could be billed by either the PT or the OT, but not both. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -22 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Similarly, if two therapy assistants provide services to the same patient at the same time, only the service of one therapy assistant can be billed by the supervising therapist o r the service units can be split between the two therapy assistants and billed by the supervising therapist(s). Therapy Aides and Students Therapy Aides Therapy Aides cannot provide skilled services. Only the time a therapy aide spends on set -up preceding skilled therapy may be coded on the MDS (e.g., set up the treatment area for wound therapy) and should be coded under the appropriate mode for the skilled therapy (individual, concurrent, or group) in O0400. The therapy aide must be under direct supervision of the therapist or assistant (i.e., the therapist/assistant must be in the facility and immediately available). Therapy Students Medicare Part A \u2014Therapy students are not required to be in line -of-sight of the professional supervising therapist /assistant ( Federal Register, August 8, 2011). Within individual facilities, supervising therapists/assistants must make the determination as to whether or not a student is ready to treat patients without line -of-sight supervision. Additionally all state a nd professional practice guidelines for student supervision must be followed. Time may be coded on the MDS when the therapist provides skilled services and direction to a student who is participating in the provision of therapy. All time that the student spends with patients should be documented. Medicare Part B\u2014The following criteria must be met in order for services provided by a student to be bi lled by the long -term car e facili ty: \u2014 The qualified professional is present and in the room for the entire session. The student participates in the delivery of services when the qualified practitioner is directing the service, making the skilled judgment, and is responsible for the assessment and treatment. \u2014 The practitioner is not engaged in treating another pa tient or doing other tasks at the same time. \u2014 The qualified professional is the person responsible for the services and, as such, signs all documentation. (A student may, of course, also sign but it is not necessary because the Part B payment is for the clinician's service, not for the student's services.) \u2014 Physical therapy assistants and occupational therapy assistants are not precluded from serving as clinical instructors for therapy assistant students while providing services within their scope of work and performed under the direction and supervision of a qualified physical or occupational therapist. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -23 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Modes of Therapy A resident may receive therapy via different modes during the same day or even treatment session. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately. The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether or not the resident is in a look back period for an MDS assessment). Individual Therapy The treatment of one resident at a time. The resident is recei ving the therapist's or the assistant's full attention. Treatment of a resident individually at intermittent times during the day is individual treatment, and the minutes of individual treatment are added for the daily count. For example, the speech -langua ge pathologist treats the resident individually during breakfast for 8 minutes and again at lunch for 13 minutes. The total of individual time for this day would be 21 minutes. When a therapy student is involved with the treatment of a resident, the minute s may be coded as individual therapy when only one resident is being treated by the therapy student and supervising therapist/assistant (Medicare A and Medicare B). The supervising therapist/assistant shall not be engaged in any other activity or treatment when the resident is receiving therapy under Medicare B. However, for those residents whose stay is covered under Medicare A, the supervising therapist/assistant shall not be treating or supervising other individuals and he/she is able to immediately intervene/assist the student as needed. Example: A speech therapy graduate student treats Mr. A for 30 minutes. Mr. A.'s therapy is covered under the Medicare Part A benefit. The supervising speech -language pathologist is not treating any patients at this time but is not in the room with the student or Mr. A. Mr. A.'s therapy may be coded as 30 minutes of individual therapy on the MDS. Concurrent Therapy Medicare Part A The treatment of 2 residents, who are not performing the same or similar activities, at the same time, regardless of payer source , both of whom must be in line-of- sight of the treating therapist or assistant. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -24 O0400: Therapies (cont.) When a therapy stude nt is involved with the treatment, and one of the following occurs, the minutes may be coded as concurrent therapy: The therapy student is treating one resident and the supervising therapist/assistant is treating another resident, and both residents are in line of sight of the therapist/assistant or student providing their therapy.; or The therapy student is treating 2 residents, regardless of payer source , both of whom are in line -of-sight of the therapy student, and the therapist is not treating any residents and not supervising other individuals; or The therapy student is not treating any residents and the supervising therapist/assistant is treating 2 res idents at the same time, regardless of payer source, bot h of whom are in line-of-sight. Medicare Part B The treatment of two or more residents who may or may not be performing the same or similar activity, regardless of payer source, at the same time is d ocumented as group treatment Examples: A physical t herapist provides therapies that are not the same or similar, to Mrs. Q and Mrs. R at the same time, for 30 minutes. Mrs. Q's stay is covered under the Medicare SNF PPS Part A benefit. Mrs. R. is paying pr ivately for therapy. Based on the information above, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mrs. Q. received concurrent therapy for 30 minutes. \u2014 Mrs. R received concurrent therapy for 30 minutes. A physical therapist provides therapies that are not the sam e or similar to Mrs. S. and Mr . T. at the same time, for 30 minutes. Mrs. S.'s stay is covered under the Medicare SNF PPS Part A benefit. Mr. T.'s therapy is covered under Medicare Part B. Based on the inform ation above, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mrs. S. received concurrent therapy for 30 minutes. \u2014 Mr. T. received group therapy (Medicare Part B definition) for 30 minutes. (Please refer to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, and the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 5, for coverage and billing requirements under the Medicare Part B benefit. ) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -25 O0400: Therapies (cont.) An Occupational Therapist provides therapy to Mr. K. for 60 minutes. An occupational therapy graduate student who is supervised by the occupational therapist, is treating Mr. R. at the same time for the same 60 minutes but Mr. K. and Mr. R. are not doing t he same or similar activities. Both Mr. K. and Mr. R's stays are covered under the Medicare Part A benefit. Based on the information above, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mr. K. received concurrent ther apy for 60 minutes. \u2014 Mr. R. received concurrent therapy for 60 minutes. Group Therapy Medicare Part A The treatment of two to six residents, regardless of payer source, who are performing the same or similar activities, and are supervised by a therapist or assistant who is not supervising any other individuals. When a therapy student is involved with group therapy treatment, and one of the following occurs, the minutes may be coded as group therapy: The therapy student is providing the group treatment and the supervising therapist/assistant is not treating any residents and is not supervising other individuals (students or residents); or The supervising therapist/assistant is providing the group treatment and the therapy student is not providing treatment to any resident. In this case, the student is simply assisting the supervising therapist. Medicare Part B The treatment of 2 or more individuals simultaneously, regardless of payer source, who may or may not be performing the same activity. When a therapy student is involved with group therapy treatment, and one of the following occurs, the minutes may be coded as group therapy: The therapy student is providing group treatment and the supervising therapist/assistant is not engaged in any other activity or t reatment; or The supervising therapist/assistant is providing group treatment and the therapy student is not providing treatment to any resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -26 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Examples: A Physical Therapist provides similar therapies to Mr. W, Mr. X, Mrs. Y . and Mr. Z. at the same time, for 30 minutes. Mr. W. and Mr. X.'s stays are covered under the Medicare SNF PPS Part A benefit. Mrs. Y .'s therapy is covered under Medicare Part B, and Mr. Z has private insurance paying for therapy. Based on the information a bove, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mr. W. received group therapy for 30 minutes. \u2014 Mr. X. received group therapy for 30 minutes. \u2014 Mrs. Y. received group therapy for 30 minutes. (Please refer to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual , Chapter 15, and the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 5, for coverage and billing requirements under the Medicare Part B benefit.) \u2014 Mr. Z . received group therapy for 30 minutes. Mrs. V , whose stay is covered by SNF PPS Part A benefit , begins therapy in an individual session. After 13 minutes the therapist begins working with Mr. S ., whose therapy is covered by Medicare Part B, while Mrs. V . continues with her skilled intervention and is in line -of-sight of the treating therapist. The therapist provides treatment during the same time period to Mrs. V . and Mr. S . for 24 minutes who are not performing the same or similar activities , at which time Mrs. V .'s therapy session ends. The therapist continues to treat Mr. S . individually for 10 minutes. Based on the information above, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mrs. V. received individual therapy for 13 minutes and concurrent therapy for 24. \u2014 Mr. S. received group therapy (Medicare Part B definition) for 24 minutes and individual therapy for 10 minutes. (Please refer to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual , Chapter 15, and the Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Chapter 5, for coverage and billing requirements under the Medicare P art B benefit.) Mr. A. and Mr. B., whose stays are covered by Medicare Part A, begin working with a physical therapist on two different therapy interventions. After 30 minutes, Mr. A. and Mr. B are joined by Mr. T. and Mr. E., whose stays are also covered by Medicare Part A., and the therapist begins working with all of them on the same therapy goals as part of a group session. After 15 minutes in this group session, Mr. A. becomes ill and is forced to leave the group, while the therapist continues working with the remaining group members for an additional 15 minutes. Based on the information above, the therapist would code each individual's MDS for this day of treatment as follows: \u2014 Mr. A . received concurrent therapy for 30 minutes and group therapy for 15 m inutes. \u2014 Mr. B. received concurrent therapy for 30 minutes and group therapy for 30 minutes. \u2014 Mr. T. received group therapy for 30 minutes. \u2014 Mr. E. received group therapy for 30 minutes . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -27 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Therapy Modalities Only skilled therapy time (i.e., require the skills, knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist and all the requirements for skilled therapy are met) shall be recorded on the MDS. In some instances, the time a resident receives certain modalities is partly skilled and partly u nskilled time; only the time that is skilled may be recorded on the MDS. For example, a resident is receiving TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) for pain management. The portion of the treatment that is skilled, such as proper electrode pla cement, establishing proper pulse frequency and duration, and determining appropriate stimulation mode, shall be recorded on the MDS. In other instances, some modalities only meet the requirements of skilled therapy in certain situations. For example, the application of a hot pack is often not a skilled intervention. However, when the resident's condition is complicated and the skills, knowledge, and judgment of the therapist are required for treatment, then those minutes associated with skilled therapy time may be recorded on the MDS. The use and rationale for all therapy modalities, whether skilled or unskilled should always be documented as part of the resid ent's plan of care. Dates of Therapy A resident may have more than one regimen of therapy treatment during an episode of a stay. When this situation occurs the Therapy Start Date for the most recent episode of treatment for the particular therapy (SLP, PT, or OT) should be coded. When a resident's episode of treatment for a given type of therapy extends beyond the ARD (i.e., therapy is ongoing), enter dashes in the appropriate Therapy End Date. Therapy is considered to be ongoing if: The resident was discharged and therapy was planned to continue had the resident remained in the facility, or The resident's SNF benefit exhausted and therapy continued to be provided, or The resident's payer source changed and therapy continued to be provided. For example, Mr. N. was admitted to the nursing home following a fall that resulted in a hip fracture i n November 2019. Occupational and Physical therapy started December 3, 2019. His physical therapy ended January 27, 2020 and occupational therapy ended January 29, 2020. Later on during his stay at the nursing home, due to the progressive nature of his Par kinson's disease, he was referred to SLP and OT February 10, 2020 (he remained in the facility the entire time). The speech -language pathologist evaluated him on that day and the occupational therapist evaluated him the next day. The ARD for Mr. N.'s MDS assessment is February 28, 2020. Coding values for his MDS are: O0400A5 (SLP start date) is 02102020, O0400A6 (SLP end date) is dash filled, O0400B5 (OT start date) is 02112020, O0400B6 (OT end date) is dash filled, O0400C5 (PT start date) is 12032019, and O0400C6 (PT end date) is 01272020. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -28 O0400: Therapies (cont.) General Coding Example: Following a stroke, Mrs. F. was admitted to the skilled nursing facility in stable condition for rehabilitation therapy on 10/06/ 19 under P art A skilled nursing facility coverage. She had slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, severe weakness in both her right upper and lower extremities, and a Stage 3 pressure ulcer on her left lateral malleolus. She was referred to SLP, OT, and PT with the long -term goal of returning home with her daughter and son- in-law. Her initial SLP evaluation was performed on 10/06/ 19, the PT initial evaluation on 10/07/ 19, and the OT initial evaluation on 10/09/ 19. She was also referred to recreational therapy and respiratory therapy. The interdisciplinary team determined that 10/13/1 9 was an appropriate ARD for her 5 -Day assessment . During the look- back period she received the following: Speech -language pathology services that were provided over the 7 -day look -back period: Individual dysphagia treatments; Monday -Friday for 30 minute sessions each day. Cognitive training; Monday and Thursday for 35 minute concurrent therapy sess ions and Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 25 minute group sessions . Individual speech techniques; Tuesday and Thursday for 20- minute sessions each day . Coding: O0400A 1 would be coded 190 ; O0400A2 would be coded 70 ; O0400A3 would be coded 75 ; O0400A4 would be coded 5 ; O0400A5 would be coded 10062019 ; and O0400A6 would be coded with dashes . Rationale: Individual minutes totaled 190 over the 7- day look- back period [(30 \u00d7 5) + (20 \u00d7 2) = 190]; concurrent minutes totaled 70 over the 7 -day look- back period (35 \u00d7 2 = 70); and group minutes totaled 75 over the 7- day look- back period (25 \u00d7 3 = 75). Therapy was provided 5 out of the 7 days of the look- back period. Date speech -language pathology services began was 10- 06-2019, and dashes were used as the therapy end date value because the therapy was ongoing. Occupational therapy services that were provided over the 7- day look- back period: Individual sitting balance activities; Monday and Wednesday for 30- minute co -treatment sessions with PT each day (OT and PT each code the session as 30 minutes for each discipline). Individual wheelchair seating and positioning; Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the following times: 23 minutes, 18 minutes, and 12 minutes. Balance/coordination activities; Tuesday -Friday for 20 minutes each day in group sessions. Coding: O0400B1 would be coded 113, O0400B2 would be coded 0 , O0400B3 would be coded 80 , O0400B3A would be coded 60, O0400B4 would be coded 5 , O0400B5 would be coded 1009201 9, and O0400B6 would be coded with dashes . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items October 2019 Page O -29 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Rationale: Individual minutes (including 60 co -treatment minutes) totaled 113 over the 7 -day look- back period [(30 \u00d7 2) + 23 + 18 + 12 = 113]; concurrent minutes totaled 0 over the 7- day look- back period (0 \u00d7 0 = 0); and group minutes totaled 80 over the 7 -day look- back period (20 \u00d7 4 = 80). Therapy was provided 5 out of the 7 days of the look- back period. Date occupational therapy services began was 10 -09-2019 and dashes were used as the therapy end date value because the therapy was ongoing. Physical therapy services that were provided over the 7 -day look- back period: Individual wound debridement followed by application of routine wound dressing; Monday the session lasted 22 minutes, 5 minutes of which were for the application of the dressing. On Thursday the session lasted 27 minutes, 6 minutes of which were for the application of the dressing. For each session the therapy aide spent 7 minutes preparing the debridement area (set -up time) for needed therapy supplies and equipment for the therapist to conduct wound debridement. Individual sitting balance activities; on Monday and Wednesday for 30- minute co - treatment sessions with OT (OT and PT each code the session as 30 minutes for each discipline). Individual bed positioning and bed mobility training; Monday -Friday for 35 minutes each day. Concurrent therapeutic exercises; Monday -Friday for 20 minutes each day. Coding: O0400C1 would be coded 28 7, O0400C2 would be coded 100 , O0400C3 would be coded 0 , O0400C3A would be coded 60 , O0400C4 would be coded 5 , O0400C5 would be coded 1007201 9, and O0400C6 would be coded with dashes . Rationale: Individual minutes (including 60 co -treatment minutes) totaled 287 over the 7 -day look- back period [(30 \u00d7 2) + (35 \u00d7 5) + (22 - 5) + 7 + (27 - 6) + 7 = 287]; concurrent minutes totaled 100 over the 7- day look- back period (20 \u00d7 5 = 100); and group minutes totaled 0 over the 7- day look- back period (0 \u00d7 0 = 0). Therapy was provided 5 out of the 7 days of the look- back period. Date physical therapy services began was 10- 07-2019 , and dashes were used as the therapy end date value because the therapy was ongoing. Respiratory therapy services that were provided over the 7 -day look- back period: Respiratory therapy services; Sunday -Thursday for 10 minutes each day. Coding: O0400D1 would be coded 50 , O0400D2 would be coded 0 . Rationale: Total minutes were 50 over the 7- day look- back period (10 \u00d7 5 = 50). Although a total of 50 minutes of respiratory therapy service s were provided over the 7- day look -back period, there were not any days that respiratory therapy was provided for 15 minutes or more. Therefore, O0400D equals zero days . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -30 O0400: Therapies (cont.) Psychological therapy services that were provided over th e 7-day look- back period: Psychological therapy services were not provided at all over the 7- day look -back period. Coding: O0400E1 would be coded 0, O0400E2 would be left blank . Rationale: There were no minutes or days of psychological therapy services provided over the 7- day look- back period. Recreational therapy services that were provided over the 7 -day look- back period: Recreational therapy services; Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday for 3 0-minute sessions each day. Coding: O0400F1 would be coded 90 , O0400F2 would be coded 3 . Rationale: Total minutes were 90 over the 7- day look- back period (30 \u00d7 3 = 90). Sessions provided were longer than 15 minutes each day, therefore each day recreation al therapy was performed can be counted. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -31 O0400: Therapies (cont.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items October 2019 Page O -32 O0400: Therapies (cont.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -33 O0420: Distinct Calendar Days of Therap y Item Rationale To record the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes in the past 7 days. Coding Instructions: Enter the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Thera py, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes in the past 7 days. If a resident receives more than one therapy discipline on a given calendar day, this may only count for one calendar day for purposes of coding Item O0420. Consider the following examples : Example 1: Mrs. T. received 60 minutes of physical therapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday within the 7 -day look- back period. Mrs. T also received 45 minutes of occupational therapy on Monday, Tuesday and Friday during the 7 -day look- back period. Given t he therapy services received by Mrs. T during the 7 -day look- back period, item O0420 would be coded as 4 because therapy services were provided for at least 15 minutes on 4 distinct calendar days during the 7 -day look- back period (i.e., Monday, Tuesday, We dnesday, and Friday). Example 2: Mr. F. received 120 minutes of physical therapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday within the 7 -day look- back period. Mr. F also received 90 minutes of occupational therapy on Monday, Wednesday and Friday during the 7- day look- back period. Finally, Mr. F received 60 minutes of speech -language pathology services on Monday and Friday during the 7 -day look- back period. Given the therapy services received by Mr. F during the 7 -day look- back period, item O0420 would be coded as 3 because therapy services were provided for at least 15 minutes on 3 distinct calendar days during the 7- day look- back period (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -34 O0425: Part A Therapies Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining as much independence as possible in activities of daily living, mobility, and communication is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and dur ation of, the therapy services provided to residents. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -35 O0425: Part A Therapies (cont.) Rehabilitation (i.e., via Speech- Language Pathology Services and Occupational and Physical Therapies) and respiratory, psychological, and recreational therapy can help residents to attain or maintain their highest level of well -being and improve their qual ity of life. Planning for Care Code only medically necessary therapies that occurred after admission/readmission to the nursing home that were (1) ordered by a physician (physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and/or clinical nurse specialist as allow able under state licensure laws ) based on a qualified therapist's assessment (i.e., one who meets Medicare requirements or, in some instances, under such a person's direct supervision) and treatment plan, (2) documented in the resident's medical record, and (3) care planned and periodically evaluated to ensure that the resident receives needed therapies and that current treatment plans are effective. Therapy treatment may occur either inside or outside of the facility. For definitions of the types of therapies listed in this section, please refer to the Glossary in Appendix A. Steps for Assessment 1. Complete only if A0310H (Is this a SNF Part A PPS Discharge Assessment?) = 1, Yes. 2. Review the resident's medical record (e.g., rehabilitation therapy evaluation and treatment records, recreation therapy notes, mental health professional progress notes), and consult with each of the qualified care providers to collect the information required for this item. NOTE: The look back for these items is the entire SNF Part A stay, starting at Day 1 of the Part A stay and finishing on the last day of the Part A stay. Once reported on the MDS, CMS grouping software will calculate the percentage of g roup and concurrent therapy, combined, provided to each resident as a percentage of all therapies provided to that resident, by discipline. If the combined amount of group and concurrent therapy provided, by discipline, exceeds 25 percent, then this would be deemed as non-compliance and a warning message would be received on the Final Validation Report. Providers should follow the steps outlined below for calculating compliance with the concurrent/group therapy limit : Step 1: Total Therapy Minutes, by disci pline (O0425X1 + O0425X2 + O0425X3) Step 2: Total Concurrent and Group Therapy Minutes, by discipline (O0425X2+O0425X3) Step 3: Concurrent/Group Ratio (Step 2 result/Step 1 result) Step 4: If Step 3 result is greater than 0.25, then the provider is non- compliant.

Coding Tips and Special Populations For detailed descriptions of how to code minutes of therapy and explanation of skilled versus nonskilled therapy services, co -treatment, therapy aides and students, please refer to these topic headings in the discussion of item O0400 above. Modes of Therapy A resident may receive th erapy via different modes during the same day or even treatment session. These modes are individual, concurrent and group therapy. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately . The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether or not the resident is in a look -back period for an MDS assessment).

General Coding Example: Following a bilateral knee replacement, Mrs. G. was admitted to the skilled nursing facility in stable condition for rehabilitation therapy on Sunday 10/06/19 under Part A skilled nursing facility coverage. While in the hos pital, she exhibited some short -term memory difficulties specifically affecting orientation. She was non- weig ht bearing, had reduced range of motion, and had difficulty with ADLs. She was referred to SLP, OT, and PT with the long- term goal of returning home with her husband. Her initial SLP evaluation was performed on 10/06/19, and the OT and PT initial evaluatio ns were done on 10/07/19. She was also referred to recreational therapy. She was in the SNF for 14 days and was discharged home on 10/19/2019. Mrs. G received the following rehabilitation services during her stay in the SNF. Speech -language pathology services that w ere provided over the SNF stay: Individual cognitive training; six sessions f or 45 minute s each day . Discharged from SLP services on 10/14/2019. Coding: O0425A1 would be coded 270 ; O0425A2 would be coded 0 ; O0425A3 would be coded 0 ; O0425A4 would be coded 0 ; O0425A5 would be coded 6 . Rationale: Individual minutes totaled 270 over the stay (45 minutes \u00d7 6 days) ; concurrent minutes totaled 0 over the stay (0 \u00d7 0 = 0); and group minutes totaled 0 over the stay (0 \u00d7 0 = 0). Therapy was provided 6 days of the stay . Occupational therapy services that were provided over the SNF stay: Individual ADL activities daily for 30 minutes each starting 10/ 08/19. Co-treatment: seating and transferring with PT; three sessions for the following times: 23 minut es, 18 minutes, and 12 minutes. Balance/coordination activities : 10 sessi ons for 20 minutes each session in a group. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -39 O0425: Part A Therapies (cont.) Discharged from OT services 10/19/19. Coding: O0425B1 would be coded 413 , O0425B2 would 0 , O0425B3 would be coded 200 , O0425B4 would be coded 53 , O0425B5 would be coded 12 . Rationale: Individual minutes (including 53 co- treatment minutes) totaled 413 over the stay [(30 \u00d7 12) + 53 = 413]; concurrent minutes totaled 0 over the stay (0 \u00d7 0 = 0); and group minutes totaled 200 over the stay (20 \u00d7 10 = 200). Therapy was provided 12 days of the stay. Physical therapy services that were provided over the stay: Individual mobility training daily for 45 minutes per session starting 10/ 07/19. Group mobility training for 30 minutes T uesdays, Wednesday s, and Fridays. Co-treatment seating and transferring for three sessions with OT for 7 minutes, 22 minutes , and 18 minutes. Concurre nt therapeutic exercises Monday -Friday for 20 minutes each day. Discharged from PT services on 10/19/19. Coding: O0425C1 would be coded 632 , O0425C2 would be coded 200 , O0425C3 would be coded 180 , O0425C4 would be coded 47 , O0425C5 would be coded 13 . Rationale: Individual minutes (including 47 co- treatment minutes) totaled 632 over stay [(45 \u00d7 13) + (7 + 22 + 18) = 632]; concurrent minutes totaled 200 over the stay (20 \u00d7 10 = 200); and group minutes totaled 180 over the stay (30 \u00d7 6 = 180). Therapy was provided 13 days of the stay. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -40 O0430: Distinct Calendar Days of Part A T herapy Item Rationale To record the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech- Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes during the Part A SNF stay. Coding Instructions: Enter the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech- Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes during the SNF Part A stay (i.e., from the date in A2400B through the date in A 2400C). If a resident receives more than one therapy discipline on a given calendar day, this may only count for one calendar day for purposes of coding i tem O0430. Consider the following example: Example: Mrs. T was admitted to the SNF on Sunday 10/ 06/18 and discharged on Saturday 10/26/18. She received 60 minutes of physical therapy every Monday, Wednesday , and Friday during the SNF stay. Mrs. T also received 45 minutes of occupational the rapy every Monday, Tuesday , and Friday during the stay. Given the t herapy services received by Mrs. T during the stay, item O0430 would be coded as 12 because therapy services were provided for at least 15 minutes on 12 distinct calendar days during the stay (i.e., every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -41 O0450: Resumption of Therapy CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. Item Rationale In cases where therapy resumes after the EOT OMRA is performed and the resumption of therapy date is no more than 5 consecutive calendar days after the last day of therapy provided, and the therapy services have resumed at the same RUG -IV classification level that had been in effect pr ior to the EOT OMRA, an End of Therapy OMRA with Resumption (EOT -R) may be completed. The EOT -R reduces the number of assessments that need to be completed and reduces the number of interview items residents must answer. Coding Instructions: When an EOT OM RA has been performed, determine whether therapy will resume. If it will, determine whether therapy will resume no more than five consecutive calendar days after the last day of therapy was provided AND whether the therapy services will resume at the same level for each discipline. If No, skip to O0500, Restorative Nursing Programs. If Yes, code item O0450A as 1. For example: Mrs. A. who was in RVL did not receive therapy on Saturday and Sunday because the facility did not provide weekend services and she m issed therapy on Monday because of a doctor's appointment. She resumed therapy on Tuesday, November 13, 2011. The IDT determined that her RUG -IV therapy classification level did not change as she had not had any significant clinical changes during the laps ed therapy days. When the EOT was filled out, item O0450 A was coded as 1 because therapy was resuming within 5 days from the last day of therapy and it was resuming at the same RUG -IV classification level. NOTE: If the EOT OMRA has not been accepted in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System ( QIES ) Assessment Submission and Processing ( ASAP ) system when therapy resumes, code the EOT -R item (O0450A) on the assessment and submit the record. If the EOT OM RA without the EOT -R item ha s been accepted into the QIES ASAP system, then submit a modification request for that EOT OMRA with the only changes being the completion of the Resumption of Therapy item (O0450A) and check X0900Z and indicate that the reason for modification is the addition of the Resumption of Therapy item . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -42 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining independence in activities of daily living and mobility is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries . Planning for Care Restorative nursing program refers to nursing interventions that promote the resident's ability to adapt and adjust to living as independently and safely as possible. This concept actively focuses on achieving and maintaining optimal physical, mental, and psychosocial functioning. A resident may be started on a restorative nur sing program when he or she is admitted to the facility with restorative needs, but is not a candidate for formalized rehabilitation therapy, or when restorative needs arise during the course of a longer -term stay, or in conjunction with formalized rehabil itation therapy. Generally, restorative nursing programs are initiated when a resident is discharged from formalized physical, occupational, or speech rehabilitation therapy. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -43 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the restorative nursing program notes and/or flow sheets in the medical record. 2. For the 7- day look- back period, enter the number of days on which the technique, training or skill practice was performed for a total of at least 15 minutes during the 24 -hour period. 3. The following criteria for restorative nursing programs must be met in order to code O0500: Measureable objective and interventions must be documented in the care plan and in the medical record. If a restorative nursing program is in place when a care plan is being revised, it is appropriate to reassess progress, goals, and duration/frequency as part of the care planning process. Good clinical practice would indicate that the results of this reassessment should be documented in the resident' s medical record. Evidence of periodic evaluation by the licensed nurse must be present in the resident's medical record. When not contraindicated by state practice act provisions, a progress note written by the restorative aide and countersigned by a lice nsed nurse is sufficient to document the restorative nursing program once the purpose and objectives of treatment have been established. Nursing assistants/aides must be trained in the techniques that promote resident involvement in the activity. A regist ered nurse or a licensed practical (vocational) nurse must supervise the activities in a restorative nursing program. Sometimes, under licensed nurse supervision, other staff and volunteers will be assigned to work with specific residents. Restorative nurs ing does not require a physician's order. Nursing homes may elect to have licensed rehabilitation professionals perform repetitive exercises and other maintenance treatments or to supervise aides performing these maintenance services. In situations where s uch services do not actually require the involvement of a qualified therapist, the services may not be coded as therapy in item O0400, Therapies or O0425, Part A Therapies , because the specific interventions are considered restorative nursing services (see item O0400, Therapies and O0425, Part A Therapies ). The therapist's time actually providing the maintenance service can be included when counting restorative nursing minutes. Although therapists may participate, members of the nursing staff are still resp onsible for overall coordination and supervision of restorative nursing programs. This category does not include groups with more than four residents per supervising helper or caregiver. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -44 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Coding Instructions This item does not include procedures or techniques carried out by or under the direction of qualified therapists , as identified in Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services i tem O0400A or O0425A , Occupational Therapy item O0400B or and Physical Therapy item O0400C or . The time provided for i tems O0500A -J must be coded separately, in time blocks of 15 minutes or more . For example, to check Technique \u2014Range of Motion [Passive] item O0500A, 15 or more minutes of passive range of motio n (PROM) must have been provided during a 24- hour period in the last 7 days. The 15 minutes of time in a day may be totaled across 24 hours (e.g., 10 minutes on the day shift plus 5 minutes on the evening shift). However, 15- minute time increments cannot b e obtained by combining 5 minutes of Technique \u2014Range of Motion [Passive] item O0500A, 5 minutes of Technique \u2014 Range of Motion [Active] item O0500B, and 5 minutes of Splint or Brace Assistance item O0500C , over 2 days in the last 7 days. Review for each activity throughout the 24- hour period. Enter 0 , if none. Technique Activities provide d by restorative nursing staff. O0500A, Range of Motion (Passive) Code provision of passive movements in order to maintain flexibility and useful motion in the joints of the body. These exercises must be individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500B, Range of Motion (Active) Code exercises performed by the resident, with cu eing, supervision, or physical assist by staff that are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. Include active ROM and active- assisted ROM. O0500C, Splint or Brace Assistance Code provision of ( 1) verbal and physical guidance and direction that teaches the resident how to apply, manipulate , and care for a brace or splint ; or (2) a scheduled program of applying and removing a splint or brace. These sessions are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -45 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Training and Skill Practice Activities including repetition, physical or verbal cueing, an d/or task segmentation provided by any staff member under the supervision of a licensed nurse . O0500D, Bed Mobility Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in moving to and from a lying position, turning side to side and positioning him self or herself in bed. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500E, Transfer Code activities provided to improve or maintain the re sident's self -performance in moving between surfaces or planes either with or without assistive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500F, Walking Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in walking , with or without assistive devices . These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500G, Dressing and/or Grooming Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in dressing and undressing, bathing and washing, and performing other personal hygiene tasks. These activities are individu alized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500H, Eating and/or Swallowing Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in feeding oneself food and fluids, or activities used to improve or maintain the resident's ability to ingest nutrition and hydration by mouth. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500I, Amputation/ Prosthesis Care Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in putting on and removing a prosthesis, caring for the prosthesis , and providing appropriate hygiene at the site where the prosthesis attaches to the body (e.g., leg stump or eye socket). Dentures are not considered to be prostheses for coding this item. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -46 O0500: Res torative Nursing Programs (cont.) O0500J, Communication Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self -performance in functional communication skills or assisting the resident in using residual communication skills and adaptive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. Coding Tips and Special Populations For range of m otion (passive): the careg iver moves the body part around a fixed point or joint through the resident's available range of motion. The resident provides no assistance. For r ange of m otion ( active): a ny participation by the resident in the ROM activity should be coded here. For both a ctive and passive r ange of motion: movement by a resident that is incidental to dressing, bathing, etc., does not count as part of a formal restorative nursing program. For inclusion in this section, active or passive range of motion must be a component of an individualized program that is planned, monitored evaluat ed, and documented in the resident's medical record. Range of motion should be delivered by staff who are trained in the procedures. For splint or brace a ssistance: a ssess the resident' s skin and circulation under the device, and reposition the limb in correct alignment. The use of c ontinuous passive m otion (CPM) devices in a restorative nursing program is coded when the following criteria are met: ( 1) ordered by a physician, ( 2) nursing staff have been trained in technique (e.g., properly aligning resident's limb in device, adjusting available range of motion), and ( 3) monitoring of the device. Nursing staff should document the application of the device and the effects on the resident. D o not include the time the resident is receiving treatment in the device. Include only the actual time staff were engaged in apply ing and monitoring the device. Remember that persons with dementia learn skills best through repetition that occurs multiple times per day. Grooming programs, including programs to help residents learn to apply make -up, may be considered restorative nursing programs when conducted by a member of the activity staff. These grooming programs would need to be individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -47 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) Examples 1. Mr. V. has lost range of motion in his right arm, wrist, and hand due to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA ) experienced several years ago. He has moderate to severe loss of cognitive decision -making skills and memory. To avoid further ROM loss and contractures to his right arm, the occupational therapist fabricated a right resting hand splint and instructions for its application and removal. The nursing coordinator developed instructions for providing passive range of motion exercises to his right arm, wrist, and hand three times per day. The nurse's aides and Mr. V.'s wife have been instructed in how and when to apply and remove the hand splint and how to do the passive ROM exercises. These plans are documented in Mr. V.'s care plan. The total amount of time involved each day in removing and applying the hand splint and completing the ROM exercises is 30 minute s (15 minutes to perform ROM exercises and 15 minutes to apply/remove the splint). The nurs e's aides report that there is less resistance in Mr. V.'s affected extremity when bathing and dressing him. Coding: Both Splint or Brace Assistance item ( O0500C ), and Range of Motion (Passive) item ( O0500A ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days these re storative nursing techniques were provided. 2. Mrs. R.'s right shoulder ROM has decreased slightly over the past week. Upon examination and X -ray, her physician diagnosed her with right shoulder impingement syndrome. Mrs. R . was given exercises to perform on a daily basis to help improve her right shoulder ROM. After initial training in these exercises by the physical therapist, Mrs. R . and the nursing staff were provided with instructions on how to cue and sometimes actively assist Mrs. R . when she cannot make the full ROM required by the exercises on her own. Her exercises are to be performed for 15 minutes , two times per day at change of shift in the morning and afternoon. This information is documented in Mrs. R .'s medical record. The nursing staff cued and sometimes actively assisted Mrs. R . two times daily over the past 7 days. Coding: Range of motion (active ) item ( O0500B ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days restorative nursing t raining and skill practice for a ctive ROM were provided. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -48 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) 3. Mrs. K . was admitted to the nursing facility 7 days ago following repair to a fractured hip. Physical therapy was delayed due to complications and a weakened condition. Upon admission, she had difficulty moving herself in bed and required total assistance for transfers. To prevent further deterioration and increase her independence, the nursing staff implemented a plan on the second day following admission to teach her how to move herself in bed and transfer from bed to chair using a trapeze, the bed rails, and a transfer board. The plan was documented in Mrs. K .'s medical record and communicated to all staff at the change of shift. The charge nurse documented in the nurse 's notes that in the 5 days Mrs. K . has been receiving training and skill practice for bed mobility for 20 minutes a day and transferr ing for 25 minutes a day , her endurance and strength have improved , and she requires only extensive assistance for t ransferring. Each day the amount of time to provide this nursing re storative intervention has been decreasing , so that for the past 5 days, the average time is 45 minutes. Coding: Both Bed Mobility item ( O0500D ), Transfer O0500E ), would 5 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days that restorative nursing training and skill practice for bed mobility and transfer w ere provided. 4. Mrs. D. is receiving training and skill practice in walking using a quad cane. Together, Mrs. D. and the nursing staff have set progressive walking distance goals. The nursing staff has received instruction on how to provide Mrs. D . with the ins truction and guidance she needs to achieve the goals. She has three scheduled times each day where she learns how to walk with her quad cane. Each teaching and practice episode for walking, supervised by a nursing assistant, takes approximately 15 minutes. Coding: Walking item ( O0500F ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days that restorative nursing skill a nd practice training for walking was provided. 5. Mrs. J . had a CV A less than a year ago resulting in left -sided hemiplegia. Mrs. J . has a strong desire to participate in her own care. Although she cannot dress herself independently, she is capable of participating in this activity of daily living. Mrs. J .'s ove rall care plan goal is to maximize her independence in ADLs. A plan, documented on the care plan, has been developed to assist Mrs. J . in how to maintain the ability to put on and take off her blouse with no physical assistance from the staff. All of her b louses have been adapted for front closure with hook and loop fasteners . The nursing assistants have been instructed in how to verbally guide Mrs. J . as she puts on and takes off her blouse to enhance her efficiency and maintain her level of function . It takes approximately 20 minutes per day for Mrs. J . to complete this task (dressing and undressing). Coding: Dressing or G rooming item ( O0500G ), would be coded 7 . Rationale: Because this was the number of days that restorative nursing training and skill practice for dressing and grooming w ere provided. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -49 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs (cont.) 6. Mr. W .'s cognitive status has been deteriorating progressively over the past several months. Despite deliberate nursing restoration attempts to promote his independence in feeding himself, he will not eat unless he is fed. Coding: Eating and/or Swallowing item ( O0500H ), would be coded 0 . Rationale: Because restorative nursing skill and practice training for eating and/or swallowing were not provided over the last 7 days. 7. Mrs. E. has A myotrophic Lateral S clerosis. She no longer has the ability to speak or even to nod her head \"yes\" or \"no.\" Her cognitive skills remain intact, she can spell, and she can move her eyes in all directions. The speech -language pathol ogist taught both Mrs. E . and the nursing staff to use a communication board so that Mrs. E . could communicate with staff. The communication board has been in use over the past 2 weeks and has proven very successful. The nursing staff, volunteers , and fami ly members are reminded by a sign over Mrs. E .'s bed that they are to provide her with the board to enable her to communicate with them. This is also documented in Mrs. E .'s care plan. Because the teaching and practice using the communication board had bee n completed 2 weeks ago and Mrs. E . is able to use the board to communicate successfully, she no longer receives skill and practice training in communication. Coding: Communication item ( O0500J ), would be coded 0 . Rationale: Because the resident has mastered the skill of communication , restorative nursing skill and practice training for communication was no longer needed or provided over the last 7 days. O0600: Physician Examinations CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Health status that requires frequent physician examinations can adversely af fect an individual's sense of well -being and functional status and can limit social activities. Planning for Care Frequency of physician examinations can be an indication of medical complexity and stability of the resident's health status. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -50 O0600: Physician Examinations (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the physician progress notes for evidence of examinations of the resident by the physician o r other authorized practitioners. Coding Instructions Record the number of days that physician progress notes reflect that a physician examined the resident (or since admis sion if less than 14 days ago). If the State does not require the completion of this item, use the standard \"no information\" code (a dash, \" -\"). Coding Tips and Special Populations Includes medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, podiatrists, dentists , and authorized physician assistants, nurse practitioners , or clinical nurse specialists working in collaboration with the physician as allowable by state law . Examin ation (partial or full) can occur in the facility or in the physician's office. Included in this item are telehealth visits as long as the requirements are met for physician/practitioner type as defined above and whether it qualifies as a telehealth billab le visit. For eligibility requirements and additional information about Medicare telehealth services refer to: \u2014 Chapter 15 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (Pub. 100- 2) and Chapter 12 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual (Pub. 100- 4) may be access ed at: http://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet -Only - Manuals -IOMs.html . Do not include physician examinations that occurred prior to admission or readmission to the facility (e.g., during the resident's acute care stay ). Do not include physician examinations that occurred during an emergency room visit or hospital observation stay. If a resident is evaluated by a physician off -site (e.g., while undergoing dialysis or radiation therapy), it can be coded as a physician examination as long as documentation of the physician's evaluation is included in the medical record. The physic ian's evaluation can include partial or complete examination of the resident, monitoring the resident for response to the treatment, or adjusting the treatment as a result of the examination. Psychological therapy visits by a licensed psychologist (PhD) should be recorded in O0400E, Psychological Therapy, and should not be included as a physician visit in this section. Does not include visits made by Medicine Men. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -51 O0700: Physician Orders CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Health status that requires frequent physician order changes can adversely affect an individual's sense of well -being and functional status and can limit social activities. Planning for Care Frequency of physician order changes can be an indication of medical complexity and stabilit y of the resident's health status. Steps for Assessment 1. Review the physician or der sheets in the medical record. 2. Determine the number of days during the 14 -day look -back period that a physici an or other authorized practitioner allowable by State law change d the resident's orders. Coding Instructions Enter the number of days during 14- day look- back period (or since admission, if less than 14 days ago) in which a physician changed the resident's orders. If the State does not require the completion of this ite m, use the standard \"no information\" code (a dash, \" -\"). Coding Tips and Special Populations Includes orders written by medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, podiatrists, dentists , and physician assistants, nurse practitioners , clinical nurse specialists , qualified dietitians, clinically qualified nutrition professionals or qualified therapists, working in collaboration with the physician as allowable by state law . Includes written, telephone, fax, or consultation orders for new or altered treatment. Does not include standard admission orders, return admission orders, renewal orders, or clarifying orders without changes. Orders written on the day of admission as a result for an unexpected change/deterioration in condition or injury are considered as new or altered treatment orders and should be counted as a day with order changes. The prohibition against counting standard admission or readmission orders applies regardless of whether or not the orders are given at one time or are received at different times on the date of admission or readmission. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [O] October 2019 Page O -52 O0700: Physician Orders (cont.) Do not count orders prior to the date of admission or re -entry. A sliding scale dosage schedule that is written to cover different dosages depending on lab values, does not count as an order change simply because a different dose is administered based on the sliding scale guidelines. When a PRN (as needed) order was already on file, the potential need for the service had already been identified. Notification of the physician that the PRN order was activated does not constitute a new or changed order and may not be counted when coding this item. A Medicare Certification/Recertification is a renewal of an existing order and should not be included when coding this item. If a resident has multiple physicians (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, internal medicine), and they all visit and write orders on the same day, the MDS must be coded as 1 day during which a physician visited, and 1 day in which orders were changed. Orders requesting a consultation by another physician may be counted. However, the order must be reasonable (e.g., f or a new or altered treatment). An order written on the last day of the MDS observation period for a consultation planned 3- 6 months in the futur e should be carefully reviewed. Orders written to increase the resident's RUG classification and facility payment are not acceptable. Orders for transfer of care to another physician may not be counted. Do not count orders written by a pharmacist. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-1 SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Intent: The intent of this section is to record the frequency that the resident was restrained by any of the listed devices or an alarm was used, at any time during the day or night, during the 7- day look-back period. Assessors will evaluate whether or not a devic e meets the definition of a physical restraint or an alarm and code only the devices that meet the definitions in the appropriate categories. Are Restraints Prohibited by CMS? CMS is committed to reducing unnecessary physical restraints in nursing homes an d ensuring that residents are free of physical restraints unless deemed necessary and appropriate as permitted by regulation. Proper interpretation of the physical restraint definition is necessary to understand if nursing homes are accurately assessing manual methods or physical or mechanical devices, materials or equipment as physical restraints and meeting the federal requirement for restraint use (see Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. [2007, June 22]. Memorandum to State Survey Agency Directors from CMS Director, Survey and Certification Group: Clarification of Terms Used in the Definition of Physical Restraints as Applied to the Requirements for Long Term Care Facilities. Retrieved December 18, 2012, from http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment- and- Certification/SurveyCertificationGenInfo/downloads/SCLetter07 -22.pdf ). Federal regulations and CMS guidelines do not prohibit use of physical restraints in nursing homes, except when they are imposed for discipline or convenience and are not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. The regulation specifically states, \"The resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for the purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms\" (42 CFR 483.10(e)(1) and 483.12) . Research and standards of practice show that physical restraints have many negative side effects and risks that far outweigh any benefit from their use. Prior to using any physical restraint, the nursing home must assess the resident to properly identify the resident's needs and the medical symptom(s) that the restraint is being employed to address. If a physical restraint is needed to treat the resident's medical symptom, the nursing home is responsible for assessing the appropriateness of that restraint. When the decision is made to use a physical restraint, CMS encourages, to the extent possible, gradual restraint reduction because there are many negative outcomes associated with restraint use. While a restraint -free environment is not a federal requirement, t he use of physical restraints should be the exception, not the rule. DEFINITION PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS Any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment attached or adjacent to the resident's body that the individual cannot remove easily, which restricts freedom of movement or normal access to one's body (State Operations Manual, Appendix PP). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-2 P0100: Physical Restraints Item Rationale Health -related Quality of Life Although the requirements describe the narrow instances when physical restraints may be used, growing evidence supports that physical restraints have a limited role in medical care. Physical r estraints limit mobility and increase the risk for a number of adverse outcomes, such as functional decline, agitation, diminished sense of dignity, depression, and pressure ulcers. Residents who are cognitively impaired are at a higher risk of entrapment and injury or death caused by physical restraints. It is vital that physical restraints used on this population be carefully considered and monitored. In many cases, the risk of using the physical restraint may be greater than the risk of it not being us ed. The risk of restraint -related injury and death is significant when physical restraints are used. Planning for Care When the use of physical restraints is considered , thorough assessment of problems to be addressed by restraint use is necessary to determine reversible causes and contributing factors and to identify alternative methods of treating non- reversible issues. When the interdisciplinary team determines that the use of physical restraints is the appropriate course of action, and there is a signed physician order that gives the medical symptom supporting the use of the restraint, the least restrictive manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment that will meet the resident's needs must be selected. Care planning must focus on preventing the adverse effects of physical restraint use. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-3 P0100: Physical Restraints (cont.) Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record (e.g., physician orders, nurses' notes, nursing assistant documentation) to determine if physical restraints were used during the 7- day look- back period. 2. Consult the nursing staff to determine the resident's cognitive and physical status/limitations . 3. Considering the physical restraint definition as well as the clarifications listed below, observe the resident to determine the effect the restraint has on the resident's normal function. Do not focus on the type , intent, or reason behi nd its use. 4. Evaluate whether the resident can easily and voluntarily remove any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material , or equipment attached or adjacent to his or her body . If the resident cannot easily and voluntarily do this , continue with the assessment to determine whether or not the manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment restrict freedom of movement or restrict the resident's access to his or her own body. 5. Any manual method or physical or mechanical d evice, material or equipment should be classified as a restraint only when it meet s the criteria of the physical restraint definition. This can only be determined on a case -by-case basis by individually assessing each and every manual method or physical or m echanical device , material or equipment (whether or not it is listed specifically on the MDS) attached or adjacent to the resident's body, and the effect it has on the resident. 6. Determine if the manual method or physical or mechanical device, material , or equipment meets the definition of a physical restraint as clarified below. Remember, the decision about coding any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material, equipment as a restraint depends on the effect it has on the resident. 7. Any manual m ethod or physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that meets the definition of a physical restraint must have: physician documentation of a medical symptom that supports the use of the restraint , a physician's order for the type of restraint and parameters of use, and a care plan and a process in place for systematic and gradual restraint reduction ( and/or elimination , if possible) , as appropriate. Clarifications \"Remove easily\" means that the manu al method or physical or mechanical device, material , or equipment can be removed intentionally by the resident in the same manner as it was applied by the staff (e.g., side rails are put down or not climbed over , buckles are intentionally unbuckled, ties or knots are intentionally untied), considering the resident's physical condition and ability to accomplish his or her objective (e.g., transfer to a chair, get to the bathroom in time). \"Freedom of movement\" means any change in place or position for the b ody or any part of the body that the person is physically able to control or access. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Restraints (cont.) \"Medical s ymptoms/ diagnoses\" are defined as an indication or characteristic of a physical or psychological condition. Objective findings derived from clinical evaluation of the resident's subjective symptoms and medical diagnoses should be considered when determining the presence of medical symptom(s) that might support restraint use. The resident's subjective symptoms may not be used as the sole basis for using a restraint. In addition, the resident's medical symptoms/diagnoses should not be viewed in isolation; rather, the medical symptoms identified should become the context in which to determine the most appropriate method of treatment related to the resident's condition, circumstances, and environment, and not a way to justify restraint use. The identification of medical symptoms should assist the nursing home in determining if the specific medical symptom can be imp roved or addressed by using other, less restrictive interventions . The nursing home should perform all due diligence and document this process to ensure that they have exhausted alternative treatments and less restrictive measures before a physical restrai nt is employed to treat the medical symptom, protect the resident's safety, help the resident attain or maintain his or her highest level of physical or psychological well -being and support the resident's goals, wishes, independence, and self -direction. Physical restraints as an intervention do not treat the underlying causes of medical symptoms. Therefore, as with other interventions, physical restraints should not be used without also seeking to identify and address the physical or psychological condition causing the medical symptom . Physical r estraints may be used, if warranted, as a temporary symptomatic intervention while the actual cause of the medical symptom is being evaluated and managed . Additionally, physical restraints may be used as a symptomat ic intervention when they are immediately necessary to prevent a resident from injuring himself/herself or others and/or to prevent the resident from interfering with life -sustaining treatment when no other less restrictive or less risky interventions exis t. Therefore, a clear link must exist between physical restraint use and how it benefits the resident by addressing the specific medical symptom . If it is determined , after thorough evaluation and attempts at using alternative treatments and less restrictive methods, that a physical restraint must still be employed , the medical symptoms that support the use of the restraint must be documented in the resident's medical record, ongoing assessments , and care plans . There also must be a physician's order reflecting the use of the physical restraint and the specific medical symptom being treated by its use . The physician's order alone is not sufficient to employ the use of a physical restraint . CMS will hold the nursing home ultimately accountable for the appropr iateness of that determination . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-5 P0100: Physical Restraints (cont.) Coding Instructions Identify all physical restraints that were used at any time (day or night) during the 7- day look - back period. After determining whether or not an item listed in (P0100) is a physical restraint and was used during the 7 -day look- back period, code the frequency of use: Code 0, n ot used: if the item was not used during the 7- day look- back or it was used but did not meet the definition. Code 1, u sed less than daily: if the item met the definition and wa s used less than daily. Code 2, u sed daily: if the item met the definition and was used on a daily basis during the look- back period. Coding Tips and Special Populations Any manual method or physical or mechanical device , material or equipment, that does not fit into the listed categories but that meets the definition of a physical restraint, and has not been excluded from this section, should be coded in items P0100D or P0100H, Other . These devices , although not coded on the MDS, must be assessed, care-planned, monitored, and evaluated . In classify ing any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment as a physical restraint, the assessor must consider the effect it has on the resident , not the purpose or intent of its use. It is possible that a manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment may improve a resident's mobility but also have the effect of physically restraining him or her. Exclude from this section items that are typically used in the provision of medical care, such as catheters, drainage tubes, cas ts, traction, leg, arm, neck, or back braces, abdominal binders, and bandages that are serving in their usual capacity to meet medical need(s). When coding this section, do not consider as a restraint a locked/secured unit or building in which the resident has the freedom to move about the locked/secured unit or building. Additional guidance regarding locked/secured units is provided in the section \"Considerations Involving Secured/Locked Areas\" of F603 in Appendix PP of the State Operations Manual. Bed rai ls include any combination of partial or full rails (e.g., one -side half -rail, one -side full rail, two -sided half -rails or quarter -rails, rails along the side of the bed that block three- quarters to the whole length of the mattress from top to bottom, etc. ). Incl ude in this category enclosed bed systems. \u2014 Bed rails used as positioning devices. If the use of bed rails (quarter -, half - or three - quarter, one or both, etc.) meet the definition of a physical restraint even though they may improve the resident's mobility in bed, the nursing home must code their use as a restraint at P0100A . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS [P] October 2019 Page P-6 P0100: Physical Restraints (cont.) \u2014 Bed rails use d with residents who are immobile. If the resident is immobile and cannot voluntarily get out of bed because of a physical limitation or because proper assistive devices were not present, the bed rails do not meet the definition of a physical restraint. For residents who have no voluntary movement, the staff need to determine if there is an appropriate use of bed rails. Bed rails may create a visual barrier and deter physical contact from others. Some residents have no ability to carry out voluntary movem ents, yet they exhibit involuntary movements. Involuntary movements, resident weight, and gravity's effects may lead to the resident's body shifting toward the edge of the bed. When bed rails are used in these cases, the resident could be at risk for entra pment. For this type of resident, clinical evaluation of alternatives (e.g., a concave mattress to keep the resident from going over the edge of the bed), coupled with frequent monitoring of the resident's position, should be considered. While the bed rail s may not constitute a physical restraint, they may affect the resident's quality of life and create an accident hazard. Trunk restraints include any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment attached or adjacent to the resident 's body that the resident cannot easily remove such as , but not limited to, vest or waist restraints or belts used in a wheelchair that either restricts freedom of movement or access to his or her body . Limb restraints include any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment that the resident cannot easily remove, that restricts movement of any part of an upper extremity (i.e., hand, arm, wrist) or lower extremity (i.e., foot, leg) that either restricts freedom of movement or access to his or her own body. Hand mitts/mittens are included in this category. Trunk or limb restraints , if used in both bed and chair, should be marked in both sections. Chairs that prevent rising include any type of chair with a lock ed lap board, that places the resident in a recumbent position that restricts rising, chair s that are soft and low to the floor , chairs that have a cushion placed in the seat that prohibit the resident from rising, geriatric chairs, and enclosed -frame wheeled walkers . \u2014 For residents who have the ability to transfer from other chairs, but cannot transfer from a geriatric chair, the geriatric chair would be considered a restraint to that individual, and should be coded a s P0100G -Chair Prevents Rising . \u2014 For res idents who have no ability to transfer independently, the geriatric chair does not meet the definition of a restraint, and should not be coded at P0100G -Chair Prevents Rising . \u2014 Geriatric chairs used for residents who are immobile. For residents who have no voluntary or involuntary movement, the geriatric chair does not meet the definition of a restraint. \u2014 Enclosed -frame wheeled walkers, with or without a posterior seat , and other devices like it should not automatically be classified as a physical restraint . These types of walkers are only classified as a physical restraint if the resident cannot exit the walker CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-7 P0100: Physical Restraints (cont.) via opening a gate, bar, strap, latch, removing a tray, etc. When deemed a physical restraint, these walkers should be coded at P0100G -Chair Prevents Rising. Restraints used in e mergency s ituations . If the resident needs emergency care, physical restraint s may be used for brief periods to permit medical treatment to proceed, unless the resident or legal representative has previously made a valid refusal of the treatment in question. The resident's right to participate in care planning and the right to ref use treatment are addressed at 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7483.10(c)(6) and 483.21(b)(ii)(A)-(F) respectively . The use of physical restraints in this instance should be limited to preventing the resident from interfering with life -sustaining procedures only and not for routi ne care. \u2014 A resident who is injuring himself/herself or is threatening physical harm to others may be physically restrained in an emergency to safeguard the resident and others. A resident whose unanticipated violent or aggressive behavior places him/her or others in imminent danger does not have the right to refuse the use of physical restraints, as long as those restraints are used as a last resort to protect the safety of the resident or others and use is limited to the immediate episode. Additional Infor mation Restraint r eduction/ elimination . It is further expected, for residents whose care plan indicates the need for physical restraints, that the nursing home engages in a systematic and gradual process towards reducing (or eliminating , if possible) the restraints (e.g., gradually increasing the time for ambulation and strengthening activities) . This systematic p rocess also applies to recently -admitted residents for whom physical restraints were used in the previous setting . Restraints as a f all prevention approach . Although physical restraints have been traditionally used as a fall prevention approach, they have major drawbacks and can contribute to serious injuries. Falls do not constitute self -injurious behavior nor a medical symptom supporting the use of physical restraints. There is no evidence that the use of physical restraints, including but not limited to side rails, will prevent, reduce , or eliminate f alls. In fact, in some instances, reducing the use of physical restraints may actually decrease the risk of falling. Additionally, falls that occur while a person is physically restrained often result in more severe injuries. Request for r estraints . While a resident, family member , legal representative , or surrogate may request use of a physical restraint, the nursing home is responsible for evaluat ing the appropriateness of that request, just as they would for any medical treatment. As with other medical treatments, such as the use of prescription drugs, a resident, family member, legal representative, or surrogate has the right to refuse treatment, but not to demand its use when it is not deemed medically necessary. Accord ing to 42 CFR 483.10(e)(1) and 483.12, \"The resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for the purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\" CMS expects that no res ident will be physically restrained for discipline or convenience. Prior to employing any physical restraint, the nursing home must perform a prescribed resident assessment to properly identify the resident's needs and the medical symptom the physical rest raint is being employed to address. The guidelines in the State Operations Manual (SOM) state, CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-8 P0100: Physical Restraints (cont.) \"...the legal surrogate or representative cannot give permission to use restraints for the sake of discipline or staff convenience or when the restraint is not necessary to treat the resident's medical symptoms. That is, the facility may not use restraints in violation of regulation solely based on a resident, legal surrogate or representative's request or approval.\" The SOM goe s on to state, \"While Federal regulations affirm the resident's right to participate in care planning and to refuse treatment, the regulations do not create the right for a resident, legal surrogate or representative to demand that the facility use specifi c medical interventions or treatment that the facility deems inappropriate. Statutory requirements hold the facility ultimately accountable for the resident's care and safety, including clinical decisions.\" P0200: Alarms Item Rationale Health -related Qua lity of Life An alarm is any physical or electronic device that monitors resident movement and alerts the staff, by either audible or inaudible means, when movement is detected, and may include bed, chair and floor sensor pads, cords that clip to the resident's clothing, motion sensors, door alarms , or elopement/wandering devices. While often used as an intervention in a resident's fall prevention strategy, the efficacy of alarms to pr event falls has not been proven; therefore, alarm use must not be the primary or sole intervention in the plan. The use of an alarm as part of the resident 's plan of care does not eliminate the need for adequate supervision, nor does the alarm replace individualized, person- centered care planning. Adverse consequences of alarm use include, but are not limited to, fear, anxiety , or agitation related to the alarm sound ; decreased mobility ; sleep disturbances ; and infringement on freedom of movement, dignity , and privacy. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-9 P0200: Alarms (cont.) Planning for Care Individualized, person -centered care planning surrounding the resident's use of an alarm is important to the resident's overall well- being. When the use of an alarm is considered as an intervention in the resident's safety strategy, use must be based on the assessment of the resident and monitored for efficacy on an ongoing basis, including the assessment of unintended consequences of the alarm use and alternative interventions. There are times when the use of an alarm may meet the definition of a restraint, as the alarm may restrict the resident's freedom of movement and may not be easily removed by the resident. When an alarm is used as an intervention in the resident's safety strategy, the effect the alarm has on the resident must be evaluated individually for that res ident. Steps for Assessment 1. Review t he resident's medical record (e.g., physician orders, nurses' notes, nursing assistant documentation) to determine if alarms were used during the 7 -day look- back period. 2. Consult the nursing staff to determine the resident's cognitive and physical status/limitations . 3. Evaluate whether the alarm affects the resident's freedom of movement when the alarm /device is in place. For example, does the resident avoid standing up or repositioning himself/herself due to fear of setting off the alarm? Coding Instructions Identify all alarms that were used at any time (day or night) during the 7- day look -back period. After determining whether or not an item listed in P02 00 was used during the 7- day look- back period, code the frequency of use: Code 0, n ot used: if the device was not used during the 7 -day look- back period. Code 1, u sed less than daily: if the device was used less than daily. Code 2, u sed daily: if the device was u sed on a daily basis during the look- back period. Coding Tips Bed alarm includes devices such as a sensor pad placed on the bed or a device that clips to the resident's clothing. Chair alarm includes devices such as a sensor pad placed on the chair or wheelchair or a device that clips to the resident's clothing. Floor mat alarm includes devices such as a sensor pad placed on the floor beside the bed. Motion sensor alarm includes infrared beam motion detectors. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [P] October 2019 Page P-10 P0200: Alarms (cont.) Wander/elopement alarm includes devices such as bracelets, pins/buttons worn on the resident's clothing, sensors in shoes, or building/unit exit sensors worn by /attached to the resident that activate an alarm and/or alert the staff whe n the resident nears or exits a specific area or the building. This includes devices that are attached to the resident's assistive device (e.g., walker, wheelchair, cane) or other belongings. Other alarm includes devices such as alarms on the resident's bathroom and/or bedroom door, toilet seat alarms, or seatbelt alarms. Code any type of alarm, audible or inaudible, used during the look- back period in this section. If an alarm meets the criteria as a restraint, code the alarm use in both P0100, Physical Restraints, and P0200, Alarms. Motion sensors and wrist sensors worn by the resident to track the resident's sleep patterns should not be coded in this section. Wandering is random or repetitive locomotion. This movement may be goal -directed (e.g., the resident appears to be searching for something such as an exit) or may be non-goal directed or aimless. Non -goal directe d wandering requires a response in a manner that addresses both safety issues and an evaluation to identify root causes to the degree possible. While wander, door, or building alarms can help monitor a resident's activities, staff must be vigilant in order to respond to them in a timely manner. Alarms do not replace necessary supervision. Bracelets or devices worn by or attached to the resident an d/or his or her belongings that signal a door to lock when the resident approaches should be coded in P0200E Wander/elopement alarm , whether or not the device activates a sound or alerts the staff . Do not code a universal building exit alarm applied to an exit door that is intended to alert staff when anyone (including visitors or staff members) exits the door. When determining whether the use of an alarm also meets the criteria of a restraint, refer to the section \"Determination of the Use of Position Change Alarms as Restraints\" of F604 in Appendix PP of the State Operations Manual.

Item Rationale This i tem identi fies the r esident's g eneral expect ations and g oals f or nur sing hom e stay. The resident sh ould be asked about his or her own expect ations regarding r eturn to t he comm unity and goals f or car e. The r eside nt may not be aware of the opti on of returni ng to the co mmunity and that services and su pports m ay be avai lable in the co mmunity to m eet his or her individual long-term care n eeds. Additiona l assessm ent in formation m ay be need ed to det ermine whether the resi dent requires addi tional c ommunity servi ces and supports. Some resid ents have ver y cle ar and directed ex pectations that will chan ge little prior to dischar ge. Other r esidents may be u nsure or m ay be exper iencing an evol ution in their thinking as their clinical con dition changes or stabilizes. Healt h-related Quality of Life Unless the resident's g oals f or care are und erstood, his or her needs, g oals, and p riorities are not li kely to be met. Planning for Care The resi dent's goals should be the basis f or care planning. Step s for Asses smen t 1. Ask the re sident about his or h er overall expec tations to be s ure th at he or she has participated in the a ssess ment process and has a b etter unde rstanding of his or her c urrent situation a nd the i mplications of alternat ive ch oices such as returning home, or moving to another appropriate community setting such as an assisted living facility or an alternative healthcare setting. 2. Ask the re sident to cons ider his or h er current h ealth s tatus, expectations regarding improve ment or worse ning, soci al supports and opportuni ties to obt ain services and s upports in the co mmunity. 3. If goals ha ve not a lready been st ated dire ctly by the res ident and docum ented si nce admission, ask the r esident directly about what hi s or her ex pectation i s regarding the outcom e of this nur sing hom e admission and ex pectations a bout r eturni ng to the co mmunity. 4. The resi dent's stated go als should be recor ded he re. The goals for the re sident, as de scribed by the f amily, signi ficant er, gua rdian, or legally author ized repre sentative, may al so be recor ded in t he cli nical record . 5. Because of a tem porary e.g., del irium) or pe rmanent (e.g., pr ofound de mentia) condition, some residents m ay be unable to pr ovide a c lear response . If the res ident is unabl e to communicate his or he r preference e ither verb ally or nonver bally, the in formation can be obtained f rom the f amily or signi ficant othe r, as design ated b y the in dividual. If family or the signi ficant other is not a vaila ble, t he information should be obtained f rom the guard ian or legal ly aut horized representative. DEFINITION DISCHARGE To release from nursing home care. Can be to home, another community setting, or a healthcare setting. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Q] October 2019 Page Q-5 Q0300: Res ident's O verall Expectation (c ont.) 6. Encourage the involvement of family or significant others in the discussion, if the resident consents. While family, significan t others, or the guardian or legally authorized representative can be involved if the resident is uncertain about his or her goals, the response selected must reflect the resident's perspective if he or she is able to express it. 7. In some guardianship situations, the decision- making authority regarding the individual's care is vested in the guardian. But this should not create a presumption that the individual resident is not able to comprehend and communicate their wishes. Coding Instructions for Q0300 A, Resident's Overall Goals Established during Assessment Process Record the resident's expecta tions as expressed by him or her. It is impo rtant to document his or her expec tations. Code 1, Expects to be discharged to the commu nity: if the resident in dicates an expect ation to r eturn home, to as sisted living, or to an other community set ting. Code 2, Expect s to rema in in this facility: if the resi dent in dicat es that he or she expects to remain in the nursing hom e. Code 3, Expects to be discharged to another facility/institu tion: if the resident ex pects to be di scharged to another nur sing ho me, rehabi litation facility, or another institution. Code 9, Unknown or uncertain: if the res ident is uncer tain or if the resident i s not able to par ticipat e in t he discus sion or ind icate a goal, and fa mily, signi ficant ot her, or guardian or l egally auth orized representat ive do not exi st or are not available to participate in the di scussion. Coding Tips This i tem is individ ualized and re sident-driven rather than w hat the n ursing hom e staff judge to be in the be st intere st of the resident. Th is item focuses on explor ing the resident's expectations, not whether or not t he staf f considers t hem to be reali stic. Coding other than the resident's stated expectation is a violation of the resident's civil rights. Q0300A, C ode 1 \"Expe cts to be dis charged to the co mmunity\" may include newly admitted Me dicare SNF residents with a facility arranged discharge plan or non- Medicare and Medicaid resi dents with adequate suppo rts alread y in place that would not require referral to a local contact agency (LCA). It may also include residents who ask to talk to someone about the possi bility of leavi ng this facility and returning to live and recei ve services in the community (Q0500 B, Code 1). Avoid tryi ng to guess w hat the resident m ight identif y as a goal or to ju dge the r esident's goal. Do not infer a r esponse based on a speci fic advance d irective, e.g., \" do not resus citate\" (DNR). The resi dent should be provided opt ions, as well as, acce ss to information that a llows him or her to m ake the dec ision and to be supported i n dire cting his or h er care planning.

Q0400: Di scharge Plan Item Rationale Healt h-related Quality of Life Returning hom e or to a non- institutional s etting can be very important to a resi dent's health and qual ity of life. For resi dents who have been in t he facility for a long tim e, it is important to discu ss with them their i nterest in talking wi th local cont act agency (LCA) experts about retur ning to the co mmunity. C ommunity resour ces and supports exist that m ay bene fit the se residents and allow them to return to a co mmunity set ting. Being d ischarged from the nursing hom e without adequate di scharge pla nning occur ring (planning and i mplementation of a plan before dis charge) could resu lt in the re sident's decline and incr ease the chances for rehos pitalization and af tercar e, so a thorough examination of the optio ns with the resident and l ocal co mmunity exp erts is imperati ve. 3.0 3: MDS Items [Q] October 2019 Page Q-9 Q0400: scharge Plan (cont.) Planning for Care Many nursi ng home residents m ay be able to r eturn to t he comm unity if they are provided appropri ate assistance and r eferral to comm unity re sources. Important progress has been made so that individuals have more choices, care options, and available supports to meet care preferences and needs in the least restrictive setting possible. This progress resulted from the 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which states that residents needing long term services and supports have a civil right to receive services in the least restrictive and most integrated settin g appropriate to their needs. The care pl an shoul d include the name and contact information of a primary care prov ider chosen by the resident, family, significant other, guardi an or legally authorized represen tative, arran gements for t he durabl e medical equipment (if needed), formal and informal suppor ts that will be availa ble, the persons and provi der(s) i n the communit y who wil l meet the resident' s needs, and the place t he resident is going to be living. Each situation is unique to the resident, his/her family, and/or guardian/legally authorized representativ e. A referral to the Local Contact Agency (LCA) may be appropriate for many individuals , who could be maintained in the community homes of their choice for long periods of time, depending on the residential setting and support servi ces available. For example, a referral to the LCA may be appropriate for some individuals with Alzheimer's disease. There are many individuals with this condition being maintained in their own homes for long periods of time, depending on the residential se tting and support services available. The interdisciplinary team should not assume that any particular resident is unable to be discharged. A successful transition will depend on the services, settings, and sometimes family support services that are available. Discharge instructions should include at a minimum: \u2014 the in divid uals prefe rences and needs f or care and s; personal identification a nd conta ct information, inclu ding Advance Dir ectives; provider contact information of primary c are ph ysician, pha rmacy, and community care agency inclu ding p ersonal c are services (if applicable) etc.; brief medical hist ory; curre a nd conta ct information at th e nursing hom e if a pro blem arises during di scharge \u2014 A follow -up appoint ment with the d esigna ted pr imary care p rovider in the community and other s (as appropr iate). \u2014 Medica tion Items [Q] October 2019 Page Q-10 Q0400: Di scharge Plan (cont.) \u2014 Prevention and disease management education, focusing especially on warning symptoms for when to call the doctor. \u2014 Who to call in case of an emergency or if symptoms of decline occur. \u2014 Nursing facility procedures and discharge planning f or sub -acute and rehabilitation community discharges ar e most often well- defined and efficient. \u2014 Section Q has broadened the scope of the traditional boundary of discharge planning for sub -acute residents to encom pass long stay residents. In addition to home health and other medical services, discharge planning may include expanded resources such as assistance with locating housi ng, transportation, employment if desired, and social engagement opportunities. Asking the resident and family about whether they want to talk to someone about a return to the community gives the resident voice and respects his or her wishes. This step in no way guarantees discharge but provides an opportunity for the resident to interact with LCA experts. The NF is responsible for making referrals to the LCAs under the process that the State has set up. The LCA is responsible for contacting referred residents and assisting with providing information regarding community -based services and, when appropriate, transition services planning. The nursing facility interdisciplinary team and the LCA should work closely together. The LCA is the entity that does the community support planning, (e.g., housing, home modification, setting up a household, t ransportation, community inclusion planning, etc.). A referral to the LCA may come from the nursing facility by phone, by e -mails or by a state's on -line/website or by other state -approved processes. Each state has a process for referral to an LCA, and it is vital to know the process in your state and for your facility. In most cases, further screening and consultation with the resident, their family and the interdisciplinary team by the nursing home social worker or staff member would likely be an important step in the referral determination process. Each NH needs to develop relationships with their LCAs to work with them to contact the resident and their family, guardian or significant others concerning a potential return to the community. A thorough rev iew of medical, psychological, functional, and financial information is necessary in order to assess what each individual resident needs and whether or not there are sufficient community resources and finances to support a transition to the community. Enrich ed transition resources including housing, in- home caretaking services and meals, home modifications, etc. are now more readily available. Resource availability and eligibility coverage varies across States and local communities. Should a planned relocation not occur, it might create stress and disappointment for the resident and family that will require support and nursing home care planning interventions. However, a referral should not be avoided based upon facility staff judgment of potential discharge success or failure. It is the resident's right to be provided information if requested and to receive care in the most integrated setting. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Q] October 2019 Page Q-11 Q0400: Di scharge Plan (cont.) Involve community mental health resources (as appropriate) to ensure that the resident has support and active coping skills that will help him or her to readjust to community living. Use teach- back m ethods to ensure that the resident under stands all of the factors associ ated w ith his or h er dischar ge.

If this is a compr ehensive assessment, proceed to item Q0500B, regardless of the previ ous responses to item Q0550A . Examples 1. Ms. G is a 45-year old woman, 300 pound s, who is cognitive ly intact. S he has CHF and shortness of breat h requiring oxygen at all times. Ms. G also requires 2 person assistance with bathi ng and transfers to the commode. S he was admitte d to the nursing home 3 years ago after her daugh ter who was caring for her passed away. The nursing home social worker discussed options in which she could be cared for in the community but Ms. G refused to consider leaving the nursing home. During the review of her clinical record, the assessor found that on her last MDS assessment, Ms. G stated that she did not want to be asked again about returning to community living, that she has friends in the nursing facility and really likes the activities. Coding: Q0490 would be coded 1, Yes, skip to Q0600; because this is a quarterly assessment. If this is a comprehens ive assess ment, then proceed to the next item Q0500B. Rationale : On her last MDS 3.0 assessment , Ms. G indicat es her preference to not want to be asked again about returning to community living (No on Q0550A). 2. Mrs. R is an 82-year-old widow with advanced Alzheimer's disease.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Q] October 2019 Page Q-14 Q0500: Return to C ommunity For Admiss ion, Quarter ly, and Annual Assessm ents. Item Rationale The goal of follow -up action is to initiate and m aintain c ollaboration bet ween the n ursing home and the loc al cont act agency to support t he reside nt's e xpressed interest in talking to someone about the possibility of leaving the facility and returning to live and receive services in the community . This inclu des the nursing hom e supporting the re sident in achie ving h is or her highest l evel of functioning a nd the loc al conta ct age ncy provi ding in formed choices f or comm unity li ving and as sisting t he resi dent in tran sitioning to community living if it is the resident's desire. The underl ying intention of the r eturn to the co mmunity i tem is to insure that all indi viduals have t he opportuni ty to l earn a bout hom e and community based s ervices and have an opportuni ty to re ceive long term services and su pports in the least r estrictive set ting. C MS has found that in m any cases in dividuals req uiring long t erm servi ces, and/or the ir families, are unaw are of community ba sed services and supports that could a dequately support indi viduals in comm unity li ving situa tions. Local contact agencies (LCAs) are experts in available home and community -based service (HCBS) and can provide both the resident and the facility with valuable information. Health-related Quality of Life Returning hom e or to a non- institutional s etting can be beneficial to the res ident's health and qual ity of life. This i tem identi fies the r esident's d esire to speak with so meone about r eturning to community living. Based on the A mericans w ith Disabi lities Act and the 1999 U.S. Supre me Court de cision in O lmstead v. L.C., residents needing long -term care ser vices have a civil r ight to re ceive se rvices in the least restrictive and m ost inte grated setting. Item Q0500 B requires that the resident be as ked the que stion directly and formalizes t he opportuni ty for the re sident to be informed of and consider his or h er options to r eturn to community living. This ensures t hat the resi dent's desire to l earn about the possibi lity of retur ning to the co mmunity wi ll be obtained and appropr iate follow -up m easures w ill be taken. The goal is to obtain the informed choice and pr eferences ex pressed by the resi dent and to provi de information a bout ava ilable co mmunity supports and servi ces. Planning for Care Many nursi ng hom e residents m ay be able to r eturn to t he comm unity if they are provided appropri ate assistance to fa cilitate care in a non- institutional setting. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Q] October 2019 Page Q-15 Q0500: Return to C ommunity (cont.) Step s for Asses smen t: Interview Instructions 1. At the initi al admission assessm ent and in subse quent f ollow -up assessm ents (as applicabl e), make the resident co mfortable by as suring him or her th at this is a ro utine question th at is asked of all residents. 2. Ask the re sident if he or she would l ike to speak with so meone about t he possibi lity of retur ning to live and receive services in the community. Inf orm the resident that answering yes to th is item signals the re sident's reque st for more in formation and will ini tiate a contac t by someone with more in formation about supports av ailable f or living in the co mmunity. A succe ssful tran sition will depend on t he resi dent's preference s and choic es and the s ervices, settings, and som etimes family supports t hat a re avai lable. In many cases individuals requiring lo ng term care servi ces, and/or their families, a re unaware of community based services and supports t hat co uld adequat ely support indi viduals in comm unity living situations. Answeri ng yes does not commit the reside nt to le ave the n ursing home at a speci fic time; nor does it ens ure that the resident wi ll be able to move back t o the co mmunity. Answering no is also not a pe rmanent co mmitment. Also inf orm the resi dent that he or she can change his or he r deci sion (i .e., whether or not he or she wants to spe ak with so meone) a t any time. 3. Explain t hat this item is meant to provide the opp ortuni ty for the resi dent to get in formation and explor e the possi bility of different set tings f or receiving ongoing ca re. A viable a nd workable di scharge plan requi res that the n ursing hom e social worker or st aff talk with the resident be fore m aking a ref erral to a loca l cont act agency to explore topics such as : what retur ning to the co mmunity m eans, i.e., a va riety of settings based on pre ference s and needs; the ar rangements and planning tha t the NF/SNF can m ake; and obtai ning family or l egal guardian in put, if necessary. This s tep will h elp the resi dent cl arify their discharge g oals and identify important i nformation f or the LCA or, in som e instances m ay indic ate that the resident does not want to be ref erred to the LCA at this time. Also expl ain that the r esident can cha nge his/h er mind at any time. 4. If the res ident is una ble to co mmunicate his or her pre ference either v erbally or nonverbal ly, the in formation can t hen be obtai ned from family or a sig nificant othe r, as design ated b y the individual. I f family or signi ficant o thers ar e not auth orized if one e xists, c an pr ovide the information. 5. Ask the re sident if he or she wants i nformation a bout di fferent kinds of supports t hat may be available f or community living. Res ponding yes will be a w ay for the in dividua l\u2014and his or her family, signi and suppor ts that wou ld be ava ilable to suppor t community living. It is simply a request for information, not a request for discharge.

Thi s code is intended to i nitiate conta ct with the LCA f or follow -up as the resident desires. Follow -up is expected in a \"rea sonab le\" am ount of time and 10 business days is a recommendation and not a req uirement. Each state has its own policy for follow -up. It is important to know your state's policy. The le vel and ty pe of response needed by a n individual i s deter mined on a resi dent-by-resident basis. Som e States m ay deter mine th at the LCAs can make an i nitial telephone conta ct to ident ify the resi dent's needs and/ or set up the f ace-to-face vi sit/appoint ment. However, it is ex pected that m ost residents w ill have a f ace-to-face vis it. In so me States, an i nitial meeting is s et up with the resi dent, facility sta ff, and LCA together to talk with the resident about their needs a nd community care o ptions. Some resid ents will have a very c lear expect ation and som e may change t heir expect ations over t ime.

Rationale: The social worke r or discharge planner would make a referral to the designated local contact agency for their area and Q060 0 would be coded as 2, yes, because a referral to the designated LCA was made . 2. Ms. V. is an 82-year-old femal e with right sided paralysis , mild dementia , diabetes and was admitted by the famil y becaus e of safety concer ns due to falls and difficultie s cooking and prope r nutrition . She said yes to Q0500B . She needs to continue her rehabilitation therap y and regai n her strengt h and abilit y to transfer. The social worker plans to talk to the residen t and her famil y to determin e whethe r a referral to the LCA is needed for Ms. V. to return to the community . Coding: Q0600 would be coded 1, No. Rationale: Ms. V. indicate d that she wanted to have an opportunity to talk to someone about return to commu nity. The nursing home staff will focus on her therapies and talk to her and her famil y to obtai n more informatio n for discharge planni ng. Q0600 would be coded as no- \"referral is or may be needed.\" The Care Area Assessment #20 is triggered and it will be used to guide the follow-up process. Becau se a referral was not made at this time, care planni ng and progress notes should indicate the status of discharge planning and why a referral was not initiate d to the designated local contact agency. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [S] October 2019 Page S-1 SECTION S IS RESERVED FOR ADDITIONAL STATE -DEFINED ITEMS. THERE IS NO SECTION S IN THE FEDERAL MDS VERSION 3.0 ITEM SET. YOUR STATE MAY CHOOSE TO DESIGNATE A SECTION S. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ V] October 2019 Page V-1 SECTION V: CARE AREA ASSESSMENT (CAA) SUMMARY Intent : The MDS does not constitute a comprehensive assessment. Rather, it is a preliminary assessment to identify potential resident problems, strengths, and preferences. Care Areas are triggered by MDS item responses that indicate the need for additional assessment based on problem identification , known as \" triggered care areas,\" which form a critical link between the MDS and decisions about care planning. There are 20 CAA s in Version 3.0 of the RAI, which includes the addition of \"Pain\" and \"Return to the Community Referral. \" The se CAAs cover the majority of care areas known to be problematic for nursing home residents. The Care Area Assessment (CAA) process provides guidance on how to focus on key issues identified during a comprehensive MDS assessment and directs facility staff and health professionals to evaluate triggered care areas . The interdisciplinary team (IDT) then identifies relevant assessment information regarding the resid ent's status. After obtaining input from the resident, the resident's family, significant other, guardian, or legally authorized representative, the IDT decides whether or not to develop a care plan for triggered care areas. Chapter 4 of this manual provides detailed instructions on the CAA process and development of an individualized care plan . Whereas t he MDS identifies actual or potential problem areas, the CAA process provides for further assessment of the triggered areas by guiding staff to look for causal or confounding factors , some of which may be reversible. It is important that the CAA documentation include the causal or unique risk factors for decline or lack of improvement. The plan of care then addresses these factors , with the goal of promoting the resident's highest practicable level of functioning: (1) improvement where possible, or (2) maintenance and prevention of avoidable declines. Documentation should support your decision making regarding whether to proceed with a care plan for a triggered CAA and the type(s) of care plan interventions that are appropriate for a particular resident. Documentation may appear anywhere in the clinical record, e.g., progress notes, consults, flowsheets, etc. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [ V] October 2019 Page V-2 V0100: Items From the Most Recent Prior OBRA or PPS Assessment Item Rationale The items in V0100 are used to determine whether to trigger several of the CAAs that compare a resident's current status with their prior status. The values of these items are derived from a prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment that was performed since the most recent admission of any kind (i.e., since the most recent entry or reentry), if one is available. I tems V0100A, B, C, D, E and F are skipped on the first assessment (OBRA or PPS) following the m ost recent admission of any kind (i.e., when A0310E = 1, Yes ). Complete these items only if a prior assessment has been completed since the most recent admission of any kind to the facility (i.e., when A0310E = 0, No) and if the prior assessment is an OBRA or a scheduled PPS assessment . If such an assessment is available, the values of V0100A, B, C, D, E, and F should be copied from the corresponding items on that prior assessment. Coding Instructions for V0100A , Prior Assessment Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment (A0310A Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100A the value for A0310A (Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment , if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details).

One of the available values (01 or 08 or 99) must be selected. Note: The val ues for V0100A and V0100B cannot both be 99, indicating that the prior assessment is neither an OBRA nor a PPS assessment. If the value of V0100A is 99 ( None of the above ), then the value for V0100B must be 01 or 0 8, indicating a PPS assessment. If the val ue of V0100B is 99 ( None of the above), then the value for V0100A must be 01 through 06, indicating a n OBRA assessment. Coding Instructions for V0100C, Prior Assessment Reference Date (A2300 Value from Prior Assessment) Record in V0100C the value of A2300 (Assessment Reference Date) from the most recent prior OBRA or scheduled PPS assessment, if one is available (see \"Item Rationale,\" above, for details).

The CAA Summary documents the interdisciplinary team's and the resident, resident's family or representative's final decision( s) on which triggered care areas will be addressed in the care plan. Coding Instructions for V0200A , CAA s Facility staff are to use the RAI triggering mechanism to determine which care areas require review and additional assessment. The triggered care areas are checked in Column A \"Care Area Triggered\" in the CAA s section. For each triggered care area, use the CAA process and curr ent standard of practice, evidence -based or expert -endorsed clinical guidelines and resources to conduct further assessment of the care area. Document relevant assessment information regarding the resident's status. Chapter 4 of this manual provides detail ed instructions on the CAA process, care planning, and documentation. For each triggered care area, Column B \" Care Planning Decision\" is checked to indicate that a new care plan, care plan revision, or continuation of the current care plan is necessary to address the issue (s) identified in the assessment of that care area. The \"Care Planning Decision\" column must be completed within 7 days of completing the RAI , as indicated by the date in V0200C2, which is the date that the care planning decision (s) were completed and that the resident's care plan was completed. For each triggered care area, indicate the date and location of the CAA documentation in the \"Location and Date of CAA Documentation\" column.

Following completion of the MDS, CAAs (V0200A , Columns A and B ) and the care plan, the MDS 3.0 comprehensive assessment record must be transmitted to the QIES Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system within 14 days of the V0200C2 date. Clarifications: The signatures at V0200B1 and V0200C1 can be provided by the same person, if the person actually completed both functions. However, i t is not a requirement that the same person complete both functions . If a resi dent is discharged prior to the completion of Section V, a comprehensive assessment may be in progress when a resident is discharged. Al though the resident has been discharged, the facility may complete and submit the assessment. The following guidelines a pply to completing a comprehensive assessment * when the resident has been discharged : 1. Complete all required MDS items from Section A through Section Z and indicate the date of completion in Z0500B. Encode and verify these items. 2.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [X] October 2019 Page X -1 SECTION X : CORRECTION REQUEST Intent: The purpose of Section X is to identify an MDS record to be modified or inactivated. The following items identify the existing assessment record that is in error. Section X is only completed if Item A0050, Type of Record, is coded a 2 (Modify existing record) or a 3 (Inactivate existing record). In Section X, the facility must reproduce the information EXACTLY as it appeared on the existing erroneous record, even if the information is incorrect. This information is necessary to locate the existing record in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system. A modification request is used to correct a QIES ASAP record containing incorrect MDS item values due to: transcription errors, data entry errors, softwar e product errors, item coding errors, and/or other error requiring modification The modification request record contains correct values for all MDS items (not just the values previously in error), including the Section X items. The corrected record will re place the prior erroneous record in the QIES ASAP system . In some cases, an incorrect MDS record requires a completely new assessment of the resident in addition to a modification request for that incorrect record. Please refer to Chapter 5 of this manual, Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments, to determine if a new assessment is required in addition to a modification request. An inactivation request is used to move an existing record in the QIES ASAP system from the active file to an archive (hi story file) so that it will not be used for reporting purposes. Inactivations should be used when the event did not occur (e.g., a discharge was submitted when the resident was not discharged). The inactivation request only includes Item A0050 and the Section X items. All other MDS sections are skipped. The modification and inactivation processes are automated and neither completely removes the prior erroneous record from the QIES ASAP system . The erroneous record is archived in a history file. In certain c ases, it is necessary to delete a record and not retain any information about the record in the QIES ASAP system . This requires a request from the facility to the facility's state agency to manually delete all traces of a record from the QIES ASAP system . The policy and procedures for a Manual Correction/Deletion Request are provided in Chapter 5 of this M anual. A Manual Deletion Request is required only in the following three cases: 1. Item A0410 Submission Requirement is incorrect. Submission of MDS assessme nt records to the QIES ASAP system constitutes a release of private information and must conform to privacy laws. Only records required by the State and/or the Federal governments may be stored in the QIES ASAP system . If a record has been submitted with the incorrect Submission Requirement value in Item A0410, then that record must be manually deleted and, in some cases, a new record with a corrected A0410 value submitted. Item A0410 cannot be corrected by modification or inactivation. See Chapter 5 of thi s Manual for details. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [X] October 2019 Page X -2 2. Inappropriate submission of a test record as a production record. Removal of a test record from the QIES ASAP system requires manual deletion. Otherwise information for a \"bogus\" resident will be retained in the database and this resident will appear on some reports to the facility. 3. Record was submitted for the wrong facility. If a record was submitted to the QIES ASAP system for an incorrect facility, the record must be removed manually and then a new record for the correct facility must be submitted to the QIES ASAP system . Manual deletion of the record for the wrong facility is necessary to ensure that the resident i s not associated with that facility and does not appear on reports to that facility.

CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-1 SECTION Z: ASSESSMENT ADMIN ISTRATION Intent: The intent of th e items in th is section is to provide billing inform ation and signatures of persons completing the assess ment. Z0100: Medicare Part A Billing Item Rationale Used to capture the Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) case mix version code followed by Health Insurance Prospective Pay ment System (HIPPS) modifi er based on type of assessm ent. Coding Instructions for Z0100A, Medicare Part A HIPPS Code Typically , the software data entry pr oduct will calculate this v alue. The HIPPS code is a Skilled Nurs ing Facility (SNF) Part A five -position billing code ; the first four positions represent the PDPM case mix version code and the fifth is an assessment type indicator . For inform ation on HIPPS, If the value for Z0100A is not automatically calculated by the software data entry product, enter the HIPPS code in th e spaces pro vided (see Chapter 6 of this manual, Medicare Skilled Nursing Home Prospective Payment Syste m, for a step -by-step worksheet for manually deter mining the PDPM case mix version code and a table that defines the assess ment type indicator). Note that the version code included in this HIPPS code takes into account all MDS ite ms used in the PDPM logic and is the \"normal\" group since the classification considers the rehabilitation therapy received. This HIPPS code is usually used for Medicare SNF Part A billing by the provider. Left-justify the 5 -character HIPPS code. The ex tra two spaces are supplied for future use, if necessary. DEFINITION MEDICARE -COVERED STAY Skilled Nursing Facility stays billable to Medicare Part A. Does not include stays billable to Medicare Advantage HMO plans. DEFINITION HIPPS CODE Health Insurance Prospective Payment System code is comprised of the PDPM case mix code , which is calculated from the assessment data. The first four pos itions of the HIPPS code cont ain the PDPM classification c odes for each PDPM component to be bill ed for Medic are reimburse ment, followed by an indicator of the type of assessment that was completed.

Otherwise, enter a n appropriat e billing version in the spaces provided. This is the billing version ap propriate to the billing code in Item Z0300A. Z0400: Signatu res of Persons Completing the Assessment or Entry/Death Reporting Item Rationale To obtain the signature of all persons who com pleted any part of the MDS. Legally, it is an attestati on of accuracy with the p rimary responsibility for its accuracy with the person selecting the MDS item response. Each person completing a section or portion of a section of the MDS is required to sign the Atte station St atement. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-5 Z0400: Signatu res of Persons Completing the Assessment (cont.) The importance of accurately completing and submitting the MDS cannot be over - emphasized . The MDS is the basis for: \u2014 the development of an indi vidualized care p lan; \u2014 the Med icare Prospecti ve Pay ment System \u2014 Medicaid reimburse ment progra ms \u2014 quality monitoring activities, such as the quality measure reports \u2014 the data- driven survey a nd certificatio n process \u2014 the quality measures used for public reporting \u2014 research and policy developm ent. Coding Instructions All staff who com pleted any part of the MDS m ust enter their signat ures, titles, sections or portion(s) of section(s) they completed, and the date co mpleted. If a staff m ember cannot sign Z0400 on the sa me day that he or she completed a section or portion of a section, when the staff m ember signs, use the date the item originally w as completed. Read the Attestation State ment carefully. You are certifying that the infor mation you entered on the MDS, to the best of your knowle dge, m ost accu rately reflects t he residen t's status. Penalties m ay be applied for s ubmitting fals e infor mation. Coding Tips and Special Populations Two or m ore staff m embers can co mplete items within the same secti on of the MDS. When filling in the infor mation for Z0400, any staff m ember who has completed a s ub- set of items within a section should identify which item(s) he/she completed within that section. Nursing hom es may use electronic signatures for medical record docu mentation, inclu ding the MDS, when permitted to do so by state and local law and when author ized by the nursing hom e's policy. Nursing hom es must have written poli cies in place that meet any and all s tate and federal privacy and security require ments to ensure proper security m easures to protect the use of an electronic signature by anyone other than the person to w hom the electronic signature belongs. Although the use of electronic signatures for the MDS does not require that the entire record be maint ained electronically, most facilities have th e option to m aintain a resident's record by comput er rather than hard copy. Whenever copies of the MDS are printed and dates are automatically encoded, be sure to note that it is a \"copy\" docu ment and not the original. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-6 Z0400: Signatu res of Persons Completing the Assessment (cont.) If an indivi dual who com pleted a portion of the MDS is not avai lable to sign it (e.g., in situations in which a s taff member is no longer e mployed by the facility and left MDS sections completed but not signed for), there are portions of the MDS that may be verified with the medical record and/or resident/staff/family inte rview as appropr iate. For these se ctions, the person sig ning the a ttestation m ust review t he information t o assure accuracy and sign for those portions on t he date the review was conduc ted. For sec tions requiring reside nt inter views, the person signing t he attestation for completion of that section should i nterview the r esident to ensure the accur acy of information and sign on the da te this verification occur red. Z0500: Signature of RN Ass essme nt Coor dinator Verifying Assessment Comp letion Item Rationale Federal regulation requ ires the RN assessm ent coordina tor to sign and thereby cer tify that the assessment is complete. Step s for Asses sment 1. Verify that a ll items on this ass essment are complete. 2. Verify that Item Z0400 ( Signature of Persons Completing the Assessm ent) cont ains attestation f or all MDS sec tions. Coding Instructions For Z0500B, use the actual date that the MDS was completed, reviewed, and signed as complete by the RN assessment coordinator. This date must be equal to the latest date at Z0400 or later than the date(s) at Z0400, which documents when portions of the assessment information were compl eted by assessment team members . If for some reason the MDS cannot be signed by the RN assessment coordinator on the date it is completed, the RN assessment coordinator should use the actual date that it is signed. Coding Tips The RN asses sment coo rdinat or is not certifying the accur acy of portions of the assessm ent that were c ompleted by other health professiona ls. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 3: MDS Items [Z] October 2019 Page Z-7 Z0500: Signature of RN Ass essme nt Coor dinator Verifying Assessment Comp letion Nursing hom es may use elec or medical ding the MDS, when per mitted to do so by state and local law and when authori zed by the nur sing home's policy.

The results of the assess ment, which m ust accura tely reflect the r esident 's status and nee ds, are to be used to deve lop, re view, and revi se each res ident's comprehensive p lan of care. This chap ter provides information about the Ca re Area Assess ments (C AAs), Care Area Triggers (CATs), and the proc ess for car e plan developm ent for nursing hom e resid ents. 4.2 Overview of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) and Care Area Assessments (CAAs) As discusse d in Chapter 1, the upda ted Resident Assessm ent Instrum ent (RAI) consis ts of three basic co mponents: 1) the Mini mum Data Set ( MDS) Version 3.0, 2) the Care Area Assessm ent (CAA) process, and 3) the RAI Utili zation Gui delin es. The RAI -related process es help sta ff identify key in formation about re sidents as a b asis for ident ifying re sident-speci fic issues and objec tives. In accorda nce with 42 CFR 483.21(b) the facility must devel op a co mprehensive c are plan f or eac h reside nt that in cludes measurable object ives a nd timetabl es to m eet a r esident 's medical, nursing, and m ental and ps ychosoci al needs tha t are i denti fied in the co mprehensive assessm ent. The serv ices that a re to be f urnished t o attain or m aintain the resident 's highest pract icable physic al, mental, and ps ychosoci serv ices that wou ld otherwise be requ ired but are n ot provided due to the resident's exercise of rights inc luding t he right to refuse treatment. The MDS is a start ing point. The Mini mum Data Set (MDS) is a s tandardi zed in strument used to asse ss nur sing hom e residents. I t is a co llection of basic physica l (e.g., medical co nditions, mood, and vision), f unctional (e.g., a ctivities of daily living, behavio r), and psychosoc ial (e.g., preference s, goals, and i nteres ts) information about re sidents. For exa mple, asses sing a resident 's orientation a nd rec all helps sta ff complete p ortions of the MDS that r elate to cogni tion (Sect ion C), and weighing a re sident and i dentifying his or her f ood i ntake h elps staff complete po rtions CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 2 of the MDS rel ated to nutr itional status (Sect ion K). When it is co mplete d, the MDS provides a foundation f or a m ore thorough ass essment and the developm ent of an individua lized care plan. The MDS 3.0 m anual explains in de tail how to c omplete the MDS. The in formation in the MDS consti tutes t he core of the -speci fied Res ident Assessm ent Instrum ent (RAI). Based on asses sing the re sident, the MDS i denti fies actual or potent ial areas of concer n. The rem ainder of the RAI process supports the efforts of nursing home staff, health pro fessiona ls, and pract itioners to further assess t hese t rigge red are as of concern in order to identify, to the e xtent pos sible, whether t he findings r epresent a problem or risk r equiring further i nterven tion, as well as the causes and risk factors related to t he triggered care a rea u nder ass essment. These c onclusions then provide the ba sis for developing an individual ized care plan for each resi dent. The C AA process fram ework. The CAA process provides a framework for guiding the rev iew of trigge red areas, and c larification of a resident 's functional s tatus and r elated causes of impairments. It also prov ides a bas is for additional ass essment of potent ial iss ues, i ncluding related risk factors. The assessm ent of the caus es and cont ributing f actors gives the interdisciplinary t eam (IDT) additi onal in formation to he lp them develop a co mprehensive plan of care. When i mplemented properl y, the CAA process s hould help s taff: Consider e ach resi dent a s a whole, with unique c harac teristics and st rengths that affect his or her capacity to functio n; Identify are as of concern that m ay warrant inter ventions ; Develop, to the ex tent possible, interventions to help i mprove, sta bilize, or preve nt decli ne in physic al, functiona l, and psychosoci al well -being, i n the cont ext of the resident's condition, cho ices, and p reference s for interve ntion s; and Address the need and de sire f or other important conside rations, such as a dvanced c are planning a nd pal liative care; e.g., s ymptom relief and pain m anage ment. 4.3 What Are the Care Area Assessments (CAAs)? The co mpleted MDS must be an alyzed and co mbined with ot her relevant information to develop an indi vidua lized care pl an. To help nursing f aciliti es apply assessm ent data colle cted on the MDS, Care Area Assess ments (C AAs) are t riggered respons es to items coded on the MDS speci fic to a resident 's possible prob lems, needs or streng ths. S pecific \"C AT logic\" f or each ca re area is ide ntified under s ection 4.10 ( The Twenty Care Area s). The C AAs re flect condi tions, symptoms, and other a reas of concer n that a re common in nursing hom e residents and are commonly identi fied or suggested b y MDS f indings. Int erpreting and addressing the c are a reas identified by the C ATs is the ba sis of the Care Area Assessm ent proces s, and can help provide additional information f or the de velopment of an individual ized care plan.

Return to Community Referral The CAA process does not m andate any speci fic tool for co mpleting the f urther asse ssment of the triggered areas, n or does it provi de any spec ific guidance on how to understand or i nterp ret the triggered areas. Instead, facilities are in structed to ide ntify and use t ools th at are current and grounded in curre nt clinical standar ds of pract es. When hese evidenc e-based resour pr oblem solving and deci sion m aking (of ten cal led \"critical t hinking \") sk ills is im perative. By statu te, the RAI must be co mpleted within 14 days of admission. As an integral part of the RAI, C AAs m ust be co mpleted and docu mented within t he same time frame. While a workup cannot a lways be co mpleted within 14 days, it is expected that nur sing hom es will a ssess r esident needs, plan care and implement int erventions in a ti mely m anner. CAAs a re not required for Medica re PPS assessments. They a re required only for OBRA comp rehensive ass essments (A dmission, Annual, Signi in Statu s, or Significa nt Cor rection of a Prior Comp rehens ive). How ever, when a Medica re PPS assessm ent is combined with an O BRA comp rehensive a ssessme nt, the CAAs must be comple ted in order to meet the requirements of the OBRA comp rehensive ass essment. 4.4 What Does the CAA Process Involve? Facilities use the f inding s from the c omprehens ive assess ment to deve lop an indi viduali zed car e plan to m eet each r esident's needs ( 42 CFR 483.20( d)). The CAA process discus sed in this manual ref ers to ide ntifying and cl arifying ar eas of concern t hat ar e triggered based on how speci fic MDS items are coded on the MDS.

Care Area Trigge rs (CATs) iden tify condi tions t hat m ay require further evalu ation because they may have an impact on speci fic issues and/or conditions, or t he risk of issues and/or conditions for the re sident. Each t riggered i tem must be ass essed f urther through t he use of the CAA process to facilitate care plan d ecision m aking, but it m ay or may not repre sent a condi tion that should or will be ad dressed in the care plan. The signi ficance and cau ses of any given t rigger may vary f or different res idents or in different si tuations f or the sam e resident. Di fferent C ATs may have common causes, or va rious ite ms associ ated wi th sever al CATs may be connected. CATs provide a \" flag\" f or the IDT members, indicating that the triggered care a rea n eeds to be assessed m ore co mplete ly prior to m aking c are planning de cisions. Furt her ass essment of a triggered c are area may identi fy cau ses, risk f actors, and com plications associated wi th the c are area con dition. The plan of care then address es these f actors with the go al of promoting the resident 's highest pr acticable l evel of functioning : (1) i mprove ment where possibl e or (2) mainten ance and pre vention of avoidable decl ines. A risk f actor increases the chances of having a n egative o utcome or com plication. For exam ple, impaired bed mobility may increase the r isk of getting a pr essure u lcer/injury . In this e xample, impaired bed m obility is the risk f actor, unre lieved press ure is t he ef fect of the co mpromised bed mobilit y, and the pote ntial pressure ulce r is the complication. A care ar ea issue/con dition (e.g., f alls) may result f rom a single unde rlying cause ( e.g., administra tion of a new medication t hat cau ses dizzines s) or f rom a com bination of multiple factors ( e.g., new medication, r esident f orgot wa lker, bed too high or too l ow, etc.). There can also be a s ingle cau se of multiple triggers and i mpairments. For exa mple, hypothyroi dism is an exam ple of a co mmon, potent ially reversi ble m edical condi tion that c an have dive rse physic al, functional, a nd psychos ocial complications. Thus, if a resi dent has hypot hyroidis m, it is possi ble that the M DS might trigger any or s everal of the following CAAs depending on whe ther or not the hypoth yroidism B Symptoms (#10), #19). Even if the MDS does not t rigger a particular care area, the f acility can use the CAA process and resour ces at any ti me to f urther assess the r esident. Recognizing the conne ction among t hese sy mptom s and treat ing the unde rlying caus e(s) to the extent p ossible, can h elp address com plica tions and i mprove the re sident's outcom e. Conversel y, failing to recognize t he links and ins tead tr ying to address the triggers or MDS f indings in isolation m ay have l ittle if any benef it for the r esident with h ypothyroi dism or other c omplex or mixed causes of impaired behavior , cogni tion, a nd m ood. For exa mple, it is necessary to a ssess a resi dent's orientation a nd rec all in order to complete portions of the MDS that relate to cognitive pat terns (Se ction C) and to obtain a resident's weig ht and ident ify his or he r food intake in order to complete MDS ite ms related to nut ritional status (Sect ion K).

If the Nutr itional St atus (# 12) CAA also trig gered, due to wei ght loss and t he resi dent being f ound t o have de lirium, then it i s possib le that both findings could have a comm on cause (e.g., an inf ection or m edication si de effects), th at delirium resulted in impaired nut ritional status, or tha t impaired n utritional status led to de lirium, or sti ll other pos sibilities. Thus, ident ifying the seque nce of events i s essen tial to understan ding causes and choosi ng appropr iate interventions. The RAI is not int ended to provi de diagnos tic advice, nor is it intended to speci fy which triggered a reas may be related to one another or a nd how those proble ms relat e to unde rlying causes. It is up to the IDT, including the res ident's physic ian, to det ermine these con nections and underl ying c auses as they assess the triggered c are area s and any other areas per tinent to the individual re sident. Not all trig gers ide ntify deficits or p roblems.

Per the OB RA statute, the resident 's assessm ent must be conducted or coordinated by a registered nurse (RN) with t he appropr iate par ticipation of health p rofessionals. It is common prac tice fo r facilities to assign speci fic MDS items or portio n(s) of i tems (and subsequent ly CAAs associated w ith those i tems) to those of various dis ciplines (e.g., t he die titian completes t he Nutr itional Status and Feeding Tube CAAs, if trigg ered). The proper assess ment and manag ement of C AAs that a re trigge red for a given r esident m ay involve a spects of diag nosis and t reatment selection that e xceed the scope of training or pr actice of any one dis cipline involved in the ca re (for exam ple, identi fying speci fic medical condi tions or m edication si de effects that c ause anorex ia leading to a resident 's weight los s). It is the f acility's responsibi lity to obtain the input th at is n eeded f or cli nical decision m aking (e.g., i denti fying c auses and s electing interventions ) that is cons istent with relevant c linical stand ards of pract ice. For exa mple, a physi cian may need to get a m ore det ailed history or p erform a phy sical exam ination in order to es tablish or conf irm a diagnosis and/or related co mplications.

The f acility should be able to provide s urveyors the resources t hat they have u sed upon re quest as p art of the surve y review process .1 CAA documenta tion. CAA documentat ion he lps to exp lain the ba sis for the c are pl an by showing how the IDT deter mined t hat the un derlying causes, cont ributing factors, and risk factors were rel ated to the care area c ondition f or a speci fic residen t; for example, the docum entation should i ndicat e the b asis for the se deci sions, why the f inding(s) r equire(s) an intervention, and the r ationale( s) for selec ting s pecific interventions. Based on the re view of the comprehensive assess ment, the IDT and the res ident and/ or the resident 's represen tative deter mine the area s that require care plan i nterv ention( s) and develop, r evise, or co ntinue the individual ized care plan. Relevant d ocumentation for each t riggered CAA descri bes: causes and contrib uting factors; The nature of issue or condi tion ( may include presen ce or lack of objective data and subje ctive c omplaint s). In other wor ds, what exac tly is the issue/problem for this r esident and why is i t a pro blem; Complications a ffecting or caused by the ca re are a for this r esident; Risk f actors related to the presence of the condi tion that a ffects the s taff's deci sion to proceed to care p lanning ; 1 In Appendix C, CMS has provided CAA resources that faci lities may choose to use but that are neither mandatory nor endorsed by the government. Please note that Appendix C does not provide an all-inclusive list. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 7 Factors that must be co nsidered in de veloping individua lized care inclu ding t he deci sion to care plan or not to c are plan va rious findings f or the individ ual resident; The need f or addi tional e valua tion by the at tendi ng iate; The resou rce(s), essment tool (s) used f or deci sion-making, and conclusions that arose f rom performing the CAA; Completion of Section V (CAA S ummary; see Chapter 3 f or coding ins tructions ) of t he MDS. Written doc umentation of the CAA findings and deci sion m aking proce ss may appear anywhere in a res ident's record; fo r exam ple, in disci pline-speci fic flow sheets, p rogress not es, the c are plan sum mary notes, a C AA summary narr ative, etc. Nursing hom es should use a f ormat that provides the information as out lined in this manual and t he State Oper ations Manual (SOM). If it is n ot clear that a fa cility's doc umentation pr ovides t his information, surveyors m ay ask facility sta ff to provi de such evidenc e. Use the \"L ocation and Date of CAA Documentat ion\" colum n on the CAA Summary (Section V of the MDS 3.0) to not e where the C AA information and de cision m aking docum entation can be found in the resident 's record. Also i ndica te in t he colu mn \"Care Plan ning Decision\" whether t he triggered c are area is ad dressed in the care plan. 4.6 When Is the RAI Not Enough? Federal requirements su pport a nur sing home's ongoing resp onsibi lity to assess r esidents. The r egulation requi res that \"ea ch resi dent m ust receive and the facility must provi de the nece ssary care and services to a hig hest l-being, in acc ordance with the c omprehens ive assess ment and plan of care\" (42 CFR 483.25). Services pr ovided or a rranged by the nursing hom e must also m eet pro fessional s tandards of quality. Per 42 CFR 483.7 0(b), the f acility m ust opera te and provide s ervices in co mplian ce with all ap plicable Feder al, State, and local laws, reg ulations, and c odes, and w ith accepted professional standar ds and princ iples that apply to prof essionals provid ing servi ces in such a facility. Fur thermore, surveyor guida nce within OBRA (e.g., 42 C and 483.45(d) U Medic ations) identifies additio nal elements of assessm ent and care re lated to s pecific iss ues an d/or conditions that are c onsiste nt wi th professional standar ds. Theref ore, ble for assessi ng and addre ssing a ll care issues that are relevant to indi vidual residents, regardle ss of whether or not they a re covered by t he RAI (42 CFR 483.20(b)), i ncluding m of the RAI -related in struments. The RAI provides tools r elated to asse ssment inclu ding s ubstan tial de tail for co mpleting the M DS, how C ATs are t riggered, and a fra mework for the CAA process. H oweve r, the process of completing the MDS and relat ed por tions of the CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 8 RAI does not cons titute t he ent ire assess ment that m ay be needed to addre ss issu es and m anage the ca re of individua l residents. Neither the MDS nor the re mainder of the RAI includes a ll of the steps, r elevant f actors, analyses, or conclu sions needed f or clinical prob lem solving and deci sion making f or the care of nursing hom e resi dents. By the mselves, nei ther the MDS nor the CAA process pro vide su fficient information to det ermine if the f indings f rom the MDS are p roblematic or merely in cidental, or if there are m ultiple causes of a single t rigger or m ultiple t rigger s related to one or sever al cau ses. Although a detai led h istory is o ften essen tial to correctly identify and a ddress ca uses of symptoms, the RAI was not desig ned to capt ure a history (chronology) of a resi dent's symptoms and i mpairments. Thus, i t can po tentially be m isleading or pr oblematic to care plan i ndividua l MDS f indings or CAAs without any addi tional thought or investi gation. The MDS may not t rigger every relevant iss ue Not all trig gers are clinically s ignificant The MDS is not a diag nostic tool or treatment select ion gui de The MDS does not i dentify causa tion or hist ory of proble ms Although f acilities have the l atitude t o choose a pproaches to the CAA process, co mpliance with various OBRA requir ements can be enhanced by using ad ditional problem solving MDS indings and CAAs. Table 2 provides a fra mework f or a m ore co mplete app roach to c linical pro blem solving and deci sion making essenti al to the a ppropri ate care of individuals with multiple and/or co mplex ill nesses and i mpairments. 4.7 The RAI and Care Planning As required at 42 CFR 483.21(b), the c omprehens ive care plan is an i nterdisciplinary communication tool. It must inclu de m easurable objec tives and ti me frames and must des cribe the ser vices that a re to be f urnished t o attain or m aintain the resident 's highest pr acticable physic al, mental, and ps ychosoci al wel l-being. The care plan must be rev iewed and r evised perio dical ly, and the s ervices pro vided or ar ranged must be c onsiste nt with each r esident's written plan of care. Ref er to 42 CFR 483.20(d), which notes that a n ursing home must m aintain all resident a ssessm ents com pleted w ithin t he previous 15 m onths in t he resident's active record and use the results of the assessm ents to develop, r eview , and revise the comprehensive plan of care. Regul atory requi rements relat ed to ca re planning in nur sing ho mes are l ocated at 42 CFR 4 83.20(b)(1) and (2) and a re spec ified in the interpretive guidel ines (F tags) in of the St ate Operat ions M anual (SOM).

The f ollowing key steps and conside rations m ay help the IDT develop t he care plan af ter completing t he co mprehensive a ssessment: 1) Care Plan g oals should be m easurable. The IDT may agree on int ermediate go al(s) that will lead to outcom e obje ctives. Intermediat e goal( s) and must be per tinent to the preferences, condi tion, a nd situa tion (i.e., not ju st auto matical ly applied without r egard for the ir individua l relevance), m easurab le, and have a t ime frame for co mpletion or eval uation. 2) Care plan g oal statem ents should incl ude the subject ( first or third pe rson), the verb, the m odifi ers, the and the goal(s) . Example: Subject Verb Modifiers Time frame Goal Mr. Jones OR I will walk fifty feet daily with the help of one nursing assistant the next 30 days in order to maintain continence and eat in the dining area 3) A separat e care p lan is not neces sarily requi red for each area that triggers a CAA. Since a single trigger c an have m ultiple cau ses and cont ributing factors a nd m ultiple ite ms can have a co mmon cause or related risk fa ctors, it is a cceptable and may sometimes be m ore appropri ate to a ddress m ultiple iss ues wi thin a sin gle care plan seg ment or to cross reference r elated interventions from several ca re plan segments. For exa mple, if impaired ADL function, m ood sta te, falls and a ltered nut ritional status are all deter mined to be caused by an in fection and m edicat ion-related adver se consequence s, it m ay be appropr iate to have a si ngle c are plan that ad dresses these issues in relation to the common causes. 4) The RN co ordinator is required to si gn and date the Care Ar ea Assess ment (CAA) Summary after a ll trig gered CAAs have been r eviewed to c ertify completion of the comprehensive assess ment (CAAs Co mpletion D ate, V0200B2). Fac ilities have 7 days after com pleting the RAI asses sment to develop or r evise the r esident's c are plan. Facilities should us e the d ate at V0200B2 to deter mine the date a t V0200C2 by which the care plan m ust be co mpleted (V0200B2 + 7 days). 5) The 7 -day r equire ment for co mpletion or m odification of the care plan applies to the Admission, SCSA, S CPA, and/or Annual RAI assess ments. A new care plan does CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 12 not need to be develope d after each SCSA, S CPA, or Annual rea ssessm ent. Ins tead, the nursing hom e may revise an existing c are plan using the results of the latest comprehensive assess ment. 6) The resident's care plan must be reviewed after each assessment, as required by \u00a7483.20, except discharge assessments, and revised based on changing goals, preferences and needs of the resident and in response to current interventions. 7) Residents' preferences and goals may change throughout their stay, so facilities should have ongoing discussions with the resident and resident representative, if applicable, so that changes can be reflect ed in the comprehensive care plan. 8) If the RAI (MDS and C AAs) is not completed until the l ast possible da te (the end of calend ar day 14 of the s tay), m any of the appropr iate ca re area issues, risk factors , or condi tions may have already been identified, c auses m ay have been considered, a nd a preliminary care plan a nd rel ated interventions may have b een in itiated. A complete care plan is re quired no la ter than 7 da ys after the RAI is co mpleted. 9) Review of the CAAs a fter co mpleting the MDS m ay raise questions about the n eed to modify or continue services. Condi tions t hat originally triggered t he CAA may no longer be pr esent b ecause they r esolved, or cons iderat ion of alternative ca uses m ay be neces sary because the initial appr oach to an issue, risk, or c ondition did not work or was not f ully implemented. 10) On the Annual ass essment, if a resident t rigge rs the sam e CAA(s) that triggered on the last comprehensi ve assessm ent, the CAA should be re viewed again. Even if the CAA is triggered f or the same reason (no di fference in MDS response s), there m ay be a new or changed r elated event id entified dur ing CAA review that m ight call f or a revi sion to the resident's plan of care. The IDT with the input of the resi dent, family or re sident's repre sentative det ermines when a p al problem needs to be addr essed in the ca re plan. 11) The RN Co ordin ator for the CAA pr ocess (V020 0B1) does not need to be the sam e RN as the RN Assessm ent Coordinat or sment (Z0500). The date e ntered in V0200B2 on the CAA S ummary is the date on which t he RN Coordinator f or the CAA process veri fied completion of the CAAs, which incl udes assessment of each t rigge red car e area and c ompletion of the locat ion and date of the CAA assessm ent doc umentation section. See Chapter 2 f or det ailed instr uctions on the RAI co mpletion schedule. 12) The Signat ure of Person Completing Care Plan Deci sion (V0200C1) can be that of any person(s ) who f acilitates the ca re plan de cision m aking. It is an i nterdisciplinary process. The date entered in V0200C2 is the day t he RN certi fies that the CAAs have been completed and t he day V0200C 1 is signed. 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Based on t he preceding discus sions i n this Chap ter, the f ollowing su mmarizes the s teps invol ved in the CAA process, f or those f acilities th at cho ose to use the CAA resources in this m anual. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 13 Please note: Because MDS 3.0 trigger logic is complex, pl ease r efer to the C AT Logic tables w ithin each CAA descrip tion (Section 4 .10) for detailed inform ation on trigger s. Step 1: Id entification of Trigge red C AAs. After co mpleting the MDS, ident ify triggered ca re areas. Many facilities w ill use auto mated sy stems to t rigger C AAs. The resulting set of trigge red CAAs generated by t he software pr ogram should be m atched again st the trigger de finitions to make sure that t riggered CAAs have been co rrectly ide ntified. CMS has developed te st files f or facility va lidation of a software prog ram's trigge ring logic. G eneral ly, soft ware vendo rs use the se test fi les to test their systems, but the nursing hom e is r espons ible for ensur ing th at the software is triggering correctly. It is prude nt to consi der whether or not the sof tware has triggered r elevant CAAs f or individua l residents. F or exam ple, did the sof tware m iss so me CAAs you thought s hould have been triggered? Do som e of the CAAs seem to be m issing and a re there ot her C AAs trigge red that you did not expe ct? For nursing hom es that d o not use an auto mated system , the C AT logic wil l provi de the information necess ary to manually i denti fy triggered CAAs. The C AT logic is f ound within t he CAT logic ta bles of each care a rea's descri ption in section 4.10. These tabl es provide the MDS items that t rigger the 20 (twenty) c are areas. F acilities are n ot required to use this information or to maintain i t in the res ident's clinical record. R ather, the information is a resour ce that may be used by the IDT members to de termine which CAAs are tri ggered f rom a completed MDS. To identi fy the triggered CAAs manually u sing the CAT logic table s in s ection 4.10: 1. Compare the co mpleted MDS with the CAT logic tab les to deter mine which CAAs have been t riggered for revi ew. 2. The C AT logic ta ble wi ll list the MDS item numbers and spe cific codes that wi ll trigger the particular CAA. To ide ntify a triggered CAA, match the resident's MDS it em responses with the MDS ite m num ber(s) and code (s) for each ca re area as listed in the C AT logic ta bles within s ection 4.10. If a par ticular item response matches a code in the C AT logic ta ble for a particular care area, read through t he logic s tatement and qual ifiers ( i.e., ' IF', 'AND', and 'OR') f or that par ticular care a rea to deter mine if that c are a rea is t riggered. This m eans that further as sessment using the CAA process is requ ired for that particular care area. 3. Note which CAAs are tr iggered by par ticular MDS ite ms. If desired, c ircle or highlig ht the trigger indicator or the title of the col umn. 4. Continue through the C AT logic ta bles for each of the 20 ( twenty) c are areas matching recor ded M DS item responses with trigger indicators u ntil all triggered CAAs have been identified. 5. When the C AT logic re view is co mpleted, docum ent on the C AA Summa ry which C AAs were t riggered by check ing the boxes in the c olumn titled \"Care Area Triggered.\" Step 2: Analysis o f Trigge red CA As. Review a trig gered C AA by doing an i n-depth, reside nt- speci fic assessment of the triggered condition in t erms of the potent ial need for care plan interventions. While re viewing the C AA, consider what MDS ite ms caus ed the CAA to be triggered. This is a lso an opportunit y to consi der any iss ues and/or condi tions t hat m ay cont ribute to the t rigge red condi tion, but are n ot necess arily captured in M DS data. Review of CAAs helps CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 14 staff to dec ide if care pl an int ervention is nece ssary, and wha t types of interven tion m ay be appropri ate. Using the r esults of the assessm ent can help t he interdisci plinary t eam (IDT) and the resident and/or r esident's representative to identi fy areas of concern t hat: Warrant i ntervention; Affect the re siden t's capacity to help iden tify and i mplement interve ntions to improve, stabilize, or maintain cu rrent level of function to t he extent p ossible, based upon the resident's condition and choices and preference s for inter ventions; Can help to m inimize the onset or pr ogression of impairments and disa bilities; and Can help to address the need and de sire f or other speci alized servi ces (e.g. pal liative care, inclu ding s ymptom relief and pain m anagem ent). Use the in formation gat hered thus fa r to m ake a clear i ssue or problem statement. An issue or problem is different f rom a finding (e.g., a singl e piece of information f rom the MDS or a tes t result). The chief complaint (e.g., t he resi dent h as a headache , is vom iting, or is not pa rticipating in act ivities) is not t he same thing as an issue or problem statement that c learly iden tifies the situation. Trying to c are plan a chief complaint m ay lead to inappropr iate, irrelevant, or proble matic interventions. Example: Chief Complaint: New onset of falls Problem S tatemen t: Reside nt cu rrently f alling 2-3 times per week. Fal ls are p receded by lightheadedness. Most f alls occu rred after she st ood up and sta rted walk ing; a f ew falls occu rred while a ttempting to s tand up f rom a sitting or lying positi on. It is clear that the probl em state ment ref lects asse ssment findings f rom which the inve stigation may continue and r elevant concl usions drawn. While the C AAs can help the IDT identi fy conditions or f indings that could potent ially be a problem or risk f or the re sident, addi tional thoug ht is n eeded t o define the se issues and deter mine whether and to what ex tent the care area issue a nd/or conditi on is a pro blem or issue needing an intervention (asse ssment, tes ting, t reatment, etc.) or si mply a m inor or inconsequent ial finding that doe s not need add itional c are planning. For e xample, a resident m ay exhibit s adness without being dep ressed or m ay appear to be underweight despi te hav ing a sta ble nutr itional status consis tent w ith their past histor y. The IDT should ident ify and docum ent the f unctional and behavior al implica tions identi ment possibi lities, and so f orth (e.g., how t he condi tion is a pro blem for the re sident; how t he condi tion limits or im pairs the res ident's ability to complete acti vities of daily livin g; or how the condi tion affects the resident's well-being in s ome way). Identify links among triggers and t heir causes. C MS does not requi re that each ca re area triggered be care planned separ ately. The IDT may find duri ng the ir disc ussions t hat several proble matic issues an d/or condi tions have a r elated cause, or they m ight identi fy that those issu es and/or condi tions s tand a lone and a re unrel ated. Goals and a pproaches f or each pro blematic iss ue CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 4: CAA Process and Care Planning October 2019 Page 4- 15 and/or condi tion m ay overlap, and c onsequent ly the IDT may decide to a ddress t he pr oblematic issues an d/or condi tions collectively in the c are plan. For exa mple, behavior , mood, cognition, com municat ion, a ial well- being typic ally have co mmon risk f actors and co mmon or clos ely related causes of related impairments. Thus, the followi ng C ATs natura lly coex ist and could be co mbined, assessed through the CAA process, and care pl anned toget her as a s tarting point f or dent: (CAA #7), Mood State (CAA #8) Behavior al Symptoms (CAA #9), and Psychotropi c Drug Use (CAA #17). Usuall y, illnesses and impairments happen in se quence ( i.e., one thing leads to an other, which leads to anot her, and so on). The sy mptom or tri gger o ften represen ts only the m ost re cent or most appar ent finding in a ser ies of complica tions or re lated impair ments. Thus, a det ailed history is often essen tial to ide ntifying causes and selec ting the m ost benefici al inter ventions, e.g., the se quence over time of how the resi dent developed incontinenc e, pain, or anor exia. While the MDS p resents dive rse information about re sidents, and t he CAAs c over va rious implica tions and co mplications, neit her one is de signed to g ive a det ailed or chronol ogical m edica l, psychosoci al, or pe rsonal history.

There ar e sever al types of urinary incont inence (e.g., functional, overflow, stress, and u rge) and t he individua l resident m ay experience m ore than one t ype at a time (mixed incont inenc e). Although a ging a ffects t he urin ary tract and increases the p otential for uri nary inco ntinence, urinary incontinenc e itself is not a nor mal part of aging. Urin ary inco ntinence can be a risk f actor for various c omplica tions, including skin ras hes, falls, and s ocial isolation. O ften, it i s at l east partially co rrectable. Incontinenc e may affect a resident 's psychologi cal well-being a nd soci al interactions. Incont inence also m ay lead to t he poten tially troubling use of indwelling cath eters, which can i ncreas e the r isk of life threatening in fectio ns.

Behavioral Symptoms In the world at la rge, human behavior var ies widely and is often dys functiona l and pr oblematic. While beha vior m ay sometimes be rel ated to or c aused by i llness, behavi or itself is only a symptom and not a di sease. The MDS only identif ies cer tain behaviors , but is not intended to deter mine the signi ficance of behavi ors, in cluding whether t hey are pro blematic and need an intervention. Theref ore, i t is ntial to in det ail in orde r to deter mine whether, and why, behavior is probl ematic and to iden tify underl ying cau ses. The behavior C AA focuses on potent ially proble matic behavi ors in the f ollow ing area s: wandering (e.g., m oving with no r ational purpo se, seem ingly being obl ivious to needs or sa fety), verbal abuse (e.g., threat ening, s cream ing at, or cur sing other s), phys ical abu se (e.g., hit ting, s hoving, kicking, s cratching, or s exually ab using other s), other be havioral sy mptom s not di rected at othe rs (e.g., m aking disrupt ive sounds or noises, sc ream ing out, s mearing or throwing f ood o r feces, hoarding, r umm aging through othe r's belonging s), inappropr iate pub lic a nd rej ection of care (e.g., verbal or p hysical resistance to taking medicati ons, taking injections, c ompleting a variety of activities of daily l iving or eatin g).

Feeding Tubes This CAA focuses on t he long -term (greater than 1 month) use of feeding tubes. It is important to balance the bene fits and risks of feeding tubes in individual re sidents in de ciding whe ther to make such an int ervention a part of the plan of care. In som e acute and longer t erm situations, feeding tube s may provide adequa te nutrition that cannot be obtained by other m eans. In other circu mstances, feeding t ubes m ay not enhance s urviva l or i mprove qua lity of life, e.g., in individuals with advanc ed de mentia. Also, f eeding tubes can be associ ated with div erse complications that m ay further i mpair qua lity of life or adv ersely i mpact surviv al.

Physical Restraints A physical restraint is defined as any manual method or phys ical or m echanical device, m aterial, or equipm ent at tached or adjacent to the res ident's body that the indi vidua l cannot remove eas ily and that restricts freedom of m ovement or nor mal acce ss to one 's bod y. The i mportant conside ration is the effect of the de vice on t he resident, and not the purp ose f or which the devi ce was placed on the re sident. This cate gory also includes the use of passive restraints such as ch airs that prevent rising. Physical restraints are only ra rely indicat ed, and a t most, should be used only as a sh ort-term, temporary i nterve ntion to treat a resident's medical symptoms. They should not be us ed for purposes of disci pline or convenienc e. Be fore a r eside nt is restrained, t he facility must determine the pre sence of a speci fic medical sy mptom that would requi re the u se of the res traint and how the use of the res traint w ould t reat the m edical sy mptom, protect t he res ident's safety, and assi st the res ident in attaining or m aintain ing his or he r highest pra cticable level of physical a nd psychosoci al wel l-being. Restr aints ar e often ass ociat ed with negati ve physical and psychosoci al outcom es (e.g., loss of muscle m ass, contr actures, lesse ned mobility and sta mina, i mpaired balance, skin br eakdown, consti patio n, and incontinence). Adverse psych osocial effects of restr aint use m ay include a feeling of shame, hopelessness, and s tigmatiza tion as well as agitation.

In addi tion, a revi ew of underly ing needs, r isks, or iss ues/condi tions may help to identify oth er pote ntial kinds of treat ments. The ultimate go al is to eliminate r estraint use by employing alte rnatives. When eli mination of restraints is not possible, a ssessment must res ult in using the least restrictive device pos sible. 19.

Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and hospitals with a swing bed agreement (swing beds) are required to transmit additional MDS assessments for all Medicare beneficiaries in a Part A stay reimbursable u nder the SNF Prospective Payment System (PPS). 5.1 Transmitting MDS Data All Medicare and/or Medicaid -certified nursing homes and swing beds, or agents of those facilities, must transmit required MDS data records to CMS' Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system. Required MDS records are those assessments and tracking records that are mandated under OBRA and SNF PPS. Providers will submit the Optional State Assessment (OSA) records to the QIES ASAP system just as they submit all other MDS assessments. The OSA is not a Federally required assessment. Each State will determine if the OSA is required and when this assessment must be completed. Assessments that are completed for purposes other than OBRA and SNF PPS reasons are not to be submitted, e.g., private insurance, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage Plans. After completion of the required assessment and/or tracking records, each provider must create electronic transmission files that mee t the requirements detailed in the current MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specifications a vailable on the CMS -Assessment The provider indicates the certification or licensure of the unit on which the resident resides in item A0410, Unit Certification or Licensure Designation. In addition to reflecting certification or licensure of the unit, this item indicates the sub mission authority for a record. Value = 1 Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified and MDS data is not required by the State. Value = 2 Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State . Value = 3 Unit is Med icare and/or Medicaid certified. See Chapter 3 for details concerning the coding of item A0410, Unit Certification or Licensure Designation. Note: CMS certified Swing Bed unit assessments are always Value 3, Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified. Providers must establish communication with the QIES ASAP system in order to submit a file. This is accomplished by using specialized communications software and hardware and the CMS wide area network. Details about these processes are available on the QIES Technical Support Office (QTSO) website at: https://qtso.cms.gov/ . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 2 Once communication is established with the QIES ASAP system, the provider can access the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page in the MDS system. This site allows providers to subm it MDS assessment data and access various information sources such as Bulletins and Questions and Answers. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 Provider User's Guide provides more detailed information about the MDS system. It is available on the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page and on the QTSO MDS 3.0 we bsite at https://qtso.cms.gov/providers/nur sing- home -mdsswing- bed-providers/reference- manuals . When the transmission file is received by the QIES ASAP system, the system performs a series of validation edits to evaluate whether or not the data submitted meet the required standards. MDS records are edited to verify that clinical responses are within valid ranges and are consistent, dates are reasonable, and records are in the proper order with regard to records that were previously accepted by the QIES ASAP system for the same resident. The provider is notified of the results of this evaluation by err or and warning messages on a Final Validation Report. All error and warning messages are detailed and explained in Section 5 of the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 Provider User's Guide . 5.2 Timeliness Criteria In accordance with the requirements at 42 CFR \u00a7483.20(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3), long -term care facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs must meet the following conditions: Completion Timing: \u2014 For all non- Admission OBRA and PPS assessments, the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B) must be no later than 14 days after the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) (A2300). \u2014 For the Admission assessment, the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B) must be no later than 13 days after the Entry Date (A1600). \u2014 For the Admission assessment, the Care Area Assessment (CAA ) Completion Date (V0200B2) must be no later more than 13 days after the Entry Date (A1600). For the Annual assessment, the CAA Completion Date (V0200B2) must be no later than 14 days after the ARD (A2300). \u2014 For the other comprehensive MDS assessments, Significant Change in Status Assessment and Significant Correction to Prior Comprehensive Assessment, the CAA Completion Date (V0200B2) must be no later than 14 days from the ARD (A2300) and no later than 14 days from the determination date of the significant change in status or the significant error, respectively. \u2014 For Entry and Death in Facility tracking records, the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B) must be no later than 7 days from the Event Date (A1600 for an entry record; A2000 for a Death i n Facility tracking record). State Requirements : Many states have established additional MDS requirements for Medicaid payment and/or quality monitoring purposes. For information on state requirements, contact your State RAI Coordinator. (See Appendix B for a list of State RAI Coordinators.) CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 3 Encoding Data: Within 7 days after completing a resident's MDS assessment or tracking record, the provider must encode the MDS data (i.e., enter the information into the facility MDS software). The encoding requirements are as follows: \u2014 For a comprehensive assessment (Admission, Annual, Significant Change in Status, and Significant Correction to Prior Comprehensive), encoding must occur within 7 days after the Care Plan Completion Date (V0200C2 + 7 days). \u2014 For a Quarterly, Significant Correc tion to Prior Quarterly, Discharge, or PPS assessment, encoding must occur within 7 days after the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B + 7 days). \u2014 For a tracking record, encoding should occur within 7 days of the Event Date (A1600 + 7 days for Entry records and A2000 + 7 days for Death in Facility records). Submission Format: For submission, the MDS data must be in record and file formats that conform to standard record layouts and data dictionaries, and pass standardized edits defined by CMS and the State . Each MDS record must be a separate file in a required XML format. The submission file is a compressed ZIP file that may contain multiple XML files. See the MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specifications on the CMS MDS 3.0 website for details concerning file and record formats, XML structure, and ZIP files. Transmitting Data: Submission files are transmitted to the QIES ASAP system using the CMS wide area network. Providers must transmit all sections of the MDS 3.0 required for their State -specific instrument, including the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Summary (Section V) and all tracking or correction information. Transmission requirements apply to all MDS 3.0 records used to meet both federal and state requirements. Care plans are not required to be transmitted. \u2014 Assessmen t Transmission: Comprehensive assessments must be transmitted electronically within 14 days of the Care Plan Completion Date (V0200C2 + 14 days). All other MDS assessments must be submitted within 14 days of the MDS Completion Date (Z0500B + 14 days). \u2014 Tracking Information Transmission: For Entry and Death in Facility tracking records, information must be transmitted within 14 days of the Event Date (A1600 + 14 days for Entry records and A2000 + 14 days for Death in Facility records).

Assessment Schedule: An OBRA assessment (comprehensive or Quarterly) is due every quarter unless the resident is no longer in the facility. There must be no more than 92 days between OBRA assessments. An OBRA comprehensive assessment is due every year unless the resident is no longer in the facility. There must be no more than 366 days between comprehensive assessments. PPS asses sments follow their own schedule. See Chapter 2 for details. 5.3 Validation Edits The QIES ASAP system has validation edits designed to monitor the timeliness and accuracy of MDS record submissions. If transmitted MDS records do not meet the edit requireme nts, the system will provide error and warning messages on the provider's Final Validation Report. Initial Submission Feedback. For each file submitted, the submitter will receive confirmation that the file was received for processing and editing by the QIES ASAP system. This CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 5 confirmation information includes the file submission identification number (ID), the date and time the file was received for processing as well as the file name. Validation and Editing Process. Each time a user accesses the QIES ASAP system and transmits an MDS file, the QIES ASAP system performs three types of validation: 1. Fatal File Errors. If the file structure is unacceptable (e.g., it is not a ZIP file), the records in the ZIP file cannot be extracted, or the file cannot be read, then the file will be rejected. The Submitter Final Validation Report will list the Fatal File Errors. Files that are rejected mu st be corrected and resubmitted. 2. Fatal Record Errors. If the file structure is acceptable, then each MDS record in the file is validated individually for Fatal Record Errors. These errors include, but are not limited to: Out of range responses (e.g., the v alid codes for the item are 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the submitted value is a 6). Inconsistent relationships between items. One example is a skip pattern violation. The resident is coded as comatose (B0100 = 1) but the Brief Interview for Mental Status is conduc ted (C0100 = 1). Another example is an inconsistent date pattern, such as the resident's Birth Date (Item A0900) is later than the Entry Date (Item A1600). Fatal Record Errors result in rejection of individual records by the QIES ASAP system. The provider is informed of Fatal Record Errors on the Final Validation Report. Rejected records must be corrected and resubmitted, unless the Fatal Error is due to submission of a duplicate assessment . 3. Non-Fatal Errors (Warnings). The record is also validated for Non -Fatal Errors. Non -Fatal Errors include, but are not limited to, missing or questionable data of a non -critical nature or item consistency errors of a non -critical nature. Examples are timing errors. Timing errors for a Quarterly assessment include (a) the submission date is more than 14 days after the MDS assessment completion date (Z0500B) or (b) the assessment completion is more than 14 days after the ARD (A2300). Another example is a record sequencing error, where an Entry record (A0310F = 01) is submitt ed after a Quarterly assessment record (A0310A = 02) with no intervening Discharge assessment (A0310F = 10 or 11). Any Non- Fatal Errors are reported to the provider in the Final Validation Report as warnings. The provider must evaluate each warning to identify necessary corrective actions . Storage to the QIES ASAP System. If there are any Fatal Record Errors, the record will be rejected and not stored in the QIES ASAP system. If there are no Fatal Record Errors, the record is loaded into the QIES ASAP system, even if the record has Non -Fatal Errors (Warnings). Detailed information on the validation edits and the error and warning messages is available in the MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specifications on the CMS MDS 3.0 website and in Section 5 of the Minimu m Data Set (MDS) 3.0 Provider User's Guide on the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page and on the QTSO MDS 3.0 w ebsite. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 6 5.4 Additional Medicare Submission Requirements that Impact Billing Under the SNF PPS As stated in CFR \u00a7413.343(a) and (b), providers reimbursed under the SNF PPS \"are required to submit the resident assessment data described at \u00a7483.20.... in the manner necessary to administer the payment rate methodology described in \u00a7413.337.\" This provision includes the frequency, scope, and number of assessments required in accordance with the methodology described in CFR \u00a7413.337(c) related to the adjustment of the Federal rates for case mix. SNFs must submit assessments according to a standard schedule. This schedule must include performance of resident assessments at specified windows during the Medicare Part A stay . HIPPS Codes: Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) codes are billing codes used when submitting Medicare Part A SNF payment claims to the Par t A/Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC). The HIPPS code consists of five positions. Under PDPM, t he first position represents the Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy (PT/OT) Payment Group, the second position represents the Speech Language Pathology (SLP) Payment Group, the third position represents the Nursing Payment Group, the fourth position represents the Non- therapy Ancillary (NTA) Payment Group, and the fifth position represents the Assessment Indicator (AI) code indicating which ty pe of assessment was completed. Standard \"grouper\" logic and software for PDPM and the AI code are provided by CMS on the MDS 3.0 website. The standard grouper uses MDS 3.0 items to determine both the PDPM group and the AI code. It is anticipated that MDS 3.0 software used by the provider will incorporate the standard grouper to automatically calculate the PDPM group and AI code. Detailed logic for determining the PDPM group and AI code is provided in Chapter 6. The Medicare Part A HIPPS code (Item Z0100A) is most often used on the claim. The PDPM version code in Item Z0100B documents which version of PDPM was used to determine the PDPM payment groups represented in the Medicare Part A HIPPS code. The HIPPS code (Z0100A) and PDPM version code (Z0100B ) must be submitted to the QIES ASAP system on all Medicare PPS assessment records (indicated by A0310B = 01 or 08 ). Both of these values are validated by the QIES ASAP system. The f inal validation r eport will indicate if any of these items is in error and the correct value for an incorrect item. Note that an error in one of these items is usually a non -fatal warning and the record will still be accepted in the QIES ASAP system . The Medicare Part A SNF claim cannot be submitted until th e corresponding MDS Medicare PPS assessment has been accepted in the QIES ASAP system. The claim must include the correct HIPPS code for the assessment. If the HIPPS code on the assessment was in error, then the correct HIPPS code from the Final Validation report must be used on the claim (warning error message - 3616a). CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 7 5.5 MDS Correction Policy Once completed, edited, and accepted into the QIES ASAP system, providers may not change a previously completed MDS assessment as the resident's status changes du ring the course of the resident's stay \u2014the MDS must be accurate as of the ARD. Minor changes in the resident's status should be noted in the resident's record (e.g., in progress notes), in accordance with standards of clinical practice and documentation. S uch monitoring and documentation is a part of the provider's responsibility to provide necessary care and services. A significant change in the resident's status warrants a new comprehensive assessment (see Chapter 2 for details). It is important to rememb er that the electronic record submitted to and accepted into the QIES ASAP system is the legal assessment. Corrections made to the electronic record after QIES ASAP acceptance or to the paper copy maintained in the medical record are not recognized as proper corrections. It is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that any corrections made to a record are submitted to the QIES ASAP system in accordance with the MDS Correction Policy. Several processes have been put into place to assure that the MDS d ata are accurate both at the provider and in the QIES ASAP system: If an error is discovered within 7 days of the completion of an MDS and before submission to the QIES ASAP system, the response may be corrected using standard editing procedures on the hard copy (cross out, enter correct response, initial and date) and/or correction of the MDS record in the facility's database. The resident's care plan should also be reviewed for any needed changes. Software used by the provider to encode the MDS must run all standard edits as defined in the data specifications released by CMS. Enhanced record rejection standards have been implemented in the QIES ASAP system. If an MDS record contains responses that are out of range, e.g., a 4 is entered when only 0-3 are allowable responses for an item, or item responses are inconsistent (e.g., a skip pattern is not observed), the record is rejected. Rejected records are not stored in the QIES ASAP database. If an error is discovered in a record that has been accepted by the QIES ASAP system, Modification or Inactivation procedures must be implemented by the provider to assure that the QIES ASAP system information is corrected. Clinical corrections must also be undertaken as necessary to assure that the resident is accurat ely assessed, the care plan is accurate, and the resident is receiving the necessary care. A Significant Change in Status Assessment (SCSA), Significant Correction to Prior Quarterly (SCQA), or a Significant Correction to Prior Comprehensive (SCPA) may be needed as well as corrections to the information in the QIES ASAP system. An SCSA is required only if a change in the resident's clinical status occurred. An SCPA or SCQA is required when an uncorrected significant error is identified. See Chapter 2 for de tails. The remaining sections of this chapter present the decision processes necessary to identify the proper correction steps. A flow chart is provided at the end of these sections that summarizes these decisions and correction steps. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 8 5.6 Correcting Errors in MDS Records That Have Not Yet Been Accepted Into the QIES ASAP System If an MDS assessment is found to have errors that incorrectly reflect the resident's status, then that assessment must be corrected. The correction process depends upon the type of error. MDS assessments that have not yet been accepted in the QIES ASAP system include records that have been submitted and rejected, or records that have not been submitted at all. These records can generally be corrected and retransmitted without any special correction procedures, since they were never accepted by the QIES ASAP system. The paper copy should be corrected according to standard procedures detailed below. Errors Identified During the Encoding Period Facilities have up to 7 days to encode ( enter into the software) and edit an MDS assessment after the MDS has been completed. Changes may be made to the electronic record for any item during the encoding and editing period, provided the response refers to the same observation period. To make rev isions to the paper copy, enter the correct response, draw a line through the previous response without obliterating it, and initial and date the corrected entry. This procedure is similar to how an entry in the medical record is corrected. When the data are encoded into the provider's MDS system from paper, the provider is responsible for verifying that all responses in the computer file match the responses on the paper form. Any discrepancies must be corrected in the computer file during the 7- day encodin g period. In addition, the provider is responsible for running encoded MDS assessment data against CMS and State- specific edits that software vendors are responsible for building into MDS Version 3.0 computer systems. For each MDS item, the response must be within the required range and also be consistent with other item responses. During this 7- day encoding period that follows the completion of the MDS assessment, a provider may correct item responses to meet required edits. Only MDS assessments that meet all of the required edits are considered complete. For corrected items, the provider must use the same observation period as was used for the original item completion (i.e., the same ARD (A2300) and look- back period). Both the electronic and paper copies o f the MDS must be corrected. Errors Identified After the Encoding Period Errors identified after the encoding and editing period must be corrected within 14 days after identifying the errors. If the record in error is an Entry tracking record, Death in Fac ility tracking record, Discharge assessment, or PPS assessment record (i.e., MDS Item A0310A = 99), then the record should be corrected and submitted to the QIES ASAP system. The correction process may be more complex if the record in error is an OBRA comprehensive or Q uarterly assessment record (i.e., Item A0310A = 01 through 06). Significant versus Minor Errors in a Nursing Home OBRA Comprehensive or Quarterly Assessment Record. OBRA comprehensive and Quarterly assessment errors are classified as significant or minor errors. Errors that inaccurately reflect the resident's clinical status and/or CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 9 result in an inappropriate plan of care are considered significant errors . All other errors related to the coding of MDS items are considered minor errors . If the only errors in the OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment are minor errors, then the only requirement is for the record to be corrected and submitted to the QIES ASAP system. The correction process is more complicated for nursing home OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessments with any significant errors identified after the end of the 7- day encoding and editing period but before the records have been accepted into the QIES ASAP system. First, the nursing home must correct the original OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment to reflect the resident's actual status as of the AR D for that original assessment and submit the record. Second, to insure an up- to-date view of the resident's status and an appropriate care plan, the nursing home must perform an additional new assessment, either a Significant Change in Status Assessment o r Significant Correction to Prior Assessment with a current observation period and ARD. If correction of the error on the MDS revealed that the resident's status met the criteria for a Significant Change in Status Assessment, then a Significant Change in S tatus assessment is required. If the criteria for a Significant Change in Status Assessment are not met, then a Significant Correction to Prior Assessment is required. See Chapter 2 for details. In summary, the nursing home must take the following actions for an OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment that has not been submitted to the QIES ASAP system when it contains significant errors: Correct the errors in the original OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment. Submit the corrected assessment. Perfo rm a new assessment - a Significant Change in Status Assessment or a Significant Correction to Prior Assessment and update the care plan as necessary. If the assessment was performed for Medicare purposes only (A0310A = 99 and A0310B = 01 or 08) or for a d ischarge (A0310A = 99 and A0310F = 10 or 11), no Significant Change in Status Assessment or Significant Correction to Prior Assessment is required. The provider would determine if the Medicare- required or Discharge assessment should be modified or inactiva ted. Care Area Assessments (Section V) and updated care planning are not required with Medicare- only and Discharge assessments . 5.7 Correcting Errors in MDS Records That Have Been Accepted Into the QIES ASAP System Facilities should correct any errors nec essary to ensure that the information in the QIES ASAP system accurately reflects the resident's identification, location, overall clinical status, or payment status. A correction can be submitted for any accepted record within 2 years of the target date of the record for facilities that are still open. If a facility is terminated, then corrections must be submitted within 2 years of the facility termination date. A rec ord may be corrected even if subsequent records have been accepted for the resident. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 10 Errors identified in QIES ASAP system records must be corrected within 14 days after identifying the errors. Inaccuracies can occur for a variety of reasons, such as trans cription errors, data entry errors, software product errors, item coding errors or other errors. The following two processes have been established to correct MDS records (assessments, Entry tracking records or Death in Facility tracking records) that have been accepted into the QIES ASAP system: Modification Inactivation A Modification request moves the inaccurate record into history in the QIES ASAP system and replaces it with the corrected record as the active record. An Inactivation request also moves the inaccurate record into history in the QIES ASAP system, but does not replace it with a new record. Both the Modification and Inactivation processes require the MDS Correction Request items to be completed in Section X of the MDS 3.0. The MDS Correction R equest items in Section X contain the minimum amount of information necessary to enable location of the erroneous MDS record previously submitted and accepted into the QIES ASAP system. Section X items are defined in the MDS 3.0 Data Submission Specificati ons posted on the CMS MDS 3.0 website. When a facility maintains the MDS electronically without the use of electronic signatures, a hard copy of the Correction Request items in Section X must be kept with the corrected paper copy of the MDS record in the clinical file to track the changes made with the modification. In addition, the facility would keep a hard copy of the Correction Request items (Section X) with an inactivated record. For details on electronic records, see Chapter 2, Section 2.4. Modif ication Requests A Modification Request should be used when an MDS record (assessment, Entry tracking record or Death in Facility tracking record) is in the QIES ASAP system, but the information in the record contains clinical or demographic errors. The Mo dification Request is used to modify MDS items not specifically listed under inactivation. Some of the items include : Target Date \u2014 Entry Date (Item A1600) on an Entry tracking record (Item A0310F = 1) \u2014 Discharge Date (Item A2000) on a Discharge/Death in Facility record (Item A0310F = 10, 11, 12), \u2014 Assessment Reference Date (Item A2300) on an OBRA or PPS assessment.* Type of Assessment (Item A0310)** Clinical Items (Items B0100 -V0200C) *Note: The ARD (Item A2300) can be changed when the ARD on the assessment r epresents a data entry/typographical error. However, the ARD cannot be altered if it results in a change in CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 11 the look back period and alters the actual assessment timeframe. Consider the following examples: When entering the assessment into the facility's s oftware, the ARD, intended to be 02/12/2013, was inadvertently entered as 02/02/2013. The interdisciplinary team (IDT) completed the assessment based on the ARD of 2/12/2013 (that is, the seven day look back was 2/06/2012 through 2/12/2013) . This would be an acceptable use of the modification process to modify the ARD (A2300) to reflect 02/12/2013. An assessment was completed by the team and entered into the software based on the ARD of 1/10/2013 (and seven day look back of 1/04/2013 through 1/10/2013). Thr ee weeks later, the IDT determines that the date used represents a date that is not compliant with the PPS schedule and proposes changing the ARD to 1/07/2013. This would alter the look back period and result in a new assessment (rather than correcting a typographical error); this would not be an acceptable modification and shall not occur. **Note: The Type of Assessment items (Item A0310) can only be modified when the Item Set Code (ISC) of that assessment does not change. In other words, if the Item Subset (full list can be found in Chapter 2, Section 2.5) would change, the modification cannot be done. Consider the following exam ple: An Admission assessment (ISC = NC) was completed and accepted into the QIES ASAP system. The provider intended to code the assessment as an Admission and a 5 -day PPS assessment (ISC = NC). The modification process could be used in this case as the ISC would not change. There are a few items for which the modification process shall not be used. These items require the follo wing correction measures if an error is identified: An Inactivation of the existing record followed by submission of a new corrected record is required to correct an error of the Type of Provider (Item A0200) An MDS 3.0 Manual Assessment Correction/Deletion Request is required to correct: \u2014 Unit Certification or Licensure Designation (Item A0410), \u2014 State -assigned facility submission ID (FAC_ID), \u2014 Test record submitted as a production record. See Section 5.8 for details on the MDS 3.0 Manual Assessment Correction/Deletion Request. When an error is discovered (except for those items listed in the preceding paragraph and instances listed in Section 5.8) in an MDS 3.0 Entry tracking record, Death in Facility tracking record, Discharge assessment, or PPS assessment that is not an OBRA assessment (where Item A0310A = 99), the provider must take the following actions to correct the record: 1. Create a corrected record with all items included, not just the items in error. 2. Complete the required Correction Request Section X items and include with the corrected record. Item A0050 should have a value of 2, indicating a modification request. 3. Submit this modification request record. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 12 If errors are discovered in a nursing home OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly asse ssment (Item A0310A = 01 through 06) in the QIES ASAP system, then the nursing home must determine if there are any significant errors. If the only errors are minor errors, the nursing home must take the following actions to correct the OBRA assessment: 1. Create a corrected record with all items included, not just the items in error. 2. Complete the required Correction Request Section X items and include with the corrected record. Item A0050 should have a value of 2, indicating a modification request. 3. Submit thi s modification request record. When any significant error is discovered in an OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment in the QIES ASAP system, the nursing home must take the following actions to correct the OBRA assessment: 1. Create a corrected record with all items included, not just the items in error. 2. Complete the required Correction Request Section X items and include with the corrected record. Item A0050 should have a value of 2, indicating a modification request. 3. Submit this modification request record. 4. Perform a new Significant Correction to Prior Assessment or Significant Change in Status Assessment and update the care plan as necessary. A Significant Change in Status Assessment would be required only if correction of the MDS item(s) revealed that the resident met the criteria for a Significant Change in Status Assessment. If criteria for Significant Change in Status Assessment were not met, then a Significant Correction to Prior Assessment is required. When errors in an OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment in the QIES ASAP system have been corrected in a more current OBRA comprehensive or Quarterly assessment (Item A0310A = 01 through 06), the nursing home is not required to perform a new additional assessment (Sign ificant Change in Status or Significant Correction to Prior assessment). In this situation, the nursing home has already updated the resident's status and care plan. However, the nursing home must use the Modification process to assure that the erroneous a ssessment residing in the QIES ASAP system is corrected. The 10/01/2019 Cross -Over Rule A unique situation exists that will prevent providers from correcting the target date of any assessment crossing over October 1, 2019. That is, providers may not submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed prior to October 1, 2019 to a target date on or after October 1, 2019, nor can they submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed on or after October 1, 2019 to a target date prior to October 1, 2019. The item sets that are effective October 1, 2019 have had significant changes, including the omission and addition of many items. It is the target date of the assessment that identifies the required version of t he item set, and, because of the substantial changes in the item sets, they are not interchangeable. Therefore, providers may not change target dates on assessments crossing over October 1, 2019. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 13 Modification records that contain a target date crossing ove r October 1, 2019 will result in a FATAL error and be REJECTED from the QIES ASAP system. However, all corrections to target dates that align with policies in Section 5.7 of this chapter and do not violate this rule will be allowed. To correct the target d ate of the assessment that violates the cross -over rule, providers must inactivate the incorrect assessment and submit a replacement assessment. Examples of potential scenarios that will and will not be allowed are identified below: Original Assessment Ta rget Date Modified Assessment Target Date Allowed or Not Allowed 8/15/19 9/30/19 Allowed 10/1/19 11/1/19 Allowed 9/15/19 10/15/19 Not Allowed 10/15/19 9/15/19 Not Allowed Inactivation Requests An Inactivation should be used when a record has been accepted into the QIES ASAP system but the corresponding event did not occur. For example, a Discharge assessment was submitted for a resident but there was no actual discharge. An Inactivation (Item A0050 = 3) must be completed when any of the following items are inaccurate: Type of Provider (Item A0200) Type of Assessment (A0310) when the Item Subset would change had the MDS been modified Discharge Date (Item A2000) on a Discharge assessment record (It em A0310F = 10, 11) when the look- back period and/or clinical assessment would change had the MDS been modified Assessment Reference Date (Item A2300) on an OBRA or PPS assessment when the look-back period and/or clinical assessment would change had the MD S been modified When inactivating a record, the provider is required to submit an electronic Inactivation Request record. This record is an MDS record but only the Section X items and Item A0050 are completed. This is sufficient information to locate the r ecord in the QIES ASAP system, inactivate the record and document the reason for inactivation. For instances when the provider determines that the Type of Provider is incorrect, the provider must inactivate the record in the QIES ASAP system, then complete and submit a new MDS 3.0 record with the correct Type of Provider, ensuring that the clinical information is accurate. Inactivations should be rare and are appropriate only under the narrow set of circumstances that indicate a record is invalid. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 14 In such instances a new ARD date must be established based on MDS requirements, which is the date the error is determined or later, but not earlier. The new MDS 3.0 record being submitted to replace the inactivated record must include new signatures and dat es for all items based on the look- back period established by the new ARD and according to established MDS assessment completion requirements. 5.8 Special Manual Record Correction Request A few types of errors in a record in the QIES ASAP system cannot be corrected with an automated Modification or Inactivation request. These errors are: 1. The record is a test record inadvertently submitted as production. 2. The record has the wrong unit certification or licensure designation in Item A0410. 3. The record has the wr ong state code or facility ID in the control Items STATE_CD or FAC_ID. In all of these cases, the facility must contact the State Agency to have the problems fixed. The State Agency will send the facility the appropriate MDS 3.0 Manual Assessment Correction/Deletion Request form. The facility is responsible for completing the form. The facility must submit the completed form to the State Agency. Completed forms with privacy information must be sent via certified mail through the United States Postal Service (USPS). The State Agency will review the request for completion and accuracy. A fter approving the provider's request, the state must sign the form and send it to the QTSO Help Desk. Compl eted forms with privacy data must be sent via certified mail through the USPS. When a test record is in the QIES ASAP system, the problem must be evaluated and the QIES ASAP system appropriately corrected. A normal Inactivation request will not totally fix the problem, since it will leave the test record in a history file and may also leave information about a fictitious resident. Manual deletion is n ecessary to completely remove the test record and associated information. A QIES ASAP system record with an incorrect unit certification or licensure designation in Item A0410 is a very serious problem. Submission of MDS assessment records to the QIES ASAP system constitutes a release of private information and must conform to privacy laws. Item A0410 is intended to allow appropriate privacy safeguards, controlling who can access the record and whether the record can even be accepted into the QIES ASAP syst em. A normal Modification or Inactivation request cannot be used to correct the A0410 value, since a copy of the record in error will remain in the QIES ASAP system history file with the wrong access control. Consider a record in the QIES ASAP system with an A0410 value of 3 (Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified) when actually the unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified and MDS data is not required by the State (A0410 should have been 1). The record should not be in the QIES ASAP system at all and manual deletion is necessary to completely remove the record from the QIES ASAP system. Consider a record with an A0410 value of 3 indicating that the Unit is Medicare and/or Medicaid certified but actually the unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State (A0410 should have been 2). In this case there is both federal and state access to the record, but access should be limited to the state. Manual CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments October 2019 Page 5- 15 correction is necessary to correct A0410 and reset access control , without leaving a copy of the record with the wrong access in the QIES ASAP system history file. If a QIES ASAP system record has the wrong state code or facility ID (control item STATE_CD, FAC_ID), then the record must be removed without leaving any tra ce in the QIES ASAP system. The record also should be resubmitted with the correct STATE_CD and FAC_ID value. October 201 9 Page 5-16 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 5: Submission and Correction of the MDS Assessments 1 Manual deletion request is required if test record submitted as production record, if record contains incorrect FAC_ID, or if record was submitted with an incorrect Unit Certification or Licensure Designation (A0410), for example sent in as Unit is Medicar e and/or Medicaid certified (A0410 = 3) but should have been Unit is neither Medicare nor Medicaid certified but MDS data is required by the State (A0410 = 2). Otherwise, automated inactivation or modification required: (a) if event did not occur (see note #3 below), submit automated inactivation, (b) if event occurred, submit automated modification. 2 Record has not been data entered, has not been submitted, or has been submitted and rejected by ASAP. 3 The event occurred if the record reflects an actual entry or discharge or if an assessment was actually performed for the resident. If a record was created in error (e.g., a Discharge assessment was created for a resident who was not actually discharged), then the event did not occur . 4 OBRA comprehensive as sessments with A0310A = 01, 03, 04, 05 and Quarterly assessments with A0310 A = 02, 06. 5 The assessment contains a significant error which has not been corrected by a subsequent assessment. 6 Final completion date is item V0200C2 for a comprehensive and Z0500B for all other assessments. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medi care SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 1 CHAPTER 6: MEDICARE SKILLED NURSING FACI LITY PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM (SNF PPS) 6.1 Background The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included the implementation of a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and hospitals with a swing bed agreement, consolidated billing, and a number of related changes. The PPS system replaced the retrospective cost-based system for SNFs under Part A of the program ( Federal Register Vol. 63, No. 91, May 12, 1998, Final Rule). Effe ctive with cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2002, SNF -level services furnished in rural swing bed hospitals are paid based on the SNF PPS instead of the previous, cost -related method ( Federal Register Vol. 66, No. 147, July 31, 2001, Final Rule). However, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 included an exemption of critical access hospital swing beds from the SNF PPS. The SNF PPS is the culmination of substantial research efforts beginning as early as the 1970s that focus on the areas of nursing home payment and quality. In addition, it is based on a foundation of knowledge and work by a number of States that developed and implemented similar case -mix payment methodologies for their Medicaid n ursing home payment systems. The current focus in the development of the Federal payment system (i.e., PPS) for nursing home care is based on recognizing the differences among resident s, particularly in the utilization of resources. Some resident s require total assistance with their activities of daily living (ADLs) and have complex nursing care needs. Other resident s may require less assistance with ADLs but may require rehabilitation or restorative nursing services. The recognition of these differences is the premise of a case- mix system. Reimbursement levels differ based on the resource needs of the resident s. Resident s with heavy care needs require more staff resources and payment levels should be higher than for those resident s with less intensive care needs. In a case- mix adjusted payment system, the amount of reimbursement to the nursing home is based on the resource intensity of the resident as measured by items on the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Case -mix reimbursement has become a widely adopted method f or financing nursing home care. The case - mix approach serves as the basis for the PPS for skilled nursing facilities and swing bed hospitals and is increasingly being used by States for Medicaid reimbursement for nursing homes. 6.2 Using the MDS in the Medicare Prospective Payment System The MDS assessment data is used to calculate the resident 's Pa tient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) classification necessary for payment. The MDS contains extensive information on the resident 's nursing and therapy needs, ADL s tatus, cognitive status, behavioral problems, and medical diagnoses. This information is used to define PDPM case -mix adjusted groups, within CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medi care SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 2 which a hierarchy exists that assigns case -mix weights that capture differences in the relative resources used for treati ng different types of resident s. Over half of the State Medicaid programs also use the MDS for their case- mix payment systems. The Resource Utilization Group, Version IV (RUG -IV) system replaced the Resource Utilization Group, Version III (RUG -III) system for Medicare starting on October 1, 2010. Starting October 1, 2019, PDPM replaced the RUG -IV system. However, State Medicaid agencies have the option to use the RUG -III, RUG -IV, or PDPM classification systems. CMS also makes available for the States alternative RUG -IV classification systems with 66, 57, or 48 groups with varying numbers of Rehabilitation groups (similar to the RUG -III 53, 44, and 34 groups). States have the option of selecting the system (RUG -III or RUG -IV) with the number of Rehabilitation groups that better suits their Medicaid long -term care population. State Medicaid programs always have the option to develop nursing home reimbursement systems that meet their specific program goals. The decision to implement a certain c lassification system for Medicaid is a State decision. Please contact your State Medicaid agency if you have questions about your State Medicaid reimbursement system. 6.3 Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) PDPM adjusts payment for each major element of a resident 's SNF care, specifically for physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech -language pathology (SLP), nursing, and non - therapy ancillaries (NTA). In section 6.6 below, we provide a PDPM calculation worksheet. This calculation worksheet w as developed in order to provide clinical staff with a better understanding of how PDPM works. The worksheet translates the standard software code into plain language to assist staff in understanding the logic behind the classification system. 6.4 Relation ship between the Assessment and the Claim The SNF PPS establishes a schedule of PPS assessments. The 5 -Day assessment is the only required PPS assessment that is used to support PPS reimbursement. However, as described in Chapter 2, S ection 2.9, an optiona l assessment, the Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) , may be used to reclassify the resident into a new PDPM classification, and would also affect the associated payment rate. See Chapter 2 of this m anual for greater detail on assessment t ypes and requiremen ts. Numerous situations exist that impact the relationship between the assessment and the claim above and beyond the information provided in this chapter. It is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that claims submitted to Medicare are accurate and meet all Medicare requirements. For example, if a resident 's status does not meet the criteria for Medicare Part A SNF coverage, the provider is not to bill Medicare for any non- covered days. The assignment of a PDPM classification is not an indication th at the requirements for a SNF Part A stay have been met. Once the resident no longer requires skilled services, the provider must not bill Medicare for days that are not covered. Therefore, the following information is not to be considered all - inclusive a nd definitive. Refer to the Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Chapter 6 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medi care SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 3 (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/clm104c 06.pdf ), for detailed claims processing requirements and policies. The SNF claim must include two data items derived from the MDS assessment: Assessment Reference Date (ARD) The ARD must be reported on the SNF claim. CMS has developed internal mechanisms to link the MDS assessment and the claims processing system. Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) Code Each SNF claim contains a five- position HIPPS code for the purpose of billing Part A covered days to the Medicare Administrativ e Contractor (MAC). The HIPPS code consists of a series of codes representing the resident 's PDPM classification and the Assessment Indicator (AI) as described below. CMS provides standard software and logic for HIPPS code calculation. PDPM Classification The first four positions of the HIPPS code contain the PDPM classification codes for each PDPM component to be billed for Medicare reimbursement. The PDPM classification is calculated from the MDS assessment clinical data. See Section 6.6 for calculation d etails on each PDPM group. CMS provides standard software, development tools, and logic for PDPM calculation. CMS software, or private software developed with the CMS data specifications , is used to encode and transmit the MDS assessment data and automatic ally calculates the resident 's PDPM classification. CMS edits and validates the PDPM classification code of transmitted MDS assessments. Skilled nursing facilities are not permitted to submit Medicare Part A claims until the assessments have been accepted into the CMS database, and they must use the PDPM classification code as validated by CMS when bills are filed, except in cases in which the facility must bill the default code (ZZZZZ ). See Section 6.8 for details. October 2019 Page 6- 4 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS Table 1.

The HIPPS code included on the SNF claim depends on the specific type of assessment involved (as described below). The HIPPS code in i tem Z0100A is validated by CMS when the assessment is submitted. If the submitted code is incorrect, the validation report will include a warning giving the correct code; the facility must enter this correct code in the HIPPS code item on the bill. The provider must ensure that all PPS assessment require ments are met. When the provider fails to meet the PPS assessment requirements, such as when the assessment is late (as evidenced by a late ARD), the provider may be required to bill the default code. In these situations, the provider is responsible to ens ure that the default code and not the PDPM classification -based HIPPS code validated by CMS in i tem Z0100A is billed for the applicable number of days. See Section 6.8 of this chapter for greater detail. AI Code The last position of the HIPPS code represents the AI, identifying the assessment type. The AI coding system indicates the different types of assessments that define different PPS payment periods and is based on t he coding of i tem A0310B. CMS provides standard software, development tools, and logic for AI code calculation. CMS software, or private software developed with the CMS tools, automatically calculates the AI code. The AI code is validated by CMS when the assessment is submitted. If the submitted AI code is incorrect on the assessment, the validation report will include a warning and provide the correct code. The facility must enter this correct AI code in the HIPPS code item on the bill. The code consists of one digit, which is defined below. In situations when the provider is to bill the def ault code, the AI provided on the validation report is to be used along with the default code, ZZZZZ, on the SNF claim. Refer to the Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Chapter 6, for detailed claims processing requirements and policies. The AI code identif ies the assessment used to establish the per diem payment rate for the standard PPS payment periods. These assessments are the 5 -Day assessment and Interim Payment Assessment. Table 5 displays the AI code for each of the PPS assessment types and the standard payment period for each assessment type. Table 5.

These requirements are summarized in this section. Refer to the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual , Chapter 1 (Pub. 100- 1), and the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual , Chapter 8 (Pub. 100- 2), for detailed SNF coverage requirements and policies. Technical Eligibility Requirements The beneficiary must meet the following criteria: Beneficiary is enrolled in Medicare Part A and has days available to use. There has been a three- day prior qualifying hospital stay (i.e., three midnights). Admission for SNF -level services is within 30 days of discharge from an acute care stay or within 30 days of discharge from a SNF level of care. Clinical Eligibility Requirements A beneficiary is eligible for SNF extended care if all of the following requirements are met: The beneficiary has a need for and receives medically necessary skilled care on a daily basis, which is provided by or under the direct supervision of skilled nursing or rehabilitation professionals. As a practical matter, these skilled services can only be provided in an SNF. The services provided must be for a condition: \u2014 for which the resident was treated during the qualifying hospital stay, or \u2014 that arose while the resident was in the SNF for treatment of a condition for which he or she was previously treated in a hospital. Physician Certification The attending physician or a physician on the staff of the skilled nursing facility who has knowledge of the case \u2014or a nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), or clinical nurse specialist (CNS) who does not have a direct or indirect employment relationship with the facility but who is w orking in collaboration with the physician\u2014must certify and then periodically recertify the need for extended care services in the skilled nursing facility. Certifications are required at the time of admission or as soon thereafter as is reasonable and pra cticable (42 CFR 424.20). The initial certification \u2014 affirms, per the required content found in 42 CFR 424.20, that the resident meets the existing SNF level of care definition, or \u2014 validates via written statement that the resident 's assignment to one of the upper PDPM groups (defined below) is correct. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 11 o Those nursing groups encompassed by the Extensive Services, Special Care High, Special Care Low, and Clinically Complex nursing categories; o PT and OT groups TA, TB, TC, TD, TF, SLP SE, SF, SH, SI, SJ, SK, and SL; and o The NTA component's uppermost (12+) comorbidity group. Re-certifications are used to document the continued need for skilled extended care services. \u2014 The first re -certification is required no later than the 14t h day of the SNF stay. \u2014 Subsequent re -certifications are required at no later than 30 -day intervals after the date of the first re -certification. \u2014 The initial certification and first re -certification may be signed at the same time. 6.6 PDPM Calculation Works heet for SNFs In the PDPM, there are five case -mix adjusted components: PT, OT, SLP, NTA, and Nursing. Each resident is to be classified into one and only one group for each of the five case -mix adjusted components. In other words, each resident is classif ied into a PT group, an OT group, an SLP group, an NTA group, and a nursing group. For each of the case -mix adjusted components, there are a number of groups to which a resident may be assigned, based on the relevant MDS 3.0 data for that component. There are 16 PT groups, 16 OT groups, 12 SLP groups, 6 NTA groups, and 25 nursing groups. PDPM classifies resident s into a separate group for each of the case- mix adjusted components, each of which has its own associated case- mix indexes and base rates. Additionally, PDPM applies variable per diem payment adjustments to three components, PT, OT, and NTA, to account for changes in resource use over a stay. The adjusted PT, OT, and NTA per diem rates are then added together with the unadjusted SLP and nursing component rates and the non- case- mix component to determine the full per diem rate for a given resident . CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 12 Calculation of PDPM Cognitive Level The PDPM cognitive level is utilized in the SLP payment component of PDPM. One of four PDPM cognitive performance levels is assigned based on the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) or the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for the PDPM cognitive leve l. If neither the BIMS nor the staff assessment for the PDPM cognitive level is complete, then the PDPM cognitive level cannot be assigned and the resident will be classified as if the resident is cognitively intact. STEP #1 Determine the resident 's BIMS S ummary Score on the MDS 3.0 based on the resident interview. Instructions for completing the BIMS are in Chapter 3, Section C. The BIMS involves the following items: C0200 Repetition of three words C0300 Temporal orientation C0400 Recall Item C0500 provides a BIMS Summary Score that ranges from 00 to 15. If the resident interview is not successful, then the BIMS Summary Score will equal 99. Calculate the resident 's PDPM cognitive level using the following mapping: Table 6: Calculation of PDPM Level from BIMS PDPM Level BIMS Score Cognitively Intact 13-15 Mildly Impaired 8-12 Moderately Impaired 0-7 Severely Impaired - PDPM Cognitive Level: __________ If the resident 's Summary Score is 99 ( resident interview not successful) or the Summary Score is blank ( resident interview not attempted and skipped) or the Summary Score has a dash value (not assessed), then proceed to Step #2 to use the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for the PDPM cognitive level . STEP #2 If the resident 's Summary Score is 99 or the Summary Score is blank or has a dash value, then determine the resident 's cognitive status based on the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for the PDPM cognitive level using the following steps: CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 13 A) The resident classifies as severely impaired if one of the following conditions exist s: a. Comatose (B0100 = 1) and completely dependent or activity did not occur at admission (GG0130A1, GG0130C1, GG0170B1, GG0170C1, GG0170D1, GG0170E1, and GG0170F1 all equal 01, 09, or 88). b. Severely impaired cognitive skills for dail y decision making (C1000 = 3). B) If the resident is not severely impaired based on Step A, then determine the resident 's Basic Impairment Count and Severe Impairment Count. For each of the conditions below that applies, add one to the Basic Impairment Count. a. In Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making, the resident has modified independence or is moderately impaired (C1000 = 1 or 2). b. In Makes Self Understood, the resident is usually understood, sometimes understood, or rarely/never understood (B0700 = 1, 2, or 3). c. Based on the Staff Assessment for Mental Status, the resident has a memory problem (C0700 = 1). Sum a., b., and c. to get the Basic Impairment Count: _____ For each of the conditions below that applies, add one to the Severe Impairment Count. a. In Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making, the resident is m oderately impaired (C1000 = 2). b. In Makes Self Understood, the resident is sometimes understood or rarely/never understood (B0700 = 2 or 3). Sum a. and b. to get the Severe Impairment Count: _____ C) The resident classifies as moderately impaired if the Severe Impairment Count is 1 or 2 and the Basic Impairment Count is 2 or 3. D) The resident classifies as mildly impaired if the Basic Impairment Count is 1 and the Severe Impairment Count is 0, 1, or 2, or if the Basic Impairment Count is 2 or 3 and the Severe Impairment Count is 0. E) The resident classifies as cognitively intact if both the Seve re Impairment Count and Basic Impairment Count are 0. PDPM Cognitive Level: __________ CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 14 PDPM Payment Component: PT STEP #1 Determine the resident 's primary diagnosis clinical category using the ICD -10-CM code recorded in MDS item I0020B. To do so, refer to the PDPM Clinical Categories to ICD -10 Diagnosis Codes mapping (available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service - Payment/SNFPPS/PD PM.html ), which maps a resident 's primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B to the 10 PDPM primary diagnosis clinical categories. I0020B diagnosis: ____________________ Default primary diagnosis clinical category: ____ ________________ Some ICD -10-CM codes can map to a different clinical category from the default depending on a resident 's prior inpatient procedure history. For these codes, a resident may be categorized into a surgical clinical category if the resident received a surgical procedure dur ing the prior inpatient stay that relates to the primary reason for the Part A SNF stay as indicated by item J2100. If the PDPM clinical category mapping indicates that the resident 's primary diagnosis code is eligible for one of the two orthopedic surgery categories (major joint replacement or spinal surgery, and orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery)) , then proceed to Step 1A; if eligible for the non -orthopedic surgery category, then proceed to Step 1C. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1A Determine whether the resident received a major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2300, J2310, J2320, J2330, J2400, J2410, or J2420 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the major joint replacement or spinal surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1B. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 15 STEP #1B Determine whether the resident received orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2500, J2510, J2520, or J2530 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) clinical category. If none of these procedures was perform ed, the resident did not receive orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spin al surgery) during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery)? (Yes/No) _____ If the resi dent received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery), then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery). Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosi s clinical category assignment. STEP #1C Determine whether the resident received a significant non -orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay usin g item J2100. If any of the during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the non- orthopedic surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive a significant non- orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical C linical Category and eceived S ignificant Non- Orthopedic Surgical Procedure? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received a significant Non -Orthopedic Surgical Procedure, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Non -Orthopedic Surgery. Otherwise, the res ident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosi s clinical category assignment. STEP #1D To finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment, if the resident is not eligible for a different clinical category from the default, then select the default clinical category assigned to the primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B in Step 1. If the resident is eligible for a different clinical category from the default, select the eligible surgical clinical category as determined in Steps 1A, 1B, or 1C. Primary diagnosis clinical category: Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 16 STEP #2 Next, determine the resident 's PT clinical category based on the mapping shown below. Table 7: PT Clinical Category Primary Diagnosis Clinical Category PT Clinical Category Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) Other Orthopedic Non-Orthopedic Surgery Non-Orthopedic Surgery Acute Infections Medical Management Cardiovascular and Coagulations Medical Management Pulmonary Medical Management Non-Surgical Orthopedic/Musculoskeletal Other Orthopedic Acute Neurologic Acute Neurologic Cancer Medical Management Medical Management Medical Management PT Clinical Category: ____________________ STEP #3 Calculate the resident 's Function Score for PT payment. Use the following table to determine the Function Score for Eating Admission Performance (GG0130A1), Oral Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130B1), Toileting Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130C1), Sit to Lying Admission Performance (GG0170B1), Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Admission Performa nce (GG0170C1), Sit to Stand Admission Performance (GG0170D1), Chair/Bed- to- Chair Transfer Admission Performance (GG0170E1), and Toilet Transfer Admission Perfo rmance (GG0170F1). It should be noted that, in the case of an IPA, the items used for calculation of the resident 's PDPM functional score are the Interim Performance items (GG0XXXX5), rather than the Admission Performance items (GG0XXXX1). For example, rather than GG0130B1, w hich is used on the 5- Day to assess the resident 's Oral Hygiene Admission Pe rformance, the IPA uses item GG0130B5 in order to measure the resident 's Oral Hygiene Interim Performance. Determine if the resident can walk using item GG0170I1. If the resident cannot walk 10 feet (GG0170I1 = 07, 09, 10, or 88), then the Function Score f or Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) is 0. If the resident can walk (GG0170I1 = 06, 05, 04, 03, 02, 01), then determine the Function Score for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) using the following table. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 17 Table 8: Function Score for PT Payment Admission or Interim Performance (Column 1 or 5) = Function Score = 05, 06 4 04 3 03 2 02 1 01, 07, 09, 10, 88, missing 0 Enter the Function Score for each item: Eating Eating Function Score: _____ Oral Hygiene Oral Hygiene Score: _____ Toileting Hygiene Toileting Hygiene Function Score: _____ Bed Mobility Sit to Lying Function Score: _____ Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Function Score: _____ Transfer Sit Score: _____ Walking Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns Function Score: _____ Walk 150 Feet Function Score: _____ The next step is to calculate the average function scores for the two bed mobility items, the three transfer items, and the two walking items as follows. For the Average Bed Mobility Function Score, calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Lying and Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed and divide this sum by 2. For the Average Transfer Function Score, calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Stand, Chair/Bed -to-Chair, and Toilet Transfer, and CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 18 divide this sum by 3. For the Average Walking Fu nction Score, calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns and Walk 150 Feet, and divide this sum by 2. Enter the Average Bed Mobility, Average Transfer Function, and Average Walking Function Scores below. Average Bed Mobility F unction Score: _____ Average Transfer Function Score: _____ Average Walking Function Score: _____ Calculate the sum of the following Function Scores: Eating Function Score, Oral Hygiene Function Score, Toileting Hygiene Function Score, Average Bed Mobility Function Score, Average Transfer Function Score, and Average Walking Function Score. Finally, round this sum to the nearest integer. This is the PDPM Function Score for PT Payment . The PDPM Function Score for PT Payment ranges from 0 through 24. PT FUNCTION SCORE : _____ STEP #4 Using the responses from Steps 2 and 3 above, determine the resident 's PT group using the table below.

STEP #1 Determine the resident 's primary diagnosis clinical category using the ICD -10-CM code recorded in MDS item I0020B. To do so, refer to the PDPM Clinical Categories to ICD -10 Diagn osis Codes mapping (available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service - Payment/SNFPPS/PDPM.html ), which maps a resident 's primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B to the 10 PDPM primary diagnosis clinical categories. I0020B diagnosis: ____________________ Default primary diagnosis clinical category: ____________________ Some ICD -10-CM codes can map to a different clinical category from the default depending on a resident 's prior inpatient procedure history. For these codes, a resident may be categorized int o a surgical clinical category if the resident received a surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay that relates to the primary reason for the Part A SNF stay as indicated by item J2100. If the PDPM clinical category mapping indicates that the res ident 's primary diagnosis code is eligible for one of the two orthopedic surgery categories (major joint replacement or spinal surgery, and orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery)) , then proceed to Step 1A; if eligible for the non- orthopedic surgery category, then proceed to Step 1C. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1A Determine whether the resident received a major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2300, J2310, J2320, J2330, J2400, J2410, or J2420 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the major joint replacement or spina l surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery? (Yes/No ) _____ If the resident received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. Otherw ise, proceed to Step 1B. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 20 STEP #1B Determine whether the resident received orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2500, J2510, J2520, or J2530 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Majo r Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery)? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery), then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spi nal Surgery). Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1C Determine whether the resident received a significant non -orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the non- orthopedic surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive a significant non- orthopedic surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and R eceived S ignificant Non- Orthopedic Surgical Procedure? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received a significant Non -Orthopedic Surgical Procedure, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Non -Orthopedic Surgery. Otherwise, the resident stays in the default primary diagnosis clinical category in Step 1. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize th e primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1D To finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment, if the resident is not eligible for a different clinical category from the default, then select the default clinical category assigned to the primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B in Step 1. If the resident is eligible for a different clinical category from the default, select the eligible surgical clinical category as determined in Steps 1A, 1B, or 1C. Primary diagnosis Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 21 STEP #2 Next, determine the resident 's OT clinical category based on the mapping shown below. Table 10: OT Clinical Category Primary Diagnosis Clinical Category OT Clinical Category Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) Other Orthopedic Non-Orthopedic Surgery Non-Orthopedic Surgery Acute Infections Medical Management Cardiovascular and Coagulations Medical Management Pulmonary Medical Management Non-Surgical Orthopedic/Musculoskeletal Other Orthopedic Acute Neurologic Acute Neurologic Cancer Medical Management Medical Management Medical Management OT Clinical Category: ____________________ STEP #3 Calculate the resident 's Function Score for OT payment. Use the following table to determine the Function Score for Eating Admission Performance (GG0130A1), Oral Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130B1), Toil eting Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130C1), Sit to Lying Admission Performance (GG0170B1), Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Admission Performance (GG0170C1), Sit to Stand Admission Performance (GG0170D1), Chair/Bed- to- Chair Transfer Admission Performanc e (GG0170E1), and Toilet Transfer Admission Performance (GG0170F1). It should be noted that, in the case of an IPA, the items used for calculation of the resident 's PDPM functional score are the Interim Performance items (GG0XXXX5), rather than the Admissi on Performance items (GG0XXXX1). For example, rather than GG 0130B1, which is used on the 5- Day to assess the resident 's Oral Hygiene Admission Performance, the IPA uses item GG0130B5 in order to measure the resident 's Oral Hygiene Interim Performance. Determine if the resident can walk using item GG0170I1. If the resident cannot walk 10 feet (GG0170I1 = 07, 09, 10, or 88), then the Function Score for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) is 0. If the resident can walk (GG0170I1 = 06, 05, 04, 03, 02, 01), then determine the Function Score for Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns (GG0170J1) and Walk 150 Feet (GG0170K1) using the following table.

STEP #1 Determine the resident 's primary diagnosis clinical category using the ICD -10-CM code recorded in MDS item I0020B. To do so, refer to the PDPM Clinical Categories to ICD -10 Diagnosis Codes mapping (available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service - Payment/SNFPPS/PDPM.html ), which maps a resident 's primary diagnosis as recorded in MDS item I0020B to the 10 PDPM primary diagnosis clinical categories. I0020B diagnosis: ____________________ Default primary diagnosis clinical category: ____________________ Some ICD -10-CM codes can map to a different clinical category from the default depending on a resident 's prior inpatient procedure history. For these codes, a resident may be categorized into a surgical clinical category if the resident received a surgical procedure during the prior inpatient stay that relates to the primary reason for the Part A SNF stay as indicated by item J2100. If the PDPM clinical category mapping indicates that the resident 's primary diagnosis code is eligible for one of the two orthopedic surgery categories (major joint replacement or spinal surgery, and orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery)) , then proceed to Step 1A; if eligible for the non -orthopedic surgery category, then proceed to Step 1C. Otherwi se, proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. STEP #1A Determine whether the resident received a major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures ndicated J2310, J2320, J2330, was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the major joint replacement or spinal surgery clinical category. If none of these procedures was perfo rmed, the resident did not receive major joint replacement or spinal surgery during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Major Joint Replacement or Spina l Surgery? (Yes/No) _____ If the resident received Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery, then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery. Proceed to Step 1D to finalize the primary diagnosis clinical category assignment. Otherwise, proceed to Step 1B. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 25 STEP #1B Determine whether the resident received orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spinal surgery) during the prior inpatient stay using item J2100. If any of the procedures indicated in items J2500, J2510, J2520, or J2530 was performed during the prior inpatient stay, then the resident is categorized into the Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) clinical category. If none of these procedures was performed, the resident did not receive orthopedic surgery (except major joint replacement or spin al surgery) during the prior inpatient stay for purposes of determining the PDPM classification. Resident Eligible for Surgical Clinical Category and Received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery)? (Yes/No) _____ If the resi dent received Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery), then the primary diagnosis clinical category is Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery).

Table 13: SLP Clinical Category Primary Diagnosis Clinical Category SLP Clinical Category Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery Non-Neurologic Orthopedic Surgery (Except Major Joint Replacement or Spinal Surgery) Non-Neurologic Non-Orthopedic Surgery Non-Neurologic Acute Clinical Category: ____________________ STEP #3 Determine whether the resident has one or more SLP -related comorbidities. To do so, examine the services and conditions in the table below. If any of these items is indicated as present, the resident has an SLP -related comorbidity. For conditions and services that are recorded in item I8000 of the MDS, check if the corresponding ICD -10-CM codes are coded in item I8000 using the mapping available at Language Deficits O0100E2 Tracheostomy Care While a Resident O0100F2 Ventilator or Respirator While a Resident Presence of one or more SLP -related comorbidities? (Yes/No) 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 27 STEP #4 Determine whether the resident has a cognitive impairment. Calculate the resident 's PDPM cognitive level, as described previously. If the PDPM cognitive level is cognitively intact, then the resident does not have a cognitive impairment. Otherwise, if the resident is assessed as mildly, moderately, or severely impaired, then the resident classifies as cognitively impaired. Presence of Cognitive Impairment? (Yes/No) _____ STEP #5 Determine how many of the following conditions are present: a. Based on Step 2, the resident is classified in the Acute Neurologic clinical category. b. Based on Step 3, the resident has one or more SLP -related comorbidities. c. Based on Step 4, the resident has a cognitive impairment. Number of conditions present: _____ STEP #6 Determine whether the resident has a swallowing disorder using item K0100. If any of the conditions indicated in items K0100A through K0100D is present, then the resident has swallowing disorder. If none of these conditions is present, the r esident does not have a swallowing disorder for purposes of this calculation. Presence of Swallowing Disorder? (Yes/No) _____ STEP #7 Determine whether the resident has a mechanically altered diet. If K0510C2 (mechanically altered diet while a resident ) is checked, then the resident has a mechanically altered diet. Presence of Mechanically Altered Diet? (Yes/No) _____ STEP #8 Determine how many of the following conditions are present based on Steps 6 and 7: a. The resident has neither a swallowing disorder nor a mechanically altered diet. b. The resident has either a swallowing disorder or a mechanically altered diet. c. The resident has both a swallowing disorder and a mechanically altered diet. Presence of Mechanically Altered Diet or Swallowing Disorder? (Neither/Either/Both): _____ CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 28 STEP #9 Determine the resident 's SLP group using the responses from Steps 1- 8 and the table below.

Determine whether the resident has HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is not reported on the MDS but is recorded on the SNF claim (ICD -10-CM code B20). Resident has HIV/AIDS? (Yes/No) _____ 2. Determine whether the resident meets the criteria for the comorbidity: \"Parenteral/IV Feeding - High Intensity\" or the comorbidity: \"Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity .\" To do so, first determine if the resident received parenteral/IV feeding during the last 7 days while a resident of the SNF using item K0510A2. If the resident did not receive parenteral/IV feedi ng during the last 7 days while a resident , then the resident does not meet the criteria for Parenteral/IV Feeding - High Intensity or Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity. If the resident did receive parenteral/IV feeding during the last 7 days while a r esident , then use item K0710A to determine if the proportion of total calories the resident received through parenteral or tube feeding was 51% or more while a resident (K0710A2 = 3). If K0710A2 = 3, then the resident meets the criteria for Parenteral/IV F eeding - High Intensity. If the proportion of total calories the resident received through parenteral or tube feeding was 26 - 50% (K0710A2 = 2) and average fluid intake per day by IV or tube feeding was 501 cc per day or more while a resident (K0710B2 = 2), then the resident qualifies for Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity. Presence of Parenteral/IV Feeding - High Intensity? (Yes/No) _____ Presence of Parenteral/IV Feeding - Low Intensity? (Yes/No) _____ 3. Determine whether the resident has any additional NTA -related comorbidities. To do this, examine the conditions and services in the table below, of which all except HIV/AIDS are recorded on the MDS. HIV/AIDS is recorded on the SNF claim. For conditions and services that are recorded in item I8000 of the MDS, check if the corresponding ICD -10-CM codes are coded in item I8000 using the mapping available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for-Service -Payment/SNFPPS/PDPM.html RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 30 Table 16: NTA Comorbidity Score Calculation Condition/Extensive Service MDS Special Medication -admit Special or Respirator Post -admit Code F eeding: Low K0510A2, K0710A2, K0710B2 3 Lung Transplant Status I8000 3 Special Treatments/Programs: Transfusion Post - admit Code O0100I2 2 Major Organ Transplant Status, Except Lung I8000 2 Active Diagnoses: Multiple Sclerosis Code I5200 2 Opportunistic Infections I8000 2 Active Diagnoses: Asthma COPD Chronic Lung Disease Code I6200 2 Bone/Joint/Muscle Infections/Necrosis - Except: Aseptic Necrosis of Bone I8000 2 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia I8000 2 Wound Infection Code I2500 2 Active Diagnoses: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Code I2900 2 Endocarditis I8000 1 Immune Disorders I8000 1 End-Stage Liver Disease I8000 1 Other Foot Skin Problems: Diabetic Foot Ulcer Diagnoses: Resistant Organism (MDRO) Code I1700 1 Special Treatments/Programs: Isolation Post -admit Code O0100M2 1 Specified Hereditary Metabolic/Immune Disorders I8000 1 Morbid Obesity I8000 1 Special Treatments/Programs: Radiation Post -admit Code 1 Ulcer M0300D1 1 I8000 CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 31 Condition/Extensive Service MDS Item Points Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Vitreous Hemorrhage I8000 1 Other Foot Skin Problems: Foot Infection Code, Other Open Lesion on Foot Code, Except Diabetic Foot Ulcer Code M1040A, M1040C 1 Complications of Specified Implanted Device or Graft I8000 1 Bladder and Bowel Appliances: Intermittent Catheterization H0100D 1 Inflammatory Bowel Disease I1300 1 Aseptic Necrosis of Bone I8000 1 Special Treatments/Programs: Suctioning Post - admit Code O0100D2 1 Cardio -Respiratory and Shock I8000 1 Except: Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Vitreous Hemorrhage I8000 1 Nutritional Approaches While a Resident : Feeding Tube K0510B2 1 Severe Skin Burn or Condition I8000 1 Intractable Epilepsy I8000 1 Active Diagnoses: Malnutrition Code I5600 1 Disorders of Immunity - Except: RxCC97: Immune Disorders I8000 1 Cirrhosis of Liver I8000 1 Bladder and Bowel Appliances: Ostomy H0100C 1 Respiratory Arrest I8000 1 Pulmonary Fibrosis and Other Chronic Lung Disorders I8000 1 1 If the number of Stage 4 Unhealed Pressure Ulcers is recorded as greater than 0, it will add one point to the NTA comorbidity score calculation. Only the presence, not the count, of Stage 4 Unhealed Pressure Ulcers affects the PDPM NTA comorbidity score c alculation. STEP #2 Calculate the resident 's total NTA score using the table above. To calculate the total NTA score, sum the points corresponding to each condition or service present. If none of these conditions or services is present, the resident 's scor e is 0. NTA Score: _____ CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 32 STEP #3 Determine the resident 's NTA group using the table below. Table 17: NTA Case -Mix Groups NTA Score Range NTA Case RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 33 PDPM Payment Component: Nursing STEP #1 Calculate the resident 's Function Score for nursing payment. Use the following table to determine the Function Score for Eating Admission Performance (GG0130A1), Toileting Hygiene Admission Performance (GG0130C1), Sit to Lying Admission Performance (GG0170B1), Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Admission Performance (GG0170C1), Sit to Stand Admission Performance (GG0170D1), Chair/Bed -to-Chair Transfer Admission Performance (GG0170E1), and Toilet Transfer Admission Performance (GG0170F1).

Average Bed Mobility Function Score: _____ Average Transfer Function Score: _____ Calculate the sum of the following scores: Eating Function Score, Toileting Hygiene F unction Score, Average Bed Mobility Score, and Average Transfer Score. Finally, round this sum to the nearest integer. This is the PDPM Function Score for nursing payment . The PDPM Function Score for nursing payment ranges from 0 through 16. PDPM NURSING F UNCTION SCORE : _____ STEP #2 Determine the resident 's nursing case -mix group using the hierarchical classification below. Nursing classification under PDPM employs the hierarchical classification method. Hierarchical classification is used in some payment systems, in staffing analysis, and in many research projects. In the hierarchical approach, start at the top and work down through the PDPM nursing classification model steps discussed below; the assigned classification is the first group for which the resident qualifies. In other words, start with the Ext ensive Services groups at the top of the PDPM nursing classification model. Then go down through the groups in hierarchical order: Extensive Services, Special Care High, Special Care Low, Clinically Complex, Behavioral Symptoms and Cognitive Performance, a nd Reduced Physical Function. When you find the first of the 25 individual PDPM nursing groups for which the resident qualifies, assign that group as the PDPM nursing classification. 1 Calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Lying and Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed. Divide this sum by 2. This is the Average Bed Mobility Function Score. 2 Calculate the sum of the Function Scores for Sit to Stand, Chair/Bed -to-Chair, and Toil et Transfer. Divide by 3. This is the Average Transfer Function Score. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 35 CATEGORY: EXTENSIVE SERVICES The classification groups in this category are based on various services provided. Use the following instructions to begin the calculation: STEP #1 Determine whether the resident is coded for one of the following treatments or services: O0100E2 Tracheostomy care while a resident O0100F2 Ventilato r or respirator while a resident O0100M2 Isolation or quarantine for active infectious disease while a resident If the resident does not receive one of these treatments or services, skip to the Special Care High Category now. STEP #2 If at least one of these treatments or services is coded and the resident has a total PDPM Nursing Function Score of 14 or less, he or she classifies in the Extensive Services category. Move to Step #3. If the resident 's PDPM Nursing Function Score is 15 or 16, he or she classifies as Clinically Complex. S kip to the Clinically Complex Category, Step #2. STEP #3 The resident classifies in the Extensive Services category according to the following chart: Extensive Service Conditions PDPM Nursing Nursing Classification: _____ If the resident does not classify in the Extensive Services Category, proceed to the Special Care High Category. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 36 CATEGORY: SPECIAL CARE HIGH The classification groups in this category are based on certain resident conditions or services. Use the following instructions: STEP #1 Determine whether the resident is coded for one of the following conditions or services: B0100, Section GG items Comatose and completely dependent or activity did not occur at admission (GG0130A1, GG0130C1, GG0170B1, GG0170C1, GG0170D1, GG0170E1, and or 88) I2100 Septicemia I2900, N0350A, B Diabetes with both of the following: Insulin inje ctions (N0350A) for all 7 days Insulin order changes on 2 or more days (N0350B) I5100, Nursing Function Score Quadriplegia with Nursing Function Score <= 11 I6200, J1100C Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and shortness of breath when lying flat J1550A, others Fever and one of the following : I2000 Pneumonia J1550B Vomiting K0300 Weight loss (1 or K0510A1 or K0510A2 Respiratory for 7 days *Tube feeding classification req uirements: (1) K0710A3 is 51% or more of total calories OR (2) K0710A3 is 26% to 50% of total calories and K0710B3 is 501 cc or more per day fluid enteral intake in the last 7 days. If the resident does not have one of these conditions, skip to the Special Care Lo w Category now. STEP #2 If at least one of the special care conditions above is coded and the resident has a total PDPM Nursing Function Score of 14 or less, he or she classifies as Special Care High. Move to Step #3. If the resident 's PDPM Nursing Function Score is 15 or 16, he or she classifies as Clinically Complex. S kip to the Clinic ally Complex Category, Step #2.

To calculate the per diem rate for t hese components, multiply the component base rate by the case -mix index associated with the resident 's case -mix group and the adjustment factor based on the day of the stay, as shown in the following equation: Component Per Diem Payment = Component Base Rate x Resident Group CMI x Component Adjustment Factor The adjustment factors for the PT and OT components can be found in the table below. Table 20: PT and OT Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factors Day in Stay PT and OT Adjustment factors for the NTA component can be found in the table below.

To calculate the total case- mix adjusted per diem rate, add all component per diem rates calculated in prior steps together, along with the non- case- mix rate component, as shown in the following equa tion: Total Case -Mix Adjusted Per Diem Payment = (PT Component Per Diem Rate * PT Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factor) + (OT Component Per Diem Rate * OT Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factor) + SLP Component Per Diem Rate + (NTA Component Per Diem Rate * NT A Variable Per Diem Adjustment Factor) + Nursing Component Per Diem Rate + Non- Case -Mix Component Per Diem Rate CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 50 6.7 SNF PPS Policies Requirements and policies for SNF PPS are described in greater detail in Chapter 8 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual ( https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and- Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/bp102c08.pdf ). There are some situations that the SNF may encounter that may impac t Medicare Part A SNF coverage for a resident , affect the PPS assessment schedule, or impact the rei mbursement received by the SNF. Delay in Requiring and Receiving Skilled Services (30 -Day Transfer) There are instances in which the resident does not require SNF level of care services when initially admitted to the SNF. When the resident requires and receives SNF level of care services within 30 days from the hospital discharge, Day 1 for the PPS asses sment schedule is the day on which SNF level of care services begin. For example, if a resident is discharged from the hospital on August 1 and the SNF determines on August 30 that the resident requires skilled service for a condition that was treated duri ng the qualifying hospital stay, then the SNF would start the PPS assessment schedule with a 5 -Day PPS assessment, with August 30 as Day 1 for scheduling purposes. However, if the resident requires and receives a SNF level of care 31 or more days after the hospital discharge, the resident does not qualify for a SNF Part A stay (see Medical Appropriateness Exception below). Medical Appropriateness Exception (Deferred Treatment) An elapsed period of more than 30 days is permitted for starting SNF Part A servi ces when a resident 's condition makes it inappropriate to begin an active course of treatment in a SNF immediately after a qualifying hospital stay discharge. It is applicable only where, under accepted medical practice, the established pattern of treatmen t for a particular condition indicates that a covered level of SNF care will be required within a predeterminable time frame, and it is medically predictable at the time of hospital discharge that the resident will require SNF level of care within a predet ermined time period (for more detailed information see Chapter 8 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual ). For example, a resident is admitted to the SNF after a qualifying hospital stay for an open reduction and internal fixation of a hip. It is determined upon hospital discharge that the resident is not ready for weight -bearing activity but will most likely be ready in 4 -6 weeks. The physician writes an order to start therapy when the resident is able to tolerate weight bearing. Once the resident is able to start therapy, the Medicare Part A stay begins, and the 5- Day assessment will be performed. Day 1 of the stay will be the first day on which the resident starts therapy services. Interrupted Stay An \"interrupted\" SNF stay is defined as one in which a resi dent is discharged from SNF care and subsequently readmitted to the same SNF (not a different SNF) within 3 days or less after the discharge (the \"interruption window\"). The interruption window is a 3- day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days, ending at midnight. In other words, the resident must return to the same SNF by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day. The CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 51 interruption window begins on the first non- covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A-covered stay. If both conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and the assessment schedule. The variable per diem schedule continues from the day of the previous discharge. For example, if the resident was discharged on Day 7, payment rates resume at Day 7 upon readmission. The assessment schedule also continues from the day of the previous discharge. Thus, no new 5- Day assessment is required upon the subsequent readmission, although the optional IPA may be completed at clinician's discretion. If a resident is readmitted to the same SNF more than 3 consecutive calendar days after discharge, OR in any instance when the resident is admitted to a different SNF (regardless of the length of time between stays), then the Interrupted Stay Policy does not apply , and the subsequent stay i s considered a new stay. In such cases, the variable per diem schedule resets to Day 1 payment rates, and the assessment schedule also resets to Day 1, necessitating the completion of a new 5 -Day assessment. Example 1: Mrs. A is admitted to the SNF on 11/07/19. She is admitted to a hospital on 11/20/19. She returns to the same SNF on 11/25/19. Because Mrs. A is readmitted to the same SNF more than three calendar days after discharge, this would be considered a new stay. The assessment schedule would be reset to Day 1, beginning with a new 5- Day assessment, and the variable per diem schedule would begin from Day 1. Example 2: Mr. B is admitted to the SNF on 11/07/19. He is admitted to the hospital on 11/20/19. H e is admitted to a different SNF on 11/22/19. Be cause Mr. B is admitted to a different SNF, this would be considered a new stay. The assessment schedule would be reset, beginning with a new 5 -Day assessment, and the variable per diem schedule would begin from Day 1. Example 3: Mrs. C is admitted to the SNF on 11/07/19. She is admitted to a hospital on 11/20/19. She returns to the same SNF on 11/22/19. Because Mrs. C is admitted to the same SNF within three days from the point of discharge, this would be considered a continuation of the previous stay. No 5- Day assessment would be required upon readmission, though the IPA would be an option. Additionally, the variable per diem would continue from Day 14 (Day of Discharge). Resident Discharged from Part A Skilled Services and Returns to SNF Part A Skilled Level Services In the situation in which a resident is discharged from SNF Medicare Part A services and later requires SNF Part A skilled level of care services, and it is not an instance of an interrupted stay (as described above), the resident may be eligible for Medicare Part A SNF coverage if the following criteria are met: 1. Less than 30 days have elapsed since the last day on which SNF level of care services were required and rec eived, CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 52 2. SNF-level services required by the resident are for a condition that was treated during the qualifying hospital stay or for a condition that arose while receiving care in the SNF for a condition for which the beneficiary was previously treated in t he hospital, 3. Services must be reasonable and necessary, 4. Services can only be provided on an inpatient basis, 5. Resident must require and receive the services on a daily basis, and 6. Resident has remaining days in the SNF benefit period. For greater detail, ref er to the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual , Chapter 8. 6.8 Non-compliance with the SNF PPS Assessment Schedule To receive payment under the SNF PPS, the SNF must complete scheduled and unscheduled assessments as described in Chapter 2. According to 42 CFR 41 3.343, an assessment that does not have an ARD within the prescribed ARD window will be paid at the default rate for the number of days the ARD is out of compliance. Frequent late assessment scheduling practices or missing assessments may result in additio nal review. The default rate (ZZZZZ) takes the place of the otherwise applicable Federal rate. It is equal to the sum of the rate paid for the case- mix group reflecting the lowest acuity level under each PDPM component, and would generally be lower than the Medicare rate payable if the SNF had submitted an assessment in accordance with the prescribed assessment schedule. Late Assessment If the SNF fails to set the ARD within the defined ARD window for a PPS assessment, and the resident is still on Part A, the SNF must complete a late assessment. The ARD can be no earlier than the day the error was identified. The SNF will bill the default rate for the number of days that the assessment is out of compliance. This is equal to the number of days between the day following the last day of the available ARD window and the late ARD (including the late ARD). The SNF would then bill the Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) code established by the late assessment for the remaining period of time that the assessment would have controlled payment. For example, a 5 -Day assessment with an ARD of Day 11 is out of compliance for 3 days and t herefore would be paid at the default rate for Days 1 through 3 and the HIPPS code from the late 5 -Day assessment for the remainder of the Part A stay, unless an IPA is completed. In the case of a late assessment, the variable per diem schedule still begin s on Day 1 of the stay and not with the late assessment ARD and default billing will be assessed prior to billing based on the late 5 -Day assessment. CMS's RAI Version 3.0 Manual CH 6: Medicare SNF PPS October 2019 Page 6- 53 Missed Assessment If the SNF fails to set the ARD of a PPS assessment prior to the end of the last day of the ARD window, and the resident is no longer a SNF Part A resident , and as a result a PPS assessment does not exist in the QIES ASAP system for the payment period, the provider may not usually bill for days when an assessment does not exist in the QIES AS AP system . When a PPS assessment does not exist in the QIES ASAP system , there is not a HIPPS code the provider may bill. In order to bill for Medicare SNF Part A services, the provider must submit a valid PPS assessment that is accepted into the QIES ASAP system . The provider must bill the HIPPS code that is verified by the system. If the resident was already discharged from Medicare Part A when this is discovered, a PPS assessment may not be performed. However, there are instances when the SNF may bill the default code when a PPS assessment does not exist in the QIES ASAP system. These exceptions are: 1. The stay is less than 8 days within a spell of illness, 2. The SNF is notified on an untimely basis of or is unaware of a Medicare Secondary Payer denial, 3. The S NF is notified on an untimely basis of a beneficiary's enrollment in Medicare Part A, 4. The SNF is notified on an untimely basis of the revocation of a payment ban, 5. The beneficiary requests a demand bill, or 6. The SNF is notified on an untimely basis or is una ware of a beneficiary's disenrollment from a Medicare Advantage plan. ARD Outside the Medicare Part A SNF Benefit A SNF may not use a date outside the SNF Part A Medicare Benefit (i.e., 100 days) as the ARD for a PPS assessment. For example, the resident returns to the SNF on December 11 following a hospital stay, requires and receives SNF skilled services (and meets all other required coverage criteria), and has 3 days left in his or her SNF benefit period. The SNF must set the ARD for the PPS assessment o n December 11, 12, or 13 to bill for the HIPPS code associated with the assessment.

CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix A: Glossary and Common Acronyms October 2019 Appendix A -10 Term Abbreviation Definition Interrupted Sta y Interrupted Stay is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A -covered stay) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A -covered stay during the interruption window. Interrupt ion Window The interruption window is a 3- day period, starting with the calendar day of discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or ret urn to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A- covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non -covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A -covered stay for the purposes of both the v ariable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion. Invalid Record As defined by the MDS Correction Policy, a record that was accepted into QIES ASAP that should not have been submitted.

Return to Community Referral October 2019 Appendix C-83 20. RETURN TO COMMUNITY REFERRAL Review of Return to Community Referral Steps in the Process 1. Document in the care plan whether the individual indicated a desire to talk to someone about the possibility of returning to the community or not (Q0500B). 2. Discuss with the individual and his or her family to identify potential barriers to transition planning. The care planning/discharge pl anning team should have additional discussions with the individual and family to develop information that will support the individual's smooth tran sition to community living. (Q0100) 3. Other factors to consider regarding the individual's discharge assessm ent and planning for community supports include: Cognitive skills for decision making (C1000) and Cognitive deficits (C0500, C0700- C1000) Functional/mobility (G0110) or balance (G0300) problems Need for assistive devices and/or home modifications if cons idering a discharge home 4. Inform the discharge planning team and other facility staff of the individual's choice. 5. Look at the previous care plans of this individual to identify their previous responses and the issues or barriers they expressed. Consider the individual's overall goals of care and discharge planning from previous items responses (Q0300 and Q0400A ). Has the individual indicated that his or her goal is for end -of-life-care (palliative or hospice care)? Or does the individual expect to return home after rehabilitation in your facility? (Q0300, Q0400) 6. Initiate contact with the State -designated local contact agency within approximately 10 business days, and document (Q0600). Follow -up is expected in a \"reasonable\" amount of time, 10 business days is a recommendation and not a requirement. 7. If the local contact agency does not contact the individual by telephone or in person within approximately 10 business days, make another follow -up call to the desi gnated local contact agency as necessary. The level and type of response needed by a particular individual is determined on a resident -by-resident basis, so timeframes for response may vary depending on the needs of the resident and the supports available within the community. 8. Communicate and collaborate with the State -designated local contact agency on the discharge process. Identify and address challenges and barriers facing the individual in their discharge process. Develop solutions to these challeng es in the discharge/transition plan. 9. Communicate findings and concerns with the facility discharge planning team, the individual's support circle, the individual's physician and the local contact agency in order to facilitate discharge/transition plann ing.

CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix D: Interviewing to Increase Resident Voice October 2019 Appendix D -1 APPENDIX D: INTERVIE WING TO INCREASE RES IDENT VOICE IN MDS ASSESSMENTS All residents capable of any communication should be asked to provide information regarding what they consider to be the most important facets of their lives. There are several MDS 3.0 sections that require direct interview of the resident as the primary s ource of information (e.g., mood, preferences, pain). Self -report is the single most reliable indicator of these topics. Staff should actively seek information from the resident regarding these specific topic areas; however, resident interview/inquiry should become part of a supportive care environment that helps residents fulfill their choices over aspects of their lives. In addition, a simple performance -based assessment of cognitive function can quickly clarify a resident's cognitive status. The majority of residents, even those with moderate to severe cognitive impairment, are able to answer some simple questions about these topics. Even simple scripted interviews like those in MDS 3.0 involve a dynamic, collaborative process. There are some basic approaches that can make interviews simpler and more effective. Introduce yourself to the resident . Be sure the resident can hear what you are saying. \u2014 Do not mumble or rush. Articulate words clearly. \u2014 Ask the resident if he or she uses or owns a hearing aid or ot her communication device. \u2014 Help him or her get the aid or device in place before starting the interview. \u2014 The assessor may need to offer an assistive device (headphones). \u2014 If the resident is using a hearing aid or other communication device make sure that it is operational. Ask whether the resident would like an interpreter (language or signing) if the resident does not appear to be fluent in English or continues to have difficulty understanding. Interpreters are people who translate oral or written language f rom one language to another. If an interpreter is used during resident interviews, he or she should not attempt to determine the intent behind what is being translated, the outcome of the interview, or the meaning or significance of the interviewee's respo nses. The resident should determine meaning based solely on his or her interpretation of what is being translated. Find a quiet, private area where you are not likely to be interrupted or overheard. This is important for several reasons: \u2014 Background noise s hould be minimized. \u2014 Some items are personal, and the resident will be more comfortable answering in private. The interviewer is in a better position to respond to issues that arise. \u2014 Decrease available distractions. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix D: Interviewing to Increase Resident Voice October 2019 Appendix D -2 Sit where the resident can see you clearly and you c an see his or her expressions. \u2014 Have your face well lighted. \u2014 Minimize glare. \u2014 Ask the resident where you should sit so that he or she can see you best. Some residents have decreased central vision or limited ability to turn their heads. Establis h rapport and respect . \u2014 The steps you have already taken to ensure comfort go a long way toward establishing rapport and demonstrating respect. \u2014 You can also engage the resident in general conversation to help establish rapport. \u2014 If the resident asks a particular question or makes a request, try to address the request or question before proceeding with the interview. Explain the purpose of the questions to the resident. \u2014 Start by introducing the topic and explain that you are going to ask a series of questions. \u2014 You can tell the resident that these questions are designed to be asked of everyone to make sure that nothing is missed. \u2014 Highlight what you will ask. \u2014 End by explaining that his or her answers will help the care team develop a care plan that is appropriate for the resident. \u2014 Suggested explanations and introductions are included in specific item instructions. Say and show the item responses . \u2014 It is helpful to many older adults to both hear and read the response options. \u2014 As you verbally review the response options, show the resident the items written in large, clear print on a piece of paper or card. \u2014 Residents may respond to questions verbally, by pointing to their answers on the visual aid or by writing out their answers. Ask the questions as they appear in the questionnaire. \u2014 Use a nonjudgmental approach to questioning. \u2014 Don't be afraid of what the resident might say; you are there to hear it. \u2014 Actively listen; these questions can provide insights beyond the direct answer. Break the qu estion apart if necessary . If the resident has difficulty understanding, requests clarification, or seems hesitant, you can employ unfolding or disentangling techniques. (Do not, however, use these techniques for the memory test). 1. Unfolding refers to the u se of a general question about the symptom followed by a sequence of more specific questions if the symptom is reported as present. This approach walks the resident through the steps needed to think through the question. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix D: Interviewing to Increase Resident Voice October 2019 Appendix D -3 Example: Read the item (or part o f the item) to the resident, then ask, \"Do you have this at all?\" If yes, then ask, \"Do you have it every day?\" If no, then ask, \"Did you have it at least half the days in the past 2 weeks?\" 2. Disentangling refers to separating items with several parts into manageable pieces. The type of items that lend themselves to this approach are those that include a list and phrases such as \"and\" or \"or.\" The resident is given a chance to respond to each piece separately. If a resident responds positively to more than one component of a complex item, obtain a frequency rating for each positive response and score that item using the frequency of the component that occurred most often. Example: An item asks about \"Poor appetite or overeating.\" Disentangle this item by asking, \"Poor appetite?\"; pause for a response and then ask, \"Or overeating?\" If neither part is rated positively by the resident, mark no. If either or both are rated positively, then mark yes. Clarify using echoing. If the resident appears to understand but is having difficulty selecting an answer, try clarifying his or her response by first echoing what he or she told you and then repeating the related response options. \u2014 Echoing means simply restating part of the resident's response. This is often extremely helpful during clinical interviews. If the resident provides a related response but does not use the provided response scale or fails to directly answer the question, then help clarify the best response by repeating the resident's own comment and then a sking the related response options again. This interview approach frequently helps the resident clarify which response option he or she prefers. Repeat the response options as needed. Some residents might need to have response choices repeated for each item on a given list. Move on to another question if the resident is unable to answer. \u2014 Even if the interview item cannot be completed the time spent is not wasted. The observation of resident behaviors and attention during the interview attempt provide import ant insights into delirium, cognition, mood, etc. Break up the interview if the resident becomes tired or needs to leave for rehabilitation, etc. \u2014 Try to complete the current item set and then offer to come back at another time to complete the remaining interview sections. \u2014 It is particularly important to complete the performance -based cognitive items in one sitting. Do not try to talk a resident out of an answer . If the resident expresses strong emotions, be nonjudgmental, and listen. Record the resident's r esponse, not what you believe he or she should have said. If the resident becomes deeply sorrowful or agitated, sympathetically respond to his or her feelings. \u2014 Allowing emotional expression \u2014even when it is uncomfortable for you as the interviewer \u2014recognizes its validity and provides cathartic support to residents. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix D: Interviewing to Increase Resident Voice October 2019 Appendix D -4 \u2014 If the resident remains agitated or overly emotional and does not want to continue, respond to his or her needs. This is more important than finishing the interview at that moment. You can comple te this and other sections at a later point in time. Resident preferences may be influenced by many factors in a resident's physical, psychological and environmental state, and can be challenging to truly discern . \u2014 Residents should be encouraged to articula te their desires and not be strictly limited by their physical limitations and perceived environmental restrictions. \u2014 When a resident is unable to communicate information about his or her preferences, a family member, close friend, or other representative m ust be used to complete preference questions. In this case, it is important to emphasize that this person should try to answer based on what the resident would prefer. The resident's preferences while in the nursing home and the resident's current response s when the particular item is offered or provided should form the basis for these responses. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix ORING RULES AND INSTRUCTION FOR BIMS (WHEN ADMINISTERED IN WRIT ING) Scoring Rules: Resident Mood Interview Total Severity Score D0300 Item D0300 is used to store the total severity score for the Resident Mood Interview. The score in item D0300 is based upon the sum of the values that are contained in the following as the \"items in Column 2\", below. The following rules explain how to compute the score that is placed in item D0300. These rules consider the \"number of missing items in Column 2\" which is the number of items in Column 2 that are either skipped or are equal to dash. An item in Column 2 could be skipped if the corresponding item in Column 1 was equal to 9 (no response). An item in Column 2 could be equal to dash if the item could not be assessed for some other reason (e.g., if the resident was unexpectedly discharged before the assessment could be completed). If all of the items in Column 2 have a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., they all contain non-missing values), then item D0300 is equal to the simple sum of those values. If any of the items in Column 2 are skipped or equal to dash, then omit their values when computing the sum. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to one , then compute the simple sum of the eight items in Column 2 that have non- missing values, multiply the sum by 9/8 (1.125), and place the result rounded to the nearest integer in item D0300. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to two , then compute the simple sum of the seven items in Column 2 that have non- missing values, multiply the sum by 9/7 (1.286), and place the result rounded to the nearest integer in item D0300. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to three or more but at least one of the items in Column 2 is not equal to dash, then item D0300 must equal [99]. If all of the items in Column 2 are equal to dash , then enter dash in item D0300. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -2 Scoring Rules: Resident Mood Interview Total Severity Score: D0300 (cont.) Example 1: All Items in Column 2 Have Non-missing Values The following example shows how to score the resident interview when all of the items in Column 2 have non- missing values: Item Value D0200A2 0 D0200B2 1 D0200H2 3 D0200I2 2 D0300 14 In this example, all of the items in Column 2 have non- missing values (i.e., none of the values are skipped or equal to dash). Therefore, the value of D0300 is equal to the simple sum of the values in Column 2, which is 14. Example 2: One Missing Value in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the resident interview when one of the items in Column 2 has a missing value: Item Value D0200A2 0 D0200B2 1 D0200C2 3 D0200I2 2 RAI 3 .0 Manual Appendix E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -3 Scoring Rules: Resident Mood Interview Total Severity Score: D0300 (cont.) In this example, one of the items in Column 2 (D0200E2) has a missing value (it is blank or skipped) and the other 8 items have non- missing values. D0300 is computed as follows: 1. Com pute the sum of the 8 items with non -missing values. This sum is 11. 2. Multiply this sum by 1.125. In the example, 11 x 1.125 = 12.375. 3. Round the result to the nearest integer. In the example, 12.375 rounds to 12. 4. Place the rounded result in D0300. Example 3: Two Missing Values in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the resident interview when two of the items in Column 2 have missing values: Item Value D0200A2 0 D0200B2 1 D0200C2 1 D0200H2 \u2014 D0200I2 2 D0300 10 In this example, two of the items in Column 2 have missing values: D0200E2 is blank or skipped, and D0200H2 is equal to dash. The other 7 items have non- missing values. D0300 is computed as follows: 1. Compute the sum of the 7 items with non -missing values. T his sum is 8. 2. Multiply this sum by 1.286. In the example, 8 x 1.286 = 10.288. 3. Round the result to the nearest integer. In the example, 10.288 rounds to 10. 4. Place the rounded result in D0300. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -4 Mood Interview Total Severity Score: D0300 (cont.) Example 4: Three or More Missing Values in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the resident interview when three or more of the items in Column 2 have missing values and at least one of the values is not equal to dash: Item Value D0200A2 0 D0200B2 1 D0200C2 1 D0200H2 \u2014 D0200I2 2 D0300 99 In this example, three of the items in Column 2 have missing values: D0200E2 and D0200F2 are blank or skipped, and D0200H2 is equal to dash. The other 6 items have non-missing values and at least one of the se items is not equal to dash. Because three or more items have missing values, D0300 is equal to 99. Example 5: All Items in Column 2 Have Dashes The following example shows how to score the resident interview when all of the items in Column 2 have dashes: Item Value D0200A2 \u2014 D0200B2 \u2014 D0200C2 \u2014 D0200I2 \u2014 RAI 3 Manual E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -5 Mood Interview Total Severity Score: D0300 (cont.) In this example, all of the ite ms in Column 2 contain dashes. In this special case, enter a dash in D0300 (enter a single dash in the leftmost space of D0300 and leave the second space blank). Scoring Rules: Staff Assessment of Resident Mood Total Severity Score: D0600 Item D0600 is used to store the total severity score for the Staff Assessment of Resident M ood. The score in item D0600 is based upon the sum of the values that are co ntained in the as the \"items in Column 2\", below. The following rules explain how to compute the score that is placed in it em D0600. These rules consider the \"number of missing items in Column 2\" which is the number of items in Column 2 that are equal to dash (an item could be equal to dash if the it could not be assessed - for example, if the resident was unexpectedly dischar ged before the assessment could be completed). If all of the items in Column 2 have a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., they all contain non- missing values), then item D0600 is equal to the simple sum of those values. If any of the items in Column 2 are equal to dash, then omit their values when computing the sum. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to one , then compute the simple sum of the nine items in Column 2 that have non- missing values, multiply the sum by 10/9 (1.111), and place the result rounded to the nearest integer in item D0600. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to two , then compute the simple sum of the eight items in Column 2 that have non- missing values, multiply the sum by 10/8 (1.250), and place the result rounded to the nearest integer in item D0600. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to three or more , then enter a dash in item D0600. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -6 Scoring Rules: Assessment of Resident Mood Total Severity Score: D0600 (cont.) Example 1: All Items in Column 2 Have Non-missing Values The following example s hows how to score the resident interview when all of the items in Column 2 have non- missing values: Item Value D0500A2 0 D0500B2 3 D0500I2 2 D0500J2 1 D0600 15 In this example, all of the items in Column 2 have non- missing values (i.e., none of the values are skipped or equal to dash). Therefore, the value of D0600 is equal to the simple sum of the values in Column 2, which is 15. Example 2: One Missing Value in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the resident interview when one of the items in Column 2 has a missing value: Item Value D0500A2 0 D0500B2 1 D0500C2 2 D0500J2 1 RAI 3 Manual E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -7 Scoring Rules: Assessment of Resident Mood Total Severity Score: D0600 (cont.) In this example, one of the items in Column 2 (D0500E2) has a missing value (it is equal to dash) and the other 9 items have non- missing values. D0600 is computed as follows: 1. Compute the sum of the 9 items with non -missing values. This sum is 12. 2. Multiply this sum by 1.111 (See bullet 5 on page E -5 for calculation of multiplier). In the example, the sum of non- missing values is 12. Therefore, the calculation is: 12 x 1.111 = 13.332. 3. Round the result to the nearest integer. In the example, 13.332 rounds to 13. 4. Place the rounded result in D0600. Example 3: Two Missing Values in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the resident interview when two of the items in Column 2 have missing values: Item Value D0500A2 0 D0500B2 1 D0500C2 \u2014 D0500I2 2 D0500J2 1 D0600 11 In this example, two of the items in Column 2 have missing values: D0500E2 and D0500H2 are equal to dash. The other 8 items have non -missing values. D0600 is computed as follows: 1. Compute the sum of the 8 items with non -missing values. This sum is 9. 2. Multip ly this sum by 1.250 (See bullet 6 on page E -5 for calculation of multiplier). In the example, the sum of non- missing values is 9. T herefore, the calculation is: 9 x 1.250 = 11.250. 3. Round the result to the nearest integer. In the example, 11.250 rounds to 11. 4. Place the rounded result in D0600. CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -8 Scoring Rules: Staff Assessment of Resident Mood Total Severity Score: D0600 (cont.) Example 4: Three or More Missing Values in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the resident interview when three or more of the items in Column 2 have missing values: Item Value D0500A2 0 D0500B2 1 D0500C2 \u2014 D0500I2 2 D0500J2 1 D0600 \u2014 In this example, three of the items in Column 2 have missing values: D0500E2, D0500F2, and D0500H2 are equal to dash. Because three or more items have missing values, enter a dash in D0600 (enter a single dash in the leftmost space of D0600 and leave the s econd space blank). Instructions for BIMS When Administered in Writing When staff identify that the resident's primary method of communication is in written format, the BIMS and Category Cues can be administered in writing. The administration of the BIMS i n writing should be limited only to this circumstance. 1. Interview any resident not screened out by Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? item (C0100). 2. Conduct the interview in a private setting. 3. Residents with visual impairment should be t ested using their usual visual aids. 4. Minimize glare by directing light sources away from the resident's face and from written materials. 5. Provide a written introduction before starting the interview. Suggested language: \"I would like to ask you some questions, which I will show you in a moment. We ask everyone these same questions. This will help us provide you with better care. Some of the questions may seem very easy, while others may be more difficult. We ask these questions of everyone so we can make sur e that our care will meet your needs.\" CMS's RAI Version 3 .0 Manual Appendix E: PHQ9 October 2019 Appendix E -9 6. Directly provide the written questions for each item in C0200 through C0400 at one sitting and in the order provided. For each BIMS question, show the resident a sheet of paper or card with the instruction for that question from the form clearly written in a large enough font to be easily seen. The resident may respond to any of the BIMS questions in writing. Show separa te sheets or cards f or each question or statement. For C0200 items, instructions should be written as: \u2014 I have written 3 words for you to remember. Please read them. Then I will remove the card and ask you repeat or write down the words as you remember them. \u2014 Category cues should be provided to the resident in writing after the resident's first attempt to answer. Written category cues should state: \"sock, something to wear; blue, a color; bed, a piece of furniture.\" For C0300 items, instructions should be written as: \u2014 C0300A: \"Please tell me what year it is right now.\" \u2014 C0300B: \"What month are we in right now?\" \u2014 C0300C: \"What day of the week is today?\" For C0400 items, instructions should be written as: \u2014 \"Let's go back to an earlier question. What we re those three words that I asked you to repeat?\" \u2014 If the resident is unable to remember a word, provide Category cues again, but without using the actual word. Therefore, Category cues for: C0400A should be written as \"something to wear,\" C0400B should be written as \"a color,\" and C0500C should be written as \"a piece of furniture.\" 7. If the resident chooses not to answer a particular item, accept his or her refusal and move on to the next questions. For C0200 through C0400, code refusals as incorrect. 8. Rules for stopping the interview are the same as if for administering the BIMS verbally. The following resources may be used, or the facility may develop their own. If the facility develops their own, they must use the exact language as in these resources.

Interruption Window Is a 3 -day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A -covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non -covered day following a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A - covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completi on.

Code 0, no: if the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A -covered stay) but did not resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window.

Examples include, but are not limited to, th e following: o Resident elects the hospice benefit , thereby declining the SNF benefit , and then revokes the hospice benefit and resumes SNF -level care within the interruption window . o Resident refuses to participate in rehabilitation and has no other daily skilled need; this ends the Part A coverage. Within the interruption window , the resident decides to engage in the planned rehabilitation regime and Part A coverage resumes. o Resident changes payer sources from Medicare Part A to an alternate payer source (i.e. , hospice, private pay or private insurance) and then wishes to resume their Medicare Part A stay, at the same SNF, within the interruption window . 3 A0310 A-10 If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF, and resumes a Part A -covered stay in the SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. No discharge assessment (OBRA or Part A PPS) is required, nor is an Entry Tracking Record or 5- Day requi red on resumption. If a resident leaves the SNF and returns to resume Part A - covered services in the same SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. Although this situation does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay, the resident lef t the SNF, and therefore an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. On return to the SNF, no 5 -Day would be required. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated.

If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF and does not resume Part A -covered services within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, a Part A PPS Discharge is required. If the resident qualif ies and there is a resumption of Part A services within the 30- day window allowed by Medicare, a 5 -Day would be required as this would be considered a new Part A stay. The OBRA schedule would continue from the resident's original date of admission ( item A1 900). If a resident leaves the SNF and does not return to resume Part A -covered services in the same SNF within the interruption window , an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, both the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments are required (and may be combined). If the resident returns to the same SNF, this would be considered a new Part A stay. An Entry Tracking record and 5 -Day would be required on r eturn. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. The OBRA assessment schedule is unaffected by the interrupted stay policy.

Lower body dressing: Mr. D is required to follow hip precautions as a result of recent hip surgery. The occupational therapist in the acute care hospital instructed him in the use of adaptive equipment to facilitate lower body dressing. He requires a helper to retrieve his clothing from the closet. Mr. D uses his adaptive equipment to assist in threading his legs into his pants. Because of balance issues, Mr. D needs the helper to steady him when standing to manage pulling on or pulling down his pants/ undergarments. Mr. D also needs some assistance to put on and take off his socks and shoes. 3 GG0130 GG-27 3. Lower body dressing: Mrs. R has peripheral neuropathy in her upper and lower extremities. Each morning, Mrs. R needs assistance from a helper to place her lower limb into, or to take it out of (don/doff), her lower limb prosthesis. She needs no assistance to put on and remove her underwear or slacks. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: A helper performs less than half the effort of lower body dressing (with a prosthesis considered a piece of clothing). The helper lifts, holds, or supports Mrs. R's trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort for the task of lower body dressing. In contrast, coding le vel 04, Supervision or touching assistance, is used if the helper provides either verbal cues and/or only touching/steadying assistance as the resident completes the activity.

She requires setup for retrieving her socks and shoes, which she prefers to keep in the closet. Mrs. F often drops her shoes and socks as she attempts to put them onto her feet or as she takes them off. Often a certified nursing assistant must first thread her socks or shoes over her toes, and then Mrs. F can complete the task. Mrs. F needs the certified nursing assistant to initiate taking off her socks and unstrapping the Velcro used for fastening her shoes.

Assess the resident's mobility performance based on direct observation, as well as the resident's incorporating resident self-report and the report s ofand reports from qualified clinicians, direct care staff, or family documented in the resident's medical record during the three -day assessment period. CMS anticipates that a multidisciplinary team of qualified clinicians is involv ed in assessing the resident during the three -day assessment period. For Section GG, the assessment period is the first three days of the Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare Stay. On admission, these items are compl eted only when A0310B = 01 (5 -Day PPS assessment). For the Interim Payment Assessment (A0310B=08), the assessment period for Section GG is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and two days prior). 3 GG0170 GG-37 5. The admission functional assessment, when possible, should be conducted prior to the personresident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine a reflect the resident's true admission baseline functional status on admission . If treatment has started, for example, on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment. 3 GG0170 GG-38 Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance : if the helper provides verbal cues or touching /steadying /contact guard assista nce as resident completes activ ity.

For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6- point scale and activi ty not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and t he 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. 3 GG017 0 GG-40 Admission, Interim, and Discharge Performance Coding Tips 3 GG0170 GG-40 General Coding Tips When reviewing the medical record, interviewing staff, and observing the resident, be familiar with the definition for each activity.

Chair/bed -to-chair transfer: M r. U had his left lower leg amputated due to gangrene associated with his diabetes mellitus and he has reduced sensation and strength in his right leg. He has not yet received his below -the-knee prosthesis. Mr. U uses a transfer board for chair/bed- to-chair transfers. The therapist places the transfer board u nder his buttock. Mr. U then attempts to scoot from the bed onto the transfer board. Mr. U has reduced sensation in his hands and limited upper bod y strength, but assists with the transfer. Th e physical therapist assists him in side scooting by lifting his buttocks/ trunk in a rocking motion across the transfer board and into the wheelchair. 3 GG0170 GG-51 Coding Tips for GG0170G, Car transfer For item GG0170G, Car transfer, use of an indoor car can be used to simulate outdoor car transfers. These half or full cars would need to have similar physical features of a real car for the purpose of simulating a car transfer, that is, a car seat within a car cabin. The Car transfer item does not include transfers into the driver's seat, opening/closing the car door , fastening/unfastening the seat belt. The Car transfer item includes the resident's ability to transfer in and out of the passenger seat of a car or car simulator. In the event of inclement weather or if an indoor car simulator or outdoor car is not available during the entire 3-day assessment period , then use code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations. If at the time of the assessment the resident is unable to attempt car transfers, and could not perform the car transfers prior to the cu rrent illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. 3 GG0170 GG-53 4. Walk 10 feet : Mr. O has bilateral upper extremity tremors, lower extremity weakness, and Parkinson's disease. A therapy physical therapist assistant guides and steadies the shaking, rolling walker forward while cueing Mr. O to take larger steps. Mr. O requires steadying at the beginning of the walk and progressively requires some of his weight to be supported for the last two feet of the 10 -foot walk.

Walk 50 feet with two turns: Mr. T walks 50 feet with the therapist providing trunk support and the therapy assistant providing supervision. He also requires a second helper, the rehabilitation aide, who provides supervision and follows closely behind with a wheelchair for safety. Mr. T walks the 50 feet with two turns with the assistance of two helpers . 3 GG0170 GG-57 If the resident walks and is not learning how to mobilize in a wheelchair, and only uses a wheelchair for transport between locations within the facility or for staff convenience (e.g., because the resident walks slowly) , code the wheelchair gateway items at admission and/or discharge\u2014GG0170Q1 and/or GG0170Q3, Does the resident use a wheelchair/scooter? \u2014as 0, No, and skip all remai ning wheelchair questions. 3 GG0170 GG-58 3. Wheel 50 feet with two turns : Mr. R is very motivated to use his motorized wheelchair with an adaptive throttle for speed and steering. Mr. R has a myotrophic l ateral s clerosis , and moving his upper and lower extremities is very difficult. The therapy physical therapist assistant is required to walk next to Mr. R for frequent readjustments of his hand position to better control the steering and speed throttle. Mr. R often drives too close to corners, becoming stuck near doorways upon turning, preventing him from continui ng to mobilize/wheel himself. The therapy physical therapist assistant backs up Mr. R's wheelchair for him so that he may continue mobilizing/wheeling himself. 3 GG0170 GG-59 5. Wheel 50 feet with two turns: Mr. V had a spinal tumor resulting in paralysis of his lower extremities. The therapy physical therapist assistant provides verbal instruction for Mr. V to navigate his manual wheelchair in his room and into the hallway while making two turns. 3 GG0170 GG-61 9. Wheel 150 feet : Mr. A has a cardiac condition with medical precautions that do not allow him to participate in propel his own wheelchair mobilization . Mr. A is completely dependent on a helper to wheel him 150 feet using a manual wheelchair.

Ms. K is a 67 -year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes who is admitted after a stroke. The diagnosis of stroke, as well as the history of Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes, is documented in Ms. K's history and physical by the adm itting physician. Coding: I0020 would be coded 01, Stroke. I0020B would be coded as I69.051 The physician's history and physical documents the diagnosis stroke as the reason for Ms. K's admission. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category. 3 I0020 I-3 2. Mrs. E is an 82 -year-old female who was hospitalized for a hip fracture with subsequent total hip replacement and is admitted for rehabilitation. The admitting physician documents Mrs. E's primary medical condition as total hip replacement (THR) in her medical record. The hip fracture resulting in the total hip replacement is also documented in the medical record in the discharge summary from the acute care hospital. Coding: I0020 would be coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. I0020B would be coded as S72.062D (Displaced ar ticular fracture of the head of the left femur). Rationale: Medical record documentation demonstrates that Mrs. E had a total hip replacement due to a hip fracture and required rehabilitation. Because she was admitted for rehabilitation as a result of the hip fracture and total hip replacement, Mrs. E's primary medical condition category is 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The ICD-10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category.

Mrs. H is a 93 -year-old female with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease who is admitted to the facility, where she will complete her course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics after an acute episode of urosepsis. The discharge diagnoses of urosepsis, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension are documented in the physician's discharge summary from the acute care hospital and are incorporated into Mrs. H's medical record. Coding: I0020 would be coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. Rationale: The physician's discharge summary from the acute care hospital documents the need for IV antibiotics due to urosepsis as the reason for Mrs. H's admission to the facility. 3 I0020 I-4 3. Mrs. H is a 78 -year-old female with a history of hypertension and a hip replacement 2 years ago. She was admitted to an extended hospitalization for idiopathic pancreatitis. She had a central line placed during the hospitalization so she could receive TPN (total parenteral nutrition). She also received r egular blood glucose monitoring and treatment with insulin when she became hyperglycemic. During her SNF stay, she is being transitioned from being NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving her nutrition parenterally to being able to tolerate oral nutrition. Th e hospital discharge diagnoses of idiopathic pancreatitis, hypertension, and malnutrition were incorporated into Mrs. H's SNF medical record. Coding: I0020 would be coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. I0020B would be coded as K85.00 (Idiopathic acute pancreatitis without necrosis or infection). Rationale: Mrs. H had hospital care for pancreatitis immediately prior to her SNF stay. Her principal diagnosis of pancreatitis was included in the summary from the hospital. The surgical placement of her central line does not change her care to a surgical category because it is not considered to be a major surgery. The ICD -10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category.

Identify recent surgeries: The surgeries in this section must have been documented by a physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws) in the last 30 days and must have occurred during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission . Medical record sources for recent surgeries include progress notes, the most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, diagnosis/problem list, and other r esources as available. Although open communication regarding resident information between the physician and other members of the interdisciplinary team is important, it is also essential that resident information communicated verbally be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure follow -up. Surgery informat ion, including past history obtained from family members and close contacts, must also be documented in the medical record by the physician to ensure validity and follow -up.

Determine whether the surgeries require active care during the SNF stay: Once a recent surgery is identified, it must be determined if the surgery requires active care during the SNF stay . Surgeries requiring active care during the SNF stay are surgeries that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF d iagnosis, as coded in I0020B. Do not include conditions that have been resolved, do not affect the resident's current status, or do not drive the resident's plan of care during the 7 -day look- back period, as these would be considered surgeries that do not require active care during the SNF stay . Check the following information sources in the medical record for the last 30 days to identify \"active\" surgeries: transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, recent discharge summaries, nursing assessments, nursing care plans, medication sheets, doctor's orders, consults and official diagnostic reports, and other sources as available. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-40 Coding Instructions Code surgeries that are documented to have occurred in the last 30 days, and during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission, that have a direct relationship to the resident's primary SNF diagnosis, as coded in I0020B .

In the rare circumstance of the absence of specific documentation that a surgery requires active SNF care, the following indicators may be used to confirm that the surgery requires active SNF care: The inherent complexity of the services prescribed for a resident is such that they can be performed safely and /or effectively only by or under the general supervision of skilled nursing. For example: \u2014 The management of a surgical wound that requires skilled care (e.g., managing potential infection or drainage). \u2014 Daily skilled therapy to restore functional loss after surgical procedure s. \u2014 Administration of medication and monitoring that requires skilled nursing.

Mrs. V was hospitalized for gram -negative pneumonia. Since this was her second episode of pneumonia in the past six months, a diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed while in the hospital. She also has Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. She was di scharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment for her pneumonia and requires daily skilled care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions, and the I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is J15.6, Pneumonia due to other aerobic Gram -negative bacteria. There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery ; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. V did not receive any major surgery during the prior inpatient stay, and she was admitted to the SNF for continued care due to pneumonia . 3 J2300 - J5000 J-43 2. Mrs. O, a diabetic, was hospitalized for sepsis from an infection due to Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus that developed after outpatient bunion surgery . A central line was placed to administer antibiotics. She was discharged to a SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is A41.01 (Sepsis due to Methicillin susceptible S taphylococcus aureus). There is no documentation that the resident had major surgery; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Neither the placement of a central line nor the outpatient bunion surgery is considered to be a major surgery , but the resident was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring.

Mrs. H was hospitalized for severe back pain from a compression fracture of a lumbar vertebral body, which was caused by her age -related osteoporosis. She was treated with a kyphoplasty that relieved her pain. She was transferred to a SNF after discharge because of her mild dementia and need to regulate her anticoagulant treatment f or atrial fibrillation. Coding: I0020 is coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is M80.08XD (Age -related osteoporosis with current pathological fracture, vertebra(e), subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing). There was no documentation that the resident had major surgery; therefore, J2100 is coded 0, No. Rationale: Mrs. H was treated with a kyphoplasty during the inpatient stay prior to SNF admission. Although k yphoplasty is a minor surgery and does not require SNF care in and of itself, the resident has other conditions requiring skilled care that are unrelated to the kyphoplasty surgery. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-44 4. Mrs. J had a craniotomy to drain a subdural hematoma after suffering a fall at home. She has COPD and uses oxygen at night. In addition, she has moderate congestive heart failure, is moderately overw eight, and has hypothyroidism. After a six-day hospital stay, she was discharged to a SNF for continuing care. The hospital discharge summary indicated that the patient had a loss of consciousness of 45 minutes. Coding: I0020 is coded 07, Other Neurological Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is S06.5X2D (Traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes, subsequent encounter). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2600, Neuro surgery - brain, surrounding tissue or blood vessels , would be checked. Rationale: The craniotomy surgery during the inpatient stay immediately preceding the SNF stay requires continued skilled care and skilled monitoring for wound care, as well as therapies to address any deficits that led to her fall or any functional deficits resulting from her fall.

Mr. D was admitted to an acute care hospital for cytoreductive surgery for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic renal cell carcinoma and post -surgic al care. Coding: I0020 is coded as 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is C 79.01 (Secondary malignant neoplasm of the right kidney and renal pelvis ). J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2810 , Genitourinary surgery - the kidneys, ureter, adrenals, and bladder - open, laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. D was treated with a surgical procedure, genitourinary surgery of the kidney , and admitted to the SNF for further treatment of the metastatic kidney cancer and post -surgical care. 3 J2300 - J5000 J-45 6. Mr. G was admitted to an acute care hospital for severe abdominal pain. He was found to have diverticulitis of the small intestine with perforation and abscess without bleeding. He had surgery to repair the perforati on. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care. Coding: I0020 is coded 13, Medically Complex Conditions. The I0020B SNF ICD -10 code is K57.00 (Diverticulitis of small with perforation and abscess without bleeding ), and J2100 would be coded 1, Yes. J2910, Major surgery - the GI tract and abdominal contents from the esophagus to the anus, the biliary tree, gall bladder, liver, pancreas, spleen - open or laparoscopic, would be checked. Rationale: Mr. G was tr eated with a surgical procedure, repair of the small intestine perforation, which is a major surgical procedure. He was admitted to the SNF for continued antibiotics and post -surgical care.

Rationale: The total fluid intake within the last 7 days while Mr. K. was not a resident was 1,900 cc (400 cc + 520 cc + 500 cc + 480 cc = 1,900 cc). Average fluid intake while not a resident totaled 475 cc (1,900 cc divided by 4 days). 475 cc is less than 500 cc, therefore code 1, 500 cc/day or less is correct for K0710B1, While NOT a Resident .

The definition and criteria of \"significant change of status\" is found in Chapter 2, pag e 20Section 2.6, 03. Significant Change i n Status Assessment (SCSA) (A0310A = 04). Regardless of whether the resident meets the criteria for an SCSA, a modification of the resident's plan of care will likely need to be completed. 3 O0400 O-15 Health -related Quality of Life Maintaining as much independence as possible in activities of daily living , mobility , and communication is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems , and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and duration of, the therapy services provided to residents. 3 O0400 O-16 Group minutes \u2014Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided in a group in the last 7 days. Enter 0 if none were provided. Group therapy is defined for Part A as the treatment of 4 two to six residents, regardless of payer source, who are performing the same or similar activities, and are supervised by a therapist or an assistant who is not supervising any other individuals. For Medicare Part B, treatment of two patients (or more), regardless of payer source, at the same time is documented as group treatment. For all other payers, follow Medicare Part A instructions. 3 O0400 O-17 Therapy Start Date \u2014Record the date the most recent therapy regimen (since the most recent entry/r eentry) started. This is the date the initial therapy evaluation is conducted regardless if treatment was rendered or not or the date of resumption (O0450B) on the resident's EOT OMRA, in cases where the resident discontinued and then resumed therapy.

All policies regarding mode, modalities and st udent supervision must be followed as well as all other federal, state, practice and facility policies. For example, if two therapists (from different disciplines) were conducting a group treatment session, the group must be comprised of four two to six participants who were doing the same or similar activities in each discipline. The decision to co- treat should be made on a case by case basis and the need for co - treatment should be well documented for each patient. Because co -treatment is appropriate for s pecific clinical circumstances and would not be suitable for all residents, its use should be limited. 3 O0400 O-23 Modes of Therapy A resident may receive therapy via different modes during the same day or even treatment session. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately . The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. (Please also see the section on group therapy for limited exceptions rel ated to group size.) The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether or not the resident is in a look back period for an MDS assessme nt). 3 O0400 O-23 NOTE: The minutes being coded on the MDS are unadjusted minutes, meaning, the minutes are coded in the MDS as the full time spent in therapy; however, the software grouper will allocate the minutes appropriately.

Later on during his stay at the nursing home, due to the progressive nature of his Parkinson's disease, he was referred to SLP and OT February 10, 20122020 (he remained in the facility the entire time). The speech -language pathologist evaluated him on that day and the occupational therapist evaluated him the next day. The ARD for Mr. N.'s MDS assessment is February 28, 20122020.

His physical therapy ended May 23, 2013 but the occupational therapy conti nued. Due to observed swallowing issues, he was referred to SLP on May 31, 2013 and the speech- language pathologist evaluated him on that day. Though Mr. T was able to receive both occupational therapy and speech therapy on June 12, he is unable to receive therapy on June 13 or June 14 due to a minor bout with the flu. The facility does not provide therapy on the weekends, which means that June 15, 2013 represents the third day of missed therapy, triggering an EOT OMRA. The therapy staff and nurses discuss Mr. T's condition and agree that Mr. T should be able to resume the same level of therapy beginning on June 18, 2013, so the facility decides to complete the EOT OMRA as an EOT -R, with an ARD of June 15, 2013.

She had slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, severe weakness in both her right upper and lower extremities, and a Stage III3 pressure ulcer on her left lateral malleolus. She was referred to SLP, OT, and P T with the long -term goal of returning home with her daughter and son- in-law. Her initial SLP evaluation was performed on 10/06/ 119, the PT initial evaluation on 10/07/ 119, and the OT initial evaluation on 10/09/ 119. She was also referred to recreational t herapy and respiratory therapy. The interdisciplinary team determined that 10/1913/ 119 was an appropriate ARD for her Medicare- required 14-day MDS 5-Day assessment .

Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, breathing problems, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries , which contribute to diminished quality of life. The qualified therapist, in conjunction with the physician and nursing administration, is responsible for determining the necessity for, and the frequency and duration of, the therapy services provided to res idents.

These modes are individual, concurrent and group therapy. When developing the plan of care, the therapist and assistant must determine which mode(s) of therapy and the amount of time the resident receives for each mode and code the MDS appropriately . The therapist and assistant should document the reason a specific mode of therapy was chosen as well as anticipated goals for that mode of therapy. For any therapy that does not meet one of the therapy mode definitions below, those minutes may not be counted on the MDS. The therapy mode definitions must always be followed and apply regardless of when the therapy is provided in relationship to all assessment windows (i.e., applies whether o r not the resident is in a look- back period for an MDS assessment).

If a resident receives more than one therapy discipline on a given calendar day, this may only count for one calendar day for purposes of coding item O0430. Consider the following example: Example: Mrs. T was admitted to the SNF on Sunday 10/ 06/18 and discharged on Saturday 10/26/18. S he received 60 minutes of physical therapy every Monday, Wednesday , and Friday during the SNF stay. Mrs. T also received 45 mi nutes of occupational therapy every Monday, Tuesday , and Friday during the stay. Given the therapy services received by Mrs. T during the stay, item O0430 would be coded as 12 because therapy servi ces were provided for at least 15 minutes on 12 distinct calendar days during the stay (i.e., every Monday, T uesday, Wednesday, and Friday). 3 O0450 O-41 Replaced screenshot.

If it will, determine whether therapy will resume no more than five consecutive calendar days after the last day of therapy was provided AND whether the therapy services will resume at the same level for each discipline. If No, skip to O0500, Restorative Nursing Programs. If Yes, code item O0450A as 1. Determine when therapy will resume and code item O0450B with the date that therapy will resume. For example: 3 O0450 O-41 Mrs. A. who was in RVL did not receive therapy on Saturday and Sunday because the facility did not provide weekend services and she missed therapy on Monday because of a doctor's appointment. She resumed therapy on Tuesday, November 13, 2011. The IDT determined that her RUG -IV therapy classifi cation level did not change as she had not had any significant clinical changes during the lapsed therapy days. When the EOT was filled out, item O0450 A was coded as 1 because therapy was resuming within 5 days from the last day of therapy and it was resu ming at the same RUG -IV classification level. Item O0450B was coded as 11132011 because therapy resumed on November 13, 2011. 3 O0450 O-41 NOTE: If the EOT OMRA has not been accepted in the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System ( QIES ) Assessment Submi ssion and Processing ( ASAP ) system when therapy resumes, code the EOT -R items (O0450A and O0450B ) on the assessment and submit the record. If the EOT OMRA without the EOT -R items haves been accepted into the QIES ASAP system, then submit a modification request for that EOT OMRA with the only changes being the completion of the Resumption of Therapy item s (O0450A and O0450B ) and check X0900E Z toand indicate that the reason for modification is the addition of the Resumption of Therapy dateitem.

Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers /injuries . 3 O0500 O-43 A registered nurse or a licensed practical (vocational) nurse must supervise the activities in a restorative nursing program. Sometimes, under licensed nurse supervision, other staff and volunteers will be assigned to work with specific residents. Restorative nursing does not require a physician's order. Nursing homes may elect to have licensed rehabilitation professionals perform repetitive exercises and other maintenance treatments or to supervise aides performing these maintenance services. In situations where such services do not actually require the involvement of a qualified therapist, the services may not be coded as therapy in item O0400, Therapies or O0425, Part A Therapies , because the specific interventions are considered r estorative nursing services (see item O0400, Therapies and O0425, Part A Therapies ). The therapist's time actually providing the maintenance service can be included when counting restorative nursing minutes. Although therapists may participate, members of the nursing staff are still responsible for overall coordination and supervision of restorative nursing programs. 3 O0500 O-44 Coding Instructions This item does not include procedures or techniques carried out by or under the direction of qualified therapists , as identified in Speech -Language Pathology and Audiology Services i tem O0400A or O0425A , Occupational Therapy item O0400B or and Physical Therapy item O0400C or O0425C .

Required MDS records are those assessments and tracking records that are mandated under OBRA and SNF PPS. Providers will submit the Optional State Assessment (OSA) records to the QIES ASAP system just as they submit all other MDS assessments. The OSA is not a Federally required assessment. Each State will determine if the OSA is required and when this assessment must be completed. Assessments that are completed for purposes other t han OBRA and SNF PPS reasons are not to be submitted, e.g., private insurance, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage Plans. 5 5.1 5-1 Providers must establish communication with the QIES ASAP system in order to submit a file. This is accomplishe d by using specialized communications software and hardware and the CMS wide area network. Details about these processes are available on the QIES Technical Support Office (QTSO) website at: https://www.qtso.com https://qtso.cms.gov/ . 5 5.1 5-2 Once communication is established with the QIES ASAP system, the provider can access the Welcome to the CMS QIES Systems for Providers page in the MDS system. This site allows providers to submit MDS assessment data and access various information sources such as Bulletins and Questions and Answers.

SNFs must submit assessments according to a standard schedule. This schedule must include performance of resident assess ments in at specified windows near the 5th, 14th, 30th, 60th, and 90th days of the during the Medicare Part A stay. Track Changes from Chapter 5 v1.16 to Chapter 5 v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 3 Chapter Section Page Change 5 5.4 5-6 HIPPS Codes: Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) codes are billing codes used when submitting Medicare Part A SNF payment claims to the Part A/Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC). The HIPPS code consists of five positions. Under PDPM, Tthe first three position represents the Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy (PT/OT) Payment Group, the second position represents the Speech Language Pathology (SLP) Payment Group, the third position represents the Nursing Payment Group, the fourth positi on represents the Non -therapy Ancillary (NTA) Payment Group, and the fifth position represents the positions represent the Resource Utilization Group- IV (RUG -IV) case mix code for the SNF resident, and the last two positions are an Assessment Indicator (AI ) code indicating which type of assessment was completed. Standard \"grouper\" logic and software for RUG- IVPDPM and the AI code are provided by CMS on the MDS 3.0 website. 5 5.4 5-6 The standard grouper uses MDS 3.0 items to determine both the RUG- IVPDPM group and the AI code. It is anticipated that MDS 3.0 software used by the provider will incorporate the standard grouper to automatically calculate the RUG- IVPDPM group and AI code. Detailed logic for determining the RUG- IVPDPM group and AI code is provide d in Chapter 6. The HIPPS codes to be used for Medicare Part A SNF claims are included on the MDS. There are two different HIPPS codes. 1. The Medicare Part A HIPPS code (Item Z0100A) is most often used on the claim. The RUG- IVPDPM version code in Item Z0 100B documents which version of RUG -IVPDPM was used to determine the RUG- IVPDPM payment groups represented in the Medicare Part A HIPPS code. Track Changes from Chapter 5 v1.16 to Chapter 5 v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 4 Chapter Section Page Change 5 5.4 5-6 2. The Medicare non -therapy Part A HIPPS code (Item Z0150A) is used when the provider is required to bill the non-therapy HIPPS. An example when the non- therapy HIPPS is to be billed is when the resident has been receiving rehabilitation therapy (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech -language pathology services), all rehabilitation therapy ends, and the resident continues on Part A (see Chapter 6 for details, including other instances when this HIPPS code is used for billing purposes). The RUG version code in Item Z0150B documents which version of RUG- IV was used to determine the RUG -IV gro up in the Medicare non -therapy Part A HIPPS code. There is also a Medicare Short Stay indicator (Item Z0100C) on the MDS. For a qualifying Medicare short stay, the RUG -IV grouper uses alternative rehabilitation classification logic when there has been insu fficient time to establish a full rehabilitation regime. The standard grouper uses MDS 3.0 items to determine the Medicare short stay indicator. See Chapter 6 for details. 5 5.4 5-6 Both The HIPPS code s (Z0100A and Z0150A ), the RUG and PDPM version code s (Z0100B and Z0150B ), and the Medicare Short Stay indicator (Z0100C) must be submitted to the QIES ASAP system on all Medicare PPS assessment records (indicated by A0310B = 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, or 0 78). All Both of these values are validated by the QIES ASAP sy stem. The F final V validation Rreport will indicate if any of these items is in error and the correct value for an incorrect item. Note that an error in one of these items is usually a non -fatal warning and the record will still be accepted in the QIES ASAP system. A record will receive a fatal error ( -3804) if the record is a Start of Therapy (SOT) Other Medicare- Required Assessment (OMRA) (A0310C = 1 or 3) and the QIES ASAP system calculated value for the Medicare Part A HIPPS code (Z0100A) is not a group that begins with 'R', i.e., Rehabili tation Plus Extensive Services or Rehabilitation group.

The provider would determine if the Medicare- required or Discharge assessment should be modified or inactivated. Care Area Assessments (Section V) and updated care planning are not req uired with Medicare- only and Discharge assessments. 5 5.7 5-9 Facilities should correct any errors necessary to ensure that the information in the QIES ASAP system accurately reflects the resident's identification, location, overall clinical status, or payment status. A correction can be submitted for any accepted record within 32 years of the target date of the record for facilities that are still open. If a facility is terminated, then corrections must be submitted within 2 years of the facility termination date. A record may be corrected even if subsequent records have been accepted for the resident. 5 5.7 5-11 A stand -alone Discharge assessment (ISC = ND) was completed and accepted into the ASAP system. The provider later (that is, after the day of discharge) determined that the assessment should have been a 30- day PPS assessment combined with a Discharge assessment (ISC = NP). This modification would not be allowed as the ISC for the Discharge assessment combined with the 30- day PPS is different than the stand- alone Discharge ISC. This is an example of a missing 3 0- day assessment. 5 5.7 5-11 An Admission assessment (ISC = NC) was completed and accepted into the QIES ASAP system. The provider intended to code the assessment as an Admission and a 5-day PPS assessment (ISC = NC). The modification process could be used in this case as the ISC would not change.

That is, providers may not submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed prior to October 1, 2019 to a target da te on or after October 1, 2019, nor can they submit a modification to change a target date on an assessment completed on or after October 1, 2019 to a target date prior to October 1, 2019. The item sets that are effective October 1, 2019 have had significa nt changes, including the omission and addition of many items. It is the target date of the assessment that identifies the required version of the item set, and, because of the substantial changes in the item sets, they are not interchangeable. Therefore, providers may not change target dates on assessments crossing over October 1, 2019. Modification records that contain a target date crossing over October 1, 2019 will result in a FATAL error and be REJECTED from the QIES ASAP system. However, all correc tions to target dates that align with policies in Section 5.7 of this chapter and do not violate this rule will be allowed. To correct the target date of the assessment that violates the cross -over rule, providers must inactivate the incorrect assessment and submit a replacement assessment. Examples of potential scenarios that will and will not be allowed are identified below: Original Assessment Target Date Modified Assessment Target Date Allowed or Not Allowed 8/15/19 9/30/19 Allowed 10/1/19 11/1/19 Allowed 9/15/19 10/15/19 Not Allowed 9/15/19 Not Allowed Track Changes from Chapter 6 v1.16 to Chapter 6 v1.17.1 October 2019 Page 1 Chapter Section Page Change 6 6.1-6.8 6-1- 6-53 This chapter has been extensively revised for this year's manual.

In other words, if a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A - covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non- covered day followi ng a Part A -covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non- covered day following a Part A -covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A -covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion.
