Niacin \u2014 also known as [vitamin B-3](/health/vitamin-watch-b3) \u2014 helps break down nutrients into energy. It's one of the many B vitamins. Vitamin B-3 helps maintain all of the body's cells and is essential for your metabolism. It also: - acts as a powerful [antioxidant](/nutrition/antioxidants-explained) - helps make sex and stress hormones - breaks down [fatty acids](/nutrition/what-are-omega-3-fatty-acids) - improves circulation - reduces [cholesterol](/health/high-cholesterol-symptoms)levels Niacin and depression Depression is a mood disorder [characterized by](/health/depression) intense feelings of sadness and hopelessness that may interfere with your daily life. Some people living with [depression](/health/depression) claim that vitamin B-3 has helped with it. Some say it reduces feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and others say it made their depression completely go away. There's a wide [variety of causes](/health/depression/causes) and treatments for depression. However, according to scientific research, there's currently no evidence that niacin can be used to treat depression. There's some proof, however, that people with depression may be deficient in B vitamins. If you're experiencing depression, you should discuss taking supplements or eating foods that have [niacin](/nutrition/niacin-benefits) in them with your doctor. Not getting enough [B vitamins](/health/symptoms-of-vitamin-b-deficiency) every day can cause many physical and mental consequences. The most common and least severe side effects of niacin deficiency include: - depression [apathy](/health/apathy) disorientation [memory loss](/health/memory-loss) Severe niacin deficiency can cause a potentially fatal disease called pellagra. If left untreated, it can cause: The treatment for vitamin B-3 deficiency is taking more B-3. This can be done through diet or by taking pills. The recommended daily intake for most people [is about 14-18 milligrams (mg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK114304/) Serotonin deficiency Two of the most common brain chemicals involved with depression are dopamine and [serotonin](/health/mental-health/serotonin). These chemicals, called neurotransmitters, regulate mood. Serotonin deficiency can lead to depression. This is why antidepressants known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are so effective at treating depression. Serotonin is created by an amino acid called tryptophan. Niacin is [part of](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/L-tryptophan#section=Top) the metabolizing process of forming serotonin from tryptophan. Therefore, niacin deficiency can directly impact mood by affecting your production of serotonin. [Niacin supplements](/health/depression/herbs-vitamins-supplements) are available as over-the-counter pills. You can also boost your vitamin B-3 intake by eating different foods. You can get more vitamin B-3 in your diet by eating some of the following foods: It's generally better to supplement niacin from foods than from pills because there's virtually no risk of overdose or liver damage from the niacin sources in food. Dosage The cure for vitamin B-3 deficiency might hover around the 20 mg mark, but when it comes to treatments for serious depression, a much higher dose is sometimes needed. [According to online testimonials](https://www.drugs.com/comments/niacin/for-depression.html), people with severe depression who respond to niacin therapy tend to benefit from a much higher dose, from anywhere between 1,000 to 3,000 mg. According to the [2008 nutrition documentary, Food Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2tqxKf2EE), one woman saw her depression symptoms reversed with a daily dose of 11,500 mg. There's not enough scientific research to support these claims, or give an accurate dosage. If you decide to experiment with niacin supplements, it's important to start small and increase the dose over time. Talk with your doctor before you begin experimenting, as everyone reacts differently to niacin. There are side effects and dangers if you use too much of this vitamin. Always consult your doctor before experimenting with niacin or other supplements, especially with large doses. Niacin has the potential to [lower blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705821/) People who use niacin should also be aware that high doses of sustained release tablets can result in serious [liver damage](https://livertox.nlm.nih.gov/Niacin.htm). Signs of liver damage include: - jaundice, or [yellowing of the skin and eyes](/health/jaundice-yellow-skin) [itching](/health/itching) [nausea](/health/nausea) - vomiting - fatigue Niacin flush One common reaction to too much vitamin B-3 is called the [niacin flush](/nutrition/niacin-flush). This reaction causes the skin to turn red and feel hot, or as if it's burning. Niacin flush isn't dangerous. This reaction typically happens at [doses higher than 1,000 mg](http://www.dpic.org/article/professional/niacin-facts-flushing), but can also occur after taking only 50 mg. There still isn't enough research to determine if vitamin B-3 is a good treatment for depression. Some personal stories, however, do support the idea that the vitamin can eliminate symptoms of depression. If you and your doctors choose to experiment with niacin, be careful and watch for signs of liver damage or low blood pressure. "}
