In many cases, the nootropics enhance erythrocyte plasticity and inhibit aggregation, which improves the blood's rheological properties and increases its flow to the brain. Many of these formulations possess antioxidant activity that protects brain tissue from neurotoxicity and improves the brain's oxygen supply. They can induce the synthesis of neuronal proteins, nucleic acids, and phospholipids for constructing and repairing neurohormonal membranes. These natural compounds can potentially be present in a great variety of herbs, shrubs, and even some trees and vines. The plant species reviewed here were selected based on the availability of verifiable experimental data and clinical trials investigating potential nootropic effects. Original research articles, relevant animal studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical trials were included in this review. Selected representatives of this heterogeneous group included Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst., Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim., Ginkgo biloba L., Lepidium meyenii Walp., Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, Paullinia cupana Kunth, Rhodiola rosea L., Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal. The species are depicted and described, together with their active components and nootropic effects, and evidence of their efficacy is presented. The study provides brief descriptions of the representative species, their occurrence, history, and the chemical composition of the principle medicinal compounds, with uses, indications, experimental treatments, dosages, possible side effects, and contraindications. Most plant nootropics must be taken at optimal doses for extended periods before measurable improvement occurs, but they are generally very well tolerated. Their psychoactive properties are not produced by a single molecule but by a synergistic combination of several compounds. The available data suggest that including extracts from these plants in medicinal products to treat cognitive disorders can have substantial potential therapeutic benefits.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-18", "cleaned_text": "Cognitive Enhancers [https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12061364](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12061364) [Valuable Sources of Bioactive Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-plants-12-01364), [2](#B2-plants-12-01364)]. Those plants thought to strengthen and improve cognition belong to natural nootropics, and they formed a substantial part of the pharmacopeia available to ancient cultures and civilizations [ [3](#B3-plants-12-01364), [4](#B4-plants-12-01364)]. The term 'nootropic' was first used by Prof. Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea in 1972/1973 to describe substances that primarily activate cognitive functions such as memory and learning, especially in situations where these functions are impaired [ [5](#B5-plants-12-01364), [6](#B6-plants-12-01364)]. The name comprises two Greek words, n\u00f6os, meaning affect cognitive function through various physiological pathways, but effects usually occur only after an extended time [ [8](#B8-plants-12-01364)]. Pharmaceutical companies have invested large sums of money in synthesizing new compounds to alleviate or treat mental disorders. Still, formulas based on one single drug sometimes meet with limited success because of the multifactorial nature of such conditions. [9](#B9-plants-12-01364)]. In this regard, using plant products based on traditional knowledge is currently on the rise in both developed and developing countries. Although there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of these plant formulations based on sometimes questionable and unconvincing results, several controlled studies have demonstrated the positive effects of these natural substances on improving brain function [ [4](#B4-plants-12-01364), [10](#B10-plants-12-01364), [11](#B11-plants-12-01364)]. 2. Cognitive Impairment and Dementia [12](#B12-plants-12-01364), [13](#B13-plants-12-01364)]. [14](#B14-plants-12-01364)]. Other common types of dementia include vascular dementia, which is caused by problems with the blood supply to the brain that typically manifests as a series of minor strokes, and Parkinson's disease, which is related to the loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra, that normally produce dopamine. The lack of dopamine causes the patient to gradually lose control of movement [ [15](#B15-plants-12-01364)]. About half of the dementia cases are of a mixed type with multiple causes. Some dementia syndromes, such as vitamin deficiency or thyroid problems are reversible, but none of the common neurodegenerative dementias can be cured. Dementia is frequently preceded by a period of milder cognitive dysfunction [ [16](#B16-plants-12-01364)]. 3. Specific Nootropic Herb, Shrub, and Tree Species [17](#B17-plants-12-01364)]. In temperate zones, tree bark is harvested at the beginning of vegetative growth in early spring, while in the tropics, it can be harvested throughout the year. For collecting rhizomes and roots, the appropriate period for harvesting is during developmental dormancy, usually in spring or sometimes autumn. The stems and leaves are generally harvested just before or during blooming, whereas flowers are collected before they are fully developed, some even in the bud stage. Seeds and fruits are always harvested fully ripe [ [18](#B18-plants-12-01364), [19](#B19-plants-12-01364)]. The plant parts harvested at the most suitable time are air-dried and then subjected to further processing by various methods [ [20](#B20-plants-12-01364)]. [21](#B21-plants-12-01364)], and potentially beneficial compounds from plants, known as phytochemicals, continue to be an active area of research worldwide. Several species of herbs, shrubs, and trees have been selected for testing as nootropic agents because of their long history of use in traditional medicine. Research has already identified several promising natural substances that could act as cognitive enhancers, sometimes called roots are smooth, 1-2 cm in diameter, and 30-40 cm withanolide isolated was withaferin A, and the primary source of withanolides is the root. Because ashwagandha grows widely in diverse geographical areas, there are several different morphological forms differing in the content of pharmacological compounds [ [32](#B32-plants-12-01364), [33](#B33-plants-12-01364)]. 3.1.5. Uses and Specific Nootropic and Cognitive Effects of Ashwagandha [34](#B34-plants-12-01364)]. Traditionally, ashwagandha is widely used as an adaptogen and recommended as a natural remedy for insomnia and neurological disorders [ [33](#B33-plants-12-01364), [35](#B35-plants-12-01364)]. [36](#B36-plants-12-01364)]. Based on mouse experiments, it was hypothesized that the neuroprotection of W. somnifera was mediated by a specific interaction with the GABA-gated chloride ionophore [ [37](#B37-plants-12-01364)]. Another study on rats also provided direct evidence of the GABAergic activity of this herb on mammalian ionotropic GABA receptors [ [38](#B38-plants-12-01364)]. [39](#B39-plants-12-01364)]. Chronic administration of W. somnifera root extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) to mice, on the contrary, restored levels of acetylcholinesterase activity in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Experiments showed that ashwagandha increased the numbers of platelets, red and white blood cells, as well as the hemoglobin content. The increase in the number of red blood cells resulted in an increase in the blood's ability to transport oxygen to the peripheral system, which ensured a greater maximal aerobic capacity. This combination of effects makes them promising candidates for further studies to treat Alzheimer's disease and related problems [ [40](#B40-plants-12-01364)]. [41](#B41-plants-12-01364)]. In another study, a rat model of tardive dyskinesia was developed by injections of reserpine. Lipid peroxidation products and oxidative stress are involved in the pathophysiology of this disease, and long-term administration of ashwagandha root extract reduced glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation and reversed the decline in brain superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase levels. These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effects are partially mediated by antioxidant activity [ [42](#B42-plants-12-01364)]. In addition, it also alleviated memory impairment by prolonging acquisition latency as well as retention of transfer in propoxur-treated rats [ [43](#B43-plants-12-01364)]. Thus, studies in rats showed ashwagandha's potential in treating Huntington's disease. [44](#B44-plants-12-01364)]. In another clinical trial, ashwagandha extract administered daily for 30 days at doses of 225 or 400 mg improved cognitive flexibility, visual memory, psychomotor speed, reaction time, executive function, and stress response [ [45](#B45-plants-12-01364)]. Acute supplementation of 400 mg of a proprietary W. somnifera root and leaf extract also helped maintain attention and increased short-term or working memory in healthy young adults [ [46](#B46-plants-12-01364)]. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with anxiety disorders were given an ethanol extract of ashwagandha daily for 2-6 weeks. The extract was well tolerated, did not cause any side effects, and showed a significant anxiolytic effect [ [47](#B47-plants-12-01364)]. The daily dose should be 6 to 10 g of ground root or the equivalent of 750 mg to 1250 mg of W. somnifera extract [ [48](#B48-plants-12-01364)]. 3.1.6. Side Effects and Contraindications [49](#B49-plants-12-01364)]. A subacute study of ashwagandha extract on rats showed no significant disturbances of biochemical, hematological, or histopathological parameters in vital organs [ [50](#B50-plants-12-01364)]. W. somnifera is best taken in the evening because, as already mentioned above, it is traditionally used for sleep disorders and can therefore act as a sedative in large doses. Possible overdose can also cause gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, so treatment should be started with small doses and gradually increased. Ashwagandha is not recommended during pregnancy or in cases of hyperthyroidism [ [51](#B51-plants-12-01364)]. Chronic stress increases cortisol levels leading to lower levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine. W. somnifera is believed to stimulate the endocrine system and increase thyroid hormone levels by reducing cortisol. However, this also means that ashwagandha can worsen the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, potentially leading to a serious form of hyperthyroidism called thyrotoxicosis [ [52](#B52-plants-12-01364), [53](#B53-plants-12-01364)]. [Figure 2](#plants-12-01364-f002)). Its roots are covered with nodules. It has kidney-shaped, shallowly serrated leaves up to 30 cm long. Tiny, white or red flowers appear in the axils of the leaves, arranged in groups of two to five into an umbel. The fruit is spherical and has raised plant, are triterpene acids (asiatic, madecassic, and isothankuniside). The quantitative and qualitative levels of individual compounds depend on the plant's location and time of collection. Other constituents present in the plant are heterocyclic compounds, tannins, and resins. C. asiatica is also rich in vitamin C, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, niacin, and -carotene. The ash contains chloride, sulfate, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and iron [ [63](#B63-plants-12-01364), [64](#B64-plants-12-01364), [65](#B65-plants-12-01364)]. 3.2.5. and Nootropic or Cognitive effects of Gotu Kola [66](#B66-plants-12-01364)]. The herb is also commonly used in Sri Lanka as part of a nutritional porridge for feeding pre-school children known as kola kenda, which is a mixture of gotu kola, rice, and vegetables [ [67](#B67-plants-12-01364)]. [68](#B68-plants-12-01364)]. To verify the stimulating effects of gotu kola on the central nervous system (CNS), treatment with an aqueous extract was compared to the effects of chloroform and methanol extracts on the behavior of mice. Only the aqueous extract of the whole plant at a dose of 200 mg/kg for 14 days showed improvement in learning and memory. At doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg of an aqueous extract of C. asiatica, a significant increase in glutathione levels and a decrease in malondialdehyde concentration in the brain were found. Furthermore, at 300 mg/kg, an increase in catalase activity was observed, but the SOD level was not significantly changed [ [69](#B69-plants-12-01364)]. However, daily oral administration of C. asiatica extract (50 mg/kg) to mice for 14 days increased the concentration of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and SOD), glutathione, and ascorbic acid [ [70](#B70-plants-12-01364)]. Evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the extracts of this herb and their comparison with natural (-tocopherol) and synthetic (BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene) antioxidants showed that phenolic substances are the main contributors to the antioxidant activity. From 3.23 to 11.7 g of phenolic substances per 100 g of dry sample were found in the extract [ [71](#B71-plants-12-01364)]. [72](#B72-plants-12-01364)]. An in vivo study in mice revealed that increased nitric oxide (NO) production might be involved in the mechanism of the protective effect of gotu kola against anxiety caused by sleep deprivation, neuroinflammation, or oxidative damage [ [73](#B73-plants-12-01364)]. The gotu kola plant contains multiple active fractions that increase neurite extension in vitro and accelerate axonal regeneration in male rats after oral administration. This suggests that components in C. asiatica may help accelerate the repair of damaged neurons [ [74](#B74-plants-12-01364)]. [75](#B75-plants-12-01364)]. In vivo experiments on rats in maze and cage tests, monitoring their locomotor activity and social interactions, have also shown that gotu kola extracts and pure asiaticoside had anxiolytic activity. Asiaticoside did not significantly affect locomotor activity, suggesting that this compound does not have sedative effects [ [76](#B76-plants-12-01364)]. [77](#B77-plants-12-01364)]. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial examined the effect of this herb on cognitive function in healthy elderly volunteers. A high dose of C. asiatica extract was shown to improve working memory, suggesting its potential for mitigating age-related cognitive decline [ [78](#B78-plants-12-01364)]. The daily dose of gotu kola should be approximately 600 mg of dried leaves or 60-120 mg of a standardized extract containing at least 85% triterpenoid glycosides [Figure 3](#plants-12-01364-f003)). Eleuthero has a highly developed root system that is usually horizontally distributed in the upper layer of the soil. A relatively low reproductive capacity also characterizes it. Both generative and simple vegetative reproduction are ineffective. The most efficient method to increase its reproductive potential for cultivation is in vitro techniques [ [84](#B84-plants-12-01364), [86](#B86-plants-12-01364), 3](#plants-12-01364-f003)), which in most cases, belong to the group of heteroglycosides. Other important components are polysaccharide glycans (eleutherans A, B, C, D, lignans -pinene, and (+)-aromadendrene). Dried fruits, consumed as food, are rich in calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and copper [ [86](#B86-plants-12-01364), [89](#B89-plants-12-01364), [90](#B90-plants-12-01364)]. Nootropic or (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. [84](#B84-plants-12-01364), [91](#B91-plants-12-01364)]. [92](#B92-plants-12-01364)]. According to the results of another in vitro study, E. senticosus could be used in antioxidant therapy as an agent capable of reducing the toxic effects of free radical products of oxygen reduction in the body [ [93](#B93-plants-12-01364)]. [94](#B94-plants-12-01364)]. A similar in vitro study was performed with an aqueous extract of E. senticosus leaves. Using an axonal density assay, this extract successfully restored neurite growth after amyloid-25-35-induced degeneration [ [95](#B95-plants-12-01364)]. Thus, eleuthero extracts have been confirmed to protect against neuritic atrophy and cell death from amyloid-25-35 treatment. One of the essential active compounds may be eleutheroside B [ [94](#B94-plants-12-01364), [95](#B95-plants-12-01364)]. [96](#B96-plants-12-01364)]. Based on memory and learning tests in rats, an aqueous extract of the saponin fraction of dried eleuthero leaves had a significant reinforcing effect. In addition, molecular docking experiments demonstrated that key BBB-penetrating saponins primarily interacted with targets of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) and MAPK8 to [91](#B91-plants-12-01364)]. [97](#B97-plants-12-01364)]. Another randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial on healthy volunteers evaluated the cognitive enhancement and anti-stress effects of the combined extracts of E. senticosus leaf and Drynaria fortunei rhizome. The intake period was 12 weeks, and the Japanese version of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status was used for neurocognitive assessment. The results revealed that the combined treatment with these two herbal extracts reduced anxiety and improved language and cognitive function in healthy adults with no side effects [ [98](#B98-plants-12-01364)]. The recommended dose of eleuthero is 2-3 g of dried root or an equivalent amount of extract daily [ [99](#B99-plants-12-01364)]. A standardized extract from the roots and rhizomes is prepared at a ratio of 1:12, so 10 mg of the extract is approximately equivalent to 120 mg of crude herb [ [100](#B100-plants-12-01364), [101](#B101-plants-12-01364)]. 3.3.6. Side Effects are dioecious and are relatively inconspicuous. In male plants, an inflorescence is formed by coniferous formations that look like catkins. In female plants, the inflorescence consists of small green panicles on stalks. The fruit is a stone fruit (drupe) with a diameter of 18-25 mm, initially green but turning yellow on the surface when ripe. The seed's outer shell contains butyric acid that gives it a characteristic strong, disagreeable odor [ [106](#B106-plants-12-01364), [107](#B107-plants-12-01364)]. Cognitive Effects of Ginkgo biloba L. [110](#B110-plants-12-01364)]. The ripe fruits should only be consumed roasted or boiled because their harmful cyanide and amygdalin content is destroyed by heating [ [111](#B111-plants-12-01364)]. Hulled and roasted seeds can be safely eaten [ [109](#B109-plants-12-01364)]. [112](#B112-plants-12-01364)]. Middle-aged (12-month-old) female rats were given an intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg body weight) of aluminum and an oral dose (100 mg/kg body weight) of ginkgo extract daily for six weeks. Administration of the extract also significantly reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, NO, and citrulline levels and increased reduced glutathione and antioxidant enzyme activity compared to non-treated control rats [ [113](#B113-plants-12-01364)]. [114](#B114-plants-12-01364)]. In mice, the effect of EGb 761 on synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus, which is a crucial area for memory development, was evaluated. A 30-day administration of the extract to mice improved neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, probably by a direct effect on glutamate metabolism [ [115](#B115-plants-12-01364)]. Incubating a line of mutated neuroblastoma cells with EGb 761 inhibited the formation of amyloid- fibrils involved in AD development. The extract also attenuated mitochondrial-initiated apoptosis and reduced the activity of caspase-3, an enzyme involved in the apoptotic cascade [ [116](#B116-plants-12-01364)]. [117](#B117-plants-12-01364)]. In another double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, volunteers were given neuropsychological tests before and after treatment with G. biloba extract. They showed significant improvements in information processing speed and working memory [ [118](#B118-plants-12-01364)]. Another study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a six-month administration of ginkgo to patients with vascular dementia, early AD, or mixed dementia, which included both dementia types. The results confirmed the benefits of G. biloba extract treatment, which was very well tolerated [ [119](#B119-plants-12-01364)]. On the opposite side, however, a review critical of the data from several randomized clinical trials which did not provide convincing evidence that ginkgo preparations or extracts used for short or long periods positively affected cognitive performance in healthy people under the age of sixty [ [120](#B120-plants-12-01364)]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients aged 70 years or older who spontaneously reported memory problems showed that long-term use of EGb 761 did not reduce the risk of progression to AD compared with placebo [ [121](#B121-plants-12-01364)]. The recommended daily dose of EGb 761 is from 120 to 300 mg, standardized to a content of 24% standardized extract of G. biloba is already widely used as a dietary supplement or as a support agent in treating several adverse conditions, memory and concentration problems, depression, anxiety, confusion, and headaches. The supposed mechanisms of action reflect the properties of several compounds in the extract and primarily include antioxidant activity by reducing free oxygen radicals, increasing blood flow by dilating blood vessels, reducing blood viscosity, and modifying neurotransmitter systems. G. biloba also appears relatively safe with no serious adverse side effects. Despite all this, the evidence regarding predictable clinical benefits for patients with dementia or cognitive impairment is still inconsistent and unreliable. 3.4.6. Side Effects and Description [Figure 5](#plants-12-01364-f005)). Depending on the natural conditions and the cultivation method, this species is usually divided into three forms: cultivated ginseng, ginseng grown in mountain conditions, and wild mountain ginseng. Cultivated ginseng makes up the majority of the product available on the market. Ginseng grown in forests and mountains tends to achieve the qualitative characteristics of wild mountain ginseng. Wild ginseng is rare and is always one of the most expensive commodities on the medicinal plant market [ [134](#B134-plants-12-01364), [135](#B135-plants-12-01364)]. 3.5.3. Occurrence [134](#B134-plants-12-01364), are the major pharmacologically active compounds and account for a significant proportion of the weight of dried ginseng, typically more than 5%. According to the aglycone, it is divided into three groups: protopanaxadiol-, protopanaxatriol-, and oleanane-type saponins [ [137](#B137-plants-12-01364), [138](#B138-plants-12-01364)]. A high content of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, iron, sulfur, and some microelements characterize the mineral composition of ginseng roots. The plant contains a significant amount of aluminum, silicon, manganese, magnesium, barium, titanium, and strontium. Ginseng root also contains fats and various unidentified substances [ [139](#B139-plants-12-01364), [140](#B140-plants-12-01364)]. 3.5.5. Uses and Nootropic or Cognitive Effects of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer [141](#B141-plants-12-01364)]. To extend the shelf life, the steaming process is followed by drying. However, dried ginseng has disadvantages when used in traditional cuisines because of its tough fibrous texture after rehydration. Grinding to a powder or preparing an extract are alternatives to overcome this problem [ [142](#B142-plants-12-01364)]. [143](#B143-plants-12-01364)]. Experiments on five-day-old male chickens suggested that ginsenoside Rb1 improved memory in a visual discrimination task and that the nootropic effect was also associated with changes in anxiety [ [144](#B144-plants-12-01364)]. Another work examined the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of ginsenoside Rb1 in a rat model of AD. Ginsenoside Rb1 reversed the changes in several markers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. In the future, this compound could be used as a therapeutic agent for patients with memory impairment [ [145](#B145-plants-12-01364)]. Another study determined the neuroprotective effects of six different ginsenosides. Ginsenoside Rb2 was found to improve the viability of HT-22 hippocampal mouse neurons against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. reduced glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx and intracellular ROS accumulation, subsequently suppressing MAPK caused by glutamate-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis-inducing factor-mediated apoptotic cell death. The study demonstrated that ginsenoside Rb2 rescued cells damaged by ischemic brain injury and showed neuroprotective efficacy in an animal model [ [146](#B146-plants-12-01364)]. Supplementation with ginsenoside Rg1 improved the performance of aged mice in a behavioral test by significantly increasing the expression of proteins associated with synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, including synaptophysin, -isoform of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and postsynaptic density protein 95, by promoting activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [ [147](#B147-plants-12-01364)]. The impact of Korean red ginseng extract on the dissociation and aggregation of tau protein in vitro was also evaluated. Analysis revealed that the extract inhibited aggregation and promoted the dissociation of tau aggregates [ [148](#B148-plants-12-01364)]. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein normally expressed in mature neurons. However, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau dissociates from microtubules and self-aggregates. These tau aggregates promote neuronal dysfunction and can ultimately lead to the death of neurons. Therefore, suppressing the aggregation or stimulating the dissociation of tau aggregates has been proposed as an effective strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia or AD [ [149](#B149-plants-12-01364)]. [150](#B150-plants-12-01364)]. [151](#B151-plants-12-01364)]. According to the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 90 volunteers, it was found that daily oral administration of 3 g of ginseng powder for six months positively improved cognitive functions, especially visual memory, in subjects with mild cognitive impairment [ [152](#B152-plants-12-01364)]. The recommended daily dose of dry ginseng root is from 0.5 to 2 g for an extended time. Alternatively, a standardized ginseng extract (1.5-7% ginsenosides) can be taken at a dose of 200 mg per day [ [153](#B153-plants-12-01364)]. 3.5.6. cupana seeds contain the world's highest natural dose of caffeine (2 to 8%), which is 3 to 5 times higher than a coffee bean. They also contain high concentrations of tannins and other compounds such as saponins, polysaccharides (starch), proteins, fatty acids, trace elements (manganese, rubidium, nickel, and strontium), and essential oils. The plant's essential oil contains, among other compounds, carvacrol and estragole [ [159](#B159-plants-12-01364), [161](#B161-plants-12-01364), [163](#B163-plants-12-01364)]. Kunth [164](#B164-plants-12-01364), [165](#B165-plants-12-01364)]. [166](#B166-plants-12-01364)]. The results of another in vitro study showed that guarana could prevent amyloid- aggregation, protein glycation, and methylglyoxal-, glyoxal-, and acrolein-induced toxicity on neuron-like cells. Since these are considered pathological AD features, guarana deserves further research as a potential therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative diseases [ [167](#B167-plants-12-01364)]. [168](#B168-plants-12-01364)]. Crude lyophilized guarana seed extract had a significant nootropic effect when administered by gavage to rats over an extended time. The impact on cognitive behavior was studied using the Morris water maze test and scopolamine treatment compared to the control group. The extracts did not alter locomotor activity in the open-field test [ [169](#B169-plants-12-01364)]. According to an in vivo experiment, mice that ingested a guarana suspension showed a significant increase in physical capacity when exposed to a stressful situation such as forced swimming. After single or repeated administration, P. cupana partially reversed the amnesic effect of scopolamine treatment in mice and rats as measured by the passive avoidance test, which indicated a positive impact on memory acquisition. However, in the active avoidance test, no effect was observed in rats even after 20 days of guarana administration. The treated animals had the same average lifespan as controls, indicating low toxicity of guarana after 23 months of treatment [ [170](#B170-plants-12-01364)]. [171](#B171-plants-12-01364)]. The effects of P. cupana consumption on enzyme activity, plasma catechins, and oxidative stress biomarkers in healthy, overweight subjects were evaluated. The twelve participants received 3 g of ground guarana seeds daily for 15 days. Administration of guarana increased oxygen radical absorbance capacity in plasma, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity while reducing ex vivo oxidation of low-density lipoprotein and deoxyribonucleic acid damage in lymphocytes induced by hydrogen peroxide. P. cupana catechins were biologically available and contributed to the reduction of oxidative stress in clinically healthy individuals by direct antioxidant action and upregulation of antioxidant or detoxification enzymes [ [172](#B172-plants-12-01364)]. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 28 healthy young volunteers, the cognitive and mood effects of individual doses of 75 mg of dry ethanol extract of guarana or 200 mg of ginseng, or a combination of both, were investigated. All three treatments improved daily task performance compared to the placebo. With guarana supplementation, sentence verification and attention improvements were observed, but with reduced accuracy. The speed of performance of attention and memory tasks was increased with ginseng and the combination treatment, while all three treatments improved performance on the serial subtraction task. Due to the relatively low caffeine content (9 mg) in this dose of guarana extract, it is unlikely that these effects could be attributed to its content [ [173](#B173-plants-12-01364)]. The guarana dosage should be 450 mg, up to five times daily for adults. Alternatively, a dose of 75 mg of guarana extract containing approximately 12% caffeine can be administered as a tablet [ [173](#B173-plants-12-01364), phenotypes characterized by different colors of their hypocotyls, from white to black, have been described. The rosette of leaves is usually sessile to the ground with a wavy edge, and the flower stalk bearing whitish flowers grows out of the center [ [182](#B182-plants-12-01364), [183](#B183-plants-12-01364), [184](#B184-plants-12-01364), [185](#B185-plants-12-01364)]. 3.7.3. vitamins B, C, and E. Maca is very nutritious, containing an average of 60-75% carbohydrates, 10-14% protein, 8.5% fiber, and 2.2% lipids. The dried root is rich in essential amino acids, while fresh root has unusually high iodine and iron contents. Yellow maca has a higher lipid and carbohydrate content than the red and black varieties [ [182](#B182-plants-12-01364), [187](#B187-plants-12-01364), [188](#B188-plants-12-01364), [189](#B189-plants-12-01364)]. 3.7.5. [190](#B190-plants-12-01364), a new polysaccharide from maca leaves was investigated, and the results showed that the polysaccharide had a reducing ability and could scavenge DPPH radicals. In addition, it stimulated the immune response of a monocyte/macrophage-like murine cell line (RAW264.7). The polysaccharide also promoted proliferation, enhanced phagocytosis, and increased NO production in a dose-dependent manner [ [194](#B194-plants-12-01364)]. [195](#B195-plants-12-01364)]. L. meyenii compounds showed potent activity in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced zebrafish model of Parkinson's disease. The significant neuroprotective action of the methanol fraction was probably mediated by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase [ [196](#B196-plants-12-01364)]. These results suggest a potential application of L. meyenii Walp. as a neuroprotectant. [197](#B197-plants-12-01364)]. L. meyenii further improved motor coordination, endurance, and cognitive function in 14-month-old male mice that received maca powder by gavage for five weeks. This effect may be associated with the upregulation of autophagy-related proteins in the cortex and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function [ [198](#B198-plants-12-01364)]. In another in vivo study, a neurotoxic model was established by subcutaneous corticosterone injection for 21 days, and the effects of macamide against corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity were tested. Experiments showed that and synapse-protective properties, neurogenesis and [ [199](#B199-plants-12-01364)]. [200](#B200-plants-12-01364)]. These findings suggest that L. meyenii could provide a beneficial functional food in the future to slow age-related cognitive decline. The optimal dose has not been determined, but 1.5 to 3 g of dried maca root per day for an adult was effective in these studies with no observed side effects [ [201](#B201-plants-12-01364), [202](#B202-plants-12-01364)]. 3.7.6. [Figure 8](#plants-12-01364-f008)). The fruits are reddish or greenish with many seeds, which are tiny, brown, egg-shaped, and -sitosterol) particularly citric, tartaric, malic, succinic, fumaric, chlorogenic, and gallic acids. These substances all contribute to the specific activity of the extracts. The increased content of manganese (up to 0.8%) and tannins (up to 20%) is unusual [ [207](#B207-plants-12-01364), [209](#B209-plants-12-01364), [212](#B212-plants-12-01364)]. 3.8.5. Uses rosea L. [213](#B213-plants-12-01364), [214](#B214-plants-12-01364)]. [215](#B215-plants-12-01364)]. Similar conclusions were reached in another in vitro study in which salidroside demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties in a cultured rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12). Experimental results indicated that it protected cells against hypoglycemia and cytotoxicity induced by serum restriction by modulating apoptosis-related gene expression, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibiting intracellular ROS production [ [216](#B216-plants-12-01364)]. [217](#B217-plants-12-01364)]. A similar experiment was performed on long-term cultured rat hippocampal neurons and aged mice treated with salidroside. The results showed that salidroside increased the viability and expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 and decreased -galactosidase levels in rat neurons. Salidroside reduced cognitive dysfunction, attenuated neuronal degeneration in the CA1 region, and lowered oxidative stress levels in aging mice. Salidroside also promoted the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase protein via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway. Salidroside treatment could be an effective strategy to increase cell survival and prevent cerebral ischemic injury and aging-related diseases [ [218](#B218-plants-12-01364)]. [219](#B219-plants-12-01364)]. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a repeated low-dose regimen investigated the normalizing and stimulating effect of R. rosea extract in international students during an examination period. The students used the extract or placebo for 20 days. Improvements in the R. rosea extract group were observed in physical fitness, neuromotor tests, mental fatigue, and overall well being; however, no significant improvement was observed in the neuromuscular tapping test and the correction of text test [ [220](#B220-plants-12-01364)]. A randomized trial evaluated the effect of R. rosea extract on stress, anxiety, cognition, and other symptoms. Eighty mildly anxious human participants were randomized into two groups receiving either a dose of the extract or no treatment. Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed significant reductions in stress, anger, anxiety, confusion, depression, and overall mood improvement after two weeks. However, no relevant differences in cognitive performance were observed between the groups. Although this was a non-placebo-controlled study, it is unlikely that the findings resulted from placebo effects because the changes occurred gradually and were specific to certain psychological measures [ [221](#B221-plants-12-01364)]. The daily dose for an adult of R. rosea extract for long-term use should be from 360 to 600 mg, standardized to a content of 1% rosavin [ [222](#B222-plants-12-01364)]. mentioned in Shennong Ben Cao Jing, written over 4000 years ago. Around 1850, schisandra was brought to European botanical gardens in eastern Russia. Its original botanical name Kadsura chinensis, was later changed to Maximowiczia chinensis, and then established as Schisandra chinensis. The genus name, Schisandra, combines the Greek words schizein, which means 'to split', and andros, which means 'man', which refers to the fact that the plant has separate male and female flowers (monoecious) [ [85](#B85-plants-12-01364), [226](#B226-plants-12-01364)]. 3.9.2. Plant Description [Figure 9](#plants-12-01364-f009)). The berries are 5-7 mm in diameter, soft, and slightly elongated. Each berry has 1-2 kidney-shaped seeds up to 3 mm in diameter. Ripe fruit is usually very juicy and has a citrus taste, hence its Russian name limonnik. The skin is sweet, the flesh is sour, and the seed is bitter with an essential oil flavor. This is also reminiscent of the Chinese name wuweizi, or 'fruit of the five flavors'. According to various authors, the Schisandra genus includes 20 to 30 species 9](#plants-12-01364-f009)). The amount of these compounds in the fruit is affected by its degree of ripeness, the time of harvest, the habitat, and location. In addition, other types of lignans, dibenzylbutane lignans (schineolignans A-C) and tetrahydrofuran lignans (schinlignins A isolated from the fruits. Among the triterpenoids, pre-schisanartanins A-C and wuweizilactone acid are monoterpenes, borneol, eucalyptol, -pinene, and -pinene and E, and the phytosterols, stigmasterol, and -sitosterol. The seeds contain 33% oil, composed of linolenic acid and oleic acid glycerides. The whole plant is permeated with essential oil, about 3% in the bark and 2% in the seeds [ [228](#B228-plants-12-01364), [231](#B231-plants-12-01364), [232](#B232-plants-12-01364)]. 3.9.5. effects of S. chinensis compounds against D-galactose-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Rats were injected subcutaneously with D-galactose and orally administered an aqueous extract or a 95% ethanol extract of S. chinensis fruits for six weeks. Changes in cognitive function were assessed using the step-down passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze. The results showed that the extract improved the induced cognitive deficit and partially reversed the effects of reducing the activity of SOD, catalase, and total antioxidant effect induced by D-galactose and maintained normal levels of glutathione, malondialdehyde, and serum, prefrontal cortex, [237](#B237-plants-12-01364)]. The preventive effects of schisandrin B on scopolamine-induced dementia in mice were also studied. Scopolamine increased nitrite levels and oxidative stress in the brain and decreased antioxidant enzyme levels. Subsequently, the passive avoidance test and Morris water maze showed significant memory and learning impairment, with a simultaneous increase in acetylcholinesterase activity and a decrease in acetylcholine levels. Schisandrin B pretreatment prevented scopolamine-induced oxidative stress, improved behavioral tasks, suppressed the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity, and maintained acetylcholine levels [ [238](#B238-plants-12-01364)]. [239](#B239-plants-12-01364)]. A similar in vitro and in vivo study also demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of schisantherin A in multiple experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Schisantherin A pretreatment protected against selective nerve damage by reducing intracellular ROS accumulation and inhibited NO overproduction by reducing overexpression of inducible NO synthase in SH-SY5Y 6-hydroxydopamine. In vivo, schisantherin A restored locomotor behavioral deficits and prevented dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish. Thus, it is a promising agent for preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress [ [240](#B240-plants-12-01364)]. [233](#B233-plants-12-01364)]. The daily dose of dried S. chinensis fruits for adults is between 2 and 6 g, optimally up to 0.1 g of fruit per kg of body weight [ [233](#B233-plants-12-01364), [241](#B241-plants-12-01364)]. 3.9.6. Side ovate to ovate-wedge-shaped, fleshy, 0.5-2.5 cm long, and 3-8 mm wide. The flowers grow in the troughs of the leaves. They are five-petaled, purple-blue, or white with darker veins. It is often confused with Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, as both these plants are known by the same Hindi name, brahmi, in many places in nicotine, and herpestine are represented. Among the steroids, such as stigmasterol and -sitosterol, the plant also contains flavonoids such as apigenin and luteolin. Other substances [250](#B250-plants-12-01364), prevented glutamate toxicity in HT-22 cells by reducing ROS production and preventing mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction through oxidative stress [ [255](#B255-plants-12-01364)]. The nootropic effects of B. monnieri extract have also been demonstrated in vitro in mouse brain homogenates. The extract was found to reduce divalent metal ions, dose-dependently scavenge ROS, inhibit lipoxygenase activity, and reduce lipid peroxidation [ [256](#B256-plants-12-01364), [257](#B257-plants-12-01364)]. Thus, the results suggested that the extract possessed antioxidant activity. [258](#B258-plants-12-01364)]. The effect of an alcohol extract of brahmi on the expression of choline acetyltransferase in the hippocampus was studied in mice with olfactory bulbectomy, which reduces cholinergic activity. The results showed that extract administration gradually improved cognitive dysfunction [ [259](#B259-plants-12-01364)]. In a rat model of AD, brahmi alcohol extract also improved escape latency in the Morris water maze test and attenuated neuron loss [ [260](#B260-plants-12-01364)]. Treatment of rats with an alcohol extract of brahmi caused an increase in hippocampal protein and protein kinase activity that resulted in enhanced cognitive functions such as memory and learning. The chemical compounds identified as responsible for this positive effect were a mixture of two saponins, bacosides A and B [ [261](#B261-plants-12-01364)]. The reported pro-cognitive effect of B. monnieri on rats may be partially explained by an observed increase in cerebral blood flow independent of a change in blood pressure [ [262](#B262-plants-12-01364)]. [263](#B263-plants-12-01364)]. A group of researchers reported that doses of brahmi and Sideritis scardica (mountain tea) extracts given to ten elderly human subjects with mild cognitive impairment led to improvements in a d2-concentration test. Differences were also documented by quantitative electroencephalography mapping [ [264](#B264-plants-12-01364)]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 28 healthy adults over the age of 55 who were required to complete cognitive training for three hours per week for three months. Fifteen of the subjects consumed a standardized B. monnieri extract daily, and thirteen consumed a placebo. Neuroimaging results indicated an improvement in neural network complexity in those receiving the combination of Brahmi and cognitive training, but most results did not reach statistical significance [ [265](#B265-plants-12-01364)]. The daily recommended dosage of brahmi extract standardized to 20% bacosides A and B is 100-200 mg in divided doses for children and 200-400 mg in divided doses for adults [ [245](#B245-plants-12-01364), [266](#B266-plants-12-01364)]. 3.10.6.
