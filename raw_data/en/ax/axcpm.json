However, a two milligauss field strength is 18 orders of magnitude below the energy needed to affect any biochemistry. The postulate of a an unknown energy field which eludes all science-based investigation and measurement, but nevertheless causes a transmission of energies large enough to affect the chemistry of cell cultures flies in the face of all micro and cellular biology experimentation and well tested theories of physics. This postulate of a medically healing energy field, which can only be generated by certain individuals, fails all tests of medical science. The Center for Inquiry (CFI) strongly recommends against government funding for this and other unsubstantiated medical treatments. Part of our nation's debate on a universal health care plan focuses on reining in costs by covering only evidence-based medicine. There is pressure, however, from alternative medicine practitioners to release proposed health care reform bills from the constraint of delivering evidence-based medicine. The Boston Globe on July 24 quoted Senator Tom Harkin as saying at a congressional hearing, \"It's time to end the discrimination against alternative healthcare practices.\"1 Recently the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (Senate HELP Committee) adopted an amendment offered by Senator Harkin to the Health Care Reform Bill prohibiting \"discrimination\" against any state licensed or certified health care providers.2 State licensed or certified health care providers include providers of complementary and alternative medicine. Legislative provisions supporting complimentary and alternative medicine have appeared in other bills.3 Lack of press 1 http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/07/24/senators_seek_coverage_for_ alternative_therapies/; see also http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c 2 See section 2713 of proposed amendment to Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, contained in sec. 101 of the Health Care Reform Bill adopted by the Senate HELP Committee on July 15, 2009; available online at http://help.senate.gov/BAI09I50_xml.pdf. 3 See, e.g., H.R. 584, a House Resolution \"To provide for coverage of hormone replacement therapy for treatment of menopausal symptoms, and for coverage of an alternative therapy for hormone replacement therapy for such symptoms, under the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, group health plans and individual health insurance coverage, and other Federal health insurance programs,\" sponsored by Rep. Barbara Lee; see also, e.g., S. AMDT. 1702 to S. 1390, a Senate amendment \"To require the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a report on the use of alternative therapies in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, including the therapeutic use of animals,\" introduced by Sen. Mary Landrieu and agreed to in the Senate by unanimous consent. The author requests that this document not be reproduced without permission. 2 coverage on Senator Harkin's and other, similar amendments have left both the science community and the general public unaware that an important medical safeguard is under attack. The purpose of this report is to inform these constituencies and members of Congress of the inherent implausibility of the claims of 'non-evidence -based' medicine, using as an example the practice of distance healing, one of the non-evidence-based treatments which would be covered under Senator Harkin's amendment. Although this report focuses on the distance healing protocol, Therapeutic Touch (TT), similar analyses can be offered for other integrative medicine protocols. Alternative Medicine and Your Taxpayer Dollars The use of alternative medical therapies is widespread within the United States. The Washington Post reports that 38% of adults in the United States use alternative medicine.4 Yet evidence for the effectiveness of these therapies is slim. The Associated Press reported on June 10, 2009, that since its founding 10 years ago, the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has spent $2.5 billion on studies which \"show most [alternative cures] work no better than placebos.\"5 On the other side of the Atlantic, 'non-evidence' (non-science) based protocols are covered under the government's health services. Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst report in their book 'Trick or Treatment' that 500 million British pounds are spent annually by the British National Health Service on 'non-evidence based protocols.'6 Non-evidence based healing practices have become part of our national psyche. Not only are they are offered in health care facilities associated with hospitals and university medical centers, and wellness clinics;7,8,9 increasingly, physicians have added these protocols to their 4 Rob Stein, \"38% of Adults Use Alternative Medicine,\" The Washington Post, December 11, 2008 at A02. 5 \"$2.5 billion spent, no alternative cures found,\" Associated Press, June 10, 2009, available at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31190909/ 6 Trick or Treatment, Singh and Ernst, W.W.

Therapeutic Touch: The Claims vs. The Evidence Distance healing is an increasingly popular form of non-evidence-based medical therapy. Commonly known as Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, or QiGong, it is especially popular in the nursing community, where it often receives the \"imprimatur\" of the nursing practice.13 Therapeutic Touch involves neither touching nor removal of clothing. Instead, the TT therapist moves his or her hands over the patient's \"energy field,\" allegedly directing the flow of a purported biomagnetic energy that extends beyond the surface of the body in the form of an aura. Allegedly, this energy field can become unbalanced, obstructed, or out of tune. TT practitioners claim they can feel and manipulate this energy field by making massaging movements in the air just above the surface of the patient's body. These hand 8 \"Healing Touch is performed by registered nurses who recognize, manipulate and balance the electromagnetic fields surrounding the human body, thereby promoting healing and the well-being of body, mind and spirit.\" Scripps Institute website: http://www.scripps.org/services/integrative-medicine/services__treatments-and-therapies 9 Affiliated with Harvard Medical Center is Brigham Young Hospital's Osher Center.

This attunement enables you to become a channel for this universal healing energy which will be with you for your lifetime. From this point on you will be a reiki practitioner. With level one reiki you will be able to do healing on yourself, friends, family and pets.\") and foot reflexology (\"Reflexology is founded on the principle that there are points on the feet that affect every organ, gland and tissue of the body. By stimulating these points or reflexes properly one can help to relieve many health problems by releasing stress and muscle tension, balancing energy, and expelling toxins. This allows the body to rejuvenate in a safe and natural way.\").

This is thought to allow the body to heal itself. TT's alleged healing ability requires belief in an unknown, unsubstantiated biomagnetic field emanating from an unknown force generated from the hands of the practitioners. Supposedly it can be tuned by a certified practitioner to be positive for healing purposes. Negative healing is never defined. With specific rules for placement of hands, TT is a mix of some vague concept of wave motion cobbled with scientific jargon (\"field,\" \"energy\"), with little consideration of basic principles of physics and biochemistry. TT practitioners use no body of measured evidence, such as blood work or imaging, to justify the practice. TT certification is obtained by course work whose cost is tax deductible as an educational expense. The use of physics terms such as \"field,\" \"energy\" and \"magnetic,\" coupled with a protocol based in ancient folklore, adds to the practice a patina of both scientific respectability and mystical wisdom.14 A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)15 found that in only 123 (44%) of 280 trials were TT practitioners able to sense which of their hands was closest to the investigator's unseen hand; this statistic \"is close to what would be expected by random chance.\"16 The conclusion stated: \"Twenty-one experienced TT practitioners were unable to detect the investigators 'energy field'. Their failure to substantiate TT's most fundamental claim is unrefuted evidence that the claims of TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified.\"17 For the most part JAMA's publication of this study did not discourage the practice of TT and claims for its efficacy continued. Publications in support of TT's claims were mostly confined to nursing, alternative and complementary medicine journals and marketing literature. Recently, however, a peer-reviewed medical journal published a claim for TT's ability to diminish the growth of cancerous bone cells. An article recently published in the Journal of the Orthopaedic Research Society concluded: \"Therapeutic touch . . . increased the 14 Integrative medicine websites, alternative medicine publications and the NIH NCCAM BACKGROUNDER: Energy Medicine: an Overview, p. 6 (available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/energy/energymed.htm) usually carry a disclaimer to the effect that \"the exact nature of this energy is not clear.\" See also infra footnote 22. 15 JAMA vol. 279 no. 13, April 1, 1998, 1005-1010 16 Id. at 1005. 17 Id.

Curiously, the authors reported that cell cultures over which the practitioners' hands were placed were located in L-shaped rooms, implying that some undefined radiation pattern would not turn corners. However, the authors' need for varied statistical methods to support their conclusions, coupled with the lack of raw data, was unconvincing. Several figures carried disclaimers about significance. To support their understanding of a healing biomagnetic field the authors referred to a claim for a measurement of a 2 milligauss field emanating from hands of practitioners.19 Editors of the journal received a critique which they stated they would forward to the authors.20 To date, however, no reply has been received. Sadly, this claim for distance healing of cancerous bone cell cultures gives questionable hope to many patients who suffer from abnormal cell growth - in particular cancer patients. Two other parts of the $1.8 million NCCAM grant required clinical trials on the use of TT in advanced cervical cancer and wrist fractures in post-menopausal women. Clinicaltrials.gov reported these trials as completed in 2006 and 2007. A request to NIH for the outcomes of the clinical trials received the answer on June 22, 2009: \"although the clinical trials have been completed, the results are not yet available.\"21 Therapeutic Touch: The Idea vs. Basic Science Aside from the lack of empirical support for TT, our knowledge of basic physics and biology casts serious doubt on TT practitioners' claims. Transmission of a force when objects are not in contact is represented by a set of vectors which enumerate the direction and magnitude of the force. This set of vectors constitutes the field. There are four fundamental forces: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear and strong nuclear. Other fundamental forces have been looked for and not found. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that science may one day find a new force field, but should such a discovery occur it will be through using the tools and methodology of science. Theorists understand that the strength of such a force must be much less than our weakest known force.

When energy fields are used as a medium for conveying information, scientists ask and answer the following key questions: How large is the signal? what is the transmitter located in the source, and what and where is the receiver? How can the device be tuned and detuned? Lastly, how can one replicate this by a device to be used for medical intervention? This methodology has led to the invention of many important medical devices\u2014such as ultrasonic and MRI imaging. The alleged source of TT's purported biomagnetic field is the practitioner, and the alleged receiver is the patient. Beyond this, TT practitioners fail to give detailed and plausible answers to the key questions above. TT practitioners' adoption of the scientific term \"biomagnetic\" field, without an equation to describe the field and without any grounding in known physics and biochemistry, conveys the impression of scientific respectability to claims that have no scientific basis. In an attempt to give the concept and claims of TT legitimacy, TT publications and the NCAAM website rely on an unsubstantiated measurement which claims the field is \"biomagnetic\" with a strength of about 2 milligauss.22, 23, 24 Yet our knowledge of physics and biology demonstrates that such a field can have no effect on the human body's biochemistry. 22 Zimmerman, J. \"Laying-on-of-hands and in J Orthop Res 26:1541-1546, 2008. 23 See also on the NIH NCCAM web site the link to BACKGROUNDER Energy Medicine: An Overview. Reference 25 in this NIH overview also cites Zimmerman, J., \"Laying-on-of-hands and therapeutic touch: A testable theory,\" BEMI Currents J Bio-Electro-Magnetics Instit., but with a publication date of 1990. 24 As another example of problems with references in both the J Orthop Res 26:1541-1546, 2008 paper and on the NIH website that purport to demonstrate TT's effectiveness, librarians at neither George Mason University nor NIH were able to locate the journal BEMI Currents cited in reference 32 'J Orthop Res 26:1541-1546, 2008' and on the NIH informational web site 'BACKGROUNDER: Energy Medicine: an Overview'. However, a separate web search for its author, J. Zimmerman, led to a reference titled \"Earthing and Earth Fx Products: A Summary of Research and Development 2/10/06\" and a citation to an article published in the Brain/Mind Bulletin on September 30, 1985 (issue 10:2). The librarians' fruitless quest to find the BEMI journal did turn up a footnote in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies, January 1997, which directed readers to contact Zimmerman directly for the article on TT. It appears it was privately published but somehow found its way into citations from Alternative and Complementary Medicine journals. We were unable to locate the author.

To initiate healing chemistry in the body, information sent to the cell must be above the cell's noise level. Static heard when there is no incoming signal from a radio station is an example of such noise. The noise level of a cell is 0.025 eV.26 The authors of the aforementioned article published in Journal of Orthopedic research (see footnote 17) admitted that although the force creating TT's alleged effects is unknown, they believe it to be biomagnetic and about 2-3 milligauss, a value less than one percent of the strength of the earth's magnetic field. The energy content of a two milligauss field27 taken over the volume of atomic dimensions is 10-18 eV (i.e., 0.000000000000000001 eV): a staggering 15 orders of magnitude below the noise level of a cell (0.025 eV), and billions of times less than the miniscule energy your eye receives when you view Sirius, our brightest star. Initiation of biochemistry requires a far greater energy, of about 100kT (2.5 eV).28 Thus to affect any healing chemistry, the purported TT field needs to be many billion times greater than its alleged value of 2-3 milligauss, and larger even than the several thousand gauss magnetic fields applied to patients in an MRI Machine. There is no mechanism in the human body which can be tuned to emit a 2 milligauss magnetic field, let alone a field 15 orders of magnitude larger. To present this purported biomagnetic field as the basis for a medical protocol is incomprehensible. 25 Russell K. Hobbie, Springer-Verlag ,Intermediate Physics for Medicine and Biology, third edition, at 222. 26 The noise level of 0.025 eV is calculated from the product of Boltzman's constant, k (8.617 x 10-5 eV / K), and the temperature of the body, T, in degrees Kelvin (300\u00b0 K). 27 Maxwells' equations for the energy density of a magnetic field of 2 milligauss, when applied over a volume of atomic dimensions, yield 10-18 eV. 28 See Appendix B, Biological Physics Energy, Information and Life, Philip Nelson, W.H.

The United States faces an urgent challenge in attempting to make quality health care available to those who need it, while simultaneously reining in the ballooning cost of medical care. Every dollar of health care funding is needed to provide tested, proven medical treatment to those who require it. It is inexcusable to squander scarce resources by funding unsubstantiated, non-evidence-based medical techniques that have no basis in theory or experiment. CFI recommends that any health care reform bill Congress passes should prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to cover non-evidence-based medicine. CFI further recommends that Congress greatly reduce or eliminate funding for the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), as a decade of study has shown that most alternative cures work no better than placebos. The United States can ill afford to continue wasting precious resources on unproven - and often disproven - medical techniques. About the Author EUGENIE V.
