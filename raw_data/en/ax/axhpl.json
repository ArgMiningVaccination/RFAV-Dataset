This study wasconducted from 1985 to 1990 by the Early Intervention Research Institute at UtahState University as a part of a contract (Contract #300-85-0173) with the UnitedStates Department of Education. Funding fo- the project was provided by the U. S.Department of Education as well as the National Institute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment and the Office of Maternal and Child Health of the Public Health Service.The study was initiated in the Fall of 1985. As specified by the federal government,the first subjects were enrolled in the longitudinal phase of the study in Octoberof 1986.The study was designed to be continued through the Fall of 1990, with theexpectation that another contract would be competitively awarded at that time tocontinue data collection efforts for a subset of the studies for an additional fiveyears.Because a follow-up phase to the original study has been funded by the U. S.Department of Education (Contract #HS90010001) the data, results,and tentativeconclusions contained in this report should be viewed as preliminary. Additionaldata are being collected, and analyses continue. Furthermore, even though care hasbeen taken to discover key punching, transcription, and computational errors, it iscertain that not all such errors have been identified and corrected at this time.As work continues, more up-to-date information on any study reported in this documentwill be available from the Early Intervention Research Institute.Staff members contributing to sections of this report included: Glenna Lowitzer, StaceyMcLinden,LanceMortensen,MatthewTaylor,MartinToohill,andKarlWhite.Preparation of the manuscript was done by Mary Ellen Heiner and Vicki Anderson. 1PART I.RATIONALE, DESIGN, AND ANALYSISISSUES RELATED TO THE STUDY In the Fall of 1985, the U. S. Department of Education undertook a significantinitiative to investigate the longitudinal effects ane costs of providing alternative typesofearlyinterventionservicestohandicappedchildren.Throughacompetitively awarded contract to the Early Intervention Research Institute at UtahState University, planning was undertaken for a series of longitudinal studies ofthe costs and effects of providing alternative types of early intervention services. PartIof this report summarizes the activities undertaken as a part of thisproject and outlines the contextLal, theoretical, and historical factors underlyingthe conceptualization, design, and implementation of the studies. The details of severalmethodological issueswhichcutacrossstudies(e.g.,randomizationprocedures, instrumentation, economic analyses, etc.) are explained in th;s sectionso that they will not need to be repeated in the Gescriptiun of each :ndividual study.Part II of the report summarizes the rPsults of each individual study. The 17studies conducted have been divided into three categories for ease of presentation:The Effects of Varying Inten4ity of InterventionIntervention with Medically Fragile Children (each of which involvedage-at-start comparisons)The Effects of Involving Parents in InterventionThe presentation of results for studies in each category are preceded by a reviewof other research which has addres,..ed similar issues. PartIIIcontainsatwo-page summary for each ofthe17studies whichsummarizes in tabular form the design and results of each study. This section isintended asa quick reference to the major findings of thestudy.Itisnotintended as a complete description and is best used after reading the more completereport of each individual study. 2Part IV describes the activities of the project over the five-year contractperiod with regard to disseCnation, training of graduate students, and the meetirgsof the Advisory Committee. BACKGROUND FOR THIS REPORT The impetus for this type of a large scale research project stems from at leastthree sources. First, over the past 25 years, hundreds of research studies havebeen conducted to investigate the efficacy of early intervention programs withhandicapped, disadvantaged, and at-risk children. Unfortunately,much of thisresearch has suffered from serious methodological and/or implemented interventions (Dunst & Rheingrover, 1981;Simeonsson, Cooper, & Scheiner, 1982). Most of the research which has been welldone, has been done with disadvantaged children, and there are questions about thedegree to which findings from research with such children should be used to makedecisionsaboutprogramsfor children with handicaps(White&Casto,1985).Unfortunately, there is very little credible research data which can be used to drawconclusions about what types of early intervention programs are best for whichchildren with handicaps.Second, during the last 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in theavailability of early intervention programs for children with handicaps. Thisexpansion is expected to continue end even increase with the 1986 passage of PublicLaw 99-457 which provides significant initiatives for states to mandate earlyintervention programs for handicapped children by the Fall of 1991. Although muchprogress has been made, itis evident that the lack of high-quality research forchildren with handicaps has been a substantial impediment to improving the qualityof early intervention services for such children and their families. Furthermore,the rapid and continuing expansion has increased the need for better informationabout which early intervention programs are best for which children. 3Third, during the last decade, resources for providing human service programs havebecomeincreasinglylimited.Thishasledpolicy makers andprogramadministrators to be more concerned about the costs as well as the effects of all humanservice programs. Withregardtoearlyintervention,therehavebeen increasingly frequent questions about which types of programsare most cost- effective.Unfortunately, very little previous early intervention research hasincluded a cost analysis component.It was in the context of these three factors: 1) limited high-quality earlyintervention research for children with handicaps, 2) pressures to expand earlyintervention programs for children with handicaps, and 3) the almost total absenceof efficacy research which includes a cost-analysis component, that the U. S. Department of Education issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the Spring of 1985.This RFP called for a contractor to conduct a series of experimental studies investigating the effects and costs of alternative types of early intervention forchildren with handicaps. The RFP stipulated that each of those studies must be arandomized experiment in which two alternative types of intervention were compared,must consider the effects of the intervention for both children and families, mustanalyze the costs in conjunction with the effects of the alternative types of intervention, andmustbecarriedoutinfield-basedsettingswhichwererepresentative of state-of-the-art early intervention programs.The RFP required that one group of studies would investigate the effects ofvarying the intensity of the intervention program, another series would investigatevariations in the age at which the comprehensive intervention program began, and afinal group of studies woul investigate the effects of program variation. Thesestudies were to be done with various subgroups of children with handicaps (e.g.,visually impaired, hearing impaired, severely handicapped, etc.) instead of withdisadvantaged or at-risk children. The contract provided funding for a 5-year period so that the effects of intervention could be assessed longitudinally, but the 4money was limited to actually conducting the research and was not to be used to fundthe intervention programs.As a separate part of the contract, the recipient was also required to developa system which could be used to describe the participating children, the nature of theinterventionprogram,thecosts,andtheeffectsofaseriesofearlyintervention programs for handicapped children. This system was to be designed insuch a way that it could be used on a regional, state, or national basis. Theintent ofthis data collection system was that itcould beusedbyprogramadministrators (e.g., a state coordinator of preschool programs) to systematicallyand objectively describe the type of programs being offered, identify gaps in theexistingsystem,anddraw conclusions about which programs were bestforaparticular purpose. This component of the contract was completed at the end of the1987-88 year.A full description of that system is included in the final report for1987-88 (see ERIC Document Reproduction Services #ED 303972). Consequently, it isnot discussed in this report.Specifications for the contract required a series of feasibility studies duringthe first year (1935-36), after which the Government would decide whether it wouldproceed with all or part of the proposed research workscdpe. Based on the work doneduring that first year (1985-86), the Government decided to proceed with all of thework outAined in the original RFP. (A report of that work can be found in ERICDocument Reproduction Services #ED 202089). Asaresult of the government'sdecision, the Longitudinal Studies of the Effects and Costs of Early Interventionwith Handicapped Children were initiated in October of 1986 and continued throughDecember 31,1990.A subsequent, competitively awarded contract, is now in place(Contract #HS90010001) which will continue to colleLt data so that the long-termeffects of early intervention with handicapped children can be more completelyassessed. 5The purpose of this report is to summarize the results of the work conductedduring the five year funding Period of the Longitudinal Studies of the Effects andCosts of Early Intervention with Handicapped Children. To set a context for themain body of the report which describes the results of each study, we will brieflysummarize the activities and accomplishments during each year of the project (1985- 86, 1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90). We will then summarize the theoretical,conceptual, and methodological issues which undergird the conduct of the individualstudies (much of the material contained in these sections has appeared previously inother reports oftheproject).Finally,thedesignandresultsofeach individual study will be discussed. AccompHshments During 1985-86 The primary task during the first year of the project was to identify the sites that would participate in the longitudinal studies. This task was difficult becauseof the constraints imposed by the original RFP. For example, since the contractfunds could not be used to actually provide services, service programs had to beidentified who were willing and able to contribute financial resources (often substantialamounts)toconductingtheexpandedservicesnecessaryforthe comparative experiments. In addition, collaborators had to be willing to abide bythe conditions of the contract (random assignment of children to groups, extensivedata collection for participating children and families, and provision of datanecessary to calculate program costs and to verify treatment implementation). Finally,the type of research called for inthe RFP eliminated many potentialcollaborators because of the necessity of having substantial numbers of handicappedchildren who were available for participation in the experimental groups.The foregoing requirements necessitated a nationwide search for projects whowere interested in collaborating in the longitudinal research. Over 50 programswere contacted and almost 25 were visited during the recruitment phase of the 6 project.Using carefully developed criteria, EIRI staff narrowed the potentialparticipants to a final set of 16 studies which were initiated in the Fall of 1986.Another major activity during the first year was thedevelopment,pilot testing,revision,andfinalization ofthevariousproceduresandprotocols necessary toimplement these studies. For example, from among the hundreds ofmeasures available for measuring child and family progress, EIRI staff selectedthose measures which appeared to be most appropriate for these particular studiesof early intervention. Procedures also had to be developed for randomly assigningchildren to groups, conducting the cost-analyses, and collecting data on treatmentverification. Insomecases,thesitesidentifiedascollaborators neededassistance in enhancing various aspects of their program so that the research couldbe conducted.For example, staff worked with some programs in developing betterchild-find procedures, record keeping systems, inservice training programs, andchild assessment and evaluation techniques.Based on the work referred to above, a series of four feasibility studies wereconducted during the 1985-86 year. Three of these studies were carried out inconjunction with a special funding initiative in the state of Illinois, and one wasconductedinSalt LakeCity,Utah.Eachofthese studies used thevariousprocedures, data collection protocols, and management techniques that were beingdeveloped for the larger set of studies.The purpose of these feasibility studies was to collect data that would assist thegovernmentin deciding whether it was feasible to conducttheseriesoflongitudinal studies called for in the original RFP. The feasibility studies ledto revisions of severalprotocols and to rethinking of some of the managementstrategies being considered for the larger set of studies.For example, thefeasibility studies made it clear that the degree of training and monitoring thatwouldbenecessaryfordiagnosticians toappropriately usetheBattelleDevelopmental Inventory would have to be substantially greater than had first been 7 anticipated.The feasibility studies also suggested that additional work would haveto be devoted to identifying instruments appropriate for assessing motor developmentin very young children and for assessing mother-child interaction. In many otherareas, the feasibility studies yielded valuable insights which had a substantialimpact on how the longitudinal studies were eventually structured.A fourth major activity of the first year was to raise additional money thatcould be used to enhance various aspects of the research. From the beginning it had been clear that the money available from the U.S. Department of Education would onlyallow a \"bare bones\" research project to be conducted. Of particular concern wasthe limited amount of funds available for collecting outcome data for children andfamilies, and the lack of funds available for \"buying out\" a portion of time of someof the staff at each of the collaborating research sites to allow them to devote thenecessary time and effort to the liaison activities necessary in this type of research.During the first year (1985-86), EIRI staff devoted substantial amounts of timeand effortto raising additional funds.Hundreds of private foundations were contacted,funds from the Utah State Legislature were requested, and work wasinitiated with several other federal funding agencies. Asaresult of theseefforts, an ongoing $50,000 per year appropriation was received from the Utah StateLegislature, a number of small donations were obtained from private companies andfoundations,and asubstantial amount of money was obtained from the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development, and the Office of Maternal andChild Health.The money obtained from these efforts dramatically increased theamount of data that could be collected as a part of the research and enhanced theinterpretability of those data because of the expanded treatment verification andsite liaison activities. 1 1 8Accomplishments During 1986-87 Although the contract did not call for the studies to begin until October 1, 1986, when the second year of the contract actually began, it was necessary to beginseveral of the studies prior to that time because of the service year calendar ofseveral of the collaborators. In other words, for some of the collaborators, theservice year began in August or September and in order to have children randomlyassigned to groups, it was necessary to begin the experiment at the beginning oftheir service year instead of part way into it.From the beginning it was clear that the continuation of any one of the studiesfor the full time period of the contract would depend on a number of factors whichwere not under the control of EIRI or the service provider. For example, a numberof the programs depended on state appropriated money for both their basic programand the expanded program necessary for thn research compariscns. If the state cutfunding for the service program, the research project was jeopardized. In othercases, the recruitment of subjects did not proceed as projected and the success ofthe project was called into question (e.g., in several studies with low birthweightbabies with intraventricular hemorrhaging (IVH), we found the incidence to havedropped substantially from previous years). Because the successful implementationof any given study was in part dependent on factors which we could not control, wecontinued to recruit additional sites and maintained several alternative research sites.During the second year of the project (1986-87), the following activitiesoccurred.Eighteen different longitudinal studies were implemented, these includedseveral changes from those studies reported in the baseline report. For example,based on much lower than expected recruitment at participating hospitals in NewOrleans, we decided to only conduct one study for children with intraventricularhemorrhage instead of the two originally planned in conjunction with Louisiana State University.The second LSU/IVH study was replaced with a similar population of 9childrenin the Salt Lake City area. For similar reasons, two studies at theAlabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind were dropped based on much lower enrollmentof subjects than anticipated.The basic procedures for conducting the studies were developed during theinitial year of the project. However, during 1986-87 it was evident that severalareas needed further work, particularly the procedures for recruiting, training, andmonitoring diagnosticians; treatment verification; and cost-data collection. Workin these areas proceeded simultaneously with the implementation of the studies.During the 1985-86 year, preliminary approval was obtained from the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the Bureau of Maternaland Child Health (MCH) for supplementing the Department of Education contract;however, substantial additional work was necessary to finalize those arrangements.Negotiations were completed in April of 1987 with NICHD, and in July of 1987 with MCH.A part of the workscope specified in the RFP was the provision of training tograduate students. During 1986-87, 19 graduate students and one post doctoralfellow were employed by the institute.These individuals participated in allaspects of the work commensurate with their skills and experiences. Accomplishments During 1987-88 During 1987-88, institute staff continued the conduct of the studies initiatedthe previous year. Individual site coordinators worked with each of the study sites tooverseetheimplementation ofalternativeinterventions toensurethateternative interventions were appropriately implemented. Periodic site visits andweekly telephone contacts were made toeach ofthesites.Aformalonsiteevaluation visit was made to eachsite using a structured format. The sitecoordinators arranged for the collection of treatment verification data and arrangedwith the liaison person ut each site for the collection of pre- and posttest data. ? 10Data collection required the recruitment, training, and monitoring of diagnosticiansin each of the sites. The site coordinators also worked with economists at theinstitute and with site liaisons to collect the necessary data for cost analyses.The management of the research comparisons at each of the sites required continualattention to make sure that necessary data were being collected and that alternativeinterventions were being implemented as planned. As outcome data were collected,site coordinators were also responsible for cleaning, double checking, and enteringthe data into the computer files.Due to difficulties in recruiting the number of subjects they had originallyexpected, additional sites were dropped near the beginning of the 1987-88 year.This necessitated the recruitment of additional sites.Asa result of these recruitment efforts, negotiations were conducted with sites in Columbus, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Chicago, Illinois. Substantial additional work was done duringthe year to identify an additional hearing impaired site with contacts being madein Texas, Florida, South Carolina, California, and Michigan. Although people ineach of these sites expressed a great deal of interestin participating in the longitudinalresearch,the unavailability of sufficient funds for the servicecomponent of the research prevented any of them from becoming involved.A longitudinal study of this nature requires ongoing procedural refinements.During the 1987-88 year, particular attention was devoted to measuring the degreeto whichparentsareinvolvedinearlyinterventionprograms.Anumberofalternatives were tried including telephone interviews, interviewer ratings, parent reportsusingpostcards,andtimediaries.Noneofthese weresuccessful.Procedures for the estimation of costs were also refined during the year. It wasdiscovered that site liaisons required substantially more assistance than originally expected.Thus,procedures were altered to account for the provision of suchassistance.Effort was also devoted to refining the scoring systems for parent-child interaction. 11Because of the extensive data being collected at each study on child and familyfunctioning, demographic characteristics, and treatment verification variables, anumber of different kinds of analyses were possible. During the 1987-88 year,samples sizes in many of the sites became large enough so that these analyses could beinitiated.Thus,the effortsof researchstaffbegantoshift from the recruitment of sites and implementation of research to conducting the analyses.A ,iart of the workscope specified in the RFP is the provision of training to graduatestudents.Duringthe1987-88year,20graduatestudentsandone postdoctoral fellow were employed by the institute. These individuals participatedin ways commensurate with their skills and experience in all aspects of the workdescribed in the remainder of this report.An important part of the institute's workscope was tu disseminate informationto professionals, parents,policymakers, and administrators. During the first several years of the project, dissemination was limited because the actual research had not yet been initiated. During the 1987-88 year, 36 journal articles, chapters inbooks,ormanuscriptswereproduced;and50presentationsweremadeat professional meetings. Accomplishments During 1988-89 1988-89 was the fourth year of the Longitudinal Studies' contract, and thethird year since most of the studies were initiated. The primary emphasis during thisyearwasoncontinuingtheimplementation oftheindividualstudies.Individual site coordinators continued to work with each of the study sites tooversee theimplementation of alternative interventions and to ensure that theexperimental conditions were appropriately implemented. Periodic site visits andweekly telephone contacts were made to each of the sites. In most cases, anotherformal onsite evaluation, using a structured format, was conducted. ;evcral of 15 12these onsite evaluations included independent evaluators who were not associated with Utah State University.Site coordinators also arranged for the collection of treatment verificationdata and arranged with the liaison person at each site for the collection of pre- andposttestdata.Asignificantamountofturnoveroccurredwiththe diagnosticians fromthepreviousyear.Thisturnovernecessitatedfurther recruitment,training,and ongoing monitoring of diagnosticians at each of the sites.The management of the research comparisons at each of the sites requiredongoing attention to make sure that necessary data were being collected and that alternativeinterventions were being implemented as planned.As outcome datacontinued to be collected, site coordinators were responsible for cleaning, double-checking, and entering the data into the computer for subsequent analyses.Obtaining money for the provision of alternative intervention services emergedas a major responsibility of site coordinators during this year. A number of thesites had been receiving federal funding for providing the early intervention program which was a part of the research (e.g., LSU IVH and South Carolina IVH), andthat mo.v ended during this year. In other sites, state money had been providedand wasshiftedto other programs, reduced,or discontinued. Theindividualcircumstances varied from site to site, but substantial amount of effort was neededto maintain funding for interventions in each of the sites.Another issue which emerged this year was the necessity of efforts to minimize attrition.Children who had completed interventions and moved to other parts ofthe country had to be located wherever possible and tested at appropriate times.In other cases, children moved within the same geographic area, and had to berelocated before testing could be done. A number of parents have simply lost interestintheprojectand efforts were madetopersuadethemtocontinueparticipation. Having liaison people located at each of the sites was critic.al tothe success of this process. In many cases, the money obtained from the Office of 13Maternal and Child Health allowed us to buy out a portion of a person's time who was located at the site. In those cases where we were able to buy out the time of anenthusiastic and committed person, problems with attrition and ongoing funding withthe project were substantially reduced.At the beginning of the 1988-89 year, we were able to finalize the arrangementsnecessary to add a site with a school district in Salt Lake City (Jordan IntensityStudy) in order to replace one of the sites lost earlier. Final arrangements werealso made to begin providing intervention to children in the Columbus Children'sHospital Site. Thus, there Nere two new sites that came into operation during this year.The biggest problem in operating the longitudinal Studies has remained thesecuring of funds for providing alternative services.During 1988-89 there was continued need for refinements and additions to some oftheprojects'procedures.For example,severalofthesitesimplementedecobehavioral observation techniques to obtain additional information about thetypes of activities in which interveitionists and children were engaged and how thoseactivitiesrelatedtochildprogress.Theanalysisofparent-childinteraction data continued to require substantial effort. Our approach to thescoring of parent-child interaction was to secure assistance from some of the peoplein the field who have developed the most widely-used systems (Dale Farran, JerryMahoney, and Kofi Marfo). At the end of 1987-88, tapes were sent to each of thesepeople for coding according to their systems. Preliminary analyses from thosecodings were complete but much work remained. Efforts were also devoted to refiningthe measures of child health for all children and the measure of motor functioningfor children in the IVH studies. Finally, we began preparations to shift from usingthe Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) to the Woodcock-Johnson Battery for thosechildren who had become too old for the BDI to be used appropriately. A significantaddition tc data collection during 1988-89 was the collection of data from teachersof children who enrolled in public school programs. The few sites where this was 1 7 14done durinc 1988-89 provided valuable lessons that were critical in subsequent yearsas more children from other sites \"graduated\" into public school programs.The training of graduate assistants and their involvement in the longitudinal studiescontinued asanimportant part of the contractual workscope for th4s project.During 1988-89, 14 graduate students from special education and psychologyworked on the Longitudinal Studies. Their responsibilities included supervision ofdata collection and coding, telephone interviews with parents, data analysis and interpretation, and report writing. In addition to these students who were employed 20 hours per week, an additional 23 graduate students from Utah State University andother universities were trained and certified to do educational assessments ofparticipating children. These students were paid on a daily rate according to thenumber of assessments they completed.As more data were collected, project staff also increased their activity invarious dissemination activities. During 1988-89, many presentations were made atprofessional meetings, and several articles reporting the results of the studies todate were submitted to journals. Accomplishments During 1989-90 1989-90 was the fifth and final year of the Longitudinal Studies' contract, and thefourth yearsincemostofthestudies wereinitiated.Individualsite coordinatorscontinuedto work with eachofthestudysitestooverseetheimplementation of the alternative interventions and to ensure that the interventionswere implemented appropriately. Periodic site visits and regular telephone contactswere maintained with each of the sites. In most cases,another formal onsiteevaluation, using a structured format, was conducted.Site coordinators also oversaw the collection of treatment verification andoutcome data at each of the sites. Because of...urnoverin diagnosticians, it wasnecessary to continue to train a few diagnosticians and monitoring procedures were 15continuedto ensure high-quality assessments. Management ofthe experimentalcomparisons at each of the sites required ongoing attention to make sure that appropriatedatawerecollectedandthattheimplementation ofalternativeinterventions were continuing as planned. The early intervention programs inanumber of the sites were no longer operational for children participating in theresearchsincethesechildrenhad\"graduated\"intopublicschoolprograms.Arrangements were made to continue to follow those children and collect dataannually.As outcome data were collected, site coordinators were responsible forcleaning, double checking, and entering the data into the computer for subsequentanalyses. Theimportanttaskof minimizing attrition among participating child andfamilies continued as a major responsibility of site coordinators. Children who hadcompleted early intervention programs and moved to other parts of the country werelocated whenever possible and tested at appropriate times. In other cases, childrenhad moved within tfe same geographic area and had to be relocated before testingcouldbedone.Inmostsites,theeffortstorelocatechildrenhavebeensuccessful, and the posttest data included in this final report often includes morechildren than the posttest data from the 1988-89 year. Unfortunately, a number ofparents have simply lost interest in the project and declined to participate inspite of our best efforts to persuade them to continue. The importance of havingliaison people located e. each of the sites was emphasized in this process. Moneyobtained from the Office of Maternal and Child Health allowed us to purchase aportion of a person's time at many of the sites, and this substantially aided in theefforts to obtain a data set which was as complete as possible.The training of graduate students and their involvement in the LongitudinalStudies continued as an important part of the contractual workscope for the project.During 1989-90, 12 different graduate students from special education, family and human development, economics, and psychology were actively involved in the workscope I ;) 16of the Longitudinal Studies. Their responsibilities included supervision of data collectionandcoding,telephoneinterviews with parents,dataanalysisandinterpretation, and report writing. In addition to these students who were employedan average of 20 hours per week, many additional graduate students from Utah StateUniversity and other universities were tralned and certified to do educationalassessments as a part of the Longitudinal Studies' workscope. These students were paid according to the number of assessments they completed.The activities of the staff regarding dissemination of project results also increased.As more studies have had complete data, the results of these studieshave been written and presented at national meetings and submitted to journals for publication.Although the funding for this project ended December 31, 1990, itisanticipated that many subsequent publications and presentations at national and internationalmeetings will bedoneto reportthe results of these import3nt studies.The remainder of Part Iofthis report contains sections addressing thefollowing issues:An analysis of the early intervention efficacy research which had beenconducted prior to the initiation of this project;The rationale for conducting randomized experiments in early childhoodspecial education;The design and general procedures for c)nducting the studies includingadiscussion of the theoretical/conceptual framework, the subjectassignmentprocedures,thedatacollectionprocedures,theinstrumentation, procedures used to verify the implementation of theintended interventions, and the techriques fu.* conducting economicanalyses with the studies;The st)Aegies and activities used tJ recruit and select collaboratorsto participate in the studies. 17PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OFEARLY INTERVENTION WITH HANDICAPPED CHILDREN The design and conduct of the Longitudinal Studies was based on a comprehensivereview ofthe early intervention efficacy literature available at the time the studies were initiated. Although that review is now outdated because many otherstudies have been conducted in the last 5 years, a proper interpretation of thestudies reported in this volume depends on understanding what could be concludedfrom the research available at that time. This section summarizes the review ofresearch literature completed prior to the initiation of the Longitudinal Studies.a;Updated research reviews pertaining to the studies included as a part of this projectare includealater.At the time the Longitudinal Studies were initiated, andcontinuing to the current time, the tem \"early intervention\" encompasses a widevariety of medical, educational, and psychological treatments such as vestibularFtimulation for cerebral palsied children, language therapy for hearing impaired children,auditoryandkinestheticstimulationforlowbirthweightinfants,educational programming for disadvantaged children, instruction in self-help skills for mentally retarded children, and diet therapy for hyperactive children. Intensityof programs range from a few seconds of vestibular stimulation once per day for aweek, to 40 hours per week of intensive educational programming beginning at birth.Objectives range from prevention to complete resolution or amelioration, to slowing therateofdegeneration, tohelpingfamiliestocope.The widerangeofintervention procedures, target populations, intensities, and objectives makes itclear thatthere are no simple answers to the question, \"Is early intervention effective?\"From the edrly 1970s, the number of early intervention vograms for childrenwho are disabled, at-risk, nr disadvantaged, increased dramatically; most peopleagree that it will continue to increase as a result of the pssacie of P.L. 99-457 in 1986.Exact estimates are difficult becaus of problems in defIning exactly what 18early intervention is, but it is safe to say that millions of children are servedeach year at an annual rest of billions of dollars. As t',z frequency of earlyintervention programs increased, questions about the efficacy of early interventionalso increased. Such questions generated thousands of articles and hundreds ofresearch studies, and many promises were made to parents, legislators, and educators.Unfortunately, the data from early intervention efficacy research have been somewhat discrepant.For example, there has long been agreement among practitioners thatearly intervention promises significant resolution to some of the most persistentand expensive problems which educators face. According to Jordan, Hayden, Karnes, and Wood (1977):Programs providing early educational and therapeutic programming to meetthe needs of young handicapped children and their families are reducingthe number of children who will need intensive or long-term help...withearly help, the sooner the better, these children can often function athigher levels than has been dreamed possible in prior years. (p.26)However, the benefits of early intervention have not been universally accepted.As Hodges and Sheenan (1978) pointed out:No consistent picture of success emerged from the early childhood educationefforts of the 19601s. Although modest or robust immediate gains fromstructured programs were frequent, just as frequently, these gains erodedafter the children left the experimental program. (p. 4)Even though the results of individual research studies should guide policy andpractice, early intervention efficacy research, when considered as a total body of evidence,wassomewhat confusing. Some researchers reported success; others, failure.Some suggested that early intervention was effective, but only for specificsubgroups of children. Thus, even though the concept of early intervention wasendorsed by individual practitioners and state and federal funding agencies (DeWeerd& Cole, 1976; Swan, 1981), the research evidence was not clear. Even more important,the factors which account for variation in research results had not been identified. 19Because of conflicting opinions about what can be concluded from previous early intervention resear,,h, it was decided that the design of the Longitudinal Studiesshould be based on a thorough and systematic analysis of the existing research. Procedures Our approach to answering the question, \"What can be concluded from exitingresearch aboutthe efficacy of early intervention?\" canbe exriained best byconsidering the following six steps which are generally included in what has cometo be known as the scientific method of inquiry: 1.Delimit the question to be asked;2.Examine previous efforts to answer the same or related questions;3.Develop research questions or hypotheses;4.Define and select an appropriate sample from which to collect data;5.Collect data on relevant variables for each subject in the sample;6.Analyze the data and draw conclusions about research questions.Two critical attributes of the scientific method of inquiry which apply to all thesteps just mentioned are: (1) the procedures used must be explicit and replicable,and (2) results should be accepted only if replicated and confirmed by independentinvestigators.Although the paradigm has not been used often in conjunction withintegrative reviews of the literature, there is no reason why it should not be justas useful in such efforts as it has proven to be in conducting primary research.Delimiting the question. In delimiting the questions which would guide ourinvestigation, we cast a deliberately broad net. Our goal was to critically examineall experimental studies of interventions that began before 66 months of age withchildren who are disabled, disadvantaged, and at-risk. We defined children withdisabilities following the guidelines distributed by the U.S. Department of Educationunder PL 94-142. At-risk children were defined as those who had suffered from traumasurroundingbirth;disadvantagedchildrenweredefinedasthosewithlowsocioeconomic status. With the exception of surgical or dietary interventions, weincluded all educational, psychological, or therapeutic interventions which presented tk.1 20data about an intervention designed to (1) prevent the oAset or further progression of a disability, (2) produce actual improvement in the functional ability of the child,or(3)provide support insituationsin whichahandicap was already established.Reviewing previous work. We began our investigation by critically examining 52 previous reviews of the early intervention efficacy literature. (See White, Bush,& Casto, 1985-86 for a complete report of this analysis.) The analysis identifiedprimary research studies to be included in our review and guided our thinking aboutmethodological approaches and the variables which needed to be considered.Generating bootheses. By analyzing previous reviews, wealso generated hypotheses that needed to be tested, as summarized in Table 1.1. Previc is reviewersconsistently cited a number of variables as being associated with interventioneffectiveness, such as age at which intervention begins, degree to which parents areinvolved, intensity of the intervention, and many others. For example, 29 of the52 reviewers cited parental involvement as a mediating variable, and 26 of the 27who drew conclusions about the effects of parental involvement concluded that more parentalinvolvement was directly associated with early intervention efficacy.Alternatively, 10 reviewers cited socioeconomic status of the family as an importantmediating variable--7 of whom drew conclusions about how this variable affectedintervention efficacy. However, only 4 of 7 agreed that intervention was moreeffective with economically deprived children, and 3 concluded that socioeconomicstatus is unrelated to intervention efficacy.Selectinaa sample from which to collect data. The analysis of previous reviewsproved to be the best source of identifying studies to be included in our analysis.We also conducted an extensive computer-assisted bibliographic search, sent lettersto colleagues to identify fugitive literature, and examined references to efficacy studiesin articles previously obtained. Less than 15% of the studies r) 4 21Table 1.1Most Frequently Cited Concomitant Variables in Reviews of Early Intervention Efficacy Research Variable No. of ReviewersMost Frequent Conclusions(Ratio of reviewers who drew conclusionsthat agreed) Parent Involvement 29 More fs better 26/27Age Intervention Begins 27 Earlier is better 18/24Duration/Intensity 22 LOnger/more intense is better 12/17Degree of Structure 19More structure is better 16/17Training of Intervenor 14More is better 7/7Continuity with Public School 13Enhances intervention 12/13Type of Curriculum 13 Nu one type is better 7/10Setting 11 Home is better 4/8Socioeconomic Status 10More deprived children do better 4/7Individualization 8More is better 4/4Child/Teacher Ratio 8Lower is better 7/7 search which examined 8 data bases and over 200 terms and combinations of terms.(Casto, White, & Taylor, 1983, explain the specific procedures used in the computer- assisted search.)Collectino data for each study. As each potential study was obtained, it was screened to determine whether it met the criteria for inclusion; those that did werecoded by one of the project team members. We attempted to collect data aboutapproximately 90 variables from the following five categories for each study. First, we coded information about the type of subjects involved in each study.For example, were they handicapped, at risk, or disadvantaged? How old were they? In what kindof families did they reside? At what level were they functioning prior to theinitiation of intervention? Second, the specific intervention used was describedby coding such variables as the duration of the intervention, the identity of theprimary intervenors, and the setting in which the intervention took place. Third, we coded information about the design of the study including a rating of the study'smethodological quality based on an analysis of the Campbell/Stanley threats tointernal validity (Campbell & Stanley, 1966) in combination with the type of designbeing used.Fourth, we coded information about the outcomes that were assessed,including the domain of the outcome,who collected the data, and howitwas 22 collected.Finally the results of the each study were computed by taking the meandifference between the groups divided by the standard deviation of the control group's scores (which we defined as an \"effect size\").By converting all results to such effect size measures, a common metric wascreated so results could be compared across studies which used different ways of measuring IQ, socio-emotional functioning, or parental attitudes. Since outcomeswere on a common metric, estimates of program impact could be combined with the information described above about domain of outcome, methodological quality of study,type of subjects used, and nature of the intervention, to compare results fromdifferent studies addressing similar questions. Each variable was operationally defined ir a set of written conventions; explicit procedures were outlined for ccders to follow.Because multiple coders were involved, frequent reliability checks wc.edone, and coders achieved more than 85% agreement for all the variables reported.Multiple effect sizes were coded for the same study if they added uniqueinformation, such as information about language competence versus adaptive behavioror immediate versus long-term data. To prevent giving undue weight to studies thatadministered many tests, only one effect size was coded for each domain of outcomefor any 12-month period of elapsed time. In other words, if a stu'y administeredtwo different IQ tests to the subjects at the conclusion of the study, only one wasused in our analysis.Analysis and interpretation of results. The sixth step of the scientific methodis to analyze and interpret the data using replicable procedures. A variety ofanalytical approaches were used. For example, we hypothesized that if parentalinvolvement were positively associated with intervention effectiveness, then thosetreatment vs. no-treatment studies that heavily involved parents should yield largereffect sizes on the average than those treatment vs. no-treatment studies that aidnot involve parents. If itis generally true that involvement of parents resultsin more effective interventions, those differences should remain when the analysis 23is limited to different subsets of the data. Using this rationale, we computeddescriptive statistics for the total data set and then those studies we considered to be the best quality. We looked at immediate effects vs. long-term effects andconsidered the results of those comparisons when different domains of outcome wereconsidered, such as IQ versus motor development versus parental outcomes. Finally,and perhaps most important, we examined the results of those fewstudies that made a direct within-study comparison of high versus low levels of parentalinvolvement.For example, some of the most direct evidence about theeffects of parental involvement came from a study in which a center-based programrandomly assigned children to a group in which parents were highly involved, or toa group in which parents were involved in a minimal extent, with the center-based program continuing in both groups. Unfortunately, there were relatively few of these \"A\"versus\"B\"studies for any given question. The combined results of such\"triangulation methods\" allowed us to be much more confident about the robustnessof our c.clusions concerning the different hypotheses investigated. Results of the Integrative Review The results of this systematic review were both enlightening and provocative.They have confirmed some common accepted positions, called others into question,and identified the almost total absence of empirical data for either supporting orrefuting others. Because the total data set is so voluminous, we note here only those parts of the data which were instrumental in designing the Longitudinal Studiesreported in the remainder of the volume. (More detailed summaries are given byCasto et al., 1983; White & Casto, 1985.) CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA SETAt the time the Longitudinal Studies were initiated, the data set consisted of2,266 effect sizes from 326 different studies. Data from experimental/control studies,AversusBstudies,andsingle-subject design studies were analyzed 24separately because of the fundamentally different questions they address. There were1,121 effect sizes from intervention versus control studies. Most of those (906) were from studies with disadvantaged children, 215 were from studies with handicappedchildren, and 85 from studies with medically at-risk children. The majority ofeffect sizes from the handicapped population came from studies which considered theeffects of intervention with either mentally retarded children or with groups ofchildren exhibiting a mix of handicaps, but predominantly with mild to moderatemental retardation.Included in the data set were 984 effect sizes from intervention A versus Bstudies which have examined such questions as earlier versus later intervention,intervention intensity, and degree of parental involvement. We also examined the results of 76 single-subject design studies, most of which have focused on increasingsocial interaction, correcting conduct disorders, or enhancing language competence.The data set included studies reported from 1937 to 1984, with 70% of them from 1970 and after. Most of those studies were reported in educational or psychologicaljournals, but significant numbers came from medical journals, books, unpublisheddocuments through ERIC, and government reports. IQ was the most frequently measuredoutcome, accounting for over 40% of all outcomes.There was also substantialreporting of language, academic functioning, and motor functioning, but relativelyscarr.e conside:ation of social-emotional growth or family outcomes. Over 60% ofeffect sizes were measured immediately at the conclusion of intervention, and only11% were measured more than 36 months after intervention concluded--all of those withdisadvantaged samples. OVERALL EFFECTS OF INTERVENTIONWehaveconsideredtheevidenceaboutearlyinterventioneffectivenessseparately for studies done with disadvantaged, at-risk, and handicapped children because of our belief that the children in each group are so different that combiningthe data would be misleading. Unfortunately, in many previous reviews of the early 25 intervention efficacy literature, conclusions about the effects of a particular typeof intervention for handicapped children have been based primarily on data from studies with disadvantaged children (see White et al., 1985-86).Although there iscertainly some limited applicability for certain issues, the general practice is highly suspect.Most of the available evidence about immediate and long-term benefits of early interventionis for disadvantaged children. As ,howninFigure1.1,the bestestimate -4 the immediate effect of early intervention for disadvantaged childrenis approximately one-half a standard deviation. In other words, for IQ measurements, this represents a gain of about 8 points, for motor functioning an improvement from the 30th to the 50th or from the 10th to the 22nd percentile, for reading achievementat the second grade a gain of approximately 10 months of reading. Those are substantial effects that are of obvious clinical importance. The magnitude of these immediate effects is similar for every domain and, generally speaking, for programs.70- .60- .50- .40. Good studies# of studies(31)(9)(10)(6)(6)Figure 1.1: Average effect sizes for outcomes measured at various times following completion of theintervention for studies with disadvantaged childnin. 26using different philosophical approaches conducted indifferent settings with involvement of different types of intervenors.Over time, there is a clear tendency for the measurable effects of interventionwith disadvantaged children to besubstantially reduced. Severalcaveats are important in interpreting that data. First, when the results are limited to studies of good methodological quality, they are based on relatively few data, and there aresome exceptions to the tendency for data to wash out over time. For example, thePerry Preschool project (Berrueta-Clement et al., 1984), which was conducted withdisadvantaged children, was a well-designed study which reported substantial effectsfor early intervention on variables such as high school graduation rates, employment,and teenage pregnancy rates. It is also important to point out, however, that therewere other reasonably well-designed studies that failed to find long-term effectsin some of the same areas.A second caveat is that the presently available long-term data are predominantly IQ and academic achievement data. Asiro studies collect data such as that reportedin the Perry Preschool project, a different picture may emerge.A third problem is that many people mistakenly assume that long-term effectsare essentialin demonstrating the efficacy of early intervention. As an exampleof how such thinking may be incorrect, consider a hiker stranded in the mountainsduring a winter blizzard. The hiker stumbles across an unoccupied cabin with enoughfuel for only one day. When he arrives, he is very cold. thanks to the firewoodhe finds he is soon warm and comfortable. The next day the blizzard continues, andhe becomes cold again. Few would argue that there was no benefit for him in beingwarm for one day, even though there was not enough fuel to sustain the warmth. 15the only obect or early intervention is to permanently change the measured IQ ofthose children, then these data are discouraging. However, the at.,ndant evidencefor various short-term benefits should not be ignored. 30 27For children with handicaps, as showi in Figure 1.2, the data is much easierto interpret because there was so little of it. Unfortunately, in contrast to dataabout the efficacy of early intervention with disadvantaged children in which 25%of the available data came from studies of high methodological quality, only 16% ofthe data for handicapped children came from studies of high methodological quality.Furthermore, there was no follow-up data collected more than 12 months after theintervention was completed from studies of high methodological quality. The bestestimate for immediate effects is about .40 of a standard deviation. However, thisestimate is based on only 20 effect sizes from 11 different studies. The estimateof program impact when all studies are included is almost double (.72), suggestingthat some of the perception about the magnitude of benefits for children withhandicaps is based on data of questionable validity. However, the fact remains thatthere was evidence of a strong and replicable immediate effect for children withdisabilities based on studies of only good methodological quality.

EFFECTS OF MEDIATING VARIABLESAs noted earlier, White et al. (1985-86)identifieda number of mediatingvariables suggested by previous reviewers as contributing to the effectiveness of early intervent.:on. Data from our analysis of previous research were used indetermining whether these frequently advocated positions couldbeempirically supported.Involvement of ihurents inintervention oroorams. One of the most frequentconclusions in the early intervention efficacy literature is that programs which involve parents are more effective than programs which do not (Bronfenhrenner, 1974;Comptroller General, 1979; Goodson & Hess, 1975; Hewett,1977; Wiekart, Bond, & McNeil, 1978). Although intuitively logical, we were unable to find strong empiricalsupport for this position prior to the initiation of these studies. As shown inTable 1.2, when values are adjusted for age at which intervention began, time ofmeasurement, and quality of dependent variable, the average of 684 effect sizes from80 studies in which parents were not used at all or only used to a minor degree was .42.The average of 200 effect sizes (ES) from 27 studies in which parents were usedas the major or only intervenor was .41. When effect sizes are limited to only high-quality studies, there is still very little difference between programs that useparents extensively and those that do not.Similar results were obtained when data were examined regarding whether theprogram was center-based, home-based, or home- and center-based combined; whetherparents or parents and children were the target of the intervention; and the degreeto which the intervention program intended to involve parents.The most direct information about the effect of parentalinvolvement wasobtained from nine studies which had made direct comparisons between different levelsof parental involvement (Abbot & Sabatino, 1975; Bidder, Bryant, & Gray, 1975; 29Table 1.2Average Effect Sizes for Different Levels of Parental InvolvementAll Studies Good Studies Type of ParentHandicap Intervention E3s\"N\"NE3Nes Disadvantaged HandicappedMinor or not at all .52.0368480.40171 Major or only .42.0420027.5154 Minor or not at all .72.0713748.3817Major or only .59.097027.436Values are adjusted for differences in quality ofoutconw measure and time ofmeasurement Gordon, 1969; Karnes, Radin, 1971; Ramey & Bryant, 1983). When all 134 effect sizesfrom these studies were considered, there is a slight advantage for programs whichinvolved parents more extensively (ES = .08). However, these findings are heavilyinfluenced by the Gordon (1969) study, which showed an average advantage of .18 forinterventions which involved parents. Although the methodological quality of theGordon study is quite good, many of the ESs from his study which compared differentlevels of parental involvement were confounded with age at start, program duration, and setting.Thus, the results from Gordon (1969) should be viewed cautiously. Theother eight studies yielded an average effect size of -.06 (i.e.,in favor ofprograms which did not involve parents).Taken together, these data suggest that early intervention programs that involveparents extensively can be effective, but it did not appear that they were any moreeffective thar, programs which did not involve parents.Admittedly, this was counter to the intuitively logical position advocated atthat time by many people. Before drawing conclusions about whether parents should 30be involved in early intervention programs, it is important to note the lWitations of the available data. First, most of the arguments in support of invo'ving parentsin early intervention programs have come from studies done with disadvantagedchildren (e.g., Bronfenbrenner, 1974; Gordon, 1969; Rescorla, Provence, & Navlor, 1982).These children often come from large families with high incidences of single parents, poverty, and other stressors, and low levels of parent education--all of which may hinder effective parent participation. Thus,it may be that effectivetests of parent involvement have not been done. Second, many of the outcomes included in this analysis (over 40%) are from measures of IQ. It may well be that the involvement of parents leads to gains in other areas which simply have not been investigated.Finally, verY few of the effect sizes (less than 2%) came from studiesin which the investigators verified that parents were actually involved to the degree intended.Thus,it may be that some investigators were examining intended ratherthan actual parental involvement. These caveats notwithstanding, there were no data at the time the Longitudinal Studies were initiated to confirm the widely held beliefthat involvement of parents leads to more effective early intervention.Age at which intervention begins. Another position which was frequer'ly statedin the early intervention literature at the time these studies were in..iated wasthat the earlier the child is involved in a program, the more effective the programwill be (Bronfenbrenner, 1974; Comptroller General, 1979; Garland, Swanson, Stone,& Woodruff,1981).In spite of the popularity of this position, the analysesconducted just prior to the interaction of the Longitudinal Studies provided onlymeager empirical support from intervention versus control studies. As showninFigure 1.3, average effect sizes for studies comparing experimental with cnntrolgroup children beginning at different ages were very similar after adjustments weremade for time at which the outcome was measured and quality of the dependent variable. 31 .50- .30- .20- .10. 0-6 studies15879110226315(18)(17)(19)(25)(34) 73227Sb37(8)(5)(4)(11)(17) Figure 1.3.Average effect sizes for interventions begun when children mire at different ages.

Otnns studies have examined the effect of age at start but havebeen substantially confounded with other variaoles such as duration of settingkBeller, 1969; Gordon, 1979; Scott, 1974; Strickland, 1971). These \"confounded\" studies show an average ES of .16, favoring children who began earlier.

Furthermore, no direct comparisons came from studies withhigh ratings of methodological quality. Most di5turbing is that in spite of thefrequently stated position that \"earlier is better,\" very few empirical studies haveeven addressed the issue of time at which intervention begins. These findingssupported the need to conduct research such as that outlined for the Longitudinal Studies. Conclusions from Previous Research The revif.i4of previous research conducted prior to the initiation of theseLongitudinal Studies established a foundation for the design and conduct of thestudies inclvded in the projecA The most important conclusions from that review which impacted on the Longitudinal studies are summarized below. First, the paucityof available empirical data--particularly from well designed studies--for many ofthe most important questions is disconcerting. Contrary to the conclusions of manyprevious reviewers and textbook authors, there simply was not enough information tobe confident about the long-term impact of early intervention with handicapped children,and evidencein support of many of the commonly held positions aboutmediating variables (e.g., parental involvement, age at start) was either nonexistentor contradictory. Second,there1.1asstrongsuppertforthcimmediatepositive effects of interventioo with disadvantaged children and emerging support for long-term benefits.Furthermore, data were beginning to accumulate which supr)rt the immediate benefitsof intervention for handicapped children. It was clear, however, that more research,particularly longitudinal research, was absolutely essential to guide both policyand practice. 33Most relevant to the design of the Longitudinal Studies was the need identifiedfrom this analysis for higher-quality research. A number of other investigators hadlamented the ambiguity caused by methodological flaws in early intervention efficacyresearch (Dunst & Rheingrover, 1981; Simeonsson et al., 1982). Fortunately, someof the most serious problems with previous studies were reasonably resolvable.First, in spite of the difficulties involved, and as discussed in more detail in alater section, the use of randomized designs in early intervention efficacy researchis neither unethical nor impossible. Random assignment to groups is especiallyfeasible and advantageous in those cases in which the number of families in need ofservices far exceeds the capacity of service agencies to provide comprehensiveservicesorinthose casesin which alternative treatment programs are beingconsiderew.A second relatively simple procedure which could substantially improve thequality and credibility of past early intervention efficacy research would be theuse of data collectors who are unaware of the group membership of subjects. Only21% of the effect sizes included in our analyses of existing research came fromstudies in which the data collector was definitely \"blind.\" Unfortunately, theeducational and medical literatureis rife with examples of ineffective or evenharmful treatments that have been advocated by well-intentioned people who believedthat their treatment was making a difference. We need not look far to see examplesofpeopleseeingwhattheyexpectedtosee,suchasdietarytreatmentofhyperactivity, Doman Delacato therapy for learning-disabled children, or even bloodlettingin the not-too-distant past. The use of\"blind\" data collectors wouldeliminate this rerious threat to the credibility of study results.Another sA..ious problem with previov research was that virtually all the earlyintervention efficacy research which existed at the time these Longitudinal Studieswere initiated had failed to determine the extent to which the intended treatmentwas actually implemented. For example,in programs which intended to use parents 34as interveners, our analyses of previous research identified virtually no instancesof evidence that parents actually did become involved to the degree intended by the program designer. Unless such information is obtained, there is a real danger that comparisons are being made between programs which were intended to be different, but were not.The failure to verify that intended treatments were actually implementedmay have been responsible in part for the failure of previous research to detcctdiffer, ces among alternative intervention programs. Finally,it was clear from these analyses that there was a need to pay moreattention to making sure that there is symmetry between the outcomes assessed andthe goals of the intervention. The specific nature of the intervention program shouldinlarge part dictate the outcome measures that are selected. Becauseresources for research are always limited, investigators should put first priorityon measuring those outcomes which are most central to what their intervention isexpected to accomplish. For example, some interventions have focused primarily onenhancirg social and emotional functioning, but have limited their assessment tomeasurements of IQ. Because there isa substantialinterrelationship among themultiple lines of development, differences in IQ may have been found. CIA: thesedifferences are probably much weaker than they would have been if measurements hadbeen taken on those behaviors and competencies directly targeted by the intervention.Our analysis of previous early intervention research clearly supported the needfor more high-quality research cn the issues outlined by the government for theLongitudinal Studies of the Effects and Costs of Early Intervention with HandicappedChildren (i.e., intensity of intervention, age-at-start, and program variation,particularly parent involvement). The government's requirement that all of thesestudies be done using randomized experiments deserves further discussion in lightof the very strong objectives to randomization raised by many early interventionprofessionals. 35ETHICAL, PRACTICAL, AND SCIENTIFIC CONSIDERATIONS OF RANDOMIZEDEXPERIMENTS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION During the last 20 years, a variety of research methods have been used todetermine whether some types of early intervention are more effective than others (e.g., Balow & Brill, 1975; Miller & Bizzeil, 1983; Nelson & Evans, 1968; Strain, 1975).Recognizing that different research methods have merit, we argue here that one particular methodological technique--randomized experiments--has been underused in collecting data about the efficacy of various forms of early intervention. Indoing that, we e):Amine some of the most frequently used arguments for not usingrandomized experiments, and support the decision of the Federal government to require the use of randomized experiments in the Longitudinal Studies. The term \"randomized experiments\" will be used to refer to those studies which use a process of randomlyassigning subjects to experimental groups (i.e., ensuring that every subject has an equal chance of being in any group). Such a procedure increases the probability thatgroups will be comparable on all variables that might affect the outcome except for group membership.As an example of a randomized exper\".ment, consider the case of the drug,propranolol, which was introduced in the early 1980s to prevent reoccurrence ofheart attacks (Beta--Blocker Heart Attack Trial Research Group, 1982). To determinethe efficacy of this particular drug, almost 4,000 patients who had previously suffered at lea!A. one heart attack were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Onegroup received propranolol, the other did not. After an average of 25 months of treatment, the mortality rate from new heart attacks was 26% lower in the propranololgroup than in the comparison group. Because the only systematic difference betweenthe two groups was that one had received propranolol and one had not, the differencein mortality rate was attributed to the drug.Obviously, the use of randomized experiments is not the only way to establisha cause and effect relationship (e.g., itis now well accepted that smoking is 36causally related to lung cancer even though randomized experiments have not been conducted),butitisone ofthe most efficient methods andhasbeenused successfully inmany areas of social science and. health. Such research has demonstrated the ineffectiveness of many otherwise popular treatments (e.g., dietary treatments of hyperactivity, Spring & Sandoval, 1976; cell therapy for Down syndromechildren, Pruess & Fewell, 1985; the use of laetrile in cancer therapy, Newell & Ellison, 1980; and Doman Delacato treatments for learning disabled children, Glass & Robbins, 1967). In many other cases, randomized experiments have established thebenefits of a particular treatment (Mosteller, 1981)--even in cases where the valueof the treatment was not particularly obvious (e.g., the effectiveness of fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries [Blayney & Hill, 1967]; or Lde historically demonstrated value of randomized experiments, manyearly childhood special education researchers, practitioners, and administratorshave suggested that such designs are inappropriate for early intervention research(e.g., Bricker, Bailey, al., 1982). The most frequently cited argumentscan be summarized in three ,..oad and somewhat overlappinr categories.The first argument suggests that randomized experiments are unnecessary becausethe information necessary to decide which types of programs are best for a particulargroup of children is more easily available from other sources. The second argumentis that randomized experiments are impractical due to a wide variety of logistical,political, and technical difficulties. And, finally, it is argued that randomizedexperiments are unethical and probably illegal because the process of randomizationrequires that needy people be denied treatment or assigned to an undesi,\"able treatment. 4 0 37In what follows, we will argue that there are many instances in which each ofthese objections is incorrect, and that randomized experiments are valuable andshould be more widely used. Although randomized experiments should not be the only method of investigating the efficacy of various forms of early intervention, the veryinfrequent use of randomized experiments in early childhood special education hasbeen a serious impediment to the advancement of knowledge about the efficacy of early intervention. ARE RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTS NECESSARY?Tworelatedargumentsareusedtodefendthepositionthatrandomized experimentsareunnecessary. First,eventhoughopponentsagreethatsuch experimenLs would provide good information about effectiveness, they argue that othermethodological techniques are adequate and easier to implement. Second, it is arguedthat even though none of the existing data are perfect, the combined weight of somuch evidence is sufficient for making decisions. These two arguments are discussed below.There are other wayi_pf knowing. Obviously, causal inferences can be madeconfidently inmanyinstances without data from a randomized experiment: Aparticularly strong wind topples a tree, or an earthquake causes a building to crumble.Because there are no plausible alternative explanations, it would befoolish to argue with the validity of the causal inference. However,in comparingthe relative effectiveness of particular types of early intervention, alternativeexplanations abound and serious mistakes are sometimes made.Professional judgment or common sense is probably the most frequently used basisfor arguing that a particular type of intervention is best for a specific group of children.It is primarily on this basis that people have argued that intervention shouldbeginasearlyaspossible,thatparentsarethekeytoeffectiveintervention, and that more comprehensive or intensive programs result in greaterbenefits (Mastropieri, White, & Fecteau, 1986). 38Fortunately, professional judgment is often correct and has led to significant advances.Occasionally, however, over-reliance on professional judgment leads to serious mistakes. One of the most dramatic examples comes from the late 1940s, whentechnological advances in incubators for low birthweight babies made it possible tosystematically monitor the amount of oxygen erovided to such infants.Becauserespiratory distress was the highest cause of morbidity and mortality among such infants,it was reasoned that increasing the concentration of oxygen would result inbetter outcomes. Encouraged by anecdotal reports and the compelling logic,hospitals across the country began the practice. Within a short time, incidence of retrolental fibroplasia (which leads to blindness) increased dramatically among such infants.Some suggested that the increased exposure to oxygen was responsible.However, this possibility was initially rejected because it was counter-intuitivethat something as essential as oxygen--particularly in the presence of such high rates of respiratory distress--could be harmful. Eventually, randomized experimentswere conducted and it was conclusively demonstrated that oxygen was the culprit (Gordon, 1954).Such errors are not isolated occurrences. Gilbert, McPeck, and Mosteller (1977)examined all randomized experiments of major surgical and anesthetic innovationsreported in INDEX MEDICUS between 1964 and 1973 (n = 36). Because of the life-threatening nature of the problems being treated, alloftheinnovations were supportedbyagreatdealofprofessionaljudgment,anecdotalevidence,and correlational datapriortoimplementation oftherandomizedexperiment.Nevertheless, the results of the randomized experiments indicated that more than halfof the innovations were actually worse than the standard technique to which they were compared.Eleven percent were equally as good and thus providld an alternativeapproach that might be useful in specific circumstances, while only 33% were actually better.From these examples, it is clear that even though professional judgment is 4L./ 39 valuable,it should not be the sole means of deciding the relative merit of different treatments.Correlationalresearchissometimessuggestedasanotheralternativeto randomized experiments, and many important causal relationships have been established on the basis of such research (e.g., the relationship between cholesterol and heart disease).However, before deciding that correlationship research is preferable to randomized experiments for a given issue, one should consider the tedious exclusion of alternative explanations required to make causal inferences from correlationship data.Unless such work isdone,correlational research can lead to seriously inaccurate conclusions.For example, a study of the correlation between amount of psychotherapy andmeasures of psychological well-being might conclude that psychotherapy is harmful because those patients who receive the most psychotherapy are least healthy. A moreplausible explanation is that those people who only have minor problems progressrelatively quickly and thus receive very little psychotherapy. Only the most severecases receive extended therapy, and those cases are least likely to show dramatic progress.Similar examples abound. Sick people are most often found in hospitals,but not because hospitals cause sickness; and students who receive tutoring generally receivelower grades than untutored students, butnot because the tutoring is detrimental.The problems cited above with using correlational data are obvious, but in manycases, the problems are more subtle. For example, much of the support for the positionthat\"earlierisbetter\"inearlyinterventionprogramscomes fromcorrelational research (e.g., Bricker & Dow, 1980; Casto, 1978; Maisto & German, 1979).However, it may be that the association is due to other factors that covarywith both progress and the age at which intervention begins. Such factors mightinclude the fact that well-educated, highly motivated parents are more likely toidentify problems and seek out intervention earlier; but they are also more likely .13 40to work with the child on their own and provide a more nurturing environment. Thus, additional progress might be made by such children as a result of the extra attentionof more competent parents, rather than the earlier start in an intervention program.Another alternative that is frequently proposed by those who believe thatrandomized experiments are unnecessary is some type of quasi-experimental design inwhich nonrandomized groups of children are compared. In the best of such studies,the researchers attempt to ensure that the groups are comparable on all variablesexcept the variable being investigated, Other through matching the groups on whatare thought to be relevant variables or by some means of statistical adjustment.Although such matching and/or adjustment is theoretically possible, it is extremelydifficult to do in practice.Campbell and Boruch (1975) noted that when usingnonrandomized experiments one must make assumptions that are:Often untenable and even more frequently unverifiable. In addition, amelangeofparameters mst beidentifiedandestimatedbasedoninsufficient theory and data. These two problems inthemselves aresufficiently formidable...to justify eliminating them at the outset, byassuring through randomization that groups are identical to one anotherwith respect to unknown parameters. (p. 208)Problems with using nonrandomized experiments to draw conclusions about theeffects of early intervention have been noted by Dunst and Rheingrover (1981) andSimeonsson et al. (1982). White, Mastropieri, and Casto (1984) gave more detailedexamples in their analysis of the 21 early intervention projects approved by theJoint Dissemination Review Panel for national dissemination. White et al. (1984)concluded that even though such projects have made a substantial contribution to thefield by demonstrating the feasibility of early intervention and by developing anddisseminating curriculum materials and assessment instruments, one could concludelittle about the efficacy of early intervention from these project reports due tothe serious methodological weaknesses.Some people have assumed that clever statistical manipulation could be used to make the same inferences from quasi-experiment designs as one might make on the basisof randomized data. The problems with such approaches have long been recognized and 41repeatedly discussed (Campbell & Boruch, 1975; Fisher,1935; Smith,1957; Wold, 1956), but the thought persists. The dangers of such an approach are nowhere more evident than in the Westinghouse evaluation of Head Start (Cicirelli, 1969), in whichanalysis of covariance was used to correct for nonrandom differences between the comparison groups. As Campbell and Erlebacher (1970) poin4.: 'nit, the adjustments seriously underestimated the effect of Head Start and resulted in indefensible and incorrect conclusions.We already know what works.A frequently advanced argument is that we already havesufficientdatatodemonstrateboththeoveralleffectiveness of early intervention programs and the relative effectiveness of different types of programs.As stated in the foreword to a recent publication by the National Center for ClinicalInfant Programs, \"We've had the demonstration projects. Now how can we take whatwe've learned and get services to all disabled and at-risk children...starting atbirth?\" (NCCIP, n.d., p.2, emphasis in original). Unfortunately, there is very little empirical support for this position. As already shown, the strategies usedto collect much of the early intervention efficacy data for handicapped childrensuffer from methodological weaknesses; thus few conclusions can be drawn. ARE RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTS PRACTICAL?A frequent argument against the use of randomized experiments is that eventhough they would provide useful information, administrators, service providers, andparents would never allow such experiments to be conducted in conjunction with earlyintervention service programs. The alleged opposition to randomization would occurbecause nobody would agree to participate in a study where they knew that some peoplewould be denied services or that some would be receiving les.; effective services. Bothlogicandexperiencesuggestthatthedifficulty of gettingpeopletoparticipate in randomized experiments may be more imagined than real.At the present time, handicapped children are aruitrarily provided with varying dosagesand typesof early intervention based primarily on the biasesofthe 4 5 42administrator or what is popular and/or affordable in that particular area. Somehandicapped preschool children receive home-based intervention, some receive center- basedintervention,and some receive a combination of center- and home-based intervention.S me are given a highly structured teacher-directed curriculum, whileothers are given a more child-directed humanistic curriculum. Some children attend intervention for 5 days a week, others are visited as little as once a month. Thesevariations are not completely explained by thc type and severity of the handicap,the age of the child, or preferences of the parents. In other words, the type of interventionprovided to children isconstantly varied as afunctionofthe experiences, biases, and resources of individual service providers.The situation described above lends itself to the use of randomized experiments.Furthermore, the fact that there are not enough early intervention services to goaround, coupled with the absence of certainty about what type of program is mosteffective, creates a situation in which randomized experiments are a feasible andappropriate way for deciding who gets what.One of the easiest situations for randomized experiments is where there is notenough of the treatment for everybody to participate. Consider the Salk polio- myelitis vaccine trials, in which some children were given the vaccine while otherswere given an inert saline placebo. All children could not be given the vaccinebecause it was impossible to produce enough vaccine during the first year. To havemade the allocation of vaccine on afirst-come,first-serve basis would havediscriminated against less well-educated families, because they would not have been aware of the availability of the vaccine. Thus, creation of randomized experimentaland control groups was not only an example of an equitable allocation of a scarceresource, it also provided definitive information about efficacy of the vaccine.Such examples are not limited to the medical field. In his application to theJoint Dissemination Review Panel for national validation, Hainsworth (n.d.) reported data for a project in which 23 moderately to severely handicapped preschoole.'s were 4 rAlt) 43availableandmettheestablishedcriteriaforaninterventionproject.Unfortunately, the project only had enough resources to serve 12 of the 23 children.Instead of randomly assigning children to experimental and control groups, theproject selected the 12 children with the most severe problems on a criterion-referenced instrument and provided services to those children. Because of problemswith statistical regression, the results of the study are difficult to interpret (seeWhite et al., 1984, p. 22).The rationale for not conducting the randomized experiwnt was that the projectwas obligated to serve the most needy children first. However, since all of thechildren met the established criteria for receiving project services, it is unclearwhy a questionable measure of \"need\" should be used to decide who would receive services.Perhaps those children who scored highest on the test would have benefitedmore than children who scored lowest. Would not random assignment of children to groupsbejustasdefensibleasselectionbasedonthecriterion-referenced instrument?Furthermore, such assignment would have increased the probability ofobtaining defensible information about the effectiveness of the project.The practicability of randomized experiments is also supported by the fact thatthere are a number of examples of such experiments in early intervention research.In the comprehensive analyses of early intervention research referred to earlier,we identified over 80 randomized experiments. As shown in Table 1.4, most of thestudies have been done with disadvantaged children, and a higher percentage havecompared one type of treatment to another type of treatment, as opposed to treatmentversus no treatment comparisons. However,these data offer evidence that suchstudies are possible. In fact, some of those studies 4iich have had the greatestimpact on the field (e.g., the North Carolina Abecedarian Project [Ramey & Haskins,1981]; and the Perry Preschool Project [Weikart et al., 1978]) were randomizedexperiments. 44Table 1.4Number of Studies in Early Intervention InstituteMeta-Analysis Data Set That Used Randomized DesignsDisadvantaged At-risk HandicappedTreatment vs. No 37 or 95 studies 4 of 10 studies 9 of 74 studiesTreatment (38%) (40%) (12%)Treatment A vs.Treatment B25 of 58 studies 4 of C studies 14 of 47 studies(43%) (50%) (30%) Note:Total data set includes information for 23 unique studies. Four studies reported information separately fortwo groupsofchildren (e.g.. handicapped 1.nd disadmmaged). Many studies reported infonnatiwt for bothtreatment versus no treatment. and A versus B cowparisons; so the swn ofthe categories in each columnwill be more than the mtmber ofuniqtw studies. Program administrators often argue that parents will not agree to participatein randomized trials, but this may not be true in many cases. In four studiesconducted at the Utah Early Intervention Research Institute (one treatment versusno-treatmentstudy,andthreecomparisonsofdifferenttypesoftreatment),acceptance rates by parents to the condition of random assignment ranged from 90% to 98% (Mehran & & Lauritzen,1986; Pezzino have been reperted by Ramey (1985)for his Abecedarian and CARE projects, and by Gross (1985) for the Infant Health andDevelopment Project, allof which compare two levels of treatment. Such highacceptance rates suggest that it is practical to conduct randomized experiments. ARE RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTS LEGAL/ETHICAL?Random assignment of children to treatment versus no-treatment groups or tocomparative treatment groups would be unethical in those situations where there isproof that one treatment is superior and suffirient resources for that particulartreatment are generally available in similar circumstances. As discussed below,neither of these conditions is met in most early intervention settings.Khow?edge about what works best. Themostimportant condition isthatunequivocal information is available about what works best. Many people rely onprofessional judgment for making such decisions. However, professional judgment is 45 sometimesincorrect about what isbestinagiven circumstance. The exampledescribed earlier about high concentrations of oxygen for premature low birthweightbabies is one of the most obvious examples, but it is not an isolated occurrence.Consider the following two examples; one from medicine, and pne from early childhood education.Gilbert, Light, and Mosteller (1975) described an expEriment tc determine ifa major contributor to skyrocketing medical costs was the :'act that insurers would only pay for work done in the hospital. It was hypothesized that inpatient services(which were relati/ely more expensive) were being used in instances where outpatientservices would have been just as good, and that substantial savings would resi.ilt ifinsurers would pay for outpatient services in cases where it could be appropriatelysubstituted for inpatient services. An experiment was conducted in which 15,000people were randomly assigned to a group in which the outpatient benefits were addedon a trial basis, or to a group in which the regular program remained in effect.The results were completely contrary to expectations. Medical costs for the group with the added outpatient benefits rose by 16% while those for the group with regular benefits increased by only 3%. Both logic and professiona', judgment were incorrect.There is also evidence in early childhood special education programs that wedo not yet have all the answers about what types of programs are most effective.One specific example from among the many available is given here. Ina studyconducted in Great Britain (Sandow & Clarke, 1978; Sandow, Clarke, Cox, & Stewart,1981), children were divided into matched groups in a quasi-experimental design inwhich the first group received a home-based intervention program with individual visitsat2-weekintervals.Thesecondgroup received asimilar home-based intervention program but subjects were visited only once every 8 weeks, and the thirdgroup received no intervention. It was hypothesized that the more frequently visitedgroup would make the greatest gains. Contrary to expectations, the group visitedleast frequently did the best. 46Standards for what constitutes adequate intervention are generally based on intuition,collective wisdom, and/or clinical judgment,only some of which is correct.Considerthehypotheticalsituationin whichhalf-day,center-basedprograms are provided to 3- to 5-year-old handicapped children, but there are not encvghresourcestoserveallhandicappedchildreninthecatchmentarea.Consequently, services afe provided to those who sign up first and others are puton a waiting list. Unfortunately,the position that a certain minimal level ofservices must be provided (in this case, 5 half-days each week) is seldom based onany sound empirical data. It may be that a 3-day-a-week intervention program or ahome-based program in which visits are made to each family once a week would be just as effective.If the more limited programwab just as effective, additional children could be served. Consequently, some children may he going without services because theservice provider isinsisting on meeting a\"standard\"for which there is insufficient evidence.AvailabiMy of sufficient resources. Whensufficient resources are notavailable to provide early intervention services to all children,programs aretypically pruvicted on either first-come, first-served, or to those children who are \"most in need of help.\" Generally, once the available _lots are filled, no furthereffort is made to identify children in need of service, because it is argued thatit would be unethical to identify the children and not provide them with s rv;ces. Asan example of the problems with this type of an approach, consider ahypothetical situation in a state with virtually no publicly funded interventionprograms for handicapped 0- to 3-year-olds. The state estimates that there are atleast 600 children from 0- to 3-years old with established handicaps in a givercounty who are not receiving services. The state offers to provide enough money todevelop and implement an early intervention program for 100 children. If it can bedemonstrated that the program is effective, the budget will be expanded. From ahistorical perspective, we can predict what would happen. Most people would take 47the money, identify 100 children, collect pretest and posttest data, and on the basisof that data, argue that the program had been effective.Not only is such an approach bad science, but it is no more ethical ,than toidentify 200 children, randomly assign 100 to receive services, and use the other 100 as a control griup. Arguing that such a design would deny services to the 100children in the control group ignores the fact that those same children would havegone unserved using the first approach. In fact, by participating in the randomizedexperiment, control group children actually receive more services since they are regularly given developmental assessments. Serving subjects on a first-come, first- served basis also biases the acquisition of services towards those families who arebetter educated, more active in the community, and better informed. Infact, Campbell(1969)has argued that the random allocation of services isthe mostdemocratic and moral means of allocating scarce resources, since a first-come, first-served policy perpetuates social inequality.The other argument used in allocating scarce resources is that those who are mostin need should receive the resource first. This argument was used in theHainsworth (n.d.) study referred to earlier, in which 23 children were identifiedas meeting the criteria for receiving services. The 12 children who were mostseverely handicapped were selected to receive the services. Such an approach ignoresthe fact that very little is known about what type of children benefit most fromearlyinterventionservices.Perhaps withthisparticularprogram,severelyhandicapped children would make no progress. If that were true, it is difficult toargue that only the sJverely handicapped children shouldbeserved while themoderately handicapped children are left unserved. One way of determining whichchildrenprofitmostfromservicesistoconductrandomizedexperiments.Unfortunately, very little such work has been done. 48CONCLUSIONS ABOUT RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTSThere is still much to learn about the relative benefits of different types ofearly childhood special education services for handicapped children. Becauseprofessional judgment and intuition are sometimes incorrect, it is crucial that we continue to collect data about such issues. Recognizing that many types of data will be useful, researchers and administrators should rely more frequently on the results of randomized experiments. Such experiments can take us beyond common sense knowing; not by replacing it, but by depending and building upon it. Conducting randomized experiments in early intervention is one of the most efficient and feasible ways ofproducing credible and replicable results, and the typical objections to such experiments are frequently without basis. THE DESIGN OF THE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES Based on the results of our analyses of previous early intervention research,and consistent with the requirements of the RFP, a series of longitudinal studieswere designed to investigate the effects and costs of early intervention with handicapped children. This section summarizes the design and organization of those studies.The longitudinal studies conducted by EIRI were designed to: (a) increase theknowledge base concerning the efficacy of early intervention with handicappedchildren in order to improve current service programs, (b) provide information aboutthe costs of various alternative interventions, and (c) demonstrate the feasibilityand utility of conducting experimental longitudinal research in collaboration withtypical service providers. Theoretical/Conceptual Framework The questions to be addressed, the specific research projects 0 be conducted,and the outcome measures selected have been developed in accordance with what is 59Nebraska, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado). Advisory board membersand field reviewers were also sent letters requesting that they contact us about any potentially interested programs. Thus, information about EIRI's desire to talk withsites interested in collaboration was widely disseminated.Each site contacted was provided with a description of EIRI and apprised of thecriteria for inclusion as one of the16longitudinal studies. These criteria included: 1.ability to access to cost information; 5.ability to participate in child assessments on a longitudinal basis; 6.staff interest in the project; and 7.ability to fund any expanded services that were necessary for thecomparison.Discussions were held with representatives of over 70 potential sites in orderto include the 17 for which results are described in this report. Many of theprograms contacted were not able to meet all of the above criteria. For someprograms, current services were either very comprehensive, or the funding necessaryto implement an expanded services program was not available. Other programs hadsufficient funding, but did not have an adequate number of children for a largelongitudinalstudy;other programs found that random assignment would notbefeasible or desirable for their population. Those programs which looked promisingwerevisitedbyanEIRIstaff member. Sitevisitsprovided staff with theopportunitytoseetheprogramsinactionandtotalkwithprogramstaff.Information which was difficult to obtain over the phone thus became available asthe result of these visits. Thirty-seven sites were visited in order to securecooperation from the 17 sites eventually included. 60As a result of these site visits, programs were selected for consideration as one of the longitudinal studies. The studies eventually included and representeda wide range of populations and comparisons, all of which are consistent with the requirements of the RFP. The selection of sites was necessarily restricted by the requirements of the RFP and the inability to provide funding for the services necessary to the experimental services being proposed. For example, many more sites could have been identified to conduct age-at-start studies if funding would havebeen available through the contract to begin serving some of the very young childrenin a state where such children were currently not receiving services. In other cases, interested programs were serving too few children, or were unwilling to meet the criteria for random assignment. CRITERIA FOR SELECTING SITESDuring the visits to programs as well as during telephone contacts, informationwas gathered about a number of factors relevant to conducting a research study at the site.Random assiament. Afrequentlyencounteredobjectiontoapossible collaborative relationship was the program's willingness to randomly assign childrento alternative intervention programs. In some cases,it was due to the facts thatprograms were mandated to serve all children who were identified and that the level of service was already comprehensive. In other cases, program staff had difficultywith the concept of random assignment and so were not interested in participatingfnr this reason. Thus, random assignment was a relevant criterion for initial interest and collaboration.Treatment differences. Many programs which were contacted by the Institute had spec,ficideasforresearchtobeconducted.However,insomecases,thedifferences between the proposed alternative interventions were relatively minimal.Whenever possible, EIRI staff discussed the possibility of substantially increasingthe differences between treacment groups. For example,in the SMA/Lake McHenry L-74 1 61Program, the original proposal was to compare once-per-week services to twice-per-week services. However, EIRI staff felt that this difference between the groupswould not be sufficient to justify conducting the research. Thus, EIRI staff workedwith the SMA/Lake McHenry Program to develop a research design in which treatmentdifferences were increased to once-per-week services versus three-times-per-week services.Incases where programs could not realistically provide agreaterdifference between the treatment groups, they were placed as a lower priority for inclusion.Appropriateness of treatment. EIRIstaff reviewed each program using a checklist to determine if the treatment currently being provided, as well as the added services to be provided, were generally consistent with \"best practices.\" Thechecklist used was based on the materials used by the Technical Assistance andDevelopment System (TADS) for conducting needs assessments with HCEEP programs.Only programs which showed evidence that the treatment being provided was wellaccepted for the population being served were considered for inclusionin the Longitudinal Studies. A decision about appropriateness, however, did not relate tothe specific theoretical orientation of the program. That is, regardless of the particular theoretical approach to treatment implementation, programs which providedsupport for the suitability of a particular approach were seen as acceptable. Cost comparisons. A primary goal of this research was to examine not only theeffects, but also the costs of any particular program being implemented. Therefore,it was necessary to evaluate each project on the basis of the difference in costsfor the alternative programs. In many cases, an interesting comparison may notreveal substantial difference in costs: in some cases, a comparison was includedeven though there were not substantial cost differences. However, other thingsbeing equal, every effort was made to select programs in which cost comparisons weremaximized. II'I 1I fi 62Ability to participate in longitudinal research. Due to the longitudinalnature of the studies to be conducted, the ability of programs to provide access to child data after the child left the program was ,:...xplored. In most cases, unless the child was to continue to be served by the same service program, specific procedureswere not in place to follow children after leaving the early intervention program.Thus this criteria primarily provided a way of identifying the programs in whichthis would be facilitated versus those in which extensive efforts would be necessaryto track children after leaving the program.Population characteristics. The populations of the studies were selected to be consistent with the requirements of the RFP. Within a particular study, however,an attempt was made to maximize the homogeneity of the population to the greatestextent possible. Thus,it was necessary to review each program for the type ofchildren being served, including disability, severity of disability, and age, aswell as the number of children available. Whenit was not possible to have ahomogeneous group for one characteristic, for example disability type, it was seenas necessary to maximize the homogeneity of other characteristics such as the agerange of the subjects or their severity of disability.Liaison strength. For each of the potential studies, the strength of thepersonnel at the site was assessed. This involved the research background of thestaff, their familiarity with service provision, their understanding and knowledgeof assessment, and, most importantly, their willingness and ability to work with EIRI staff.The criteria for liaison strength was primarily influenced by this lastcharacteristic. Also, programs in which staff did have research backgrounds wereseen as being more appropriate than those in which staff did not.Funding configuration. Due to the prohibition against using project funds tosupporttheprovisionofinterventionservices,it was necessary to identifyprograms which could provide or obtain the funding for additional services. While inmanycasesobtainingadditionalfundingthroughgrantproposalswasa 63possibility, there was always an element of uncertainty in this approach. Thus,sites in which service money was already available for providing added services wererated more highly than those in which grant money would have to be applied for later.Costs/difficulty to hmolement. A number of logistical issues about actuallyimplementing the research were considered for each potential site. While this could not be the primary criterion for site selection, it was an important part of the finaldecision.Thesepracticalaspectsincludedboththedifficultyof implementingthe research as well asthe difficulty the agency might have in implementing additional services necessary for the research. It was also necessaryto consider the amount of EIRI staff time necessary for implementing the project, thecostoftraveltothesite,theneedfor trainingsitepersonnel,thefeasibility and ease of verifying treatment implementation, the predicted subject mortality,and the number of service providers which would be involvedinthe particular study.With regard to a service perspective, the availability of site personnel, the potentialintegrity of the limited treatment group to access services, and the support from site administrators was evaluated. Administrative support was seen asbeing an essential component for inclusion in the Longitudinal Studies.Based on the criteria referred to above, 16 sites were initiated in the Fall of 1986.As noted in the previous section, there were some adjustments over thecourse of the first five years of the study as some projects dropped out or wereeliminated and others were added. The 17 studies reported in this volume are thosefor which enough outcome data were collected to be considered as a part of thecompletion of the contract with the federal government. 64Common Elements of Each Study Even though the studies were being done in geographically diverse sites with variedpopulationsandinterventionapproaches,eachprojectadheredtothe followingdesignfeaturescredibility of conclusions.toensuretheintegrityoftheresearchandthe RANDOM ASSIGNMENT TO GROUPSAs noted previous'y in this report, many early childhood special educators havequestioned the feasibility and/or ethics of randomized experiments. However, as wasargued earlier in this report, properly designed studies are neither infeasible nor unethical.Furthermore, eve,lthough randomization does not guar:A:tee a \"good\" study,it is one of the best methods for reducing the probability of many of themost obvious alternative explanations for observed effects.Each of the Longitudinal Studies of the Effects and Costs of Early Interventionwith Handicapped Childral compared two alternative forms of early intervention byrandomly assigning children who met pre-specified criteria to one of the two groups.In each study, parents' informed consent to participate in the study was obtainedprior to random assignment. Random assignment was done by researchers at EIRI so that:Each child had an equal chance of being assigned to any of the groupswithin that study.Service providers or parents could not influence the decision aboutthe group to which a particular child was assigned.In each study, stratification techniques were used prior to randomization inorder to increase the statistical power of the design and to reduce the probabilityof random fluctuation resulting inlarge pre-treatment differences between thegroups on thelriables most relevant to the outcomes being measured.Specific procedures for random assignment varied from project to project,depending on whether: 65 All of the subjects in a particular cohort (at least 20 subjects) wereavailable for group assignment at the same time; orSubjects became available for assignment to one of the alternativetreatment conditions as they were identified over an extended periodof time (usually less than 5 subjects per month).Procedures for each of these two categories (one-time assignment versus ongoingassignment) are described below.Studies with one-time assignment. Any study which had at least 30 children whocould be assigned to alternative treatment groups at one time was included in this category.Those studies included: a.Jordan Intensityb.Arkansas '85f.Utah Involvement '86g.New York Association for Children with Down Syndromeh.Arkansas Hearing Impairedi.PITCHIn each of these studies, the available population was stratified on two variableswhich seemed particularly relevant to the outcome of the study. For example, in the Des Moines study, children were stratified by teacher ratings of high vs. low parentmotivation as the one factor, and chronological age in months (27 to 42 vs. 43 to 54 vs. over 54) as the other factor. A maximum of six cells was created by the twovariables selected for stratification (in other words, it was always a 2 x 2 or 2 x 3 stratification).The specific variables used for stratification in each ofthe studies aredescribed later in this report. Within each cell of the stratification, availablechildren were rank ordered on a variable such as chrono'ogical age in months orpretest scores on a measure of child functioning. The children within each cellwere then randomly assigned to one of the groups by taking the first pair ofchildren in the rank ordering and flipping a coin to determine whether the firstchild should be assigned to Group A or B. The remaining child in that pair was assigned to the opposite group. Additional children within the same cell were then 66alternately assigned to one of the two groups in the same way. When all children in the firs''' cell were assigned, children in the second cell were considered. Usingthe same procedure, a coin was again flipped for the first pair, which determinedthe order of assignment for every other pair within the cell. This procedure was continued for every cell.Studies with ongoing assignment. A number of the studies enrolled children in theintervention program over an extended period of time as new children were identified.These studies included: a.New Orleans IVHb.New Orleans Visually Impairedc.SMA/Lake-McHenryd.Bellevillee.Salt Lake City IVHf.Wabash and Ohiog.South Carolina IVHh.ColumbusIn each of these studies, two variables were selected which were thought to be correlated with anticipated outcomes. For each study, the identified variables wereused to create a 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 matrix (i.e., either 4 or six cells, respectively).As subjects were identified, it was noted where they fit with respect to the cellsof this matrix. For subjects in each cell of a two-group comparison, there werefour possible sequences of assignment where \"A\" indicated one of the two groups and\"B\" indicated the other group.Sequence BAABFor subjects in each cell of a three-group comparison, there were six possiblesequences of assignment, where \"A\" indicated one of the three groups, \"B\" indicateda second, and \"C\" ACBACB 67When the child was identified for assignment to groups, it was determinedwhether the child was the first child to be enrolled in the project from that cell.If so, a die was cast (with either four or six numbers, depending on whether it wasa two-group or a three-group comparison, respectively) to determine the assignmentsequence to be used for the first group of children in that cell. For the nextgroup of four (or six) children identified as belonging to that cell, the die wascast again to determine the sequence for that group of children. This process wasrepeated for each cell of the matrix as the first child in that cell was identified. IMPARTIAL DATA COLLECTIONIt is well documented in the social sciences that people tend to see what theyexpect to see (e.g., Foster, Ysseldyke, & Reese, 1975; Rosenthal, 1976). A majorproblem with past early intervention efficacy research was the tendency to use datacollectorswhonotonly knew which childrenwerereceivingtheexperimentaltreatment, but also had a vested interest in the outcome. In the meta-analysisrepurted by White and Casto (1985), only 21% of the effect sizes came from studiesutilizing \"blind\" data collectors. The failure to use impartial data collectors isa major design flaw, especially in light of a substantial body of research (e.g.,Gould, 1983) which suggests that expectations, even when they are subconscious, can bea powerfulinfluence on how data are collected and interpreted. All of thestudies conducted by this project used data collectors who were uninformed orunaware of the purpose of the experiment and the group membership of the subjects.This relatively simple procedure eliminated an important threat to the internalvalidity of the research studies to be conducted. C 68ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF EAR Y INTERVENTION ON- IIvSome of the most difficult issues to satisfactorily resolve in conducting longitudinalresearchontheeffectsandcostsofearlyinterventionwith handicapped children are the questions sur!'ounding instrumentation: What data to collect?When to collect those data? How to ensure that the data are collected satisfactorily? However,the wayinwhichthestudies are designed and theselection of the specific studies to be conducted are also important; these issues have well-developed and widely-agreed-upon strategies, techniques, and conceptual frameworks which can guide decisions. In the area of instrumentation for earlychildhood special education, however, the one thing which is abundantly clear is that the state-of-the-art intermsof assessing child change attributable to intervention is inadequately developed, and totally satisfactory instruments are not available.With regard to measuring the impact of early intervention on families,the field is even less well developed.In recent years, there has been a growing awareness that efforts to evaluatethe efficacy of early intervention programs have often been too narrowly focused(Ramey et al., 1982; Simeonsson ef al., 1982; Zigler & Balla, 1982). As indicated by our previous review of the literature, past early intervention efficacy researchhas been too focused on easily available, psychometrically sound instruments suchas measures of IQ, and has largely ignored other areas of child functioning such associal-emotional growth and adaptive behavior, as well asindicators of family functioning.Because resources for evaluation are always limited,it was impossible to collect all of the data that might have been of interest. However, it was crucial topaymoreattentiontoareassuchassocial-emotional growthandfamily functioning.The studies conducted as part of this project selected measures basedon two sources of information: (1) what would be predicted by the theoretical/ conceptualframeworkunderlyingtheLongitudinalStudiesandtheparticular (\") 69 0intervention program, and (2) which areas have other investigators identified asimportant with similar types of interventions.Information such as IQ, motor functioning, and language functioning were, of course,collected.However,additionalinformationsuchas motherandchild interaction, paren...al attitudes toward their child with a disability, child successin school as indicated by special education class placement and grade retention, andperceived stress as reported by the parents was also collected. In each case, thespecific goals and activities of the interention program was the primary source ofinformation in selecting assessment instruments.A limited number of instruments were used across all projects. For example, theBattelleDevelopmentalInventory,theParentingStressIndex,theFamily Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales, the Family Resource Scale, the FamilyIndex of Life Events and Changes, and the Family Support Scale were used in allprojects(see Mott el al.,1986,foradiscussion of why these measures were selected).Other parts of the assessment battery, however, were individuallytailored to the particular population being served and the type of interventionprogram implemented in each of the research sites.EIRI staff engaged in a number of activities throughout the course of theproject to identify the most appropriate measures to use in the studies. Theseactivities included literature reviews, solicitation of input from experts in thefieldofearlychildhoodas,Issment,andcollectionofdataonpromising instruments.PretestingPretests were conducted at each site using the Battelle Developmental Inventory (Newborg, Stock, Wnek, Guidubaldi, & Svinicki, 1984), Parenting Stress Index (Abidin,1986), Family Resource Scale (Dunst & Leet, 1985), Family Support Scale (Dunst,Jenkins, & Trivette, 1984), Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACESIII) (Olson, Portner, & Lavee, 1985), and Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes 70(FILE) (McCubbin, Patterson, & Wilson, 1983). Each of these measures was selectedto assess a different aspect of child and/or family functioning as follows:Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI). TheBOIisastandardized,individually administered assessment battery of key developmental skillsin the following areas: Personal/Social, Adaptive, Motor (Fine and Gross),Communication (Expressive and Receptive), and Cognitive abilities. Thismeasure was selected as a core child outcome measure due to the broad spanof abilities tapped, a wide age range (birth through age 8), adaptationsfor handicapped children, and good psychometric characteristics.Parenting Stress Index !PSI).The PSI was used to measure reportsofstressinthe parent-child system. Child-related factors includeAdaptability, Acceptability, Demandingness, Mood,Distractibility/Hyperactivity,'and Reinforces parent. Factors related to others includeDepression, Attachment, Restriction of Role, Sense of Competence, SocialIsolation, Relationship to Spouse, and Parent Health.Family Resource Scale (FRS). This scale was used to measure the extentto which different types of resources are adequate in households with youngchildren.Factors include General Resources, Time Availability, PhysicalResources, and External Support.Family Support Scale (FSS).This scale was used to assess the availabilityof sources of support, as well as the degree to which different sourcesof support have been helpful to families rearing young children.Family Adaptation and Cohesion Evaluation Scales \"FACES III). This scalewas used to provide a general picture of family functioning by assessingthe family's level of adaptability and cohesion. The scale also has aperceived as well as an ideal form which provides an indication of theextent to which current family functioning is consistent with the family'sexpectations for ideal family functioning.Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE). This scale was usedto assess life events and changes experienced by a family unit during thepast 12 months. The specific areas of potential strain covered by thescale include:Intra-family, Marital, Pregnancy and Childbearing, Financeand Business, Work-Family Transitions, and Family \"Care,\" Losses,Transitions \"In and Out,\" and Legal.Measures administration. The BDI administration time ranged, depending uponthe age of the child, from one to two hours. The full battery of family measures,including collection of demographic data, required between one and two hours forparents who read at the fifth grade level or higher. Parents who had poor readingskills, or those with special characteristics (e.g., mental retardation), requiredmore time because the measures were administered in an interview format. Less than 715% of the parents required an interview format for the administration of the family measurer.In general, families were cooperative in completing the pretest battery, whichis quite positive given the fact that for some parents it required as long as four hours.Diagnosticians, assessment supervisors, 1tnd program staff who observed theassessment process attributed much of this positive response to the availability ofa nominal monetary incentive for parents.The use of the BDI was more difficult than expected, due to the need to traindiagnosticians on this newly developed test. Inusingthe BDI,it wasalsodiscovered that the DQ scores which can be derived from the tables in the manual forchildren scoring below 65 were quite misleading--often resulting in DQs inthe negative range. Consequently, any measures of DQ reported in this volume are basedon scores computed using the ratio of Age Equivalents to Chronological Age.Management of pretesting. The management of pretest data collection wasaccomplished through the use of assessment supervisors and diagnosticians hired ateach site.The responsibilities of the assessment coordinators included: 1.Familiarization with of the BDI. 2.Training and monitoring of diagnosticians. 3.Scheduling of testing. 4.Checking of data and transmitting completed protocols to the EIRI sitecoordinator. 5.Reporting of test results to parents who requested them.Diagnosticians at each site were responsible for administration of the BDI andthe family measures. Formal procedures for training, certifying, and monitoring thework of diagnosticians was done to ensure high-quality results. Recruitment, Training, and Monitoring of DiagnosticiansGiventhewidelyscatteredgeographiclocationofparticipating sites,procedures were needed for recruitment, training, and monitoring of diagnosticians 72in order to ensure the quality of outcome data. Without such procedures, itispossiblethatdataofquestionablevalidity could havebeencollected--thusjeopardizing all of the work of the longitudinal rt.,earch. The following sectionsoutline the procedures for recruiting, training, and monitoring the diagnosticianswho administered the outcome measures.The assessment supervisor hired at each site was instrumental in identifyingcandidates for diagnostician positions. Diagncsticians were recruited who had atleast a bachelor's degree and some work towards a Masters, with course work andexperience in individualized testing. Professionals with additional experience inworking with children with disabilities and/or children under five years of agereceived primary consideration. Training.Training of the diagnosticians and the assessment supervisors wasdivided into three subsections: individualized pretraining, group training, andcertification of performance. Individualized pretraining materials were mailed tothe assessment supervisor approximately one month prior to the EIRI-conducted grouptraining session. Each participant was required to study the Battelle Examiner'smanual and review the separate domain manuals. An introductory videotape depictingan overview of the purposes, organization, and administration techniques for theBattelle was also provided. Subsequent videotapes provided detailed informationregarding preparation procedures for test administration and the administration ofthe Personal/Social Domain. Actual administration of items from the Battelle wasdepicted on the videotape, including examples of scoring for selected items.After viewing the videotapes, written exercises were completed by the trainee.Due to the complexity of the scoring procedures for the BIM, pretraining activitieswere designed to provide the trainees with an opportunity to become acquainted withthe process.A detailed handout clarified the scoring procedures and specific rulesto be followed for EIRI research. A completed sample scoring booklet was provided,demonstrating the calculation of raw scores, age equivalents, 'd standard scores. Cf; 73The trainees were then directed to complete two of the five versions of the practicescoring booklets, calculating subdomain and domain raw scores as well as standard scores and age equivalents. Finally, a self-administered test was given so that the traineecouldassessthedegreetowhichhe/shehadmasteredstandardized administration andscoringprocedures,test organization, andtestcontent.Trainees were encouraged to do further study prior to the group training in areaswhere they did not do well. The assessment supervisor at each site was responsiblefor makingsurethat trainees completed allofthe training materials beforeparticipating in the group training. The assessment supervisor also completed thepretraining activities if he/she had not done so at a previous time. Group training was conducted by an EIRI staff member in 11/2 days at the research site.Given the need to ensure accuracy in testing, a great deal of modeling,simulated practice, and immediate feedback on performance was deemed necessary forthe training to be successful. Therefore, the focus was on intensive, personalizedtraining instead of using instructional videotapes. All diagnostician candidatesand the assessment supervisors were required to attend the group training session. Thegrouptrainingsessionbegan withabrief overview of the BattelleDevelopmental Inventory, including the rationale for selecting it as the core measure ofchild functioning, theimport.ofadheringtostandardprocedures,andconcurrent validity findings. More sophisticated scoring procedures were reviewed,such as the use of extreme scores. Common mistakes and suggestions for preventingscoring errors were provided. The majority of the training session focused on thefive domains of theBattelle.Domain-specific administration proc..lures wereemphasized by the trainer. Guided practice of actual item administration was doneby dividing the participants into pairs. After practicing selected items, a groupdemonstration and feedback on performance was given. The trainees were also askedto determine item scores based on the observed performance. Finally, adaptationsfor various disabilities were discussed. 74 Following this practice, a 40-minute videotape portrayed the administration of certain items. The purpose of this exercise was to evaluate the trainee's ability to discriminate correct from incorrect administration and scoring procedures. During tnis administration, the diagnostician on the videotape did most things correctly, liuis committed a number of mistakes ranging in seriousness from minor to very major. A completed protocol accompanied this videotape, and trainees were asked to identify mistakes in administration or scoring made during the administration.A group administered mastery paper and pencil test was administered at the conclusion of the Battelle training. This was a \"closed book\" tct, containing itemsthat required the trainees to recall pertinent factual information as well as apply the learned information. Ninety percent accuracy was required on this test beforethe trainee could be certified as an EIRI diagnostician.In most cases, the diagnosticians who attended the Battelle testing session alsoadministered the family measures. Though the diagnosticians did not score the measures or study the parent's responses, they needed to be familiar with the surveysin order to check the forms for completion and answer any questions that the parents had.Therefore, an overview of the administration procedures for the family measureswas also provided at the group training session.Following the group training session, each trainee completed three BDI practice administrations. At least one of the three practice tests had to be administeredto a child with a handicapping condition/developmental delay similar to those ofsubjectsinthestudy with whom the diagnostician was working.Thefirstadministration was done independently, and the completed protocol given to the assessment superviscr. Each trainee was then observed by the assessment supervisor,administering either a second full BDI or selected items appropriate for the child'sdevelopmental level. Tre assessment supervisor evaluated the trainee's adherenceto standard administration procedures and scoring rules. Constructive feedback concerning the trainee's errors was given and strengths that the trainee demonstrates f'\" 75 were reinforced. Eighty to 100% accuracy was required before the trainee could be certified as an EIRI tester. This demonstration had to be repeated if the criterion was not met.The third performance exercise required that the trainee be videotapedduring the administration of a complete Battelle. This videotaped administration, accompaniedbythecorresponding protocol,wassenttotheEIRIassessment coordinator and was shadow scored, and interreliability was calculated. Agreement for scoring had to be equal to at least 80% in order for the trainee to be certifiedas an EIRI diagnostician. Administration errors had to be minimal. Trainees who successfullycompletedthetrainingprocessalsohadtosignapromiseofconfidentiality prior to testing for EIRI.Monitoring.To maintain accuracy in test administration, the diagnosticians weremonitoredcloselybytheassessmentsupervisor.Tenpercentofeachdiagnostician's Battelle administrations were observed and shadow scured by theassessment supervisor or fellow diagnosticians and had to result in at least 80%agreement and accuracy. Agreement between the EIRI assessment coordinator and thediagnosticians on these videotapes ranged from 80% to 96%, with a mean of 89%.Diagnosticians who tested for a research site for several years had to submit a videotapeofanadministration totheEIRIassessmentcoordinatoryearly, demonstrating thatthetester wasnotdrifting fromstandard administration procedures. PosnestingThe core battery administered at pretest was admir'stered again at posttest.In addition, an average of three complementary measures were administeredin each projcct. The complementary measures were selected to reflect specificdifferences expected in part'cular questions under investigation. An attempt wasalso made to administer the same complementary measures in studies which deal withsimilar populations of children. For example, an effort was made to use similarmeasures in each of the three studies of children with IVH. 76The specific complementary measures used in each study are described more fullyin the reports of the individual studies later in this volume. A number of the instrumentsc.' procedures used as complementary measures were developed by EIRI institute staff in areas where existing measures were inadequate. For example, there is no existing instrument for assessing the motor functioning of young childrenwhich will provide a detailed assessment of motor functioning in children from birth to age three.Existing instruments are either too narrow in age range, have poorpsychometric properties, or require a great deal of clinical judgment of trainedphysical therapists to administer. Two such instruments require some explanation.Videotaped assessment of motor functfoning. Due to the emphasis on motordevelopment with subjects involved in the IVH studies, assessment procedures thatwere sensitive to changes in motor behavior were needed. Standardized instruments suchasthePeabody Motor Scales provide normativeinformationbasedonthe achievement of developmental motor milestones. However, physical and occupationaltherapists focus intervention on enhancing patterns of movement which are thecomponents ofthese milestones. Although attempts have been made todevelopstandardized measures of early movement patterns, no tool was available at the timethese studies were being conducted. To address this need, a videotaped sequence ofmovement patterns was developed. The standardized sequence is designed to analyzemotor behaviors seen in children functioning up to a 12- to 15-month level.At 12 months adjusted age, all subjects involved in the IVH research studieswere videotaped completing this sequence. Scoring procedures to analyze treatmentdifferences between the early versus late groups as well as to determine individualsubject changes were developed by EIRI staff. Motor therapists with experience inneurodevelopmental treatment who were naive tothe research design scoredthe videotapes.Videotaped assessment ofparent-child interaction. Awareness of the importance of parent-child interaction had substantial influence on assessment and intervention PM 77 practices at the time these studies were initiated. A number of EIRI studies thathad a major parental involvement component in their treatment groups were involvedin assessing parent-child interaction. In order to evaluate the effects of the parent involvement treatment, a standardized procedure for videotaping was developedwhich was based on a specific sequence of structured and free play activities with a fixed set of materials. Researchers who had developed validated coding systemswere hired as consultants to analyze the videotaped interactions (these included Gerald Mahoney, Kofi Marfo, and Dale Farran). There were several benefits in usinga variety of coding systems in this manner. The primary purpose was to assess agreater variety of effects due to the intervention. Differences in maternal and childlinguisticspeech/communication patterns,andmaternalbehavior(i.e., directiveness, responsiveness, encouragement, method of control) are all factors thatcould be studied only by using several different approaches. By comparing severalsystems to each other, it was hoped that information would result that would assistpractitioners in selecting a system best suited to their needs and their population. In addition, valuable concurrent validity information resulted from using the various systems.Management of posttesting. Thecollectionofposttestdatawasalsoaccomplished by on-site assessment supervisors and diagnosticians. Additional timewas required during posttesting in order to accommodate the large number of measures.Most posttest sessions required at least two, two-hour sessions for complete data collection.Parents were paid an additional incentive for participating in more thanone posttest session. 78PROCEDURES TO VERIFY THAT THE INTENDEDTREATMENT WAS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTEDMost reports of the past early intervention efficacy research have failed to explain whether procedures were used to determine the extent to which the intended treatment was actually implemented and how it was experienced by participants. For example, for programs which intended to use parents as intervenors ir their child's program, very few report whether parents became involved to the degree intended by the program designer, whether they understood what was expected of them, or whether they carried out the intervention consistently and appropriately. Unless such information is obtained, there is a real danger that comparisons will be made between programs that were intended to be different but that in fact were not. The failure toverifythatintendedtreatmentswereactuallyimplementedmaybepartly responsible for the lack of significant findings in those early intervention studies which compared high and low levels of parental involvement (Casto & Lewis, 1984). To address the problems of interpretation and the resulting ambiguities when there is little or no evidence regarding the fidelity of treatment procedures, each of the longitudinal Studies usedboth self-evaluation procedures and external monitoringtodocumentthe degreeto whichintended treatments were actually implemented.These procedures were tailored to the individual studies but generallyinvolved site visits by staff members external to that particular project who usedchecklists, questionnaires, and rating forms to document the delivery of services.Additional information was collected using attendance data, teacher logs, parentquestionnaires, and telephone monitoring.Treatment verification procedures serve four purposes inthe longitudinal research: 1.Independent and empirical confirmation that treatment was implementedas intended, and, where departures from the original plan occurreu,technical ass'stance was provided; 2.The nature of data collection for the treatment verification processservesasastimulusforself-improvement andconsistentimplementation; 79 3.A comprehensive description of research conditions allowed betterunderstanding and generalizability of results; and 4.Data collected were used to document which subjects participated moreextensively so that this could be accounted for in the data analysis. Rationale for the Veriflcaflon ProcessA major failing of many educational evaluations is that little or no attempt is made to describe and measure the services provided (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Shaver, 1979). Often,researchers seem to regard experimental treatments as constants that are alwaysimplemented exactly as intended and do not vary from classroom to classroom or program to program. In studies of varied treatments, neglecting to determine degreeof implementation can lead to erroneous conclusions (Cooke & Poole, 1982). Theseerroneousconclusionsoftenhaveseriousconsequencesforpolicy decisions.For example,in the Westinghouse study of Head Start (Westinghouse Learning Corporation, 1969),thelack of any information about which classroompractices were employed and how the variation in these practices affected outcomeseverely hampered the validity of the conclusions. Nevertheless, the results of thisstudy,whichshowednoeffectofintervention,nearlyledtothediscontinuation of the Head Start program by Congress. Inasimilar quasi- experimental evaluation, the Abt Follo%, Through study (Stebbins, St. Pierre, Proper,Anderson, & Cervaj, 1977), the only non-controversial finding was that the variationwithin models exceeded the variation among models (House, Glass, McLean, & Walker, 1978).This finding, initself,is justification for including information onimplementation so that results like this can be better explained. Indeed,ina complementary study, the Stanford Research Institute did measure the degree to whichthe varicus models were implemented and provided a more complete and fair evaluationthan would have been possible without such data (Stallings, 1975).A statewide study of compensatory preschool in South Carolina, conducted by theEarly Intervention Research Institute (Barnett, Frede, Mobasher, & Mohr,1988), 80 illustrates how information on treatment implementation can completely alter the conclusions of a study. In this study, children in 14 classrooms were compared to a waiting list control group to determine the effects of a compensatory preschool program.The original analysis, which included all of the classrooms in the study, found no statistically significant preschool effect. However, when the treatment implementation data were analyzed, it was discovered that the two classrooms that had not implemented the program at even a minimal level were also the two classrooms thathadanegative effect on the posttestscoreofthepreschoolgroupin comparison to the control group. The abnormally low implementation score of these two classrooms justified excluding them from the second analysis, which resulted in a significant preschool effect. Without data on treatment implementation, theconclusion would have been drawn that the program was not effective, but the\"program\" would have inappropriately included classrooms that did not implement treatment to even a minimal degree. InanotherstudyconductedbyEIRI(Mehran&White,1988),treatment verification data were gathered to determine the degree to which individual parentsparticipated in a home-based parent tutoring program designed to enhance the readingskills of Chapter I-eligible kindergarten-aged children. It was found that when allchildren from this randomized experimental/control group study were included in theanalysis, there were immediate but no long-term effects. When the analyses werelilited to include only those children for whom the program had been implementedwell, there were also substantial and statistically significant long-term benefits.The conclusion that the program was effective, but only for those that participatedfully, would have been missed if it had not been for the treatment verification data. ProceduresIn the treatment verification procedures for the Longitudinal Studies, EIRIstaff used multiple data sources to cross validate treatment implementation data 81 sources.These triangulation procedures (Denzin, 1978; Mercer, 1979) required thatdata from one source be verified or confirmed by data from other sources. In thecase of treatment implementation, self-report data collected from interventionpersonnel were compared to data collected through direct observation and records.Data were collected on three entities:The ChildThe FamilyThe ProgramA core set of treatment verification instruments were used across all of thesites, while a number of other site-specific measures were used in certain sites.For example,in the Arkansas Hearing Impaired study, where the effects of a totalcommunication approach were compared to an oral communication approach with younghearing-impaired children, the opinions of the teachers on the effectiveness of thecontrasting approaches were collected through a questionnaire, and information wascollected from parents about which communication mode was most frequently used withthe child at home. At the New Orleans ARC site, which contrasted basic groupeducational activities with individualized programming, periodic videotaping oftreatment implementation and direct observation using ecobehavioral techniques wereused to ensure that the alternative interventions occurred as expected. Data on the ChildData onindividualchildren were collected inthe treatment verificationprocess in order to provide more specific information on each child to help explainvariationsinthe efficacy of treatment on different children, to document howtreatment varied from child tochild,and to ensure that individualchildrenreceived the treatment as it was intended, and, if not,to ameliorate the problemwhen possible.Individual Education Plans wert, examined at each site as a partial measure of program quality and to provide more detailed information about the child and his/herneeds which could later be helpful in analyzing data. For example, in one study, 82 achild fromtheexperimental group scoredabnormally low on the posttest. On checking it wasdiscoveredthat the analyses, since they obviouslydid notreceive thefull treatment. For example, in oneproject, first a usefulexplanatoryvariable inthis particular site. A relatedmeasureof treatment was gathered through a parentquestionnaire. The Typesof ServicesChild HasReceived outside of werecollected an interview.Such servicesmight have included therapy othercommunity-based programs, orparental activities in the homeindependent ofthe intervention. This information helped to ensurethat theintendedinterventionactivities on the FamilyIn order to ensure that differences between experimental and control groupswere actually due totreatment variation and not characteristics of the homeenvironment, the Family Demographic Questionnaire was given to each family prior tointervention with the child and at each annual posttest session. This questionnaireincluded questions on family pattern, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and ageof parents or primary caregivers. Information was also gathered to assist in locating families who moved out of the immediate area.The home environment plays a crucial role in the progress yeung children withdisabilities can make. To partially capture how involved in the studies' parentsbecame with their child's education, primary intervenors completed the Quality ofParent Involvement form to indicate the degree to which families had become actively involvedintheinterventionprocess.Ona scale ofhigh,medium,andlow, intervenorsratedtheparents'levelofattendanceatgroupmeetingsandconferences; their knowledge of their child's condition and their rights; and theirparticipation insupportiveactivities,suchasschoolprojects,educational activities at home, and volunteer activities. This form was completed at the timeother posttest data were collected.To corroborate the intervenor's measure of family engagement, parents suppliedinformation on the amount of time they spent in intervention-related activities at home.Parents also completed the Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) at thetime of each posttest to express their opinions about specific aspects of theirchild's program, including:the teacher, the communication between program and home,thegoalsandactivitiesoftheprogram,opportunities forparentalparticipation, therangeofservicesavailable,andtheirchild'sprogress. Analysis of the PSQ data demonstrated little variation in response ec!.oss treatmentsand sites.This is not surprising, since parents tend to like what they have. \"tlp 84 Data on The Program.The Supervisor Ratings of Quality of Staff Services was completed at least once per year.The evaluation assessed teachers' proficiency and skills and provided them with feedback. Those sites which did not have a teacher evaluation system inplace used one of the evaluation forms provided by EIRI. One form providedevaluation criteria forseveralareasconsidered fundamental tomostcurrent teachingpracticessuchasassessment,IEPdevelopment,IEPimplementation, presentation of instruction, and instructional environment. The other form wasdesigned to provide a gross measure of the quality of the work effort of the teacher.Thedataobtainedfromthisform werebasedonthesupervisors' perceptionsofteachers'skills,problem-solving, workhabits,relationships, communication, and attitudes.In addition, Qualitative Ratings of Direct Intervenors was completed annuallyby the early interventionists' respective direct supervisors. These data weredesigned to provide information on how service providers compared to a larger peergroup of persons in the same or similar positions. These type of data also addedto our ability to describe the type of treatment environment which was prevalentduring each study. These data were not used by supervisors to evaluate or providefeedback to staff, rather they were used only for data analyses and descriptive purposes.EIRI Staff Visits and EIRI Staff Telephone Contacts were used for both ongoingtechnical assistance and informal treatment verification. Site visits by EIRI staff occurred at least twice per year; phone contacts were made weekly. Topics discussed included:random assignment of children, child assessment, curricularissues,management issues, and field testing of new methods.In most sites, formal onsite evaluations, often including professionals notpreviously associated with EIRI, were conducted annually to collect informationabout the nature and quality of the early intervention programs collaborating on 85 research studies with EIRI. The site review procedures were designed to also serve asaneeds assessment and provided site staff and administrators with useful information on which to base program improvement. Five general areas were included -t of this review: (a) services for children, (b) interactions among staff and childreh,(c)curriculum,(d)administration and management, and(e)physical arrangementsA more detailed description of the Onsite Evaluations procedures and materialsis available from EIRI. These procedures were designed by EIRI staffutilizing the TADS Manual for Comprehensive Accreditation Criteria and Proceduresof the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, and various Preschool InternalEvaluation Systems which were developed by EIRI staff members. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THEPROVISION OF HIGH-QUALITY INTERVENTIONEarly intervention efficacy research is sometimes criticized on the groundsthat research studies are often conducted in university laboratory schools with such highlevels of funding that the results are unlikely to be replicated in more typical service delivery settings. A second and even more serious criticism couldbe offered if research were conducted with programs of such poor quality that theymight fail to produce the effects which would have occurred if a better interventionprogram had been implemented.To prevent these problems, all of the Longitudinal Studies were conducted inconjunction with ongoing service programs willing to expand or vary the servicesthey were providing in a systematic manner which still reflected the \"state-of-the-art\" practice in the field. Each site was visited frequently by EIRI staff toverify the type and quality of intervention being provided; technical assistance orinservice training was provided where necessary. ECONOMIC EVALUATIONAs noted earlier, a major shortcoming of past early intervention efficacyresearch has been the failure to consider simultaneously both the effects and costs 7;) 86 of intervention. The fact that most studies tiove ignored costs altogether suggests a tacit assumption that unlimited resources are available tor such programs. This is obviously incorrect. Asanother example of why both costs andeffects need tobe considered simultaneously, consider three hypothetical programs which are all designed to reduce the incidence of later special class placement for developmentally delayedpreschool children. Program A is the most effective, since 17 of the 20 childrenare placed inregular programs atfirstgrade,butthecostis$20,000per participant.Program B is the cheapest at $500 per participant, uut only 2 of the20 children are placed in regular classrooms. In Program C,14 of 20 children are placedinregularclassroomsatacostof$2,000perparticipant. Ifanadministrator wanted to pay as little as possible for the program, B might be selected.Unfortunately,little benefit would be realized. Inasociety withunlimited resources for such programs, Program A would probably be the method ofchoice because it is the most effective. However,in a more realistic situationwhere resources are limited, Program C would probably be preferred. Although ratesof placement in regular classrooms are somewhat lower for Program C, the cost of theprogram is a fraction of the cost of Program A. Thus, neither the most effectivenor the cheapest program is the most cost-effective alternative.Accounting for the costs of a particular early intervention program is morecomplex than taking the budget for that program and dividing it by the number ofchildren served. Instead, as was done in each of the Longitudinal Studies, it iscrucial to account for shared and contributed costs, as well as to use standard economictechniquesforcalculatingdifficult-to-estimate costs,discounting,judging the robustness of economic assumptions, and figuring benefits. Economicevaluation of social service programs is a relatively new field but one which isbecoming increasingly important as people realize that we do not have unlimitedresources for providing such services. L () 87 The Purpose of Economic AnalysesFrom an economic perspective, early intervention is an investment in the livesof children with disabilities and their families. Despite popular belief in the \"cost-effectiveness\" ofearlyinterventionprograms,relativelyfeweconomic analyses have been conducted. When these studies were initiated, only 16 economic analyseshad been conducted inearly intervention studies thatincluded young childrenwit'ldisabilities, andthe majority ofthesewere methodologicallyproblematic (Barnett & Escobar, 1987, 1988). If research is to inform policy andassist the practical application of early intervention, the short- and long-termcosts and benefits of programs generally, and of specific alternative approaches,need to be fully understood and documented. Consequently, a part of the design forthis set of longitudinal studies focused on establishing criteria for conductingeconomicanalysesofearlyinterventionprogramsthatadheredtoeconomic conventions,developingnewmethodstoaddressproblemsspecifictoearlyintervention research (Escobar, Barnett, & Keith, 1988), and conducting new economicanalyses of early intervention. The remainder of this section presents a briefoverview of rationale and techniques used in the economic analyses for this set ofearly intervention studies.The primary purpose of economic analysis is to assess economic efficiency. Anearly intervention program that is economically efficient produces a greater gain thanloss(netgain)tosocietyasawhole.Efficiency isalwaysassessedcomparatively; the most efficient program is the one with the greatest net gain.Economic analysis can also be used to assess equity by describing the distributionof costs and benefiLs of a program. However, the purpose of economic analysis withrespect to equity is purely descriptive because there are no economic criteria ofequity.Consumers of the analysis are left to rely cn their own values to judge thefairness of the distributional consequences. 88 Different Types of Economic AnalysesTwo types of economic analyses are most relevant to the Longitudinal Studies: cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a way to investigate the relationship between the costs and outcomes of one programcompared to those of one or more alternative programs: the dollar value of the resources that go into the program are estimated and compared to outcomes. CEA is most usefulin considering alternative strategies to address the same problem. Programs can then be compared on how much they accomplish with each dollar invested in them.The comparison of costs and effects differs between cost-effectiveness (CE) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). CE analysis uses a series of matrices that displaythe costs and effects of each intervention. A hypothetical cost-effectivenessmatrix is given in Table 1.5. Such a matrix displays th relative strengths andweaknesses of each of the interventions in an easily read format. Program C, for example,is associated with more motor skills and positive responses than areprograms A or B. However, Program C has higher costs and lower developmentalquotients (Ns). The matrix approach allows several different comparisons to be made on program costs and effects. For example, costs can be separated by the Table 1.5Hypothetical CE Matrix for DO, Motor Skills, andPositive Responses Across Three Interventions (A, B,Cost Per Child Effects A1,05055050031215 4B1,7501,40035095 number of positive responses in one trialMean saLisfaction-with-program score on a 10-point scale where 10 is positiveand 1is negative E 2 89groups bearing the expense of the resource, or effects can be displayed according to the type of disability, severity of disability, or age served.Thit' analysis and display pmcedure is used instead of the direct computation ofsimplecost-effectiveness ratiosforseveralreasons.First,itmaybeinappropriate for the evaluators to decide which cost breakdowns and effects are the most important. For instance, some persons may value parent satisfaction more highly than others. Some may value gains in DQ more highly than anything else. Inanother instance, a CE comparison disregarding parent time may be desired (if onewants to know what is feasible based on public school resources, for example). Theultimate cost-effectiveness comparisons must be left to the decision-making body.Second, this format displays the distribution of the intervention costs and effects.For example, in Table 1.5, the parents in Program B bear more of the costs than do parentsin Program A or C. However,the parentsin Program Creport higher satisfaction than parents in Program A or B. This disaggregation provides decision-makers wia valuable information about political and social impacts of the programand potential disincentives or incentives to parent participation. Third,thematrices are easily comprehended by readers without an economics background. Thus,the data are available to a wide audience, increasing the usefulness of the cost-effectiveness data. Fourth, cost-effectiveness ratios do not provide a reliableranking of programs in terms of economic efficiency (Barnett, 1986).Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a way to compare the dollar value of a program'sbenefits (outcomes) to the dollar value of its costs. In addition to the completeestimation of program costs, CBA requires the comprehensive measurement of programeffects, and, whenever possible, an estimation of their monetary value. CBAisoften only partially completed because many program effects are intangible, and,thus, difficult to value in a monetary sense.Cost-benefit analysis ismcstgermane whenthe economicimplications ofoutcomes can be readily estimated. For instance, a program which reduces the need 90 for special education or expensive therapy produces benefits to society that can at least be roughly estimated. Because the process of estimating the dollar value of intervention outcomes is almost always incomplete, it yields a conservative estimate of the net economic return to society. However, such analyses can be accomplished to a much greater extent than often supposed, as demonstrated by the economic analysisofthePerry Preschool Project(Barnett,1985a;1985b).For early intervention research, three types of measures can be used to quantify the benefits of early intervention.Savings in costs of care and education. One measure of benefits is the costsavingsgeneratedbyincreasingthecapacitiesofpreschoolerswithdisabilities, orimproving the efficiency of the service delivery system.These cost savings may derive from: organizational, procedural, or staffchanges that reduce intervention costs; a reduction in intensity or durationof later special services; or an intervention that provides a better transitionto later services and so increases productivity or reduces cost. For example,the Perry Preschool Study analyzed cost savings in education and socialservices (Barnett, 1985; berrueta-Clement et al., 1984).Significant costdifferences were observed as early as two and three years after intervention.Seitz, Rosenbaum, and Apfel (1985) found similar kinds of educational savingsfrom an intervention program that focused on families and began at birth. Cost savingsto households. Families with children with disabilities havesubstantially higher child-related expenses of time and money than familieswithout children with disabilities. This applies to many ordinary activitiesaswellastospecialactivitiesnotrenuiredforchildrenwithoutdisabilities.One way that we can measure cost savings is to compare time useandout-of-pocketexpenditures forsamplefamiliesparticipating ininterventions.Willingness-to-pay by households. The mostcompletebenefit estimationprocedures estimate the value of an intervention program and its effects tofamilies beyond cost savings discussed above. Techniques used to produce morecomplete estimates of benefits are classed as either (1) \"hedonic\" approachesor (2) direct measures of willingness-to-pay. The hedonic approach involvesthe estimation of a \"household production function\" based on expenditures ofmoney and time by household members on various goods and services (Lancaster,1966), or the identification of differing prices or wages accepted in order toparticipate in the activity. Estimation of a household production function canirvolve difficult theoretical and empirical problems and requires relativelylarge amounts of detailed data collection from families (Barnett, 1977; 1983;Muellbauer, 1974; Pollack & Wachter, 1975).The second approach to valuation, direct elicitation of willingness-to-paythrough\"biddinggames,\"mightalsobesuccessfullyappliedtoearlyintervention programs and their effects. However, strategic and other biaseswhich are often suspected in hypothetical responses may be a problem. Also,it is sometimes difficult to elicit responses from individuals in cases wherevery detailed descriptions of the \"game\" must be used; this would be the casefor valuing specific treatment variations in intervention components. The 4 pig 91economic analysis staff have developed possible solutions to these problems,however,and have had some success in using this approach. For example,Escobar et al.(1988) were able to obtain reasonable estimates of parents'valuation of apreschoolprogram for children with disabilities. Theseestimates were highly consistent with predictions based upon economic theory. Procedures tor Collecting Cost DatimEconomic analysis requires that the components of each alternative treatment be clearly specified. Procedures for collecting detailed cost data for each of thesites included in the Longitudinal Studies were developed, tested, and implemented at all of the study sites. Using all available sources (e.g., written documents andinterviews with project staff), adetailed description was drawn up for each intervention. Descriptivedataincluded:(a)numberofchildrenbyage,disability, severity, and developmental level; (b) number of direct service staff, administrators, andvolunteers;(c)other resources used intheinterventionprogram; and (d) type and extent of parent involvement. These data were combinedwith information on the unit costs of resources to produce estimates of totalprogram cost and cost per child.The primary reason that economic evaluation requires a specialized cost datacoLection system is that project budgets usually do not accurately reflect thetoal costs of a program. For instance, the value of parent time is often not iicluded as a cost in project budgets. Yet, the care and education of a preschoolerwitkadisabilityrequiresextraordinaryamountsofafamily'sresources,especially parent time,under any circumstances. Parents with children withdisabilities who participate ininterventionsmaybeexpectedtocontributesignificantly greater amounts of their time than other parents. Indeed, parentparticipation in development of the Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) alone mayconsume nontrivial amounts of time. These time costs are important for more thaneconomic comparisons; if time costs are sufficiently high, they may be a barrier toparticipation for some parents (particularly low-income, single parents). Otherresources that are frequently not found in budgets are the costs of initial staff 92training and set-up for a new program, \"borrowed\"staff,volunteers,and even facility costs. To overcome the problems with usthy Judget figures, the costs of implementing each of the interventions studied were defined and measured using the \"ingredients\" method proposed by Levin (1975, 1983).The ingredients approach is a systematic, well-tested procedure for identifjingall of the social costs for implementing alternative programs, including costs thatare often omitted from cost analysis such as contributed (in-kind) andshared resources.Using this approach, an exhaustivelist of resources used by eachalternative intervention program was developed, and the ingredients were costedaccording to observed market values (e.g., salaries) or estimated market values (e.g., parent time). In some cases,it was necessary to prorate shared costs of aresourLe; for example, by estimating the propc^tional costs to one program using a buildingthat wasshared with another program. Costs were then distributedaccording to constituencies, adjustments were made for transfer payme.Its (transferpayments are shifts in income like taxes and welfare payments that are not net coststo society as a whole), and total net costs were calculated. Using this approach, it was possible to ascertain the overall costs for each alternative program as wellas the costs to various contributing groups.Since the concepts and skills involved in economic analysis are relatively new,most site staff were unfamiliar with the procedures. Consequently,cost datacollection forms were developed, tested, and revised so that they did not requirea background in economic analysis to generate accurate cost data. EIRI economistswere available for assistance in computing the forms. The forms were returned to EIRIfor analysisand furtherinteraction with thesiteifanyproblemsor inconsistencies were noted.Described next are the general resource categories that were used for each site.More specific information about the overall costs and cost per child for each 93of the following resource categories for each site are contained later in this report.Personnel.Cost for program personnel was divided into direct service, administrative, consultants, volunteer, and parent time costs. Direct service and administrative costs included salary plus benefits according to the portion of FIE devotedtothealternative early interventionprogram.Consultanttime was calculated based upon their daily rate. Volunteer and parent time was valued at $9 per hour, the U.S. average wage (U.S. Departme 'of Labor,1989).Professional volunteers were estimated at $25 per hour. In mc_c cases, parent time is based upon the number of hours parents were required to commit to the programs, for attending center- or home-based programs, or in phone calls with program staff.Although we know that most parents conducted intervention activities at home with their child, we usually did not attempt to estimate how much time was spent because too much uncertainty was involved. However, for those programs that outlined specific homeintervention activities for parents to carry out, we did estimate parent time based upon the time recommended by the program. Thus, we provided an estimate of how much time parents would have spent if they adhered to the program at home. In all cases, weprovided program cost estimates with and without the value of parent and volunteer time.Capital assets. Facilities, vehicles, equipment, and other investments initems with more than a 1-year life are capital assets. Their costs need to be apportioned to the relevant time period (e.g., 1987-88 school year). Annual capital costs were estimated in one of three ways: (1) the replacement cost of the capitalwas determined and then multiplied by an annualization factor that accounted for implicit interest and depreciation on the item (Levin, 1983); (2) annual rental cost wasused;or(3)theindirectrate(forinterventionprogramshousedin universities) was used. S7 94 Transportation. Annual staff and child transportation costs were reported byeach early intervention program. Staff travel included any job-related travel paidfor by the program, such as home visits, travel between centers, any air travel, andconsultant travel. Child transportation may or may not have been provided by the program.Parents whousedtheir own resources totransporttheirchild or themselves for intervention services were phone interviewed. In the interview, they were asked the round-trip distance they were required to travel, the number of tripsmade, travel time, and whether or not they car-pooled. Based upon this information,parents' transportation costs were estimated at $.21 per mile and $9 per hour. In all analyses, transportation costs were estimated with and without parent costs.Materialsand supplies. Eachprogramreportedannualexpenditures onconsumableitems(expectedlife of Iyear orless).Thisincluded office,classroom, and custodial materials and supplies.Miscellaneous. Annual expenditures on anything not counted elsewhere wereincluded in this category. These may include utilities, insurance, debt service,dues, subscriptions, etc. Design/Analyses Issues Most of the issues related to design and analyses are described adequately inthe individual reports of the 17 Longitudinal Studies. There are several issueswhich cut across studies, however, which merit further discussion here. ATTRITIONAttritionis one of the most serious challenges associated with conductinglongitudinal research. Although the analysis techniques for attempting to deal withattrition once it has occurred are relatively straightforward and non-controversial(Jurs & Glass, 1971),the best approach is to do everything possible to preventattrition from occurring. Consequently, EIRI staff employed a number of strategiesfor preventing the occurrence of attrition. 95 !Migrant to parents. The original plan for the studies called for payinganincentive for participation only to parents in the \"experimental\"groups.However, because attrition is just as serious whether it occursin the \"experimental\" group or the \"control\" group, it was decided to payall parents an incentive for completing the annual assessment battery (thisranged from $25 - $50, depending on the study). Money obtained from theNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development for broadeningassessment activities made this possible.Liaisons with service provider. Animportant strategy for avoidingattrition was to develop and nurture a feeling of commitment to the projectamong those who were participating. A key linkin this strategy was theservice provider. Nurturing a positive attitude toward the research amongkey staff of the service provider was essential because these are thepeople who had the most frequent contact with the participants in eachstudy.Suchfeelingsofcommitment were fosteredbyfrequentandconsistent communication with the service provider staff about the researchactivities,opportunities forinterestedserviceproviderstafftoparticipate in the publication of data from the research project, provisionof technical assistance to the service provider in upgrading their program,and assistance to the service provider in identifying additional funds forexpanding and strengthening the services they provided.Communication with Parents. Although EIRI staff had to depend on theservice provider staff for the week-to-week contact with participatingfamilies, EIRI staff tried to communicate the following three messages toparents: (1) each person will benefit from participating; (2) participationwithbenefit others inthefuture;and(3)research staff will berespon,ve to concerns of parents and will keep parents and family informedaboutthe-esultsoftheresearch.These messages were initiallycommunicated to parents via the informed consent form and during thepretesting assessments. In addition, parents were fully informed as totheir roles and responsibilities, given explicit examples of what theirtime commitments would be, and were informed of measures and precautionstaken to ensure their family's safety and privacy.Other tangible incentives. In addition to the monetary incentives paidto parents for cooperating with the annual assessment, several othertangible incentives were used to maintain cooperation. Developmentaltoys, subscriptions to magazines, coupons for McDonalds, and infant formulawere given to parents in different projects. Whenever such incentiveswere used,it was balanced across the two alternative groups.locating difficult-to-find fmmilies.Theactivities described aboveprovided numerous opportunities each year to have contact with parents.For those parents who \"became lost\" during the year, a number of techniqueswere immediately implemented to locate them. The first was the locatorservice provided through the U.S. Postal Service. For a nominal charge($1 per family), the Post Office provided information about any forwardingaddress that had been left. Second, neighbors and relatives whose nameshad been provided by the parents as part of the demographic informationLompleted at the beginning of the project were contacted. These peopleoftentimes had information about where the family had moved. 96Using the techniques described above, many sites were able to retain most of the subjects initially enrolled. In cases where substantial attrition occurred,analysis techniques were used to make whatever adjustments were possible. COLLECTION OF PRETEST DATAThe original proposal did not envision the collection of extensive pretest data.However, the results of the feasibility studies conducted during the first year made it clear that pretest data were essential for three important reasons. First, it is clear that some children and families appear to benefit more from early intervention services than do others; the critical question is why these differential benefitsoccur.Pretest measures onfamily structure andfunctioning,home environment, and child functioning were included in the core assessment battery in order to examine some of the possible reasons for the differential effect of early interveltion.For example, it was hypothesized that for financially secure, high-functioning, relatively healthy and intact families, early intervention might addvery little toa child's developmental progress. For families which are overly stressed,disorganized, orlackingadequateresources,interventionmaybe particularly beneficial. Pretest data on child and family functioning were used inconjunction with the demographic data already planned for collection to investigateseveral such hypotheses.A second reason for collecting pretest data was demonstrated by the findings oftheintegrativereview summarized earlier inthereport.Thisanalysisdemonstrated that a great deal of the current research about the efficacy of earlyintervention 4or children with disabilities is based on pretest/posttest design inwhich children make more growth than the investigators anticipated. A number ofpopular and widely disseminated arguments for using such designs to estimate theimpact of intervention have been advanced (see for example, Bagnato & Neisworth, 1980;Carr,1979;Simeonsson,Huntington,Short,&Ware,1982;Simeonsson&Weigerink, 1975; and Wolery, 1983). Based on data collected during the feasibility 97 studies, itbecame clearthat suchestimatesof intervention impact cansometimes be misleading. For example,if the studyin Utahinvestigating the effects of parent involvement had doneusing a one-group pretest/posttest design, theconclusion would ofgrowth a controlgroupin this study demonstratedthat childrenin both groups(i.e., the group with parentinvolvement and involvement) made approximatelythe sameamount of pretest toposttestgrowth.Thus, conducted inthe expansionof pretestmeasures overwhat wasoriginallyplanned made it possible to use analysis ofcovariance much moresuccessfully for increasing the statistical power of ALPHALEVELS error)cannot bemade in theabsence ofconsiderations 98 about statistical power (i.e., the Type II error). As pointed out by Hopkins (1973),too many people, attempting to be rigorous, set the probability level for Type I errors at .01,ignoring the fact that the probability of making a Type II error (i.e., failing to detect true differences) may be 60% or 70%. A much better strategy is to attempt to balance Type I and Type II errors.In order to achieve such a balance, Alpha levels in each of the studies will be set at .05 or .10 for one-tailed tests of significance, depending on the numberof subjects included in that analysis and the availability of effective covariates.Related to the issue of how to set Alpha levels for the testing of any single hypothesis is the issue of how to interpret the pattern of statistical significance testsacrossa widerange ofdependent variables (andsubtestswithinthose variables) for a given study. For example, in all of these studies, there are dozensof different tests of statistical significance. Obviously, several statisticallysignificant differences would be expected by chance alone. Thus,itis importantto examine the pattern and logical consistence of differences and not rely on amagical number for Alpha to establish statistical significance. Furthermore, aspointed out by Gabriel and Hopkins (1974), appealing to multivariate analysis ofvariance (MANOVA) techniques as a solution to the multiple dependent variable problem istoo simplistic and not very convincing. The only real solutionisto usestatistical significance as a tool in examining the pattern of differences, whileat the same time considering the logical consistency of results, the magnitude ofdifferences, the consistency of results from year to year, and the results of otherstudies in the group which proviue evidence aboat similar questions. 99PART II.RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL STUDIES Seventeen separate studies were completed as a part of the Longitudinal Studiesof the Effects and Costs of Early Intervention with Handicapped Children. Tofacilitate comparisons between studies, a similar format has been followed wherever possible.It is emphasized that because additional data continue to be collectedand more analyses are being done, the tentative conclusions of this report may change.The purpose of this document is to describe what has been done so far as ameansofgeneratingdiscussionandsuggestionswhichwillimprovetheinterpretability of the Longitudinal Studies.The presentation of studies are divided into three categories:Studies in which intensity of the intervention varied.Studies with medically fragile infants in which the age-at-start ofthe intervention varied.Studies in which different programmatic features, primarily parentinvolvement, varied.The results for each category of study is preceded by a review of the researchconducted by o4!ier researchers which is relevant to the studies in that category.These reviews are the most comprehensive reviews on each of these topics yet done,and the infc,rmation in them provides an extremely important context in which tointerpret the results of these studies. 100 REVIEW OF EARLY INTERVENTION RESEARCH ON THEINTENSITY OF EARLY INTERVENTION It has been argued that the field of early intervention must stop asking theresearch question, \"Is early intervention effective?\" and focus on research questionsthat examine the conditions under which different interventions are effective andfor whom they are effective (Dunst,Snyder,&Mankinen,1989;Farran,1990;Guralnick, 1988; Meisels, 1984; Reynolds, Egan, & Lerner, 1983). This argument seems logical.Even the most critical reviewers of the early intervention researchliterature have stated, with provisions, that early intervention seems to make animmediate impact on child developmental progress (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Dunstet al., 1989). However, as Dunst et al. (1980) have stated, \"The extent to whichthe interventions are responsible for observed effects is difficult to ascertain\" (p.285).The change ina research focus from the general question to specificquestions would provide clearer evidence by which to ascertain cause/effect relationsand by which to implement intervention programs.The review article of Handicapped Children's Early Education Program (HCEEP)funded projects that have received Joint Dissemination Review Panel (JDRP) approval(White etal.,1984)canserve asan example of thecurrent state of earlyintervention research. JDRP approval is considered a rigorous process, and projectswhich gain this approval are considered to be well developed and thoroughly evaluated(Odom & Fewell, 1983). At the time White et al. conducted their review, 21 earlyintervention projects had received JDRP approval. Characteristics of these projectswere:7 were home-based, 8 center-based, and 6 combined home- and center-basedservices;7 projects heavily involved parents, 10 involved parents to some extent,4 did not involve parents; 12 served children with mixed handicaps, 9 served morespecific populations; the ages of children served by projects varied from 0 -6 to A-6 with many permutations; and programs provided from one hour per week of 101intervention to five days per week, 3 hours per day intervention. With such a variety of\"effective\"intervention formats tochoosefrom,howisanearlyintervention provider to select a model to implement?Factors such as funds, advocacy, and personal beliefs enter into selecting an intervention program. If theresults of more rigorously designed research were available to answer specificquestions about what works best for whom, then the early intervention provider couldselect an intervention program(s) based on factors such as types of disabilities,ages of children, and background of families to be served.This suggested change in the focus of early intervention research is one towardexamining the parametric aspects of early intervention programs. Parametric, in thiscontext, refers to the limits or boundaries of a field of study. This process isanalogous to what Kuhn (1970) has referred to as \"normal science\" in the physical sciences.This process starts with a proposition or belief (e.g., early interventionis effective), referred to as a paradigm by Kuhn. The role of a field or inquiry isthen to examine the limits and boundaries (the parametric aspects) of this paradigm.It is clear that early intervention research cannot conduct normal science inthe way that many physical sciences do. Early intervention research has beenimplemented in an atheoretical manner, and problems with causality will always bepresent (Dunst, 1986; Dunst et al., 1989; Halpern, 1984). These aspects of earlyintervention research separate it from the path that most physical sciences take intheir approach to \"normal science.\" However, this type of path would allow the fieldof early intervention to address concerns raised from within and outside the fieldof early intervention (Odom & Warren, 1988; Summers & Innocenti, in press).If this parametric approach to early intervention research is accepted, thequestion of what parametric factors require examination is raised. The answer tothis questionis too extensive to be explored thoroughly here, but the paradigmproposed by Ounst et al. (1989) provides one useful approach. Ounst et al. (1989) 102 suggestedthatthemostimportantfactorsincludeinterventionprogram characteristics, aspects of social support,family characteristics, and child characteristics. Within and across these characteristic, the list of possible parametric questions isinexhaustible. This review will focuson the early intervention characteristics of intensity. Intensity as a Parametric VariableInformation on the parametric aspects of intensity as it relates to a paradigm are usually examined from avariety of perspectives. For example,in operant psychology extensive information is known regarding intensity factors needed to establishthephenomenonofstimuluscontrol(Mackintosh,1977).Inearly intervention,however,littlesystematicresearchhasoccurredinregardto intensity, although it is often cited as an important treatment variable (Bailey & Bricker, 1984; Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Dunst et al., 1989).The field of early intervention commonly holds the belief that \"more is better\" (White, Bush, & Casto, 1985-86).This belief is common to our culture in many areas but may not be valid in all cases (e.g., the megavitamin controversy; Perils of, 1987; Vitamins, 1986). Thereisa need for a definition ofthe term intensity ifitistobe systematically investigated. Many reviewers of early intervention research fail to clearly define what is implied by the term intensity (Dunst et al., 1989; Reynolds et al., 1983; White et al., 1985-86).'hose who have defined intensity have done so in slightly different ways. Bryant and Ramey (1987) defined intensity \"by amountand breadth of contact with children and/or families\" (p.71).This definition implies some qualitative aspects of intervention. Casto and Mastropieri (1986) defined intensity both in terms of total hours of intervention and hours per week of intervention. This definition implies aspects of both amount and duration.For the purposes of this review, intensity is defined solely from an amount perspective.That is, intensity is defined as hours of intervention contact, with child and/o). parent, by an interventionist provided within a constant time frame 103(e.g., within a one-week period). This differs from duration, which is the lengthof time intervention is provided over an unlimited time frame. An example may be useful.A program that provides three hours of intervention per week versus one thatprovides five hours per week is an example of an intensity difference. If there aretwo programs of equal intensity and one provides three months of intervention whilethe other provides 12 months, the difference is one of duration. Itisclear thatthis definition isnot without problems. Duration andintensity are frequently confounded, as are many other aspects of intervention programs(e.g.,age atstart).Qualitative aspects of programs 0 impact on intensity (cf., Carta, Sainato, & Greenwood, 1988). These issues will be discussed later in the review. The goal of this review is to examine the general propositionthat \"more is better\" and determine if available evidence supports or refutes thisproposition. The Importance of IntensityWith the passage of P.L. 99-457, there has been an increase in the number ofearly intervention programs. When developing a program, program administrators mustaddress a variety of issues, but two basic ones are how many days per week and howmany hours per day services will be provided. In the absence of empirical findings,administrators will be forced to rely on factors such as personal philosophy, effortsof advocates, and examples of already established intervention programs. Thesefactors are all valid, but may not be enough to answer the questions correctly.Odom and Warren (1988) have discussed the potential institutionalization ofintervention services and the possible drawbacks this would have on effectiveservices.Barnett (1988) takes this institutionalization scenario into the costrealm. Barnett presents different cost scenarios based on different service deliverypatterns.Itis clear from his analysis that information on efficacious programintensities for different groups could allow funds to be spent more effectively in 104 serving children. Essentially, more accurate information or intervention intensityfor specific groups would allow \"more bang for the buck.\"A second major issue related to the intensity of intervention has to do withthe way in which interventionists are trained (see Odom & Warren, 1988).One ofthe strengths of early intervention programs, prior to P.L. 99-457, has been their ability to individualize according to the needs of the population being served. Itis possible that there may be a limit to what a child with disabilities can learnin a structured session, and that this limit may vary depending on degree or type of disability. Also,it is possible that some families find more intense programsdetrimental to child and family functioning. If interventionists are trained toprovide services through one intervention format (e.g., 5-days-per-week, 3 hours perday, or a 1.5 hour home visits per week), then the individualization aspects of earlyintervention may become less salient.Shonkoff and Hauser-Cram, Krauss, & Upshur, 1990) have addressedsomeoftheseconcernsintheirreportontheEarlyIntervention Collaborative Study. They found that program variables were not always meeting childand family needs and questioned these factors in relation to the Individual FamilyServices Plan (IFSP). If research on intervention intensity were available, theninterventionists would bebetterabletoprovide appropriate, individualized intervention.However, training for the interventionist to make judgments regardingprogram intensity is predicated by the availability of research to shape training programs. EVIDENCE FRCNA PREVIOUS REVIEWSWhite et al. (1985-86) criticized researchers who conducted reviews that failedto build upon earlier reviews. In order to learn from the information contained inprevious reviews, a review of reviews of the early intervention efficacy literaturethat provided conclusions regarding intensity was conducted. To makeit moremanageable, only published reviews conducted after 1970 were examined. 105This process began through an examination of the White et al. (1985-86) review.White et al. identified 22 out of 52 reviews which cited duration/intensity as aconcomitant variable in early intervention efficacy research. These reviews were obtained.Upon closer examination of these reviews, it was determined that themajority of these dealt with the duration variable and not intensity. Of these 22 reviews, only four dealt with intensity as a variable. Two of these reviews did notmeet the above criteria for selection (Groteberg, 1969; Ragghianti, undated). Theother two reviews (Ramey & Bryant, 1982; Reynolds et al., 1983) ware obtained. In order to augment these reviews, a literature search was conducted for reviewsof early intervention efficacy published between 1985 and 1989 and that providedconclusions regarding intensity. Three reviews were identified (Bryant & Ramey, 1987;Casto&Mastropieri,1986;Dunst etal.,1989).Twoofthesewere\"traditional\" reviews (Bryant & Ramey, 1987; Dunst et 1989), and one was ameta-analytic review (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986) based on the use of study effectsizes (Glass, 1976).In total, five reviews were identified which provided conclusions regarding theintensity of early intervention programs. The review by Bryant and Ramey (1987) wasan expansion of the argument presented in their earlier article (Ramey & Bryant,1982); thus, the more recent article was deemed a better representation of theirposition on intensity. This results in a pool of four articles for this review ofreviews (Bryant & Ramey, 1987; Casto & Mastropieri, 1986;Dunst et al., 1989;Reynolds et al., 1983).Each cf these reviews will be examined by the evidencepresented regarding intensity. \"Traditional\" reviews will be examined first and thenthe review based on effect size analyses.Bryant and Ramey (1987). This review consists of an analysis of 17 compensatoryearly education research studies.Only studies that were described astrueexperiments(i.e.,amatched or randomly assigned intervention group versus anonintervention or less intervention group). Children in these studies were from 106economically disadvantaged families. Twelve of the programs were infant/toddler programs and five were preschool programs. Programs varied in terms of center- or home-based intervention, and in degree of child and parent focus. The focus of the analysis was on changes in IQ scores.Bryant and Ramey, as part of their review, examined 11 studies which began ininfancy and calculated the difference in IQ between the experimental and controlgroup when the children were 24 months old. Ramey and Bryant ranked the studiesaccording to observed differences and the intensity of the intervention. They concluded that therankingsofoutcome corresponded totheintensityoftheintervention program, as defined by number of project hours per month with parentsand/or children. Bryant and Ramey stated: \"Taken all together, the 2-year resultsfrom the 11 infancy interventions support an intensity hypothesis\" (p. 65).The same process was repeat e... with the 10 studies of infants that providedresults from the children at age 3. This process produced essentially the same conclusion.Thestrongest effects clearly favored thethreemostintensiveintervention programs. However, treatment effects were not as clearly related tuintensity differences for the other seven studies of the group. P.-oblems were reported with this analysis partly because of the absolute IQ scores of most subjectsin these studies (the majority were in the average range) and because many studieschanged tests between the 2 and 3 year assessments.In an analysis of preschool results, Bryant and Ramey presented IQ differencescores for the five preschool studies, two of the infant studies that continued toprovide services in the preschool years (full-day daycare), and two studies thatcontinued to collect follow-up data but provided no services. Although Bryant andRamey do not discuss the intensity hypothesis in regard to these data, it is clearthat the intensity hypothesis breaks down. Although all children who entered thepreschool programs made progress, the progress was not clearly related to program intensity.In fact, subjects in the most intensive preschool program (30 contact 1( 0 107 hours perweek in theCurriculumComparisonStudy [Miller& Dyer,1975]) made the least that werethe interms of contact least effects. In Rameystated: \"Thepreponderance of evidence seems tosuggest thatthe intensityof programs...is likely to have a direct and positiverelationship to the degreeof intellectual benefit derived by children participating in such programs\"(p. and\"...if and theprocedures used in thereview.The conclusions regardingintensity,however, much stronger thanthe datawarrant.Support isprovided fortha intensityhypothesis, but this (1989).Dunst andcolleagues tak, adifferentapproach tothe the 14 studies; the group with the highest level ofcausality.Seven studies were included in this group.Five of these seven studies had been included in theBryant andRamey (1987) review. earlyintervention studies. Bryant andRamey had used 108some of the individual studies included in this monograph in their review article.The otherstudy selected byDunst etalwas (Cappleman, DeRemer-Sulliran, &King, 1982).All of the studies considered by Dunst as having the highest level ofcausality focused on environmentally at-risk children as subjects.The argument presented by Dunst et al. supporting the intensity hypothesis isessentially the same as that presented by Bryant and Ramey (1987), although Bryantand Ramey explicated their arguments in much greater detail. In discussing thesestudies, Dunst et al. stated:\"At least in terms of IQ differences between theexperimental and control groups, the data from these studies support the intensityhypothesis\" (p. 284). However, the specific logic by which Dunst et al. reach thisconclusion and the evidence upon which it is based is not clear. Dunst et al. arealso more qualified in their overall conclusions regarding intervention-relatedvariables, which include intensity. r^ey stated in regard to these variables that,...thet:e variables tend to have conditional effects. For example, intensity ofinvolvementappearsimportantincenter-basedprogramswithminimalparentinvolvement but is less important in home-based programs, where parents Lnction as'teachers' of their own children\" (p. 286). Agair, the specific evidence on whichthis qualification is basA is unclear. The inclusion of the Cappleman et al. (1982) and Lazar and Darlington (1982) monograph is not clear from an intensity perspective.Both articles report the results of methodologically wel l-designed research, and bothdemonstrate that some intervention is better than no intervention. However, neitherarticle would readily fit into the Bryant and Ramey (1987) analyses. Regardless,the review by Dunst et al. is useful.However,it is difficult to tell how strongthe evidence is on which they base their qualified views on the role of intensityas a program variable. Ounst and colleagues also make clear the need for parametricresearch on program variables in their conclusions. 109Reynolds est(1984Reynolds and colleagues review focused on the efficacy of early intervention on preacademic deficits. Reynolds et al. took a neutral stancein regard to intensity of intervention, citing only the 1982 review by Ramey and Bryant.These authors suggest that this may be an important variable, but that morecontrolled studies were needed. Reynold etal.were also cautious intheir conclusionsandstatedthatthere few studies ofspecificintervention variaLles.Casto and kfastropled (1980). A number of recent reviews have focused on the useof effect sizes to assess variables that may impact on the efficacy of earlyintervention (Casto & Mastropieri, Cram, 1987; White & Casto, 1985). In these reviews, a single effect size or multipleeffect sizes (Glass, 1976) are obtained from existing research articles. The research articles are also coded according to different variables on which the review will focus.The effect size then serves as a common metric for comparisons of theseselected variables across studies. This type of review is referred to as a meta- analysis (Glass, 1976; Jackson, 1980).The meta-analysis conducted by Casto and Mastropieri is uniquein thatitfocused solely on children with disabilities and addressed the program intensity variable.Casto and Mastropieri examined intensity both from a total hours ofintervention and an hours of intervention per week perspective. The data presented indicatedaclear trend in..:avorof theintensity hypothesis. These authorssuggestedthatintensity/duration maybeanimportantvariablefordisabled populations.Although this analysis has merit, itis not without problems. The analysiscombined intensity and duration, and the clearer data were those dealing withduration (total hours).For example, the duration effect sizes were presentedadjusted for quality of measurement, ageatstart,andtimeof measurement.Intensity (hours of intervention per week) adjusted effect sizes were not presented. 110 In addition, although a trend favoring more intense studies was present, the standard error of the mean for the mean effect sizes presented was very large, suggesting that findings in this area were not uniform. These problems suggest that any statementsregarding intensity, without duration included, should be equivocal. Conclusions From the Review of ReviewsThe reviews examined were, overall, supportive of the position that more intenseintervention programs result in greater developmental gains for children than lessintensive programs. It seems that the research articles reviewed do provide some support for this proposition. However, the strength of the evidence regarding thishypothesis is limited, and there are clearly some qualifications that need to be maderegarding the proposition that more intenseinterventions are more effective.Neither the Bryant and Ramey (1987) nor Casto and Mastropieri (1986) reviews, whichpresent the more thorough analyses of the intensity variable, present data that arewithout criticism or competing hypothesis. The qualified conclusions by Dunst etal. (1989) appear to be the most accurate. Overall, these reviews suggest the needfor more information and research on intensity as an early intervention efficacy variable. REANALYSIS OF THE EIRI LITERATURE BASEOne method to obtain more information on intensity as an early intervention efficacy vari:.Ible would be to conduct a meta-analysis (Glass, 1976), similar to thatcompleted by Casto and Mastropieri (1986), with categories more specific to theintensity variable. The data base of results from previously reported research thathad been compiled by the Early Intervention Research Institute (EIRI) at Utah StateUniversity for use in meta-analytic reviews was accessed for this purpose. Morespecific information on this data base and methods used to code studies can be foundelsewhere (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Casto & White, 1985; White & Casto, 1985). 111 The EIR1 article data base was accessed in Fall, 1989.All articles (over 400 research studies) were examined for the intensity variable of hours per week of intervention.This analysis included all of the studies analyzed previously by Casto and Mastropieri (1986) in addition to studies added to the data base since their analyses were completed. All studies from which this factor could be gleaned were taken,rated according to methodological quality (based on threats to internal validity), and effect sizes were obtained from the results presented (see Casto & White, 1985, for more specific information on coding of articles). Intensity factors were not under examination (i.e., an independent variable) in the majority of this research, but information was presented that allowed intensity information to be obtained.These data are presented in Table 11.1. Findings are presented by type of population included in the study; that is,children identified as disabled, children at-risk because of economic or environmental factors (disadvantaged), and children medically at-risk. Ifitis assumed that intensity is directly related to program efficacy in terms of child outcomes, then a relationship would be expected between level ofintensity and child progress--with increasing effects as children receive more intensive interventions. The data presented in Table 11.1' do not support this assumption for any of the populations presented. In fact, if only the good-qualitystudies are examined, then an inverse relationship between intensity and efficacy occurs.It is clear that an analysis such as this is not without difficulty. Confounds existbetweenintensity and other intervention,child,andfamilyvariables.However, the support for the intensity variable provided by the reviews presented earlier is not confirmed by this analysis. This lack of confirmation between sources 'Spec:al thanks to Mau Taylor who assisted in developing this table.1( 5 112 further emphasizes the need for experimental studies of intensity as an intervention variable.

See Casco and White (1985) for more detail on coding procedures. For parentheses: (# of effect sizes [#.1 of studies]) \"\" indicates no data available 113EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES COMPARING INIVAMTY DIFFERENCESAnother method to examine intensity as an early intervention program variable is through studies that have experimentally compared programs of different intensity.In other words, within the same study, some children were in a group which received more intense intervention services, and others were in a group that received less intensive intervention services. These studies can be categorized as to whether the intensityofinterventionservicesisthe only variable being experimentallymanipulated (a direct comparison), or whether intensity is one of several variables (e.g.,age atstart,type of curriculum) being expe..imentally manipulated (an indirect comparison). Analyses of comparative experimental studies provide the bestinformation regarding a phenomenon under investigation.For the purpose of this review, all studies in the EIRI research article data base,as of1989,that experimentally manipulated intensity as anindependent variable were obtained. Intensity was defined as an amount of intervention (e.g.,hours) provided over a given time frame (e.g., week, month, year, etc.). Studies thatcomparedtwodifferentinterventionapproaches(e.g.,CurriculumAvs.Curriculum B) of equal intensity were excluded from the review.Tables 11.2 and 11.3 summarize all of the studies examining the intensity ofintervention variables that were located. Table 11.2 presented studies completed ondisadvantaged populations, while Table11.3 presentsstudies completed onhandicapped populations. The tables present information on type of comparison(direct or indirect), reference, a brief description of the comparisoJ (many of thestudies also compared intervention/no intervention,but these results are notpresented), the quality of the study (poor, fair,or good) based on threats tointernal validity, the outcome measures used, and effect size information.Only nine articles were identified, a very small number of studies given thepossibleimpact ofintensity on factors such aschild and family functioning,professional training, and costs (Barnett & Pezzino, 1987).

The two indirect comparisons which compared center-based vshome-visitinterventionprograms found mixed results (Carter, 1977; Dusewicz & Higgins, 1971); one study suggesting less intensive home visitingisbetter,theothersuggestingthatmoreintensivecenter-based intervention is better. The two studies directly examining home visiting also do not allow a cleir statement to be made (Burkett, 1982; Powell & Grantham-McGregor, 1989).Burkett's results indicate no difference between weekly and bi-weekly visits. However, the results of Powell and Grantham-McGregor indicate that bi-weekly is more effective than monthly. Taken together, these studies produce equivocal findings. It is important to note that none of these studies are particularly well designed from a methodological perspective.The studies presented in Table 11.3 presented a much clearer picture--but it isapicture which iscontrarytotheprevailing notion that moreintensive interventionsaremoreeffective.Thesestudiessuggestthatmoreintense interventions for children with handicaps are not related to magnitude of effect.Overall, the studies reviewed in Tables 11.2 and 11.3 present no data that suggest moreintenseinterventions arepreferredforeitherdisadvantaged or handicapped populations. Difficulties are encountered in the methodological quality of studies and in potential confounds within studies. Consequently, these findings should not serve as the definitive statement on intervention intensity.These findings do make clear the need for high-quality studies that examine the question of intervention intensity. Also, the majority of effects are based only on child outcome measures. It seems plausible that interventioNs of different intensity may differentially impact on parents and families (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Dunst, 1986). Impacts on these variables also requires consideration in research studies. CONFOUNDS AND CONSIDERATIONSThe study of intensity, as with other program aspects, is one that can be affected by confounds. Possible confounds include: (1) Children may start programs 116 at different ages; (2) children may exhibit different levels of delay or differentpatterns of delay; (3)curricula or duration of intensity may differ betweeninterventions; and (4) families may be from different SES levels or from areas of different population density. All of these factors and others could affect intensity outcomes.Many of these issues cut across research studies and have bPen addressed elsewhere (Dunst et al., 1989; Simeonsson, 1985). In relation to intEnsity, however, the treatment verification variable needs to be carefully considered.If weekly and bi-weekly home visits are being compared, then it becomes imperative that information on number of home visits attended be given.For example, if attendance at weekly visits was 40%, and attendance at bi-weekly visits was 80%, thennointensity comparison actually exists.In addition, a factor related to treatment verification is information on whatoccurs during home visits or during a \"day\" at the center.Taylor et al. (1984)discuss their concern that the half-day program they examined may have been as\"inten5e\" as the full-day program based on activities that occurred during the \"day.\"Ecobehavioral re\":earch on classroom variables has demonstrated that a longer day doesnot necessarily result in more child-engaged time (Carta et al., 1988); child engagedtime being directly related to child gains (Greenwood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1984; Innocenti, 1990). To clearly understand intensity as a program variable, research will need to incorporate measures that examine these process variables (Carta et al., 1988).Finally, an area that receives criticism in intensity research is the use ofdifferent curricula by the programs being compared. This is a confound, but it isa necessary confound in some kinds of intensity research. It would be impossibleand inappropriate from an intervention perspective to use the same curriculum if aone-day-per-week home visit was being compared to five-days-per-week center-based program.Individual research must examine the appropriateness of different types 117of curricula based on the intensities of programs being compared and on the goals of these programs.It is clear that research on intensity as a program variable (or any programvariable) must progress from a multi-tiered parametric approach. Only through suchan approach will questions of what works best for whom be answered. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSThe question of whether existing research has established that more intenseinterventions result in more positive outcomes was addressed by examining reviewsof the literature, by conducting a meta-analysis based on intensity, and by reviewingexperimental studies that addressed questions of program intensity. These combinedsources suggest that there is currently little evidence to support the position thatmore intensive programs result in better outcomes. However, methodologically sound researchexaminingthisissueisalmostnonexistent,and minimalinformationregarding effects of program intensity on parents and families is available. Somelimited cross-study evidence suggests that intensity may be an important variablefor center-based programs for disadvantaged infants until they reach age 3 (Bryant& Ramey, 1987; Dunst et al., 1989).It is disconcerting that so few data are available to address the question ofprogram intensity. Intensity is one of the primary factors affecting interventioncosts, and information regarding effective intensities for different disabilitiescould significantly impact who gets service given available monies (Barnett, 1988).Additionally, clearer knowledge regarding intensity factors should impact on trainingearlyinterventionists suchthatIndividualFamilyServicePlans(IFSPs)andIndividual Education Plans (IEPs) accurately reflect the needs of children andf'milies (cf., Shonkoff et al., 1990).In the remainder of this section, the results of seven studies are presentedwhich address some aspect of theissue of whether more intensive interventionprograms have benefits ..or participating children or parents. 1 Jordan 118JORDAN SCHOOL DISTRICTProject #1 COMPARISON: Mildly to Severely Handicapped Children--Participation in a 3-day-per-week, center-based preschool program versus participation in an enhanced 5-day-per-week, center-based preschool program.SITE COORDINATOR: the Study Limitedevidenceexistsintheearly intervention literature to guide programdecisionsconcerningtherelativeeffectiveness ofvariousintensities of program efforts (Casto &Mastropieri, 1986; White & Casto, 1985).The frequency and intensity of servicesin early intervention programs varieswidely, based on factors such as philosophical orientation and professional judgementof child needs. With the passage of the federal mandate to provide services to allpreschool-aged children with disabilities (P.L. 99-457), the intensities of programsmay change to reflect the effect of more children in programs and related fundingand personnel issues. One result may be that programs will decrease their intensityin an attempt to serve more children with the same level of funding. Conversely,this legislation may increase the number of individuals who advocate in favor of Jordan 119increased intervention for young children with disabilities. This could generate support for more assistance to such children that includes greater program intensity.Decisions that can potentially affect the lives of children and their families,such as the intensity of a program, must be made using a data base of the effectsand costsofprogramsofvaryingintensity rather thanbe madeaccordingtobureaucratic needs or well-meant lobbying efforts. This study will help provide informationforthisdatabasebycomparingtwo commonintensitylevelsofintervention services for preschool-aged children with disabilities. Review of Related ResearchAlthough treatment intensity may be an important variable for early interventionprograms, little systematic research has occurred in regard to intensity (Bailey &Bricker, 1984; Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; White & Casto, 1985). The field of earlyintervention commonly holds the belief that more is better (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986).This belief is common to our culture in many areas and may not be valid inall cases (e.g., the megavitamin controversy; Perils of, 1987; Vitamins, 1926).Table 1.1 summarizes characteristics of five previous studies that directlyexamined the question of intensity in early intervention (Blank & Solomon, 1968;Burkett, 1982; Jago et al., 19b1; Levenstien, 1970; Sandow et al., 1981). Only twoof these used children with disabilities as subjects (Jago et al., 1984; Sandow etal., 1981).Three of these studies (Blank & Soloman, 1968; Levenstein, 1970; al., 1984). Sandowhad the highest level of methodological rigor of the studies presented, while theother four studies were rated as fair or poor on study quality.The results of these studies are equivocal. Sandow et al. (1981) found childrenwith disabilities made better progress ifhome visits were separated by 8-weekintervals rather than 2-week intervals. Burkett (1982) reported no differencesbetween children who received home visits once or twice per week. Jago et al.

More hours of intervention proved better forlanguage development, but these results are confounded by different interventionapproachesin each of the three intensities. The finding from these intensitystudies makes clear the need for new research studies which are methodologically sound,whichdirectlyaddressthequestionofprogramintensity,andwhich systematically vary intensity parameters. Theneedfor methodologically sound studies directly examining intensityparameters, where comparison groups are not confounded by different interventions,is further stressed by analyses conducted by EIRI. All articles on early interven-tion compiled by EIRI for use in various meta-analyses were examined for factorsrelated to intensity. These factors were: total hours of intervention, hours per week of intervention, and duration of intervention in weeks. All studies from whichthese factors could be glealed were taken, rated according to methodological quality(based on threats to internal validity), and effect sizes were obtained from theresults presented. Intensity factors were not under examination (i.e., an indepen-dent variable) in the majority of this research, but information was presented thatallowed intensity information to be obtained. These data are presented in Table 1.2.Only findings from studies that used children with disabilities as subjects arepresented.Data in this table do not support the suggestion that \"more is better.\"This study directly examined one aspect of the question of program intensity.A comparison of a 3-day versus a 5-day-per-week early intervention preschool programmay be of particular importance, as both represent common program intensities, andstudy results could affect personnel and funding issues. Impact of these differentprogram intensities on parents and families, as wellas their child, was alsoexamined.The effects of intervention on parent and family functioning have notreceived sufficient investigation in previous early intervention research (Casto & Jordan122Table 1.2Average Effect Size for Different Intensity Factors From StudiesExamining Early Intervention on Children with Handicaps Quality of Studies' Good FairPoorTotal Total Hours (# of Effect Sizes [# of studies])No data for cell Jordan 123Mastropieri, 1986; Dunst, 1986). Impacts on family functioning may translate intoimmediate and long-term changes that can, positively or negatively, affect the child(Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Dunst, 1986). Overview of StudyIntensity has many dimensions (e.g.,programs may vary hours per day ofinterventions, days per week of intervention, degree of engaged learning time inwhich child are involved, etc.).This study contrasted preschool interventionservices for two groups distinguished by multiple variations. First, children inone group received 5-days-per-week, 2-hours-per-day preschool intervention servic,s inclassrooms established toprovide appropriate, child-centered services forchildren with intensive group). Childrenin the other groupreceived 3-days-per-week, 2-hours-per-day preschool intervention services in the same'classroom format (less intensive group). The more intensive condition in this studyalso had a 31 child/teacher ratio, while a 5:1 child/teacher ratio existed for theless intensive condition classrooms. A third dimension along which intensity wasdifferent was that more intensive condition classrooms were provided with increasedavailability of communication and motor therapists. In practice, this increasedtherapy time resulted in the presence of a speech and language therapist in moreintensive condition classrooms each day they were in session, while the speech and language therapists were available on an every-other-day basis for the less intensiveclassroom condition. Differences in program efficacy were evaluated by assessingchild and family outcomes, and by obtaining cost data. Method This study was conducted in conjunction with the early intervention program ofthe Jordan School District. The Jordan School District has a history of activeinvolvement in early intervention. Although prior to the 1987-88 academic year, .1. Jordan 124 early intervention services had been funded by the Utah Division of Social Service, the intervention services were housed in a school in the Jordan District. With the passage of P.L. 99-457 and State of Utah mandates, the district has taken over thefinancial and administrative responsibility of early intervention for preschoolerswith disabilities This has resulted in the district expanding early interventionclassrooms into neighborhood schools while retaining experienced staff. The Jordan District currently maintains early intervention rooms at three schools. The district offers a variety of intervention options ranging from home intervention, to variousclassroom mainstream options, to placement in neighborhood daycare centers.The early intervention program previously provided 5-days-per-week, 21/2 hours-per-day, classroom-based intervention services to a limited number of qualified children.Children who met both age and Utah State Office of Education developmentalcriteria, as explained in the Recruitment section below, were placed on a waitinglist, and classroom slots were filled on a first-come basis. With the transition of preschool services to school district control, the school district began servingall eligible preschoolers and providing transportation. These factors resulted ina change in the service structure of the preschool program to a 3-days-per-week, 2-hours-per-day program.This changein program intensity raised concerns from preschool providers,school administrators, and parents of children with disabilities. In conjunctionwith Early Intervention Research Institute (EIRI) support, the Jordan School Distr;ctreceived research funds from the Utah State Office of Education to examine thequestion of program intensity. The specific comparison investigated was establishedthrough negotiations with all participating agencies. Sub'ects.Subjects for this study came from four classrooms located at twoschools (two classrooms/school). All subjects were recruited for this study at thebeginning of the 1988-89 school year. Fifty-three children (28 less intensive, 25 Jordan 125 more intensive) between 36 and 62 months of age (mean = 50 months) participated in the study.Sixteen children in the less intensive group were male, and 8 males were in the more intensive group. The age equivalent for the children, based on the total score of the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI), ranged from 16 to 46 months (mean30 months).The majority of children were mild to moderately disabled. Usingadevelopmental quotient (DQ)calculated by dividing the BDItotalage equivalent by chronological age and ther multiplying by 100, 65% of children had DQsof 65 or below; no child had a DQ lower than 40. Recruitment,The criteria for acceptance into the early intervention program was that adopted by the Utah State Office of Education.This criteria specified thatpreschool-aged children were eligible for services if they demonstrated a delay fromthe norm of -1.5 or greater standard deviations in three developmental areas of -2.0 or greater standard deviations in two developmental areas, or -2.5 or greaterstandard deviation in one developmental area. Multiple assessments and evaluatorswere used by the school district in determining eligibility. Allparents ofchildrenidentified as disabled at the schools where theclassrooms were located were considered for possible placement inthis sudy. Parents were either !erbally informed or sent a letter regarding the study. Parentswere then given an informed consent form to read and to indicate their agreement orrefusal to participate. The site contact person was available to answer parentquestions and concerns. Approximately 5% of parents refused participation. Themajority of these refusals were from parents of younger children who desired the less intensive program.Assigni.ientto groups.During the one-year intervention study period, subjectsattended one of two schools, dependent on address. In each school, one of twoclassrooms was established as a more intensive classroom. Two teachers, one at each Jordan 126 school, conducted both a less and more intensive classroom. The time of day services were delivered (morning or afternoon) was counterbalanced across schools. As children were identified, the site contact sent information about the child (including a rating of degree of disability [mild, moderate, severe] based on theinitial district assessment) to the EIR1 research coordinator. This information wasused to place each child in a school by severity matrix (2 x 3).For subjects in each cell, there were four possible sequences of assignment (ABAB, ABBA, and BAAB, where A = the more intense group and B = the less intense group). A die was cast to determine the assignment sequence for each set of 4 children in each cell. This process was repeated for each cell of the matrix as the first child in a cell was identified.Attrition.Fifty-three subjects were recruited to participate in this study at the beginnin )f the 1988-89 school year. To date, none of the subjects have been lost to the study. Posttest data for two follow-up years were obtained for all 53 subjects and their parents.Demographic characteristics. The subject pool for this study is complete.Funds provided by the Utah State Office of Education were for only a single year.The demographic characteristics of the population sample in this study approacheswhat many consider the \"typical\" American family (see Table 1.3). Parents hadslightly more than a high school education and were in their early 30s. In 92% ofthe families, the parents of the child were married and living together, and themother was the primary provider of child care (96%); families had an average of fourchildr2n, including the child with disabilities. Fathers worked a 40-hour week ineither blue collar or technical/managerial positions; mothers did not work or heldpart-time jobs. The average family income was $30,00. All the families spokeEnglish as their primary language, and the majority (94%) were Caucasian. 122 Jordan 127Demographic differences between the less and more intensive subjects can beevaluated using the p-values and effect sizes given in Table 1.3. Statisticallysignificant differences (p <.10) existed for percent male subjects, years ofeducation for the mother, hours per week mother was employed, and number of siblings.The more intensive subjects had more educated mothers who worked more each week thanthe less intensive subjects. The more intensive group also had a higher percent ofchildrenin daycare than the lessintensive group. The number of siblings infamilies receiving the less intensive treatment was higher than in the more intensiveintervention families.

(Hasty123BEST COPYAVAILABLE Jordan 128All of these characteristics on which demographic differences were found are complementary. More educated mothers could be expected to work more as theirearnings in jobs outside the home would, on average, be higher. Families with two parents who work also could be expected to have a higher mean income than families where only the father is employed. Families where the mcJier is employed outsidethe home more hc \"s use daycare more than families where the mother works only inthe home or fewer hours outside the home. Finally, the number of siblings is higherfor the less intensive group who use daycare less and have relatively less educated mothers.It has been shown that, on average, more educated parents tend to havefewer children. More siblings raises the cost of using daycare and lowers thebenefits from the mother working outside the home. Logically, these differencesbetween the demographic characteristics of the more and less intensive subjects andtheir families are interconnected.The results of the analysis of pretest differences on 17 demographic variablesindicate differences between the groups as the intervention began. In some cases,these differences favor the more intensive group and in others the less intensive group.For example, the more intensive group has better educated mothers and higherincomes, but the less intensive group has a higher percentage of both parents livingat home and a higher percentage of fa,ners employed as technical/managerial levelor above.In most cases, the differences were quite small. If there i, any biasin the random assignment, it would slightly favor the more intensive group. Analysis ofcovariance,utilizingthosevariablesforwhichpretestdifferencesweresignificant, was used to adjust for biases that may exist through random assignment. Intervention ProgramsThe early intervention program of the Jordan School District was mandated toprovide services to all children with disabilities, ages 3 to 5 years, who residedwithin district boundaries. The majority of these children were served in two 1\" 4'4 Jordan 129 districtschools that also served as elementary schools for children without disabilities.Other service options were possible (home services, self-containedschool placement, services in a daycare center) and were dictated by child needs.To study the program intensity question, classrooms within the two most populousschools within the district were selected for research involvement. Children in boththe less and more intensive programs were located at each school.Where the question of importance in this study was program intensity, it was critical that other intervention factors be held as constant as possible. At each school, teachers had morning and afternoon sessions. Two teachers were involved inthis study (one per school), and each taught a less and more intensive classroom.At one school, thelessintensive class was a morning class, at the other an afternoon class. This arrangement helped control for differences resulting fromfactors other than intensity.One difference in the two schools was one of the schools (one less and onemore intensive condition classroom) utilized a reverse mainstreaming arrangement toprovide services. In this school, regardless of condition, the classrooms werecomposed of 50% children without disabilities three days per week. The classroomsat the other school, although not similarly mainstreamed, attempted to provideintegrated services with children in the kindergarten and first grade classrooms acthat !chool.The frequency and nature of these contacts varied considerably at this school.Childrenwereinitiallyassessedfor earlyinterventionplacementbyatransdisciplinary ter.1 of professionals using norm-referenced assessment instruments.These assessment protocols were then forwarded to the teacher for eligible children;receipt of further assessment for speech/language or motor therapy was based on thisevaluation. 1`)\"-)t_ Jordan 130 Onceenrolledintheprogram,thechildreceivedacriterion-referenced assessment by the teacher. If determined appropriate at evaluation, or if suggestedby the teacher, the therapists working with that teacher and classroom providedfurther specific assessments. Information from all these sources was then combined at a meeting, in which the parent participated, to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for the chijd. The IEP then dictated the specific nature of intervention services for that child.Each classroom consisted of approximately 15 children. The majority of these children were in this study, but children who were not participating in the intensitycomparison could also have been in one of the less intensive classrooms. Eachclassroom was staffed by one certified teacher who had access to paraprofessionalaides, communication therapists, physical and occupational therapists, and a behavior specialist.Access to aides and communication therapists varied by condition as described below. Child need (as per the IEP) dictated access to motor therapistsand the behavior specialists, and this was equally distributed across conlitions.Teachers were free to select curricula of their choice, and classroom activitieswere drawn from different curricula. The primary curriculum for all classrooms canbe described as a theme-based, developmentally appropriate one focused on teachingskills embedded in the daily activities. Both the teachers and communicationtherapists used this approach which focused on naturalistir. teaching (c.f., Haring& Innocenti, 1989).The daily organization of the classrooms was similar, regardless of experimental condition.The teacher established anumber ofactivities that the childrenalternated through during the day. These activities were either directed by theaides or the teacher. Children rotated through these activities in small groups.Generally, teachers selected a number of themes that were emphasized during a school week.For example, the color green, the shape of a square, and the concept underLU Jordan 131were weekly themes. Large group activities, such as singing and calendar, werescheduled between other activities. Children were provided a snack activity each day.Children in need of more individualized instruction, as dictated by child need,were pulled from other activities for individual or smaller (2-3 children) group instruction.Individualized instructional activities werl usually conducted by the teacher.Evaluation of child IEP objectives was built into the IEP. Data on objectiveswere collected daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-annually, dependent on the objective.Specific criteria were set for each objective to guide evaluative activities.Less intensive intervention program. This program consisted of a 3-days-per-week, 2-hours-per-day intervention service. The teacher:child ratio in the classroom was1:5,resultingineachclassroombeingstaffedbyateacherandtwoparaprofessional aides. Communication therapy was provided primarily through aconsultation model where classroom staff took primary responsibility for goals andimplemented activities as appropriate throughout the school day. The communicationtherapist was in the classroom approximately every other school day. Some childrenreceived individualized therapy from the therapist on these days. In contrast tothe more intensive intervention program, there was no group communication therapyActivity conducted in the less intensive intervention program.More intensive intervention program. Children in this group received 5-days-per-week, 2-hours-per-day intervention services. The teacher:child ratio in thisclass was enhanced from the standard program and consisted of a 1:3 ratio; oneteacher and four paraprofessional aides per classroom. Communication therapy wasdelivered primarily through a consultation model, but the therapist was allowed moretime to work with teachers. The communication therapist was in these classroomsevery school day. The communication therapist, in addition to consultation andindividual therapy, conducted alarge group communication activity and conducted Jordan 132snack-time activities such that naturalistic language teaching interventions were included.Communication therapy occurred more often for the more intensive groupand the large group activity was undertaken only in the more intensive group. Treatment VerificationA number of procedures were implemented to verify that the interventions werebeing implemented as intended. Table 1.4 presents some of these data. One methodto verify that treatment was received was through child attendance data. Attendanceproblems in an intensity study could significantly affect research conclusions.Daily attendance records were kept by teachers, and these were forwarded to EIRImonthly.Regular attendance by subjects in both intensity groups is indicated.

If the child was attending but in poor health, results may be compromised. Parentscompleted a health questionnaire at Posttests #1 and #2. Questions regarding a variety of health issues were asked. No differences between groups were found on any of these health measures for Posttest #1. General health data are presented in Table 1.3.Posttest #2 results are being evaluated.In a study such as this, it is possible that the parents of children in the lessintensive group were supplementing their child's education with private therapies or instruction. Questions were asked at Posttest #1 and #2 to examine this issue,andparentsreportedinvolvement inthesesupplementalactivities.Supplemental hours of speech therapy, motor therapy, and daycare are reported in Table 1.3.No significant differences were found on the supplemental activities for Posttest #1.Other areas also relate to treatment ver,fication. To determine if teachersof children during the one year intervcntion perceived differences in the skilllevels of parents, they were asked to rate each parent regarding parent supporttheir child, knowledge of the intervention process and their child's development,and attendance at required activities. Nc differences were found between the parentsin the two groups on any of these measures.Teachers and other support staff were also evaluated by their superviscr (thesite contact) regarding their teaching techniques. An evaluation criteria developed by EIRI was u5dd. Teachers and communication therapists at both schools were ratedes being in the upper 25% of professionals with whom their supervisor had worked.The respective ratings, based on a 30-point scale, of the teacher and communicationtherapist were: 30 and 30 for one school; 24 and 28 at the other school.Another aspect of treatment verification was parent satisfaction with theprogram.Parent satisfaction was assessed through a seven-question scal completed Jordan 134 at posttest.The results of this questionnaire are presented in Table 1.2. No group differences were .uund except on hose questions assessing satisfaction with child progress and the general program. Parents in the more intensive group were moresatisfied with both the progress their child had made and the program in general. It should be noteo that average parent satisfaction in all arc.as addressed represents high levels of satisfaction. Differences occur within a narrow buundary of positive satisfaction.Site review.A major source of treatment verifiration information was a site review conducted by i site coordinator. The purposes of this review were to (a) coliect information about the nature and quality of early intervention services thatwere being delivered, (b) verify that the research being conducted by EIRI was beingimplemented as intended, end (c) collect assessment data that may have been usefulto site administrators to guide internal changes and for use when seeking technical assistance.Purpose (a) and (b) were relevant ix treatment verification.A site review was conducted on April 11, 1989. The site review was conducteo by a team consisting of: (a) the Jordan site coordinator; (b) the site contact, ChrisGiacovelli; (c) John Killoran, Preschool Specialist for the Utah State Office of Educatthn; and (d) Jeannette Misaka, Professor of Special Education at th,! University of ULah.The site review was structured by the EIRI developed Treatment Verification Guide.kA copy of the site review report and treatmen4: verification guide can beobtained from EARL)Site review findings indicated that the Jordan School District Early Interv-ention Program was delivering appropriate, quality intervention services. Variablesthat distinguished different intensities of programs were being full.%. implemented.The less and more intensive classrooms were clearly ci4stinct with respect to student:teacher ratios, number of days per week the intervention occurred, and frequency of 130 Jordan 135 speech and language therapy. Staff of the Jordan Preschool were qualified, enthusi-astic professionals whose goal was to provide quality services to preschool- aged children with disabilities. Teachers were commended on use of developmentallyappropriate classroom activities and naturalistic teac.hing strategies. The program was competently administered and had in place a well-developed procedures manual.Tie program-developed transition procedures for information transfer were excellent. Minor suggestions for improvement were made regarding: daily lesson plans, data collection, TEP development, assessment for program entrance, and training for aides. No threats to the validity of the research study were found.Ecobehaviora 1 assessment. A final major source of treatment verification was the as!..essment of the ecobehavioral differences between classrooms. A concern with this intervention was whether classroom contexts and teacher behaviors varied for classrooms of different intensity. It is possible that time differences (hours/week)may not result in actual program intersity differences.For example, Carta et al.(1988) examined preschool programs and found two that operated for different lengths of time, but where the intensity was equivalent. To account for possibilities such as this,and to examine program differences that are related to intensity, an ecobPhavioral observation instrument was used. Ecobehavioral observation assessesprogram variables through systematic observaticn and measures moment-to-moment effectsoftheinteractionbetween environment (classroom contexts), teacher behavior, and student behavior (c.f., Carta et al., 1988). The Ecobehavioral 196C;) was used for this observational assessment.ihe ESCAPE was designed for use in preschool environments that serve studentswith disa)ilities. The ESCAPF assesses three major features of preschool earlyintervention programs: (1) the program ecology, (2) the behavior of teachers, and (3) the behavior rf child participants. These three major categories are subdividedinto 12 subcategories (see Table 1.5). All variables are recorded on a 15-second131 Jordan136Table 1.5ESCAPE Variable and Categories Within Variables for Jordan intensity Study Ecology VariablesA.Designated ActivityThe overall format on structure of the activity in which the teacher has placed the target child.SnackFine MotorStoryLanguage ProgrammingB.Activity InitiatorPlayMusic/Dance/RecitationSelf-CareTransitionClean-upGross Motor The person who selected the activity in which the target child was engaged.Teacher Child No oneMaterialsObjects with which the target child is engaged or attending toLarge Motor EquipnntManipulativesBathroom D.LocationThe physical placement of within a groupEqualNone the target child's interacting.AideSubstitute TeacherInstructionalAudio-VisualOther studentAcademic WorkGross Motor BehaviorsTransitionTarget child and others No one attention, engagement, and for participation.PretendingSinging/Reciting/DancingAttention NonePreacademicsClass BusinessTime Out Pretend Play ToysFood or Food Preparation On Equipment Volunteer DisapprovalDiscuss.onVerbalNo Rasponse Other than target Child ManipulatingSelf-care (continued) 132 Jordan 137[7Table 1.5 (continued)ESCAPE Variable and Categories Within Variables for Jordan Intensity Study K.Competing BehaviorsCompeting behaviors are those which are commonly considered to be unacceptable.Acting-out L.Verbal Bei,e AorVerbal or signed PeerSelf-stimulationNone UndirectedNo Talk momentary time-sampling system where all categories are scored over a one-minute period.Each subcategory is examined and scored within a 15-second time period.ESCAPE observations were conducted in April, 1989. Each child was observed forthree10-minutesamples,distributed across differentdaysandtimeperiods.Observations were conducted on all children in all classrooms. The only exceptionwas one more intensive intervention subject who left school before observations wereconducted.To assess the reliability of the observation system, two observers recorded dataconcurrently and independently for 25% of the samples. Agreement between observers,calculated as the percentage of intervals in which both observers selected the samecategory for a particular variable, averaged 95% across variablez\" with a range from86% fo 100%. Results from the ecobehavioral observation are presented in Table 1.6. Thitable presents mean percentages of time that each variable was observed and analysesconducted on these variables. In addition, engagement variables are presented.Engagement values are determined based on a child's behavior across all studentbehavior categories during a single interval. Appropriate engagement is hypothesizedto be the primary behavior contributing to child development (Carta et al., 1988).133 Jordan138Table 1.6Percentage of Time in Categories Observed by the ESCAPE for the Jordan Intensity Study VariableLess Intensive More (conunued)Percentage of Time in Categories Observed by the ESCAPE for the Jordan Intensity StudyLess Intensive More Intensive ES1 Than Child 28.08.02823.511.524.10-.56Target Child and Others Child Only 10.57.52810.69.524.97.01 .61.3281.52.624.17.69 w/Other Behavior 24.715.82823.911.224.84-.05Appropriate-Not Engaged w/Other Behavior 2.23.8282.94.824.54.18 It ES - i (more) -(less)SD (less) These results should be interpreted conservatively. Multiple t-tests wereconducted to obtain comparative data and may result in findings of s gnificance, evenwhen the groups are comparable. A difference that emerges is that the less intensiveclassroom more often used preacademic activities for instructional purposes. The 125 Jordan 140finding from the designated activity category is supported by results from the materials category, and student target behaviors category.These findings suggest that some differences between the groups existed in theway that time was spent by the two groups although the differences for most categories were not significant. Examining variables within and across the teacher,location, and materials categories, the groups appear more similar than different.Teachers, overall, responded similarly to children in both groups. In the student behavior categories, the different groups may have been required to perform differenttarget behaviors, although levels of appropriate engagement were similar between the groups.These results suggest that the time of the children in both groups was spent engaged in very similar activities. The major difference between the two groups wasthat the children in the more intensive classroom engaged in these activities formore days per week than the children in the less intensive group.The intensity differences are supported by the finding that the subjects in themore intensive group spent significantly more time in small groups, while the lessintensive children were in large groups more often. Although the children in bothgroups were engaged in similar activities during the time spent 'n groups, theintensity differences were designed to provide a higher teacher:child ratio for thetime that subjects were engaged; the data in the grouping category supports that result.Cost of alternative interventions. The cost analysis for this study wdsconducted during the 1988-89 school year. Costs are based on those classroomsinvolved in the study (two less intensive, two more intensive). Cost estimates arebased on a class of 15 students. Even though the number of subjects for the studywas not 15 per class in all classes, classes were designed for 15 students. Costdata were obtained using the ingredients approach described earlier. As shown in Table1.7,each alternative used direct service and administrative personnel, Jordan 141 occupancy, equipment, transportation, and materials and supplies in varying amountsaccording to the intensity of program. Cost estimates on Table 1.7 are in 1990 dollars.In addition, undiscounted costs and costs discounted at real rates of 3% and 5% are given.Table 1.7Cost Per Child for Jordan Intensity Study Resources Less Intensive More Intensive I.UNDISCOUNTED COSTSAgency ResourcesDirect Services $1,709 $3,570AdministrationPreschool 623 $3,531IMO$6,003$6,238 The average cost per child for the less intensive program is divided by thenumber of days those children received intervention, 117 days, to obtain the averagecost per day equal to $25.68 per child. Similarly, the more intensive program, whichprovided 195 days of intervention per child, cost $27.22 per child per day. Dailycosts were roughly equivalent. The differencein average total cost per childbetween the more and less intensive programs clearly results from the extra days ofintervention rather than other cost differences.137 Jordan 142The three-dayprogram operated one morning and one afternoon class for two hoursper day, three days per week.Direct service personnel included a teacher, a speechand language therapist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and twoaides in each class. The five-dayprogram also operated a morning and afternoonsession.Classes were held for two hours per day, five days per week. The samestaff conducted the five-day intervention with the addition of two aides.Of course,direct service staff reported devoting more of their total FTE to the five-dayprogram.The salaries and benefits for direct service personnel were determinedaccording to their FTE devoted to each program alternative.Preschool administrative personnelincluded salaries and benefits for theprogram director and a secretary.Interestingly, they reported spending approximate-ly the sameproportion of FTE on admi-istrative duties for both programs. Districtadministration includes the school principal, the special education director, andother necessary district administration, as well as the bus drivers and bus aides.The administrative cost of operating the program on the district level was calculatedaccording to the district's indirect rate for operating federalprograms (1.1%).Occupancy charges, includingspace, maintenance, utilities, and insurance costs werebased on the school district leasing cost of $6 persquare foot per year. Onethousand thirteen square feet were allocated for the three-day program, and 1,688square feet for the five-day program.Annual equipment cost was determined by takinginventory of all instructional materials, office furniture, and equipment. Marketreplacement values were then applied to each item, costswere annualized accountingfor interest and depreciation, and prorated according to usage by each alternative.Childtransportation includedfuel,maintenance,depreciation, andtheannualized cost of car seats/restraints. As previously noted, the cost fordrivers,bus aides, andtransportationadministrationare included under \"administration.\"Staff travelwas based on actual mileage (at $.205 per mile) for the teachers and138 Jordan 143therapists travel related to the respective intervention programs. The cost ofmaterials and supplies were assessed based on actual usage of these items by each alternative. Data CollectionAt pretest, parents of each subject who participated in the study provideddemographic information. All children were administered the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) (Newborg et al., 1984). The BDI measures five developmental domains:personal-social, adaptive, motor, communication, and cognitive. A total BDI score, based on all domains, can also be determined. The BDI is being used to assess childoutcomes for each of the studies conducted by EIRI. This measure was selected for ..isebased onthe finding of anexpertpanelconvenedtohelp EIRIdetermineappropriate measures. (More information on the BDI and other EIRI measures may befound in the EIRI 1987/88 Annual Report.)Parents of children in the study also completed the following scales of familyfunctioning at pretest: Parenting Stress Index (PSI; Abidin, 1986), Family ResourceScale (FRS; & Leet, Family Support Scale (FSS; Dunst et al., 1984),Family Inventory of Life Events (FILE;McCubbin et al., 1983),and the FamilyAdaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales III (FACES III; Olson et al., 1985).These measures assessed, respectively: parent stress,family resources, familysupport, occurrence of recent significant life events, and functioning of the familyin respect to an \"ideal\" family. When possible, the FSS was completed by both parents.These family measures are part of a core battery of instruments used by EIRI.As discussed earlier, family functioning has been an overlooked variable inearly intervention research (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Dunst, 1986).Although,theoretically, it is assumed early intervention will effect families (Bronfenbrenner,1979), the specific areas that may be impacted are unknown and may vary dependent 139 Jordan 144 on type of intervention. The battery of family functioning measures used here will help to elucidate areas of functioning that may be affected.For each of the two posttests, a similar course of events oc ed.Parents of children in the study returned for a test session with their child.The core measures described above were again completed.Parents also provided information on aspects of treatment verification.Also, at Posttests #1 and #2, a number of measures unique to this study were administereH.These complementary measures were used to address issues related to the type of EIRI study (e.g., intensity, program variation, etc.) being investigated.One measure completed by both the teacher and parent was the System to Plan Early ChiAhood Services (SPECS) (Bagnato & Neisworth, 1989). SPECS evaluates adultperceptions of child capabilities on 20 developmental dimensions, which encompass seven domains. Impressions of the child may lead to differences in how teachers andother significant adults interact with the child. Staff of the Jordan programexpressed their opinions that the intensity differences may impact more heavily onthe social/survival skills than on developmental skills. Therefore, this instrument was selected.In response to similar concerns, the Cooper-Farran Behavior Rating Scale (CFBRS)(Cooper & Farran, 1988) was completed by teachers. The purpose of the CFBRS is toassess behaviors necessary for successful kindergarten adjustment. The CFBRSassesses both interpersonal and work-related skills. TheJosephPreschoolandPrimarySelf-ConceptInventory(Joseph)was administered to children. The Joseph is a child-a:ministered test of self-concept.Self-concept may be an area of development affected by early intervention that mayimpact on future school success.Recruitment, training, and monitoring of diagnosticians. Diagnosticians whoadministered the BDI and Joseph were either graduate students or certified teachers140 Jordan 145who were nut engaged in full-time work in Special Education or Psychology at either UtahStateUnivers'tyortheUniversityofUtah.Alldiagnosticians werespecifically trained in the use of the BDI. This training included an extensiveinservice on BDI administration and scoring. Each examiner was also required toadminister a minimum of three BDIs, two of which were observed for quality control.Further, each examiner was \"shadow scored\" for reliability at least once during each test period.For Posttest #1, an average of 9% of all tests were \"shadow scored\"for interrater reliability. Average agreement was 90% and ranged from 77 to 100%.Eleven percent of all tests were shadow scored for Posttest #2, and average agreementwas 91% with a range of 84 to 97%.For Posttest #1, Josephs were administered by a graduate student in the School Psychology Program at the University of Utah. The site coordinator provided trainingon the Joseph prior to the first administration. Children were administered theJoseph during their school day. Posttest #2 Josephs were administered by the samediagnosticians who gave the Battelle. Each examiner received training in the Josephfrom the site coordinator and the assessment coordinator prior to Posttest #2administration.Pretesting.Pretest data were collected at the beginning of the academic year.The specific measures administered and procedures for administration have beendetailed above.First posttesting. All children in the study were administered their firstposttest at the end of the first academic year (May and June). Posttesting consistedof the core and complementary measures described above. The results of Posttest #1are presented and discussed below.Second posttestina. The second posttesting was completed in June, 1990. Thecore and complementary measures described earlier were administered to all 53children who completed intervention. The results of Posttest #2 analyses arepresented and discussed next.141 Jordan 146Results and Discussion Thus far, data have been collected one year and two years after the intervention was initiated. Children participated in the different intensities of interventionfor only one year. During the second year, an equal number of children from thecontrol and experimental groups were enrolled in preschool programs, while 11 of the control children and 7 from the experimental group were enrolled in public schoolkindergdrten programs. A number of children were enrolled in mixed school programs,this was true for 6 of the control and 8 of the experimental children. The mixedprograms were most often special education classrooms which served children of different ages. Overall, there were not large differences in the post-intervention school placements of children from the study. The results of Posttest #1 represent an immediate test of the effects of the different intensity of services provided to children in the study. Posttest #2 is a follow-up to the intensity question and willprovide information regarding whether differences between groups appear some timeafter treatment and whether initial differences are maintained through time. Comparability of Groups on Pretest MeasuresThe comparability or groups on demographic characteristics was presented inTable 1.3 and discussed earlier. A difference was observed for 5 of 17 variablesin those comparisons. Group differences on family and child pretest measures arepresented in Table 1.8. Using the same cut-off value for assessing significance asin the demographic analysis (p < .10), subjects were comparable on all BDI domains,on the BDI Total score, and for chronological age at pretest. This is supported bythe average ES across child and family measures, which equals -.03. On measures ofparent and family functioning, group differences were found only on the FACES measureof cohesion.Parents of subjects in the less intensive group indicated a strongerconnection of individual family members to the family than the more intensive group.142 Jordan147Table 1.8Comparability of Groupson Pretest Measures for Jordan Intensity Site VariableLess Intensive More Intensive (SD)n (Sr.\")nValueES&Age in 714.82855.511.025.78..oe 61.513.62861 Parenting Stress Index (PSI)\"Total 237.529.928233.755.425.75.13 (range 101 to 504)Child Related 112.517.928114.630.325.78-.12 (range 54 to 270)Other Related 125.019.128119.130.125.39.31 (range 101 to 504)Family Adaptation andCohesionEvaluation Scales (FACES)Adaptation 4.02.5284.53.325.54-.2 0 to 26)Cohesion (range 0 Resourcl Scale to of 9.85 12811.47.925.40- 31 (range 0 to 71) NOTES.Statistical analysis for BDIscores were conducted using raw scores for eari of the scales.For ease of interpretation,the information in this table hasbeen converted from theraw scores to a ratioDevelopment Quotient (DO) by dividing the \"age equivalent\" (AE) score reported in the technical manual foreach child's rawscore by the child's chronological age at time of testingScores for each subscale ofthe FACES are derivedfrom the \"ideal\" scorereported in the reported in the table indicate thedistance from \"ideal' inraw score unitsA score of 0 is bestAnalyses for the FL'S and FRS are based on raw scoresindicating number ofsupports or resources reported as being availableHigner scores are considered betterFor the FSS, thescore presented represents the sum of perceived support divided by Viz (lumber ofreported sources.The PSI and FILEare based on raw scoreswhere lower scores areconsidered betterEffect Size (ES) is definedhere as the differencebetween the groups (MoreIntensive minus Less Intensive) on the ANCOVA adjusted scores, dividedby the unadjustedstandard deviation of theLess Intensive Group (seeGlass, 1976: Tallmadge,1977 and Cohen, 1977 fora more general discussionof the concept of EffectSize).For the PSI, Faces. andFILE, the numerator for the ES is calculatedas: Less Intensive minus More Intensive as lowerscores are preferred143 Jordan 148For all otKer measures of family functioning, including the measures that would suggestdifferences intheareasoffamilystress,familyresources,family structure,andavailablefamilysupportsystems,thetwogroupswerenotsignificantly different when they entered the study. Overall,the groups were comparable on child and family functioning measures at pretest. MeasurescdFamily and Child FunctioningFor Posttest #1 and *2Effects for the measures of family and child functioning were obta.ned usingan analysis of covariance procedure completed on SPSS-PC. Analysis of covariance procedures were used for two reasons: (a) to increase the statistical power of thestudy by reducing error variance; and (b) to adjust for any pretreatment differenceswhich were present between the groups. In either application, the degree to whichanalysis of covariance is useful depends on the correlation between the covariate(s)selected and the outcome variable for which analyses are being done. However, sinceone degree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, it is generally best to usea limited number of covariates (usually five or less) in any given analysis. Allpretest and demographic variables were considered as potential covariates. The finalselection of covariates depended on a judgment of which variable or set of variablescould be used to maximize the correlation or multiple correlation with the outcomevariable in question and still include those demographic or pretest variables forwhich there were the largest pretreatment differences. For example, BDI pretestpersonal/social score and number of siblings living at home were used as covariatesfor 12-month Battelle Personal/Social raw scores. The combination of these variablesreduced the amount of unexplained variance in the 12-month Battelle Personal/Socialraw scores better than other combinations of pretest and demographic variables. Ineach analysis, the specific covariates used are indicated in the table. 144 Jordan 149R6sultsofChild Functioning tor Posttest #1Twenty-three chilri functioning variables were examined and are presented inTableThe p values at 2 < .10 suggest significance for nine child functioningmeasures (BDI motcr, 30I cognitIve, and teacher PODS sensorimotor). The p-value of.00 for average length of intervention in days gives further evidence of the designdifferences between the more intensive intervention of the experimental group ascompared to the control group. Seven of the nine significant measures favor the more intensive group. Three of these measure sensorimotor development. The HI cognitiveand total scores also favored the exririmental subjs as did the Teacher ratingsof general and physical development. Parent ratings of general development favoredthe less intensive group so that the results in this area of rkild functioning areinconclusive.The CFBRS measure of Interpersonal Skills demonstrates a higher value for theless integsive subjects. This indicates better personal/social skills for thesesubjects as demonstrated in classroom situations. The CFBRS finding in the area ofinterpersonal skills is not reflected by the BDI personal/social domain. This mayhave occurred because the teacher completed the CFBRS, where the parent reported onpersonal/social skills for the BDI.It is clear from these results that the more intensive intervention resultedin higher motor functioning. The evidence also suggests that higher intensityprogramming increased cognitive and overall child development as well.

Child andparent characteristics such, as acceptability and social isolation, may affectfeelings of cohesion and enmeshment in those families. FACES attempts to measurethe level of family satisfaction by evaluating the difference between actual familyfunctioning in areas like bonding, coalitions, and interests and those perceived bythe family as idealfunctioning for the same areas. The lessintensive groupindicated that their ideal picture of family cohesion was closer to the family'sactual level of cohesion than the more intensive group's responses indicated. Itis possible that the increase in motor skills of the more intensive grouprelative to those of the less intensive group improved the more intensive group's stressscore,in particular as it affected health of the family. Of the tenvariables of family functioning that were evaluated, it may be more significant thateight of these were not significant. The differences in the remaining two may bedue to sampling fluctuation.

Results of Family Functioning tor Posttest *2The results of Posttest #2 measures of family functioning are presented inTable 1.12.While the results show no significant differences between the groupson the Parent Stress Index (PSI), the groups do differ on the Adaptation measure ofFamily Adaptability and Cohesion (FACES), the Family Resource Scale and the FamilySupport Scale. The p-values for these measures are significant using a cutoff of p < .10.The less intensive families report a higher FACES adaptation score, suggestingthat they are less flexible and able to change in a variety of situations. The FACESmeasure of Cohesion, while it favors the less intensive group, is not significantnor is the FACES total, which incorporates measures of adaptability and cohesion notsignificantly different between groups. The more intensive families also scoredlower on the Family Resource Scale, indicating that they have fewer of the resourceswhich are valuable to families. The total FRS incorporates measures of physical andfinancial resources as well as time resources.

Conclusions The results described here are based on two posttests. This study compared twocommon intensities of preschool intervention for children with disabilities; a 3-day-per-week vs. a five-day-per-week program. Results from the Battelle Developmen-tal Inventory, on the motor, cognitive and total scores favored the more intensive 151BEST COPY AVAILABLE Jordan 156 group for the first posttest only. These differences were virtually nonexistent by the second posttest. Parent and teacher perceptions of child motor development weresimilarly affected by the program at Posttest #1; both favored the augmented subjects.This difference inparent and teacher perceptions of subjectshad disappeared by Posttest #2. The more intensive group achieved lower development oninterpersonal skills as rated by teachers for both Posttest #1 and on work-related skills for Posttest #2.The results from measures of family functioning are mostly equivocal. Parent stress was higher in the less intensive group for Posttest #1, this difference was not significant for Posttest #2. The less intensive group was more cohesive at bothposttests, although this was significant only at Posttest #1. The more intensive group, while equivalent on the FACES adaptability score at Posttest #1, had scores suggesting a more adaptive family un for Posttest #2. The FRS favored the lessintensive group, while the FSS favored the more intensive group at Posttest #2. It is very possible that these small family effects are not due to the intervention butare the result of other events affecting families.Overall, these results suggest a benefit on developmental skills resulting from the more intensive program immediately following intervention. This difference didnot persist so that by Posttest #2 the groups were, for the most part, equivalent.The gainsin motor skills made by the more intensive subjects as measured by theeffect size of the BDI and SPECS implied a 1/3 to 1/2 standard deviation increase inmotor skills above the control subjects.This temporarily moved the more intensive subjects from the second percentile level of motor development to the fifthpercentile for their age group. The c)gnitive and total measures of developmentsuggest a 114 standard deviation gain for the more intensive group above the control group.As was true of the motor differences, the cognitive and total scores didnot exist at Posttest #2. The temporary nature of these gains is not surprising as 15 2 Jordan 157it is confirmed by another intensity study (Sandow et al., 1980) which found similarimmediate differences that disappeared with time.A one year of 1/4 to 1/2 a standard deviation increase in motor, cognitive, andtotal development cost $2,000 per child, or a 70% higher level of spending on themore intensive group relative to the less intensive subjects to achieve these gains.Several questions remain unanswered by these results. Will the temporary gain inmotor skills of the more intensive children result in long-term gains in otherachievements in their lifetimes? Would the greater gains in motor skills persist if the more intensive subjects had coni.inued in more intensive center-based prslrams?There may be benefits that result from the increased spending of the more intensiveprogram that do not appear in the measures used to capture differences in child andfamily functioning. These differences may appear in the lives of the children as they move through primary and f::;condary school and into adulthood. These benefitsmust be weighed against program costs and the needs of a district. 153 NO/VI158NEW ORLEANS VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDY (NO/VI)Project #2 COMPARISON: Visually Impaired Children -- Weekly individualized parent-infantsessions versus parent group meetings.LOCAL CONTACT PERSON: David Slade, University NewOrleansEIRI COORDINATOR: Diane Orleans, LouisianaDATE OF REPORT: 4-8-1991 Rationale for Study Theimportanceofvisioninearly development is crucial (see discussions by Barraga,1985;Ferrell,1985;Fraiberg,1977; and Warren, 1984).By age three, infantswithvisualimpairmentsoften demonstratesocio-communicative andcognitive development patterns that arequantitatively and qualitatively different from their sighted peers (Ferrell, 1986; Warren, 1984). Ferrell (1986) stated that all of these secondary disabilities are preventable;theyoccurbecausetherehasnotbeensufficient,systematicintervention given to the child and his/her family. Although such a position is log-:cal, there is little evidence in the literature which either confirms or refutesthe value of systematic intervention in alleviating these secondary disabilities. Visualimpairment also causes adisruptionintheinteraction between the caregiver and child. Als (1983) observed that the infant with visual impairments signalsandcommunicatesdifferently.These signals are often distorted anddifficult to interpret, making positive, constructive interaction even more difficult NO/VI 159for parents who cften aie attempting to cope with the emotions of having an infantwith a disability. Rowland (1984) summarized the position of most researchersinvolved with children with visual impairments by stating, \"Theimportance of appropriate exchanges between mothers and infants cannot be overstressed.\"Though the importance of early intervention for children with visual impairments andtheirfamilieshasbeennotedfrequently inliterature,fewcontrolled prospectivestudieshavebeencompletedonchildren with visualimpairments, especially at the infant and toddler levels (Warren, 1984). Furthermore, even thoughresearchers speculate that intensive intervention for both child and family isnecessary, there isa dearth of evidence regarding the intensity with which thisintervention should be provided. Additionally, little data are found to assist inanswering the question of how to provide the best intervention (White et al., 1985- 86). Thisstudyofearlyinterventionforinfantsandtoddlerswithvisualimpairments compares the immediate and long-term effects of a comprenensive, home-based intervention in the form of one time per week parent-child sessions, with amuch lower intensity treatment of informal parent group meetings held approximately12 times per year. To set the context for this study, existing research on theeffectsof earlyintervention with visuallyimpairedchildren will firstbesummarized briefly. A description of this study will follow, providing a description ofthesubjectsandthealternativeinterventions, aswellastheresearchprocedures. Results based on the first two years of the study then will be presentedalong with conclusions. Review of Related FiesearchSince1969,eight studies with quasi-experimental designs and appropriateoutcome data have been conducted with visually impaired children in an attempt toprovidesomedegreeofobjectiveinformationontheeffectiveness ofearly NO/VI 160 intervention. The nature of these studies, including subjects, intervention, outcome measures,and resAts are summarized in Table 2.1. Unfortunately,as willbe discussed below, critical components necessary for previous studies to be considered well-controlled investigations were lacking.One of the most serious problems with past research is the lack of appropriate comparison groups; the visually impaired subjects were typicall compared to either normally sighted peers or a blind comparison group from a previous study (see Table 2.1).The current study improved upon these research designs by using random assignment of a sample of children with visual impairments to one of two treatment conditions.In addition to lacking appropriate comparison groups, the conclusionsof these previous studies are difficult to interpret because very little demographic information is presented about participating subjects (i.e., it is difficult to knowwhether subjects who come from families with high socioeconomic status responddifferentlytointerventionthansubjectswhocomefromfamilieswithlowsocioeconomic status, or whether subjects who are more severely visually impairedrespond differently than those who have moderate visual impairments). Because of the extensive demographic data collected as a part of this study, such questions can be examined.Another point relative to previous research is that exemplary services designedfor children with visual impairments have generally been described as needing to becomprehensive in nature, providing systematic instruction to the child as well asproviding parents with instructional strategies and support. Unfortunately, mostprevious saidies have not provided clear descriptions of their interventions. The lackofinformation about the expertise of the intervenors, specific trainingtechniques, curricula, and shaping procedures has made it difficult to understandthe comprehensiveness of previous treatments as well as making it difficult forothers to replicate the interventions (Guralnick & Bennett, 1987). The collectionof treatment verification data by the study, described more fully in a subsequent Table 2.1Summary of Early Intervention Studies Involving Children with Visual Impairments ReferenceChildren (age, n) Intervenlion Description Experimental Cesign Outcome Measures WeaknesSes Adelson& 10 Program and center basedtrainingemphasizingxplorationandindependence. center Freiberg (1977) 10 bilnd no otherhandicaps O'Brien (1976) 33 subjects.Birthr o 8tirs v.rilh mild to severe Olson (1963)lb VI 2 6 dos Rogow 11962) IC in earlier study.

Early intervention for children with visual impairments. In M. J. Guralnick & F. C. Bennett (Eds.),The effectiveness of early intervention for at-risk and handicapped children (pp. 318-321). Orlando, FL: Academic Press. BEST COPY AVAILABLE 158 NO/VI 162section, provides specific information facilitating replication of any effective treatments.The use of a home-based intervontion as the high intensity treatment was chosen for several reasons. Home-based programs serving young children who are disabledor at-risk are experiencing rapid growth, makingit one of the most typicalintervention models inthe field(Halpern,1984).Philosophically, there are numerous advantages to a home-ba;ed intervention and the involvement of the family. Some of the earliest advocates of home-based intervention, Shearer and Shearer (1976) argued that home-based intervention was good because:(1) Learning occurs in tne parent and child's natural environment.... (2)There ir direct and constant access to behavior as it occurs naturally....(3)Itismorelikely thatlearned behavior will generalizeandbemaintained.... (4) There is more opportunity for full family participationinthe teaching process.... (5)Thereis access to the full range ofbehaviors.... (6) Training of parents, who already are natural reinforcingagents, will provide them with the skills necessary to deal with the newbehaviors when they )ccur.... and (7) Because the home teacher is workingon a one-to-one beiis with the parents and child, individualization ofinstructional goal for both is an operational reality. (pp. 336-337)There are also ad antages to home based intervention that are more practical in nature.For rural ur low-income families, travel to a center location is oftendifficult. Additionally, some children have medical needs that make leaving the home difficult (Bailey & Simeonsson, 1988). In spite of these theoretical and practicaljustifications for home-based intervention, previous research has provided very little evidence about the effectiveness of home-based intervention, particularly forchildren with visual impairments. This controlled study comparing a well-designedtreatment serving both parent and child with a control condition of substantiallylower intensity which provides indirect services only to the parents, will addgreatly to the knowledge needed to respond to the aforementioned questions.As a third point, the majority of previous studies have also failed to measure critical outcomes that may have been affected by the intervention. Using a family-focused approach, the high intensity intervention is sensitive to the effects of the 159 NO/VI 163child on the total family, the effects of the family on the child, and the effects of externa' supports on the child and family. Through the use of measures sensitiveto these interactions, this stud will provide important assessment data that havebeen missing from previous studies (see Table 2.1). Fourth,longitudinaldata are needed to detemine whether effective earlyintervention programs continue to have a noticeable effect on children as they getolder (Warren, 1984).Though five of the eight previously cited studies withchildren with visual impaimnts had interventions that were at least eight monthsin duration, none of them provided information regarding long-term effects of thetreatment.Since this study includes outcome data for several years following thetreatment,itprovidessomeneededinformation concerning long-term treatment results.Finally, this study provides an economic perspective on eariy intervention.One would expect the intmsive program to be much more expensive. Therefore, it isimportant to find out 4hether the additional costs are justified in terms of thegains made by childre, or the effects on the family. Furthermore, itis importantto find out whether less expensive program such as the low intensity parent groupmeetings may result in some benefits (e.g., positive effects on family functioning)that may not be prosent in the more expensive program which focuses more directlyon child progress. Unfortunately, very little attention has been given to costanalysis issues in previous early intervention research, particularly with childrenwith visual impairments. Methods Services for children in both groups were funded by the Louisiana Office of Education.The service program was developed by a certified teacher of the visuallyimpaired with extensive experience in service provision and research. Staff who NO/VI 164provided direct services included special educators, a social worker, and consultingservice providers who are therapists at the Human Development Center at Louisiana State University Medical Center. The program was developed for the research projectand provided services to children with visual impairments and their families who would otherwise receive no services designed for children with visual impairments.The geographical area served included the area within a 60-mile radius of New Orleans.Other services available for 0- to3-year-old children with visual impairments were limited to programs designed to serve children with developmentaldelays or those that provided private motor and/or speech/language therapy. There was no other program in the area that provided programming specifically to meet the needs of children who are visually impaired. Consequently, most 0- to 3-year-old children with visual impairments inthis area have typically not received any services until they were 3 years old.Assistance in the identification of potential research subjects, as well as informationregardingvariousaspectsofthesubject'svision(i.e.,acuity, perception, and discrimination), was provided by the Louisiana State University (LSU) Eye Center. SubjectsA total of 36 children between the ages of 0 to 30 months were identified andrandomly assigned to groups as of July 1, 1990. The following section describes the recruitmentandrandomassignmentproceduresforthestudy.Demographiccharacteristics of children and families in each group are also summarized.Recruitment. Subjects were identified through referrals from the LSU Eye Centerand from pediatricians and ophthalmologists in the New Orleans area. Children whowere identified as potential subjects were screened by either the site liaison ora teacher and therapist. Each child was classified according to visual acuity,presence of other disabilities, and developmental level as follows. 161 Visual acuity: Handicappingcondition:1 = blind2 = severelyimpaired withcorrection3 groups.

(Refer to the EIEI 1986-1987 report for a more detailed description of the assignment procedures). On Ftruary 13, 1987, the initial group of 15 children identified during screenings inthe first two weeks of February were rank-ordered by age within the cells. Therandom assignment pattern was determined for each cell by a computer-simulated four- sided die.Children were assigned hAsed on this pattern within cells. Children whowere identified after that date were placed in the appropriate cell and assignedaccording to the assignment pattern.Demographic characteristics.

The more intensive intervention for0- through 30-month-o:d subjects consisted of parent-infant sessions in whichparents or primary caregivers and their children were given a systematic programindividualized to meet the needs of the family as well as the child.All infants/toddlers in the individualized treatment group were scheduled foran average of 1hour ofintervention services weekly. Generally,interventionservices were provided in the child's home. The activities incorporated dailyroutines, such as feeding, diapering and changing, as well as familiar toys and household items. In three instances, it was necessary for families tr travel to theprogram center for intervention services. The travel expenses for these families were covered through program funds.The model of intervention was based on the guidelines set forth by P.L. 99-457in regard to serving the families of children ages birth through 3 years of age.A case manager coordinated services for the family. The case manager was typically the education specialist, but depended on the unique needs of the family. Individ- ualized Family Service Plans were developed to meet needs of the child and family. 16'5 NO/VI169Table 2.4Comparability of Groups on Demographic Characteristics for NONIIntensity Study: Subjects Included in Posttest #1 Low Intensity High Intensity (SD) Age of child in monthsat pretestAge of mother in yearsAge of father In yearsPercent of Education-MotherYears of 40.8(16 7)1039.5employedPercent of mothers 35%1714%employed technicalmanagerial or above*Percent of fathers 38%1367% employed as or above*Mean total household income $25,264($17,316)17$3 (median) $27,500 17$172,871570 Percent receiving 24%1736% public assistance*Percent with mother as 82%1786% primary caregiver*Percent of children in 47%1715% day care is d..?fined here as the difference between the groups (high minus low) on the iby the standard deviation of the Low Intervention Group (see Glass, 1976; Tallmedge, 1977; andmore general discussion of the concept of Effect Size).

With some families, the role of caregiver varied among parents,grandparents, babysitter, and preschool teacher. In any event,the person withprimary caregiving responsibility for thechildatthetime wastheactive participant in the session. In instances in which a parent was not the primo.ycaregiver during program intervention sessions, every effort was made to share information with them in telephone contacts and other visits. For example, one child attended a regular preschool, 5daysa week,and the program teacher provided services there. Meetings were held between program staff, preschool staff, and theparent to discuss and plan strategies and exchange information. All parties were pleased with this pattern of service delivery, which appeared to be the most natural setting for this child.The degree of caregiver involvement inany one session was individualizedaccording to the needs and skills of the caregiver. The role of the intervenorduring the sessions may have been assumed almost entirely by the caregiver, withthe program teacher guiding and giving feedback. In other instances, the programteacher demonstrated while the caregiver observed. In most sessions, there was a combination of these patterns. New activities were generally first introduced bythe program teacher, who then instructed the caregiver in implementing the activity.Parents were involved in implementing stimulation activities, collecting data, andcharting behavior in the home between sessions.In addition to foc'!sing on specific needs of the individual infant/toddlers, the needs of the family in relation to the child were addressed. 1oeatment reflected the family's needs in regard to interacting with the child, developing their generalknowledge of visual impaiments, and improving their skills in encouraging theirchild's developp.int. Needs for assistance or guidance inobtaining communityservices such as medical or daycare services for their child were also addressed. 16s NO/VI. 172 The Louisiana Curriculum for Infants with Handicaps, which was developed by the staffoftheHumanDevelopment Center, formedthebasisfordevelopmentof intervention activities for this program. The activities in the curriculum take intoaccount the total child and the interactive nature of developmeA across domains.The curriculum was augmented with strategies addressing visual impairments.Activitie:, (lessons) were developed for the domains of gross motor, fine motor,cognition, self-help, social-emotional, and communication. Information with eachlesson included: area, goal, rationale, materials, cautions, teaching procedures,teaching notes, and evaluation criteria. A data collection sheet was available foruse by parents and program staff.A Curriculum Placement Instrument (CPI) for each domain was used for choosingactivities appropriate for the status of child and family. Modifications were madein specific activities in the curriculum, in consultation with the professionalstaff, to adapt them to the child's needs and as appropriate for the child's vision.In addition to the observation and modeling provided by the program teacher,parents were provided instructions on how to implement a specific lesson and the type of weekly data to be collected. Often parents requested information on a particulartopic related to visual impairment or child development. The home intervenorprovided supplemental information from the Reach Out and Teach curriculum (Ferrell, 1986).This is a manual designed to provide parents with information about visualimpairments and appropriate general stimulation activities.During 1987-1988, the education specialist was the primary contact personworking closely with the parents or other caregivers to provide the intervention.The education specialist planned sessions and activities, guided interventions,collected data, maintained attendance records and individual child folders, andcoordinated consultations and direct services from other professionals. These twoeducation specialists were certified teachers experienced in serving young children I 69 NO/VI173 with specialneeds. Thespeechtherapist,occupationaltherapist,physical therapist childand needsof the family, thespecialists were called uponfor consultation with the program teacher and/or parents, or forprovision ofdirect services.

Therefore, this service delivery model is onethat isrepresentativeof many programs serving children with visualimpairments.Low intensityparent the low intensitycontrol group wereofferedservicesinthe formofgroupmeetings which wereheld approximately 12 times per hour each.During 1987and the majority of1988, parentgroupmeetings about staffand fundingchanges, meetings 170 NO/VI 174in 1988-1989 were rescheduled to be held in two sessions, each session consistingof 6 weekly meetings. Although informal, there was always 4 specific topic fordiscussion, with readings assigned and time for questions and answers. Slides andtapes developed for use with Reach Out and Teach had also been used. After anintroductory meeting, appropriate professionals attended the meetings to discuss cognitive development, social skills, and temperament. Presentations focused on theeffects of visual impairment on these various areas of development with generalsuggestions for compensation. General stimulation activities were suggested, butno individualized treatment plans or activities were provided.After each presentation by a professional, parents were given time to askspecific questions and discuss issues of concern to them. These sessions also functioned as a support group, whereby parents with older children who were visuallyimpaired offered support and information to the parents of younger children. Treatment VerificationThe following procedures were used to verify that treatment was implemented as intended. Collection of attendance data. Parent and child participation in the individualsessions, as well as parent involvement in group meetings, were recorded accordingto length of session and staff involved. Non-attendance at regularly scheduledsessions was also recorded according to the reason for non-attendance (e.g., childillness, vacation etc.). Attendance data are summarized in Table 2.6 for subjects includedinPosttest #1.These data indicate that the high intensity, weeklyintervention group received almost nine times the number of intervention hoursreceived by the low intensity group. In addition to the differences and number ofhours of intervention received, the type of intervention was substantially different.In the high-intensity group, each hour of intervention included individualized,specifically focused developmental activity; wheleas in the low-intensity group, the 171 Table 2.6Treatment Verification Data for LSUNI intensity Study:Report of Services Received Between Pretest and Posttest #1NO/VI 175 Low Intensity High Intensity Variable (S10)n SDnValue Average length of intervention 12.7in months(2.0)1712.3(.5)14.46 Total number of hours of 3.4intervention(3.9)1629.2(8.8)13.00 Intervenor's rating of parent N/Ainvolvement with intervention(range 0 to 45)N/AN/A31.8(6.1)12 Receipt of additional therapeuticservices outside of assignedintervention% receiving no Speech/Language 94%therapy1769% 14.41 % receiving no receiving no preschool Evaluation of intervenors 24.2(range 0 to 30)1726.0 12 Parent satisfaction with 3.7services (range 0 to 4)(.5) 73.7(.5)12.84 hourofinterventionconsistedofgeneraldiscussionaroundissuessuchasdevelopmental milestones and facilitative strategies. Consequently, each hour of.intervention in the high-intensity group was much more likely to produce effects thanthe inter,ention in the low-intensity group. Thus, the study closely resembles atreatment versus no-treatment comparison.Parent report of time. Various strategies were used to measure parent report oftime spent working with their child forthoseinthe weekly intervention. However,accurateinformationwasdifficulttoobtain,primarily due tothenaturalistic learning and teaching approach of the program. Since the interventionin the high-intensity group stressed incidental learning activities to be integratedinto the parent and child's daily routine, a discrete measure of time was not 172 NO/VI 176 meaningful.Therefore,in lieu of a parent report of time, the intervenors ratedthe parents using a 9-item, 5-point Likert-type scale on their ability to integrateprogram suggestions at home. Examples of behaviors rated include the parent'sability to facilitate communication, encourage child to use functional vision, respond appropriately to cnild's initiation. The mean score for the high intensity group reflected moderate to good ability of parents to integrate home activities (see fable 2.6).Since parents inthe low intensity group were not expected to beinvolved in incidental teaching with their children, and no instructions were givento them as to how to be involved in such teaching, no measures were taken on thisvariable for the low intensity group.Additional services, Given this treatment intensity design, itis important to document any additional services that subjects may have received. There were few,if any, other services available, if parents were able to pay for them, in thestudy's geographical area designed to specifically treat children who are visually impaired.However,therewereotherservicesavailableforchildrenwith developmentaldelays.Parents could have accessed motor and/or communicativedisorders specialists, though thisis expensive.The Children's Hospital alsoprovided such therapies to families who were receiving public assistance. Althoughthere were other infant programs, these did not specialize in serving children withvisual impairments. Parents were not restricted from obtaining additional services,though it was unlikely that many such services would be obtained given the lack ofopportunities. The completion of the additional service form, described in thetreatment verification section, provioed the necessary information needed to monitoradditional services.Parents provided information via an interview with the assessment supervisorregarding any services that may have been obtained outside of the research programbetween Pretest and Posttest #1. Based on these data, few subjects received a 173 NO/VI 177 substantial amount of additional therapeutic services (see Table 2.6). Subjects in the hic!liintensity group reported the receipt of significantly more preschool or ...-s.In many cases, it was difficult to differentiate center-based daycare .a preschu,' program. If these services are combined, 60% of children in the low intensity grou, had no daycare/preschool, and 54% of the children in the high intensitygrouphadnodaycare/preschool; thismakesthetwogroupshighly comparable.Additional services data were also collected between Posttests #1 and #2. Many ofthe 'subjectsturned three years of age after Posttest #1,andnolonger participated in the original birth-to-three intervention to which they were assigned.Additional services data are only relevant for subjects under three years of age forthe purpose of determining any contamination of the two interventions in question.Information on subjects given between Posttest #1 and Posttest #2 indicates thatsubjects in the high intensity group averaged slightly more additional services (see Table 2.7).It is worthwhile to note that the percentage differences represent few subjects.One high intensity subject received speech and language therapy. Thedifferences in the daycare percentage (83% versus 67%) translates to one more highTable2.7Treatment Verification Data for LSU/VI Intensity Study:Receipt of Additional Services Outside of Assigned Intervention Between Posttest #1and Posttest#2 VariableLow Intensity High Intensity Value (SD)n no Speech/Language 650% 6.28 174 NO/VI 178 intensity subject. There were three high intensity subjects and one low intensitysubject involved in a preschool program. Again, it appears the overall differencesbetween groups receiving additional services is not significant.Parent satisfaction. Given the important role that parents play in receivingservices and providing intervention to their children, rating scales were developedto record parent's satisfaction with the services they are receiving based on their group assignments as well as the service provider's impression of the parents' levelsof knowledge, attendance, and support. Both forms are completed at posttest time. All obtained information was kept confidential. As shown in Table 2.6, parents from bothgroupsreporthighsatisfactionwiththeintervention inwhichthey participated.Evaluations of intervenors. To assistindetermining the quality of theintervention, ratings and rankings of the interventionists from both groups wereconducted internally by program supervisors, as well as externally by the projectsite coordinator and an independent reviewer. The program supervisors providedinformation about the quality of the intervention via a 5-point rating scale in theareas of skills, problem solving, work habits, relationships, communication, and attitude.The average score for the intervenors in the high intensity group was24.2, from a possible total 30 points. There was only one intervenor in the lowintensity group, and she received a total score of 26 out of 30. All intervenorswere then compared to professionals in similar positions and rated in either the top10%, top 25%, top 75%, or bottom 25%. Four of the six intervenors in the highintensity intervention were rated in the top 10%, and the remaining two were ratedin the top 25% of their peers. These results reflect a quality program as viewedby staff at the Human Development Center.In addition to these measures of treatment verification, a formal on-site reviewwas conducted in December, 1988, by the site coordinator. Based on observations of 175 NO/VI 179home intervention sessions, reviews of records, and interviews with staff, theprogram was providing the services as required for the study. A detailed report isavailable for more specific information.Dr. Kay Alicyn Ferrell, a well-respected authority on serving young children with visual impairments, provided an independent assessment of the program's abilityto meet the unique heeds of this population. This independent evaluation occurredin October,1989.Dr. Ferrell rated the program highly in the area of generalassessment procedures, supplementing standardized testing with observations of the childin the natural environment. She noted that attention to functional visionassessment and orientation and mobility assessment could be improved. She alsosuggested that more attention be given to the development of formal lesson plans anddata collection, althoughtheintervenor's records did provide good anecdotal information.IFSP development was rated as meeting all the criteria of a high-quality plan, and overall interaction with parents was viewed very positively. Dr.Ferrell stated that she was favorably impressed with the competencies of the staffin early childhood special education, even though they were not certified teachersof the visually impaired. Unfortunately, this dearth of trained specialists is aproblem throughout the country.Dr. Ferrell noted that the intervenors have done an admirable job, and wereserving visually impaired infants and their families far better than some agencieswith trained specialists. Dr. Ferrell stressed that the presence of professionalscertified in visual impairment alone does not necessarily equate to an appropriateearly intervention program. Expertise in early childhood development and familyintervention may be of greater importance to an intervention such as this. Theevaluation report in its e.A;rety is available for review upon request. 176 NO/VI 180Cost of Alternative InterventionsAnalysis of the cost data for the LSU VI project reflects the per child costsfor the individualized, weekly home-visit intervention versus the low intensity parent group intervention. These data were collected in June of1988 and are adjusted for inflation to 1990 dollars. The total cost at discount rates of 3% and 5% are presented at the bottom of Table 2.8. Discounting adjusts the costs for thereal rate of return that the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere. Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time.Since there had not been any major changes in the interventions, cost datawere not collected each subsequent year.Program costs were calculated using the ingredients approach. The ingrdientsapproach is a systematic, well-tested procedure for identifying dll of the socialcosts for implementing alternative programs, including costs that are often omittedfrom cost analysis such as contributed (in-kind) and shared resources. In this approach, an exhaustive list of resources used by each alternative is developed, andthe ingredients are costed according to observed market values (e.g., salaries) oropportunity cost (e.g., parent time). An opportunity cost is the value of a resource in its next best alternative use. For example, parents participating in interventionactivities could have been engaged in other productive activities; these foregoneactivities represent a cost to parents. Since we have no information about any one individual's opportunity costs, we estimated the value of an individual's time basedon national data. The amount of parent or non-parent volunteer time required forthe study was assigned the pecuniary value of $9 per hour based on the \"median usualweekly earnings for full-timt work\" plus benefits (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureauof Labor Statistics, 1989). As shownin Table 2.8, each alternative used varyingamounts of the indicated resources. The following sections describe the resourcesand costs used for the weekly home visit program and the parent group meetings. 177 NO/VI 181 Table 2.8Cost per Child tor LSU-Vl Site (1990 Dollars) Resources High Intersity (n=15) Low 8,027 1,048 Totals may not add up due to rounding errors. Hh intensftweeklhome-visit intervention. Salaries and benefits fordirect service and administrative personnel were determined according to their FTEdevoted to this aspect of the project. Direct service personnel included two teachers, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, a physical therapist, a social worker,a developmental pediatrician, and a temporary home-based teacher 178 NO/VI 182 hired for three months on a consulting basis. Administrative personnel included theprogram director, the principal, and a secretary. University administration wascalculated using the LSU indirect rate of 12.6% for general, departmental, andsponsored projects administration. Parent time was required for participation inhome visits, special sessions with the therapists, and for programming assessments.The opportunity cast of parent time ($9/hour) was applied to the average time (23.2hours) each parent spent on the project in 1987-88. However, the actual value ofparent contributions is probably much higher in this program than it appears sincethe majority of parent contribution was involved via incidental teaching strategiesthat are difficult to measure quantitatively. Thus, the actual estimation of value ofParent time ismostlikely an underestimate ofwhat theparents actually contributed.Occupancy charges, includingspace,maintenance,utilities,andinsurance costs, are based on office leasing costs in the area. Nine dollars persquare foot was applied to the 478 square feet used by the program (also pro-ratedaccording to FTE). Annual equipment cost was determined by taking inventory of allinstructional materials, office furniture, and equipment. Market replacement valueswere then applied to each item, costs were annualized accounting for interest anddepreciation, and pro-rated accordiny to the percent FTE worked on the project.Staff travel was based on actual mileage (at $.21 per mile) for home visits. Severalparents were reimbursed for travel to the center for weekly intervention services.For parents who were not reimbursed,information was collected viatelephoneinterview on the number of trips made to the center, the round-trip distance, andthe approximate time spentintravel.Parent transportation costs were thencalculated based on $.21 per mile and the opportunity cost of parent time ($9/hour)spentintravel.The cost of materials, supplies,and telephone charges wereassessed based on actual usage of these items. 7:J NOAI 183 Low intensity, _oarent_group meetings. Direct service costs for the lowintensity parent group meetings involved compensation for the group leader on a contractual basis. Various professionals assisted the group leader in addressing specific topics on a volunteer basis. The opportunity cost of their time was determined at $25 per hour for 9 hours. Program administrative cost included a small portion of the site liaison's FTE. University administrative cost was based on the indirect rate as explained above. Parent costs included time spent in the group meetings (based on average attendance), as well as time and expenses associated with travel to the meetings (parent travel information was obtained for this group also by telephone interview). Occupancy cost, calculated at $9 per square foot, (for 47 t,:quare feet, pro-rated according to usage by the program) was calculated for the group meeting room at the LSU Eye Center and the site liaison's office. Equipment costs for the group meetings include instructional/curricular materials (Reach Out and Teach) and office equipment and furniture which was valued, annualized, and pro- rated according to FTE. Finally, telephone and materials and supplies costs were assessed based on annual actual usage. Data CollectionData on children and their families was collected using instruments selectedto yield descriptive information (i.e., demographics) as well as assess treatment effects.The majority of the instruments were similar to those used in other Longitudinal Study sites. However, additional posttest data were collected usingcomplementary measures selected to meet the unique characteristics of this visuallyimpaired population. A description of diagnostician requirements is described below,followed by descriptions of the pre- and posttest instruments for this study.Recruitmenttraining, and monitoring of diagnosticians. All testers recruited forthestudysuccessfullycompletedthecertificationprocessrequired for administration of the Battelle Developmental Inventory. From the beginning of the1.60 NO/VI 184 study in 1987, through 1989, testers were recruited through the Human Development Center (HDC)at Louisiana State. University. As of January, 1990, testers were recruited from th Special Education Department at the University of New Orleans. All of the diagnosticians had bachelor's or master's degrees and extensive experience assessing infants and children with disabilities. All the testers were naive to the subject assignment. Shadow-scoring was conducted on 10% of the BDI administrations,averaging 93% interrater agreement. While working with the HDC, an assessment supervisor with a master's degree in special education coordinated the schedulingof the testing, collected the family measures, and ensured the quality of the testresults via tester reliability checks :frig double-checking protocols. Since 1990, Dr. David Slade, a professor with the Special Educ,..tion Department, has fulfilled the role of assessment supervisor. Pretest.After children were identified and assigned to groups based on theirvisual acuity and screening results, a core pretest battery cf measures used acrossall sites consisting of the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI), Family SupportScale (FSS), Family Resource Scale (FRS), Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes(FILE), and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III), were administered.(Specific psychometric information regarding these measures can be found in the EIEI 1986-87 annual report.) Demographic information was also obtained viainterview with theparent.These measures were considered aspotential covariatesinthe analysis as well astoinvestigate whether certain types offamilies or certain types of children profit more from intervention.The BDI was administered by a trained diagnostician who was unaware of thechild's grcup assignment. Testing occurred at the Human Development Center in NewOrleans, ensuring that the testing setting was the same for all subjects.The family measures were completed by the parent attending the testing sessionfollowing the administration of the BDI. Married parents and those with spouse NO/VI 185equivalents were also given a copy of the FSS to take home for their partner to complete.To encourage and reinforce parent participation in the assessment process,parents were paid a monetary incentive of $20 for completing the pretest battery. The diagnostician scored the BDI and completed a testing report. The diagnostician did not score the family measures. All data were then transmitted to the assessment supervisor.The assessment supervisor maintained copies of all of the protocols for the on-site records and submitted the original pro'cols via certified mail to the EIRI site coordinator within one week. Posttest #1.Core Posttest measures were collected after children were in the program for 12 months. These consisted of the Battelle Developmental Inventory andthe family measures previously described.Complementary measures included the Early Intervention Developmental Profile (EIDP)(Brown, et al., 1981)the Carolina Record of Individual Behavior (CRIB)(Simeonsson, 1981), Assessment of Preferential Looking, and videotaped assessmentof parent-child interaction.The EIDP is a criterion- and age-referenced instrument that assesses all majorareas of development for children ages birth to 36 months. This instrument was selected for two reasons. The behaviors measured by the EIDP emphasize sensorimotorintelligence based on Piaget's theory of development, thus providing a differentperspective on the child's development compared to the Battelle. Second, the EIDP contains a large quantity of items (299) which are broken down into small age rangesof approximately 3 months each. Thus, the EIDP would potentially provide a moresensitive measure of developmental progress. The EIDP wa3 supplemented with thePreschool Developmental Profile, a version of the EIDP designed for use with childrenages 3-6 years of age. This supplement was used with older subjects who did not reach a ceiling on the Early Intervention version. In such circumstances, raw scoreswere calculated by crediting full points possible on the EIDP and adding any as onemonth of a posttest measure. Since acuityis onecriticalvariablein the 163 NO/VI 187 assessment of functional vision, posttest assessments were conducted to assist in judging the effectiveness of the intervention increasing the child's functional use of vision.The preferential looking procedure was a standardized procedure, unlikemost functional vision assessments which are non-standardized with a great deal of variability in administration procedures and results.Videotaped assessment of parent-child interaction was used to measure the effects of visual impairment on parent-child relationships. This was considered tobe an important outcome given the dramatic differences in the two treatments being compared.Standardized procedures recorded in a laboratory setting were developed.The videotapes were then sent to coders who have developed systems judged to be sensitive to the desired treatment variables. The Parent-Caregiver Involvement Scale (Farran, Kasari, Comfort, & Jay, 1986), rates maternal behavioral descriptors on a5-point scale across three dimensions: amount, quality, and appropriateness. Globalratings of (1) availability of parent to child, (2) general acceptance and approvalmanifested by parent, (3) general atmosphere, (4) enjoyment, and (5) provision of learning eHvironment. The Parent-Child Behavioral Observation System (Marfo, 1989)examines behavior as a dynamic process, measuring both child and parent behaviorsand how they interact. Approximately half of the Year 1posttest parent-child interaction videotapes have been coded and analyzed using the Parent-Child BehavioralObservationSystem.Thesemeasuresprovideinformationwhichisusefulinestablishing the comparability of the two intervention groups as well as providinginformation that can be used as covariates in the analysis. Additionally, it canbe used to investigate whether certain types of families or children benefit more'om the intervention procedures. To date, all of the children who have completedPosttest #1 have been videotaped; scoring of the tapes is proceeding, with only alimited number of scores now available. 184 NO/VI 188 Posttest #2.The posttest measures used during Year 2 include the BOI and the previously described family measures. Complementary measures include the assessment of preferential looking and two videotaped assessment procedures.The previously- described videotaped assessment of parent-child interaction was also collected during Year 2 posttesting. In addition to assessing group differences, this measure was repeated with the intention of providing insightinto theimpact ofa visual impairment on later parent-child interactions.A standardized videotape procedure for assessing exploration and play was also used for Posttest #2. Both exploration (the skills used to obtain information about novelties in the environment) and play (involving the application of informationobtained through exploration) are outcome measures that are not assessed through traditional assessments, and yet are behaviors that have been closely related to cognition, language, and social development. Learning through exploration and play are strategies emphasized by the high-intensity, weekly intervention group. The Play Assessment Scale (Fewell, 1986) was used to analyze the exploration/free play videotaped scenarios.By the time of Posttest 2, many families had relocated out of the original catchment area, making it difficult for families to come to a central testing area. For this reason, the location of some families necessitated testing in their homes. However, testers made every effort to ensure that there was a structured atmosphere. Posttest #3,The posttest measures used during Year 3 include the BOI and the previously described family measures. Additionally, the Vineland Adaptive BehaviorScales were selected to obtain a more detailed estimate of the child's ability to function independently. The items on the Vineland tend to be less vision-oriented; in fact, norms for children with visual impairments are provided. The parent-childinteraction data was continued, with age appropriate toys added. To date,18children have receved Posttest #3 battery, as per their date of enrollment in the 185 NO/VI 189 study.Due to the lack of complete subject data, these results will not be reported until October 1991.

Comparability of Groups on Pretest MeasuresTable 2.9 presents comparability of groups for whom Posttest #1 data have been collected,and Table 2.10 compares those for whom Posttest #2 data have been collected.In reviewing scores of subjects for whom Year 1 posttest data have beencollected, BDI pretest scores are higher for the low intensity group, though thesedifferences only approach significance for the gross motor subdomain (p = .06). (DO scores are reported in the tables to provide insight into the subjects' developmental functioning; however, analysis was based on raw scores). In comparing the scoreson the family measures between groups, the mean FRS score was significantly lower (p=.02);therefore, the FRS was considered as a covariate in the analyses of posttest data.DifferencesbetweengroupsonBattellepretestscoresareconsistentincomparing subjects included in Year 2 posttest analysis, with the high intensitygroup again scoring lower. On the family measures, subjects in the high intensitygroup again scored significantly lower on the Family Resource Scale. All oth2rfamily measures reflected comparable scores for the two groups. The selection ofcovariates when analyzing Year 2 posttest results reflects these differences inscores for the low and high intensity groups. 11f.; NO/VI190Table 2.9Comparability of Groups on Pretest Measures for NO/VI Intensity Study:Subjects Included in Posttest #1 by August 1, 1990 Low Intensity High Intensityi(SD)Age in months at pretest 14.5(10.0)Battelle Developmental Inventory(BDI)DOs 270)TOTAL 223.3(34.2)(range to 505)Family Sales 0 to Size (ES) is defined here as the difference between the groups (high intensity minus low intensity) on the scores, divided by the standarddeviation of the Low latensity Group (see Glass, 1976; Tellmadge. !\"); ana Cohen, 1977 for a more general discussion of the concept of effect$ ite)Statistical analyses for 801 scores were conducted using raw scores for each of the scales.

Five subjects dropped prior to the collection of Year 1 posttest data. Three subjects were dropped from the study based on the parent'sdecision to no longer participate. One subject was disqualified based on the severityofotherdisabilities. Onesulijectdiedfollowingprolonged hospitalization. Thus, there were 31 active subjects at Posttest 1. One additional parent dropped by Posttest 2, and one subject could not be located; thus, there were 29 active subjects at Posttest 2 time.Data for key demographic and pretest variables for those who remained in thestudy and those who dropped out of the study prior to the collection of Posttest #1data are reported for children in each group in Table 2.11. As can be seen, thosewho dropped out from each group are quite similar to those who remained, except for the income variable. Since so few children have dropped out of the study, the test ofstatistical significance isnot pa,Iicularly meaningful, even though itis recorded in the table. These data seem to suggest, however, that attrition whichhas occurred thus far has not substantially effected the results of the study.169 NO/VI193Table 2.11New Orleans VI Intensity Study Attrition Comparison VariableGroup ANOVA Group Oy Status Low Intensity Nigh Intensity IN73.0(26.2)16o0.011.98.71.11.33OuT63.0(53.0)269.2(367:0)-.39 Effect Site (ES) is defined nere as the difference between the groups (high intensity minus low intensity) on the x scores, divided by the standarddeviation of the Low Intensity Group (see Glass, 1976: Tallmaage, 1977: and Cohen, 1977 for a more general discussion Of the concept Of effect Site).

ANCOVA Fs, p values, and effect sizes are based on analysis of BDI raw scores.Analyses of covariance were conducted for the BDI raw scores using the grossmotor raw score and the Family Resource Scales, as these variables were differentfor the two treatment groups at pretest time and were highly correlated with outcomevariables.Chronological age at pretest was also used as a covariate due to the highdegree of variability and its correlation with the outcome measures. Analysis ofthe BDI posttest data show that the adjusted means for BDI adaptive, fine motor, andcognitive, domains were higher for the high intensity group. The total BDI score,personal/social, gross motor, and communication domain scores were lower for the highintensity group. However, none of these differences was statistically significant(at p < .05 level) resulting in very small positive effect sizes for the BDI domainscores, based on raw score differences.The Early Intervention Developmental Profile scores are also reported in Table 2.12.Since this is a criterion-referenced measure, raw scores are reported formajor domains using the Battelle gross motor raw score, the FRS, and chronologicalage at pretest as covariates. The low intensity group generally scored higher on alldomains,exceptforselfcare.Again,noneofthesedifferences werestatistically significant. Effect sizes generally favored the low intensity group.Scores for the Carolina Record of Individual Behavior are reported for selecteddomains based on the ability to provide unique information as well as those mostpertinenttothe study.Scores for social orientation(reflectsthechild'sresponsiveness to persons in the environment), participation (describes the child'sparticipation with the examiner), attention span (degree of persistence in attendingto object,person, or activity), resporriveness to caretaker (degree of contactthrough eye contact, vocalizations, and/or touch), and negative affect (crying, 1D2 NO/V1 196avoidance, clinging) revealed no significant differences between groups. The highintensity group scored significantly better (p < .05) in the areas of explorationof objects using the senses (i.e., tactile via hands and mouth, olfactory) andreactivity (the ease with which the child is stimulated). The score for positiveaffect (laughing/smiling) was statistically significant (p = .04) in favor of thelow intensity group. The mean effect size for Posttest #1 child outcome variableswas negligible at +.08. Results of Posttest #2, As of August 1, 1990, 25 subjects have completed Year2 posttesting. As mentioned in the treatment verification section, the degree ofintervention has varied for subjects between Year 1 and Year 2 posttesting. Of the12 subjects assigned to the high intensity intervention, 4 subjects continued toreceive the prescribed intervention; 7 graduated from the program upon reaching 3years of age,6 of whom participated in preschool programs during the year and 1subject who did not receive no intervention due to functioning within normal limits; 1subject chose a different intervention program located in their home area. Of the13childrenassignedtothelowintensityintervention, 5continuedtoparticipate inthe study,although their attendance at the group meetings wasnegligible; 8 of the 13 low-intensity intervention subjects have graduated from thestudy upon reaching 3 years of age, with 3 participating in a special education program,2 subjects enrolled in a regular preschool, 1enrolled ina Head Startprogram, and 2 received no intervention (again due to performance within normal limits).Given thevarious types of interventions present within the low and highintensity intervention groups due to the exiting of subjects from the originalintervention upon reaching age 3years,itisdifficult to draw aconclusionregarding two years of consistent intervention. Rather, the data in Table 2.13reflect the long-term effects of one year of the prescribed interventions.13 NO/VI 197Table 2.13Year 2 Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Alternative Intervention Groups for NONI Study Var iable CovariatesaLow Intensity High Intensity Developmental Play Age 1,2.318.5(4.5)16.61314.4(6.3)16.311.01.90-.07(In Months) Effect site (ES) is defined nere as the difference between the groops (migh minus low) on the 1 scores, divided by the standard deviation of theBasic Intervention Group (see Glass. 1976; Tallmadge. 1977; and Cohen, 07) for a more general discussion of the concept of e ffect size).

It is expected that the majority of Posttest #3 data willbe collected by October, 1991. 134 NO/VI 198Effects of Alternative Forms of Interventionon Measures of Family FunctioningData are reported for one year and two years following enrollment. Previously-described procedures were again implemented in the selection of covariates.Posttest #1.Table 2.14 represents results of analysis involving family functioning measures. One family declined to complete the measures, therefore datafrom the high intensity group included 13 rather than 14 subjects. Analysis ofcovariance was performed using pretest scores for BDI gross motor raw score andFamily Resource Scale. No significant differences were found between groups on any of the family measures. However, there is a trend toward differences between groupson the adaptability domain of the FACES III, in favor of the high intensity group.In reviewing effect sizes baad on the measures of stress, positive effect sizesresulted for the total score of the PSI, the FILE, and the FACES III. Negativeeffect sizes resulted for the FRS and the FSS total score.Analysis of parent-child interaction videotapes. The Multi-pass scheme (Marfo, 1989) wasimplemented for the coding of the parent-child interaction tapes. Multi-pass wasdesigned primarily to study the notion of maternal directiveness in relation to theresponses of parent and child to one another. The behavior count section of Multi-pass utilizes an event-based coding system targeting four types of parental directivebehavior:1)turn taking control, 2) response control, 3) topic control, and 4)inhibitive/intrusive control. The system also allows for a close analysis of verbaldirectivenoss. Videotapes were sent directly to the author of Multi-pass to ensureaccuratecoding.Analysisofthe raw data was conductedbythe EIEIsitecoordinator.

There was a statistically significant difference between groups on the frequency of parental inhibitions and intrusions (verbal or nonverbal behaviordirected at stopping the child from engaging in an activity or behavior that is notconsidered to be dangarous/undesirable, or imposing the parental agenda at the costof the child's interests) in favor of the high intensity group (p < .05). However, it should be noted that this was a very low frequency variable, thereby diminishingits statistical significance. Associated with the frequency of parental inhibitingbehaviors is the frequency of child's compliance with parental inhibitions. Mean scoresforcomplianceinthehighintensitygroupwerelower(thoughnot significantly so), most Mely due to the lower number of parental inhibitions whichwere directed toward them.Posttest#1parent-childinteractiontapes were also analyzed using theParent/Caregiver Involvement Rating Scale (Farran et al., 1986).This scale is designed to assess the behavior of the caregivers (in this case, mothers) during play interactions.Behavior is rated in regard to the amount displayed, the quality, andthe appropriateness of 11 behaviors: physicalinvolvement,verbalinvolvement,responsiveness, play interactic teaching behavior, control activities, directivesgiven, relationship among activities, positive statements, negative statements, and goal setting.The scores reported reflect averages of the 11 behaviors. Amount wasscored based on a 5-point Likert-type scale with a \"3\" being the most desirable score.As shown in Table 2.15, both groups received almost ideal scores in regard NO/VI 202to amount of behaviors, withno difference between the groups. Quality andappropriateness were scored based on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with \"1\" beingworst and11511being best.As shownin Table 2.15, there were no significantdifferences between the groups in regard to quality or appropriateness of these behaviors.Both groups received higher than average scores in regard to quality and appropriateness.The coders using the Parent/Caregiver Involvement Scale also rated his/her generalimpressions of the caregiver depicted in the videotape. Thisincluded availability of the parent to the child, acceptance of the child, general atmosphereof the interaction, amount of enjoyment between parent and child, and parent's provision of a learning environment. These characteristics are also scored using a 5-point Likert-type scale, with \"1\" being poor and \"5\" being best.Scores for both groups were in the moderate range, with no significant differences between groups.Finally, a mean general impression score was calculated, revealing a minimal effectsize in favor of the high intensity group. The mean effect size for the Parent/Caregiver Involvement Scale was .10 (\"amount\" not included). Posttest #2.The core family measures were again administered two years fromdate of pretest. The parents of one subject again refused to complete the family measures,Lherefore data on only 9 of the 10 subjects from the high intensity intervention were available for analysis. As depicted in Table 2.16, no significantdifferences were found between intervention groups on any of the family measures.However, there was a large negative effect size for the FILE; upon closer examinationof the scores, it appears that the discrepancy is due primarily to one subject inthe high intensity group who underwent major upheavals in her life.

Nosignificant interactions were found between intervention and degree of vision loss.However, as would be expected, Battelle scores were influenced by degree of visionloss alone, with children whose acuity was worse than 20/800 receiving lower scores.The effects of socioeconomic status on degree of child progress was alsoanalyzed, applying a two-way analysis of variance by intervention and by income[income greater than $13,000 (the median income) versus income less than $13,000].Results reflect a trend toward the high intensity group having a greater impact onBDI scores for families with incomes more than $13,000 compared to families of incomeless than $13,000; however, only one of the five domains (adaptive) reached a levelof significance (p < .03). Conclusions Based on the results of data collected after 12 months of intervention, itappears that there are negligible effects due to the high intensity intervention onmeasures of child and family functioning. Although not statistically significant,small positive effect sizes resulted for the Battelle Developmental Inventory (onall but the gross motor domain) at Posttests #1 and #2. This po;itive trend wascontradicted by the Early Intervention Developmental Profile at Posttest #1 and theExploratory/Play Assessment at Posttest #2, for which negative effect sizes resulted.One significant difference did appear at Posttest #1 when assessing behaviors thatire less developmentally-based (i.e., the CRIB); specifically, the high intensitygroup scored significantly better in regard to exploring with other senses, a skillthat is important for children with visual impairments.In regardto effects of alternative interventions on measures of familyfunctioning collected at Years 1 and 2. the results are also equivocal. The highintensity intervention appeared to positively effect the family's overall functioning 21.: NO/VI 205and level of satisfaction with their family life (based on FACES III scores), yetlevels of stress and utility of external resources and supports were not positively changed.Future subgroup analyses may yield useful information regarding the effectsof different interventions on families with particular characteristics.Parent-child interaction may be a potentially sensitive method of assessing theeffects of the alternative treatment; one that will provide infcrmation differentfrom the other outcome measures. However, conclusions cannot be made based on the small number of subjects presently available for analysis.Although the results of this study are only based on 31 children (a relativelysmall number of children for intervention studies such as this), it is important to notethat most ofthe previous experimental studies ofthe effects of early intervention with children with visual impairments were also based on small numbers.The findings of this study are substantially different than those from previousstudies; therefore, itis important to reiterate the reasons why discrepancies mayhave occurred.First, this study was based on a randomized experiment; few of the previouslymentioned studies involved a control group for comparison. Furthermore, this studyused diagnosticians who were uninformed as to subject assignment to assess childoutcome variables, and efforts were also undertaken to ensure that the expectedtreatments were delivered as planned. Therefore, the results may be attributed tothe quality of the research design.Second, the qualifications of the intervenors raise questions regarding theirimpact on the outcomes. Although the intervenors were supt.rvised by someone witha Ph.D. in visual impairment, the direct intervenors were not certified to serve thevisually impaired. These results lend support to those in the field of visualimpairment that view the needs of children with visual impairments to be so unique thatthe absence of trained specialists isdetrimentaltotheir development. 2. 2 NO/VI 206However, as postulated by the study's independent reviewer, the mere presence of visuallyimpaired,certifiedinstructorsdoesnotguaranteequalityearly intervention services (Ferrell, 1990). The vast majority of certified VI personnelhave received training focusing on school-age children and/or adults. The use of such certified instructors who lack the early childhood and family-focused trainingmay be equally inappropriate. Currently, there is only one personnel developmentprogram in the United States which provides an emphasis in early intervention for children with visual impairments. The shortage of personnel with early childhoodvisually handicapped expertise iseven greater than the scarcity of teachers certified to serve the visually impaired. Therefore, the high intensity interventionprovided by this study, although perhaps not ideal, isnot uncharacteristic oftypical early intervention for children with visual impairments when the shortageof VI-certified personnel is considered. Scu,:fies comparing treatment provided byintervenors certified to serve infants and toddlers who are visually impaired versusthe generic early childhood/special educator would speak to this specialized training issue. Third,it may be that childrer: who are visually impaired, even at this young age,need much more comprehensive interventionservices.Perhapstoachievesubstantial benefit, itis necessary to have intervention programs which deliverprofessionally mediated interventionseveraltimes weekly to thechildren,or supplement home visits with a center-based program. However, as demonstrated by thisstudy, the cost of delivering high intensity intervention is nontrivial, and it isan issue which states will scrutinize.A fourth possibility is that perhaps the focus of the intervention should changeto provide primary support and asistance to the family rather than emphasizedevelopmentaltherapy directed toward the child.Although the high intensityinterventionin this study was consistent with what is deliveredin most early 21 3 NO/VI207 intervention programs, it is possible that different findings may result through the application of completely different forms of interventions. Although Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs) were implemented, the intervention was primarily child- focused. Perhaps a more radical orientation to the strengths and needs of the familyshould receive the primary emphasis, with minimal direct child contact. More intervention focused on parenting skills and coping behaviors may meet the immediate needs of parents with infants and toddlers. It is worth reiterating that the parentsin the high intensity group did not have the benefit of participating in a parent support group; such contacts may be critical to parents of children with a specific disability.Conclusions cannot yet be drawn regarding the long-term effects of the high versus low intensity treatments. As of August 1, 1990, approximately two-thirds ofthe Posttest #2 and half of the Posttest #3 data have been collected.Thus far, there do not appear to be any significant differences between the grcups as measured by the aforementioned instruments. However, it would be premature to conclude that neither of the interventions had an impact on later child and/or family functioning.As other studies have shown, effects of intervention often are not evident until longitudinal data have been collected (Infant Health and Development Program, 1990).It may be that families with young children during the first three years initiallybenefit from less intense general support and access to resources, and that theindividualized developmental intervention shows it effects in later stages (i.e., the early school years). These are issues which will require extended research. 21'4 SMA/Lake-McHenry208SMA/LAKE McHENRY PROJECTProject #3COMPARISON: Severely Handicapped Chi ldren--Once per week versus three timesper week services.LOCAL CONTACT PERSON: Dr. Alice Kusmierek, Coordinator, Early Illinois (Chicago Suburb)DATE OF REPORT: 4-8-1991Rationale for Study Although popular support for earlyintervention efforts hasbeenstrong,research on early intervention effec-tivenesshasshedlittlelighton importantissuessuch as the relativeeffectiveness ofvariousprogramintensities (White & Casto, 1985). Thet>researchbasewhichhasdealtwithmoderate to severe young children with disabilities is particularly sparse. It isonly within the last 15 years, since the advent of P.L. 94-142, that children withsignificant impairments have been systematically included in early interventionprograms (Bailey & Bricker, 1984). Thus, little is known about the optimal intensityof services to be provided to this group of children.The implementation of P.L. 99-457 has focused attention on early interventionservices in general and on services to infants and toddlers in particular. As states aredevelopingplanstoservicetheyoungestpopulationofchildrenwithdisabilities, questions are being raised regarding the most appropriate types of 21,5ev, SMA/Lake-McHenry209 services to be provided. Peterson (1987) has discussed seven specific decisions which must be made regarding the development of a service delivery program, includingwho will be the target of service (e.g.,child, mother, father, both parents, family), at what age services should begin, what services should be provided, in what settingtheinterventionprogram will 'be provided,who willbetheprimary intervention agent, in what social context services will be provided (e.g. individual or group program), and which agencies will provide services.Although certain aspects of service delivery will be determined by practical and political forces (i.e., decisions regarding the agencies through which serviceswill be delivered will be made at a state level based on tle ability of different state agencies to perform this role) decisions regarding other aspects of service delivery can be facilitated by the availability of research data on the effectivenss of various approaches. Such data are particularly important in light of the cost issues(i.e.,the cost of human as well as monetary resources) which various approaches to service delivery entail. However, the overriding issue should be, and is, how the services which are provided to infants and toddlers and their families can maximize their development.Decisions regarding the type of services tobe provided are particularlyimportant, as such decisions are directly related to both the cost of intervention as wellasits effectiveness. Although a myriad of research questions on therelative costs and effects of different types of services can be asked, a very basic question is,\"How many hours of service should be provided each week to maximizechild and family functioning?According to Bricker (1986), one hour per week of individual services is acommon service delivery model for children under age three, in either a home-basedor center-based setting with the child and primary caregiver present. Thishas face validity from both a cost and a practical perspective (i.e. it makes sense SMA/Lake-McHenry210 to providearelatively low intensity ofservices to young childrenwhose skill developmentneeds arerelativelyrestricted a effectiveness of once-per-week versus three-times-per-weekservices, a number of measures of child and family functioning were selected for this study.Some of these measures have been administered at pretest, one year, and againat two years following the child's enrollment in the study. Other measures were administered at the first or second posttest only. To assess intervention effects on the child,the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) (Newborg et al., 1984) Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley, 1969), Wisconsin Behavior Rating Scale(Song & Jones, 1980),and Scales. of Independent Behavior (Bruininks, Woodcock, Weathermai, & Hill, 1984) were administered.The BDI, which was administered at pretest and during each posttest year, wasselected to assess the child's overall development as well as skill development in five domains of functioning: Personal/Social, Adaptive, Motor, Communication, and Cognitive.The BDI allows for direct assessment and observation of child skills as well as use of parental report. The scale was developed for use with children birthto 8 years of age, thus facilitating the assessment of children of different ageson a longitudinal basis. The Bayley Scales, which were administered at the one yearposttest, were selected to provide a more fine-grained analysis of the child'scognitive and motor skills. The Bayley has also been used extensively in pre-iousstudies of early intervention; thus, their ue would facilitate comparison of the resultsofthisstudytoother work.The Wisconsin Behavior Rating Scale,administered at pretest and at one year posttest, is completed by a specialist oreducator who is familiar with the child, and thus allows for another source of datato be used to assess child skill development. The Early Development Scale (ED) and Short Form (SF) of the Scales of Independent Behavior (SIB) were administered at Year2 posttest to provide additional data on the extent to which interventions impactedthe subjects' adaptive behavior. Both the SIB ED and SF were administered becausethere is evidence to suggest that the age scores obtained on these scales may be S SMA/Lake-McHenry212 significantlydifferentforthispopulation(Goldstein,Smith,Waldrup,& Inderbitten, 1987).A battery of instruments which would allow for the assessment of the effectsof intervention on the mothers and fathers of subjects was also administered. Theseinstruments were selected to address criticisms of previous research in which thefocus of assessment was restricted to child outcome measures (Mott et al., 1986).The instruments selected for use inthisstudy were based on reviews of the literature on expected family outcomes, and variables with the potential to mediatefamily outcomes, andthusincluded measures of parent stress, socialsupport, resources, family functioning, and life events and changes. The specific instrumentsincluded the Parenting Stress Index (Abidin, 1986), the Family Support Scale (Dunst etal.,1984),theFamilyResourceScale(Dunst&Leet,1985),theFamilyAdaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales kOlson et al., 1985), and the FamilyInventory of Life Events and Changes (McCubbin et al., 1983).The ComprehensiveEvaluation of Family Functioning Scale (McLinden, 1988), a new scale developed to assess the impact of the child with a disability in the family, was also administeredto both the mothers and fathers at Year 2 posttest. Methods SubjectsA totalof75 children who were served by 3 different early interventionprograms in the Chicago suburbs were included as subjects. Sixty children wereposttested at Year 1, 49 at Year 2, and 38 at Year 3. Recruitment, assignment togroups, and demographic characteristics of the subjects are described below.Recruitment.Subjects were recruited from three intervention programs in theChicago suburbs. The three programs--South Metror,litan Association (SMA), Lake-McHenry Regional Program (LMRP), and Southwest Cooperative Association (SW Coop)-- 2L9 SMA/Lake-McHenry213received funding from the State of Illinois Board of Education from July 1,1985, through June 30, 1988, to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of expandingservices to the birth to three population. All three programs had in the pastprovided once-per-week intervention services to children under age three. As acondition of receiving additional funding from the state, agreed to provide three-times-per-week services to a randomly assigned experimental group, while continuingto provide once-per-week services to other children.Between January 1, 1986, and June 30, 1987, all children who were referred toany of these three programs were considered for inclusion in the study if they were24 months of age or less and had either a diagnosed disability or demonstrated overall developmental delay of 65% or more. A determination of developmental delay was made through a multidisciplinary team assessment conducted by the program as wellas through completion of the Wisconsin Behavior Rating Scale by the member of tneteam assigned as the child's case manager. The age cutoff was included to ensurethat all children would have an opportunity to participate in at least one year of early intervention services befor t.. moving on to a preschool program operated by thepublic school system at age three. Referrals who met the criteria were informed ofthe nature of the research project by program staff and asked to participate in the study.The requirement of random assignment to groups, and the possibility ofobtaining three-times-per-week services, was emphasized. It was made clear that adecision not to participate in the study would in no way influence their ability toaccess the once-per-week services typically provided by the program.A totalof75 children and their families agreed to participate and werepretested as subjects inthe study.Of these,15 families dropped out of theresearch proj!ct before Year 1 posttest data could be collected, and an additional11 subjects dropped out before completing Year 2 posttest, and 11 additional familiesdid not participate in Year 3 posttesting. The most common reason for attrition 21.0 r':!;ti. SMA/Lake-McHenry214 before Posttest #1 was a move out of U..: area (8 subjects). Other reasons included death ofthe subject (2subjects),refusaltoparticipate inposttesting, (1subject), or dissatisfaction with the frequency or nature of services provided.Attrition prior to posttest one across groups was relatively equal (7 experimental, 8 control).There was an unequal proportion of subjects from the experimental group (8) who dropped after Year I posttest versus the control group (3). However, the reasons for attrition were similar across groups. Of the eight experimental group subjectswho dropped, five moved and three refused to participate in testing. Of the threecontrol subjects who dropped, two moved and one refused to participate in testing.This attrition did not affectthe comparability of the groups on any pretestvariable, and actually improved the comparability of the groups in terms of numberof children with both parents living at home as well as the ethnic make up of the groups.In addition, although there was a statistically significant difference between mother's age at pretest and Year 2, it is not practically significant (e.g.,there is no reason to believe that a mean age difference of 4.4 years for motherswould have statistically significant influence on the outcomes of the study) and was not found at Year 3.Attrition between Posttest #2 and Posttest Li was also equal across groups (5 expanded,6basic).OftheIIsubjects,2died,Imoved,and 8 refused tc participate intesting.Attrition didnot appLar to significantly affect thecomparability of the groups at Year 3, except for a statistically significantlyhigher percentage of mothers in the expanded group wno held technical/managerialpositions or higher. However, as mother's education, hours worked per week, andtotal household income were not different across groups, this eoes not appear to bea difference of any practical significance. 211 SMA/Lake-McHenry215 A series of two by two ANOVA'S were conducted to determine whether there were any statistically significant group by subject status (i.e., subjects who dropped versus those that do not) interactions. The dependent variables for these analyses included mother's age, number of hours worked-father, BDI total raw score, PSI total score, number of parents living with child, mother's FSS total score, and FRS total score.A statistically significant interaction effect was found for the FRS total score only.Subjects who dropped out of the expanded intervention group had higherFRS pretest scores (7 =126.7)thandidsubjects who dropped from thebasic intervention group (R = 106.0).Assignment to groups. Subjects were entered into the stildy on a continuousbasis as ideitified by the programs and randomly assigned to groups by the EIRI coordinator.Data onthe subject's disability and/or developmental status asprovided by the program and the parent's level ofstress as determined by theparent's score on the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) (Abidin,1986) were used to stratify the subjects prior to random assignment. (A more detailed description ofthe procedures utilized to randomly assign subjects can be found in the Base Period Report.)Demographic characteristics. Data on the demographic characteristics of allsubjects enrolled in the study, as well as subjects in the e.perimental and controlgroups who participated in Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 posttesting, are presented in Table 3.1.The total sample can be characterized as predomi;lantly Caucasian and middle class.Most subjects lived in two-parent households in which fathers wereemployed fu'll time and mothers were the primary caretakers for the child. Intervention ProgramsThe two intervention groups receied very similar tpes of service, but differedwith the frequency with which those services were provided, with the experimental Table 3.1Comparability of Groups on Demographic Characteristics for SMA/Lake McHenry Project Variable Age of child in monthsat program entry Age of mother in years Age of father in years Percent male.

Basic intervention (once-ger-Neet services). Children and primary caretakers inthisgroup participated inaonce-per-week contact with either an infant specialist (e.g., speech/language pathologist or occupational or physical therapist) or an early childhood special educator. While most contacts occurred at acenter-based location, programs did allow the flexibility of conducting some of thecontacts in the parent's home. Since the programs did not provide transportation to the children and their parents, the most common reason for providing a home visit was lack of transportation to the center. However, home visits were also provided when a particular teaching session could be most effectively accomplished in the home(e.g., when feeding or sleeping behaviors were of concern).The content of the intervention sessions was directly related to the needs ofthe specific child and family as specified in the child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP).No specific curriculum was followed unless the individual specialistor educator found that doing so would meet the child and family's specific needs. Thus, the specialists and educators have a great deal of freedom in determining whatwas accomplished during the individual sessions. In general, there was a programexpectation tnat the sessions would focus on improving child development in thedomains of personal/social, adaptive, motor, language, and cognitive functioning,and that the sessions would also help parents to become intervenors for their child.Another major goal of the sessions was to provide a forum for parents tc discussissues of concern to them and to help them adapt to the daily demands of caring fora child with a disability. During the first year of the project, funding from theIllinois State Board of Education allowed the programs to hold a number of inservicesto provide staff with additional training in providing family-focused interventionservices(e.g.,Dunst,Trivette,& Deal,1988).This training emphasized the 217 d..1= SMA/Lake-McHenry219 importance of addressing parent-identified needs as well as strengths in an effort to empower parents to become capable of dealing with the demands of caring for a child with special needs rather than relying solely on professional helpers and helping systems.Expanded intervention (three-times-per-week services).Children who wereassigned to this group participated in three, one-hour contacts per week with a specialist or educator. The content and focus of the sessions were the same as that for the control group. The increased staff contact time allowed for a wider range of IEP goals to be addressed, and the more frequent contact allowed more parent concerns and issues to be incorporated into the treatment sessions. Treatment verification. A number of procedures were used to verify that treatment was implemented as intended. Data for Year 1 are presented in Tables 3.2.and 3.3, and data for Year 2 are presented in Table 3.4. An examination of the attendancdata in Table 3.2 indicates that even though percent attendance in the Table 3.2Treatment Verification Data for SMA/Lake Parents were rated in three areas (i.e attendance, knowledge. and suppor,) by the intervenor who worked with them most closely.Rating scale was 1= low. 2 = average: and 3 = highVideotapes of a typical intervention senior1 were scored by Independent raters as to how well best practices were followed.Highest possible rating was 32.Parents rated their satisfaction with the program in 7 areas on a scale of 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good. and 4 = excellent. 21s SMA/Lake-McHenry 220 Table 3.3Additional Services and Child Health Data for SMA/Lake McHenry TimePer Week 3.2% Social Work 0.0% 6.9%Servicesd. % Receiving Home NursingServices6.5% 17.2% e. % Receiving Nutritional 3.2% 10.3%Servicesf.% Receiving 3.4%Servicesg. % Receiving Parent Services 17.2% 22.6% 2.Child Health Over Past Year 23 25% With Seizures 9 7% 20.7%% Wits Unusual Weight 9.7% 3 4%Gain or Loss% Infectious Diseases Hours of Additional Therapy &Moos.% 93.1(128.8)26157.2(190.6)191.80.50.19Total*af Sessions Attended 15.0(7.8)2337.8(24.2)2018.232.92.00Total*of Sessions Offered 19.9(11.1)2353.4(31.6)2022.753.02.00Percent Attendance 78.7(14.4)2368.4(19.1)203.27-.64.08 Only subjects who were still being served by the programs involved in the study by the end of the 1988-89 school year wererated by intervenors.Attendance data were collected on subjects until they turned 3 and thus were no longer eligible toparticipate in the program.Attendance data were not available for subjects who left the program after Year One posttest.Based on the total number hours of speech, motor, social work, and respite services received between Year One and YearTwo posttests. basic intervention group was higher (although not statistically significant at p < .05)than for the expanded intervention group, the expanded intervention groupparticipated in almost 21/2 times as many intervention sessions than did the basicintervention group. These findings were similar in Year 2. As the data containedin Table 3.4 indicate, the expanded intervention subjects were offered and attendedsignificantly more treatment sessions during Year 2 than did the basi: intervention groupsubjects.However,duringYear2,percentattendanceforthebasic intervention group was significantly higher than for the expanded intervention group.This suggests that even when additional service hours are offered over time, childrenwill attend these sessions less consistently than when less frequent services are offered.The specialists or educators were also asked to rate each parent's attendance,knowledge, and support for intervention efforts. The ratings for Year 1 suggest SMA/Lake-McHenry222 that parentattendance wassimilar acrossgroups,but that theexpandedintervention group wassignificantly more and supportive ofinterventionefforts than was thebasicintervention group. At YearI,teachers reported parents of children inthe expandedintervention group to be moreknowledgeable but not more supportive than parents ofchildren in the basicintervention group. At Year Iposttest,videotapes cf a typical treatment session werealso rated to determinethe extent towhich theinterventionrepresented'best practices.' The highest variables weIalsono statisticallysignificantdifferenceintheranking ofintervenorsby their supervisors, or in theparents'satisfaction with services.

These approximately 20% of subjectsin each groupaccessed someform ofadditional 2represent theactual numberof hours ofadditionalservices accessed by subjectsin each group. There was not a statisticallysignificantdifference between the groups onnumber ofhours oropportunity cost (e.g., 221 SMA/Lake-McHenry 223 parent time).An opportunity cost is the value of a resource in its next best alternative use. For example, parents participating in intervention activities could have been engaged in other productive activities, these foregone activities represent acost to parents. Since wehavenoinformation about any one individual's opportunity costs, we estimated the value of an individual's time based on national data.The amount of parent or non-parent volunteer time required for the study was assigned the pecuniary value of $9 per hour based on the \"median usual weekly earningfor full-time work\" plus benefits (U.S.Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989).All costs are in 1990 dollars. In cases where program costs were compared over several years, costs were adjusted for inflation using the Fixed Weighted Price Indexfor state and local government purchases (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1988). In addition, the total costs of program and contributed resources were discounted usingdiscount rates of 3% and 5%. Discounting adjusts the costs for the real rate ofreturn that the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere.Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over ,ime. Table3.5 summarizes the average cost per child for 3 days per week versus 1 day per week in the SMA and the Lake McHenry locations. These two programs were used as the basisfor the calculations since they serve the majority of the children included in the project. Data CollectionAll subjects wLre tested at program entry and then again after one, two, andthree years of intervention. Data collection procedures are described below.Diagnosticians. Two diagnosticians were hired to complete pretesting and Year#1 posttesting. These diagnosticians were not employed by any of the participating SMA/Lake-McHenry224 Table 3.5Costs per Child tor SMA/Lake McHenry (1990 Dollars) 1x per week 3 x per week 1.UNDISCOUNTED COSTS:Direct Services $2,293 $ 5,561Administration Resources 4,411 $11,708Totals mai due to rounding errors programs,and were notinformed ofthe purpose of thestudy or ofthegroup assignment of the subjects.

Scheduling of subjects and monitoring of diagnosticians was coordinated by staff of the SMA program, who also had overallresponsibility for coordinating the project fortheStateofIllinois.Sixdiagnosticians were used to complete Year 2 and Year 3 posttesting. All were graduate students in School Psychology at the University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee(UWM) who successfully met EIRI certification requirements for diagnosticians.Assessment coordination was the responsibility of Dr. McLinden at UWM.Interobserver agreement was calculated for eight BDI administrations and twoBayley administrations.

Subjects were tested again two years after their initialprogram entry date. The posttest battery was administered in two sessions inamanner similar to Year 1posttesting.Year 2 posttesting differed from Year 1 posttesting as follows: (1) The Scales of Independent Behavior replaced the BayleyScales and the Wisconsin Behavior Rating Scale as a child outcome measure, (2)Fathers and mothers completed the Comprehensive Evaluation of Family FunctioningScale, and (3) Fathers completed the FSS and FACES III.Year 3 posttestinq. Subjects were tested again three years after their initial program entry date. The posttest battery was administered in only one session. Some of the parent forms (parent survey, satisfaction questionnaire, and health form) were senttotheparentstobe completed Jefore the testing session, and data on additional services were collected Ly the assessment coordinator in a phone call with the parent after testing had been completed. One other measure (teacher rat g form) was completed by the child's current teacher. Other measures fk..1- Year 3 posttestingincluded the Child Behavior Checklist and the CEFF (completed by both mothers and fathers).Fathers also completed the FSS and FACES III.

Higherscores for teacher ratings indicate more desireable functioning. Discussion A few conclusions can be made about the relative effectiveness of once per weekversus three times per week services given the longitudinal data presented for this population.First of all, it does not appear that increasing the number of service 23 9BEST COPY AVAILABLE SMA/Lake-McHenry239 hours to three times a week has a significant effect on the skill development of a child with disabilities. Although there were three separate indices of the child'sdevelopmental level at Year 1, two indices at Year 2, and one at Year 3, there were no statistically significant differences between the once-per-week and three-times- per-week groups on any of these measures.Although the interventions did not appear to differentially affect child skill development, there were indications that the three-times-per-week intervention had positive effects on perceived levels of support by mothers. The higher score formothers' reported satisfaction with sources of support at both Yea,.s 1 and 2 lndscredence to the assumption that three-times-per-week services allow for an increase intheamount of family support which programs can provide. Thelack ofa significant difference at Year 3 may be due in part to the smaller number of subjectstested, as the trend at Year 3 was similar to that found at Years 1 and 2.Although the results of this study do not provide support for increasing servicehours for purposes of improving child functioning, the observed effects of the increased level of services on mothers' perceptions of support must be considered.Based on the consistent effects of family functioning, but lack of effects on child functioning after two years of intervention, it might appear that the significant increase in the cost of providing three-times-per-week services versus once-per-weekservices may not be warranted. However, one hypothesis which might be presented is that the observed effects on parental support and resources might generalize to moreprofound outcomes such as a maintenance of parental marital status and willingnessof the family to continue to maintain the child in the home. The longitudinal datato be collected in future years will be crucial in addressing these issues. 240 Arkansas Intensity 240ARKANSAS INTENSITY STUDYProject #4 COMPARISON: Children with Mild to Severe Handicaps--Home-based interventiononce per week versus home-based intervention twice per PERSONS: Lowell the Study Limited available to guide pro- grammingdecisionsconcerningthe relativeeffectiveness ofvarious intensities of early intervention (White &Casto,1985).Thefrequencyand intensity with which early intervention servicesareprovidedvariesacross program models based largely on philosophical orientation and professional judgment of individual child needs. Although home-based early intervention models are widely used, there is unfortunately, little empirical evidence upon which to make decisions regarding the effects of varying the frequency with which such home-based services are provided.This study provides a comparison of the effectiveness of two levelsof intensity of home-based services for children from birth to five years old. 241 Arkansas Intensity 241 Rim/Wm ofRelated ResearchCurrently, parents and professionals often make decisions regarding the form services should take based only on their experience and/or philosophy of the human condition (Frederido, 1985).Rarely are the program models, approaches,or curricular contents evaluated ina systematic manner (Switsky & Haywood, 1985). The field lacks empirical findingsin many areas critical to the training and education of young children with severe disabilities. The treatment intensity issue is of particular importance in programs serving young children with moderate and severe disabilities because it is often assumed that because of their developmental needs such children need more intervention. Discussions about whether interventions should be more intensive inevitably also raise concerns about the costs associated with increased intervention.Although research in this area is sparse (Bailey & Bricker, 1984), Casto and his colleagues have reported a series of meta-analyses that indicate that intensity of intervention may be an important variable with children with disabilities (Casto, 1987; Casto & Mastropieri, 1986). Specifically, Casto (1987) noted that intensity and duration appeared to be important considerations for programs serving preschool- ers with disabilities, but less so for disadvantaged populations.When adjustments were made for age at start of intervention, quality of outcome measures, and time of measurement, the range of effect sizes was .45 to .88, in favor of more intense interventions (Casto, 1987). These effect sizes indicate that more intense or longerintervention resulted in a performance difference of between about one-half to morethan three-quarters of a standard deviation on whatever measure of child progress was used.These encouraging findings, however, must be viewed with caution becausemany studies included in the analysis were confounded by the investigator's failure to distinguish intensity and duration of intervention and/or their failure to include other important variables in the analyses. Continuing literature searches by White 24 2 Arkansas Intensity242 and his colleagues (White, 1986; White & Casto, 1985) have found few studies that have systematically compared home-based intervention programs that varied solely on the intensity of intervention.Although not addressing the intensity issue, there are several well-designedstudies which suggest home-based intervention programs are an effective way of providing early intervention to children with disabilities. Several of these studies were conducted with children considered at-risk for developmental delay due to low birthweight (Barrera, Rosenbaum, & Cunningham, 1986; Bromwich & Parmelee, 1979; 1984;Scarr-Salapatek & Williams,1973).With the exception of Bromwich and Parmelee, each of these investigations found that home-based intervention providedduring the first year of life resulted in improvements in cognitive development for childreninexperimentalversuscontrolgroups.Barreraandhercolleagues contrasted two types of home intervention, one focusing on child development and theother on parent-infant interaction with both low birthweight and normal birthweight controlgroups.Althoughbothinterventiongroupsdidbetterthanthelow birthweight controls, children in the parent-infant interaction group achieved gains in more areas than those in the child development group. Neither intervention groupperformed as well as the normal birthweight control group (Barrera et al., 1986).Bromwich and Parmelee reported no significant differences in cognitive development,but did report differences in social skills favoring the intervention group.A study by Sandow and her colleagues is particularly important in light of thecommonly held belief that \"more is better\" when it comes to early intervention forchildren with disabilities. Ina well-designed research project, a home-visitprogram conducted twice per month was compared to the same program provided once every two months (Sandow et al., 1981). The two service groups of 16 children (totalof 32 children) were contrasted with each other and with a matched comparison groupof 15 children who received no intervention. The children had a mean chronological 243 Arkansas Intensity 243 age of two years six months and a mean mental age of one year three months at the start of the study. Differences in cognitive functioning were not statistically significant after one year; after two years differences favored the lower intensity group.After three years, there were again no statistically significant differences between groups, although the no service comparison group had only 2 children who had gained inIQ as compared to 6 in the more intense group and 5 in the less intense group.Sandow et al. concluded from their findings that less intervention may be preferred in that parents then tend to rely more on their own capabilities than on those of the interventionist(s). The authors also suggested that perhaps \"a high level of intensity should gradually decrease as the parents become more capable of taking charge\" (p. 140).Piper and Pless (1980) found similar outcomes among young children with Down syndrome.That study included an experimental group of 21 children who received six months of bi-weekly center-based visits in which developmental activities were conducted with the infants (mean age 9.3 months) and demonstrated to their parents for use at home (written instructions were provided). The comparison group of 16children (mean age 8.45 months) received no intervention. Group assignment wasbased on date of program entry (July to December entrants were experimental, and March to June entrants comparison). Assessments used were the Griffiths Mental Scale and the H.O.M.E. Inventory.The only statistically significant differencefound at the end of the six months (pretest/posttest design) was in the \"provisionof appropriate play materials\" subscale of the H.O.M.E. Again, the introduction of a relatively high intensity home-based intervention with infants with disabilities yielded no statistically significant differences in child developmental performance. Finally,a recently published report from the Infant Health and DevelopmentProgram (IHDP, 1990) indicated that a combined home- and center-based interventionprogram for loobirthweightinfants was effective inimprovingthecognitive 24 4 Arkansas Intensity 244 development of these at-risk children, but that the effects for very low birthweight infants(< 1500g) were almost nonexistent. Thatis,mean Stanford-Binet IQdifferences at age 36 months favored the intervention group by 13 points for allchildren in the study, but the difference in proportions of children in this lowest birthweight group with IQs less than 70 was negligible (26.8% in the interventiongroup versus 28.7% in the control group). Thus the data fail to demonstrate a significant impact of intervention for children most at-risk due to low birthweight.The implications of this finding for children with developmental delays are unclear..ine research reported here represents an effort to fill a gap in the literature with respect to the optimal intensity of home-based services. This research enrichesthe existing data base and yields information helpful in determining the optimal frequency of home visits for young children with disabilities. It is an especiallyvaluable addition to the literature in thatit provides three to four years of follow-up data on the developmental status of the children.The effects of varying the intensity of service were investigated within theframework of Family Systems Theory (Haley, 1976, 1980). The long-term (thrce tofour years) impact of two intensity levels (once-per-week versus twice-per-week homevisits) on both child and family outcomes was assessed. Family systems theory, anextension of the interaction process approach, provides a conceptual framework fromwhich to study the impact of early intervention on the families of children with disabilities.A variety of factors that influence the developing child are includedin this framework, and several factors considered most important were evaluated inthe present investigation. Specifically, family demographics, sources of supportavailable to the family and child, family interaction style, and parental stress weremeasured.Attention was paid to differential effects of intervention intensity onchildren with varying levels of severity of disability. Parent involvement was alsoassessed because some data suggest that interventions requiring substantial parent 245 Arkansas Intensity 245time may actually increase stress and disrupt family functioning and because home-based delivery systems often require significant aiounts of parent time (Turnbull, Summers,& Brotherson, 1983).Teaching quality and adherence to the researchprotocol was monitored. Finally,the studyincludes an analysis of the costdifferences between the two levels of intensity, an area in wioch Barnett and hiscolleagues (Barnett, 1986; Barnett & Escobar, 1987) have noted a sparsity of data. Overview of StudyChildren andbfamilies participating in this study were randomly assigned toeither the standard or the expanded home-based intervention group.Additionalcenter-based services such as occupational, physical,and speech therapy ii;ereavailable to children in both groups and were provided with an intensity levelapproximately equal to the frequency of home-based services for each group. Expandedservices were funded collaboratively (throuyh the efforts of the service providersand EIRI) for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 academic years.All children and parents completed a battery of tests that measured the child'sdevelopmental status, family demographics, parental stress, sources of support, andfamily adaptability and cohesion. Enrollment was conducted during two academicyears (1986-87 and 1987-88), such that two cohorts of subjects were enrolled. Thefirst cohort completed its fourth posttest in 1990, while the second cchort completedits third (see Table 4.1).

As explained below, children in the programs involved with this project qualified for participation on the basis of their age and type and severity of disability. For each child whc ieLthe study criteria, parents signed an informed consent indicating that they were willing to participate in either the standard intensity or the expanded intensity conditions based upon a random assignment. Children were not enrolled in the studyif over 48 months of e.geat thetime of pretesting. This ensured that all participants received a minimum of one year of treatment before graduation to public school programs. The children were initially screened using the Developmental Profile II (Alpern, Boll, & Shearer, 1980). If they were functioning ',.dnificantly below age level, further individualized assessments were administered.A child who couldcomplete75% ofitemsathis/herage range wasexcluded from further evaluation.Three age levels (0 to 20 months; 21 to 36 months; and 36 to 48 months) and three levels of disabiiity (severe [< 25% of age level]; moderate [25 to 50% ofage level]; and mild 151 to 75% of age level on the Developmental Profile]) were included for stratification purposes.Recruitment.All families with children receiving services prior to the 1986-87 academic year, and all new referrals during that year and the Fall of the 1987-88 year were approached by personnel from the Benton County Sunshine Preschool or the Richardson Center for possible participation in the study. Of those approached, all but 5(2 at the Sunshine program and 3 at the Richardson Center) agreed to participate.This represents a 94% (78 of 83) rate of participation. Assignment to groups. A total of 78, 3- to 48-month-old children with mild tosevere developmental delays were randomly assigned to the two treatment conditionsafter stratification by chronological age and developmental functioning level (asdescribed above). A complete description of assignment procedures is provided inthe 1987 Annual Report of the Early Intervention Effectiveness Institute. 249 Arkansas Intensity249 Attrition.Sixty-seven children were posttested one year after pretest, 61 children were tested after two years, and 56 children after three years (see Table 4.1).Forty-nine of the 58 children in the first cohort completed fourth year posttesting.The number of children not participating at each posttest and the reasons for non-participation are presented in Table 4.2.Those children whose parents refused further participation had reached school age and were being assessed at school.The parents were concerned that these children were being tested toomuch, and the common sentiment was that too much testing would be aversive for their children.One family at the Richardson Center refused because they felt the family measures were too intrusive. A major cause of attrition at the Sunshine Preschool was difficulLy in locating families at the time of posttesting.These were primarily families that moved frequently and did not have telephones. One child at each site was placed in foster care and was, therefore, dropped from the study.

Thecontentofthehomevisits wastakenfromtheIEP,which wasbasedon recommendations made by the multidisciplinary assessment team, which typically 259 Arkansas Intensity 257 includedapsychologist,speech/language pathologist, OT/PT,educator,and the child's parent. Goali and objectives for the child were agreed upon by the educatorand the parent, considering the parents' needs and the child's progress over time. A variety of assessment instruments and curricula were used to develop the objectives in the IEP.Intervention programs focusing on development of functional skills were provided by the home teachers and were individualized based on the child's developmeNtal level and family's functioning. Typical goals included self-help (particularly feeding), gross motor,and communication skills. The primary care taker was required to demonstrate skill in positioning, feeding, and in 15 cases, medical technology such as oxygen, respirators, gavage feeding, and catheters. The home teachers werespecially trained in these areas and helped parents meet the medical as well asdevelopmental needs of their children. Children with less severe disabilitiesreceived programs focusing on their language, cognitive, self-help, and gross and fine motor needs.Home teachers were assigned to children based on the children's level offunctioning such that each teacher served approximately equal numbers of childrenin both groups. Three of the nine teachers had extensive experience with the severely disabled. T'IC other teachers had early childhood backgrounds as indicatedin Table 4.6, which also indicates the number of children served by each teacher in each group.Each teacher was observed at least two times annually by the EIRI staffcoordinator and consistently demonstrated knowledge, creativity, and sensitivity indealing with young children with disabilities and their families.Home visits included the following activities: warm-up play period, discussionof current concerns and child's status, direct 1:1 programming designed to meetspecific objectives, work with the parents, discussion of progress made towards 21;0 Table 4.6Teacher Qualification and Original AssignmentsArkansas Intensity258 # of Children # of ChildrenTeacherEducation Experience in Standard in Expanded 1 14 years 1 year 5 4 2 12 years 6 years 4 6 3 12 years I year 0 2 4 B.A. 2 years 7 6 5 M.A. 3 years 5 7 6 12 years 10 years 6 6 712+ years 1 year 4 58 12+ years 1 year 5 5 9 B.A. 2 years 0 1TOTAL 36 42 specific objectives, work with the parents, discussion of progress made towardsobjectives, and data recording. When ending the visit, the teacher reminded the parent of the next visit and of any scheduled therapies; left data sheets, programdescriptions, detailed instructions, and materials for the parent to use; and gavethe parent encouragement for their efforts. Program data and anecdotal notes were recorded for each home visit.The curriculum was based on comprehensive assessments and a modification of the Learning Accomplisnment Profile. The home teacher brought a variety of materialsand toys for programs aildthe child's folder for recording data. She workedindividually with the child, keeping data on 4 to 6 goal areas. Every attempt was made to involve the parents in the activities. For example, the home teacher might demonstrate how to position a child for feeding and provide direct modeling, shaping,prompting, and positive reinforcement to the parent. Once the teacher had instructedthe parent on how to carry out the activity, a schedule was set up for the parent 261 Arkansas Intensity259 to For feeding of the IEPs wererandomlysampled forevaluation and were found to be age appropriate, developmental, and functional innature.)

Non-attendance at regularly scheduled sessionswas also recorded according to the reason for non-attendance. Table4.5, discussed above, contains attendance data by group for the twoyears during which expanded services were available (1987-87 and 1987-88).Rates of attendance for home visits were nearly equal acrossgroups (81% for the standard group versus 82% for the expanded group). 2.Data describing the level of parent involvement. Home teachers rated parentsin three areas: attendance (in IEP meetings, therapy, home visits),knowledge regarding their child and rights, and support activities(follow through, communication with staff, form completion, etc.).Parents were rated on each area with a 3-point scale, 1=low,2 =average,3 = high.Table 4.7 contains the results of this teacherrating of parent involvement. Although none of the between groupdifferences are statistically significant, thelarge effect sizes(Mean = .37) suggest that teachers rated parents in the expanded groupas more involved than those in the standard group.

Thusthe minimum score was 6 and the maximum was 40. Actual teacher ratingtotalr are presented in Table 4.8. Although there are some differencesamong teachers, the fact that all teachers had children in each groupmeans that these differences did not bias the results of the study.

The EIRI Site Coordinator metwith both Richardson and Sunshine Coordinators as well as with parents,ancillary staff, and all home teachers. In addition, the EIRI SiteCoordinator attended a sample of home visits to obs2rve each teacherat work.Results of the site reviews indicated that the project was wellorganized and implemented. The program files were in good order,containing up-to-date IEPs, quarterly reports of progress, assessmentinfcrmation, and description of services received. Randomly selectedIEPs were reviewed, and all were found to contain the following: (1)a statement of current level of performance (both norm and criterionreferenced); (2)annual goals and short-term objectives that werefunctional, appropriate, and individualized; (3) evaluation of criteriafor determining when the objectives were met; and (4) timelines formonitoring. Cost of alternative interventions. The cost of the Sunshine Preschool andRichardson Center programs as described above was determined using the ingredient approach.Theingredients approach isasystematic, well-tested procedure foridentifying all of the social costs for implementing alternative programs, includingcosts that are often omitted from cost analysis such as contributed (in-kind) andshared resources. In this approach, an exhaustive list of resources used by eachalternativeis developed,and the ingredients are costed according to observedmarketvalues(e.g.,salaries)or opportunity cost (e.g.,parenttime).Anopportunity cost is the value of a resource in its next best alternative use. Forexample, parents participating in intervention activities could have b(len engaged inotherproductive activities; these foregone activities represent a cost to parents.Since we have no information about any one individual's opportunity costs,we estimated the value of an individual's time based on national data. lhe amountof parent or non-parent volunteer time required for the study was assigned thepecuniary value of $9 per hour based on the \"median usual weekly earning for full-time work\" plus benefits (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989). 2f;5 Arkansas Intensity 263 All costs are in 1990 dollars. In cases where program costs were compared overseveral years, costs were adjusted for inflation using the Fixed Weighted Price Index for state and local government purchases (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1988). In addition, the total costs of program and contributed resources were discounted using discount rates of 3% and 5%. Discounting adjusts the costs for the real rate of return that the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere.Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time. Costs are based on actual expenditures for direct service and administrative personnel, occupancy, equipment, travel, materials and supplies, miscellaneous and contributed resources. Total costs in each resource category for both programs werefirst added together and then prorated according to program intensity: 60% of resources were consumed by the high-intensity program and 40% by the low-intensity program.Allocation is based on total number of child visits to the high-intensityprogram as contrasted with the total low-intensity child visits out of the total number of visits to both programs. Cost per child was determined by dividing totalresource cost in each category by the number of children receiving services in each group.Table 4.10 presents the cost per child ;n each of these resource categories.Direct service and administrative costs included salaries plus benefits foreach staff member according to the percentage of ETE allocated to the program.OccupanLy charges were based upon the replacement value of the facilities in whichthe programs were housed, annualized to account for interest and depreciation, and included all utilities, insurance, and maintenance costs. Equipment costs were based on the m3rket replacement value of office furniture and equipment used by theprogram and also included equipment repair. Equipment cost, like facilities, was annualized to account for interest and depreciation. Staff transportation costs forhome visits and other job-related travel were reimbursed by Sunshine Preschool andRichardson Center at the rate of $.23 per mile and $.22 per mile, respectively.

Data CollectionData concerning child and family functioning were collected at enrollment and annually thereafter. Testing procedures and results of each data collection effort are presented below.Recruitment, training, and monitoring of diagnosticians. Three diagnosticians and alocal assessment supervisor were trained and certified by EIRI standards.None were employed by either service provider, and testing assignments were made by theassessmentsupervisor to ensure thatalldiagnosticians were unaware of subjects'groupplacement.Thediagnosticians possessedmastersdegreesin psychology,andthesupervisorhadaPh.D.Theassessmentsupervisorwasresponsibli for shadow scoring 10% of each diagnostician's test administrations,scheduling testing, and collecting, reviewing, and sending all protocols to the EIRI site coordinator.Interrater reliability for the BDIs that were shadow scored were calculated by dividingthe number of agreements by the total number of itemsadministered.Reliability coefficients averaged .95 (range .80 to 1.00). Pretest.Parents of each child participating in the study signed an informedconsent form and provided demographic information. Children were administered theBattelle Developmental Inventory, and parents completed the Parenting Stress Index,Family Support Scale, Family Resource Scale, Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes,and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales as pretest measures.Parents were paid a $20 incentive for pretesting. As explained later,data from these measures were used as covariates in the analyses as well as forinvestigating whether certain types offamilies or certain types ofchildrenbenefited more from intervention than others.2f;s Arkansas Intensity 266 Posttest #1.First year posttest data were collected on 67 children. Data were collected in May and June, 1987, for the first cohort, and in May and June, 1988, for the second. Measures included the BDI and the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD), in addition to the various parent questionnaires mentioned above. Iraddition,parents completed a satisfaction with treatment questionnaire,a report of child's health, and a report of additional services received(i.e.,servicesthat werenotprovidedaspartoftheintervention program).The SICD was chosen because of the intervention emphasis on language development.Pretest demographic data and treatment verification data were used in the analyses to improve the generalizability of our data by allowing us to control forfamilydemographicdifferencesanddifferences intheintensityofthe intervention.The parent incentive for the first posttest was increased to $30because of the addition of the SICD.Posttest #2.Second year posttest data were collected in May and June, 1988, for Cohort 1,and May and June, 1989, for Cohort 2. Sixty-one children completed the second posttest. Measures of child functioning included the B01, SICD, and theVineland; the standard set of parent measures was again administered. With the addition oftheVinelandtothe posttest measures, theparentincentive waS increased to $50.Posttest #3.Third year posttest data have been collected on 56 children.Measures of child functioning included the BOI, SICO, and Vineland; the standardset of parent measures was again administered. The parent incentive was $50, as established for the third posttest.Posttest #4.Fourth year posttest data were collected in May and June 1990 un49 children in the first cohort; data are expected for 12 more children in the 2ndcohort in the Spring of 1991. The same measures were used as on the 3rd posttestand parents were again paid $50 for participating. Arkansas Intensity 267Results and Discussion nparability measures appearinTable4.11.No statistical,: significant pretest differences were found in any HI domain, althoughthe high intensity group performed at higher DQ levels in all domains. Family measures also revealed some statistically significant pretest differences at eachposttest group with regard to demographic characteristics, mothers' occupationalstatus, hours per week mothers were employed, maternal education, and the percentageof childrenin daycare were all higher among the expanded group, although thestatistical significance of the differences varied between posttest session (see Table 4.4).These differences were investigated in posttest analyses. It is worthnoting that these differences existed even though subjects were randomly assigned to groups.Also,ininterpreting the results of the outcome measures for this study,itis important to remember that if thereisa pretreatment bias in the groups,it appears to be in favor of the expanded intervention group. Measures of Child FunctioningResults of the four posttests are contained in Table 4.12. Battelle pretestdata (in each domain) were the best predictors of Battelle posttest scores, withcorrelations ranging between .67 and.96.Allcorrelations were statisticallysignificant at the p < .001 level.Regression analyses indicated that when BDI totalDQ(Age Equivalent/Chronological Age) was usedasacorrelate of childfunctioning measures, other variables, including family data, did not account fora statistically significant additional amount of variance in outcome measures. Whenthe pretest demographic measures that were statistically significantly different(see Table 4.4) were included, missing data caused some cases to be dropped. Thechanges in posttest scores resulting from their inclusion were so small that it was decided to not use them as covariates.

Thus, pretest BM, Total DQ, and maternal educationwere used as covariates in the ANCOVAs, with treatment groups (expanded intensity vs. standard intensity) as the independent variable and the Battelle DQs as dependent variables.No statistically significant mean differences were found on any of the child measures at any of the posttests. Although some fairly strong positive effect sizes were found in two BDI subdomains and one Vineland subdomain at third posttest,these differences disappeared at fourth posttest, suggesting that they may be onlyrandom variations. Measures of Family FunctioningPosttest analyses of family functioning measures are presented in Table 4.13.Pretest scores indicated in the tables were included as ccvariates for posttest scores.The data indicate that families in the expanded group are functioning morelike \"ideal\" families with respect to their adaptation and cohesion scores, but that theyaremore stressed and havelesssupportthanfamiliesinthestandardintervention group. Table 4.13 indicates that only a couple of differences arestatistically significant (i.e., FSS at second posttest, and FACES adaptation atfourth posttest), but there are large effect :;izes on the PSI and FILE data favoringthe standard group at fourth posttest, and nearly equally large effect sizes on theFACES aaaptation and cohesioo scores favoring the expanded group. Further analyses suggest that differt.ices in stress scores are related to increased stressors measuredby the FILE and to reduced family cohesion as measured by the FACES. That is, whenthe sample was divided into high and low stress groups, the low stress group reportedlower FILE scores and cohesion scores that were closer to the \"ideal\" (as definedby McCubbin and Olson) on the cohesion scale of the FACES III.

The results ofthe parental education and child health data analyses suggest that the developmental progress of the children in this study was not affected by either their parent's assessment of the child's health status or by parental completion of high school.Regarding the parental involvement data, parents were rated as \"highly involved\" if their total teacher rating score ranged from 7 to9 and those rated as \"less involved\"if their total score was 6 or less. Although differences found between these groups are not statistically significant, the effect sizes in three BOI domains (personal-social, communication, and cognition) were largeatsecond and third posttest (average .41 and .30, respectively), favoring highly involved parents (Table 4.14).Aver,ge effect sizes in these domains at first and fourth posttest wereunimpressive (.06 and .18, respectively). These varying effect sizes provide no clew direction as to cause and effect. It may be that parent involvement and childdevelopmental outcome are related, but if there is a cause/effect relationship, thedirection of that relationship is uncertain. This uncertainty is compounded by thefact that parents rated as more involved had children with more severe delays. Itmay also bethat teacher ratings of parent involvement were related to cnilddevelopmental progress or to their relationship with the parents. Unfortunately, we found no unbiased and reliable way of assessing parent involvement.Thus, it is not possible. to draw conclusions from this finding. Conclusions The absence of statistically significant differences between groups should notbe viewed negatively. Rather, it could be considered an indication that resources 27!)

Although larger frequency differences are not addressed, childrenin the first cohort did receive one year of service at an approximately 3:1 ratio (based on attendance data; see Table 4.5). Dividing the sample into groups with more andlesssevere disabilities also failed to produce statistically significantdifferences.This finding casts still more doubt on the conventional wisdom thatmore frequent home visits are more effective than less for children with severe disabilities.Findings from the analysis of parent involvement data gathered in this studyare ambiguous given the decline in effect sizes observed at fourth posttest (Table4.14), but the effect size data do suggest that this may be an area worthy of further investigation. Serious consideration should be given to the Sandow et al. (1981)recommendation that intervention be more intense when it is first delivered and betapered off as parents gain skill and comfort with their own abilities. Thisrecommendation is based on the findings of Sandow and her colleagues and of Barreraal. (1986).Barrera et al.found that children who were most at-risk achievedsignificantlylarger ,:ognitive gains thanchildren who were lessat-risk(asdetermined by birth weight). Barrera et al. suggested that intervention effortstarget children and families who are at serious risk because these families may bemore receptive to intervention. These investigators appeared to be following theadvice of Sandow et al. by conducting home visits weekly for the first three months,every other week for the next six months, and once a month for the last three monthsof the first year.Future investigators should attempt to get parent involvement data from severalsources (e.g., parents, professionals, and school records) and analyze these databoth separately and in combination relative to their impact, or lack cf impact, onchild development. 2S1 ARC 277NEW ORLEANS ASSOCIATION FOR RETARDED CITIZENSProject COMPARISON: Severely Handicapped Infants--Center-based developmental interven-tion delivered by paraprofessionals trained through an inservice model vs.thecenter-based developmental intervention delivered by paraprofessionals trainedthrough an intensive, in-classroom model. LC)Ctd_CONTACT PERSON: David Sexton,Professor and Chair, Department ofSpecial Education, University of New Orleans EIRICOORDINATORS: Mark Innocenti and Linda GoetzeLOCATION:New Orleans, LouisianaDATEC)FTHEREPORT:4-8-1991 Rationale for the Study Thereisachronicandcriticalshortage of certified personnel in earlychildhood special education (McLaughlin, Smith-Davis,&Burke,1986).Thisshortage is especially acute in ruraland inner-city areas (Huntington, 1988;McLaughlinetal.,1986).Withthepassage ofP.L. 99-457,this shortage willlikelyincrease as early childhood intervention program grow to provide services to a greater number of ck'sfdren. At present, partly as a result of thisshortage, it is not uncommon to have noncertified personnel providing services toyoung children with disabiliti s (Huntington, 1988; Teaching Resources, 1985; Weiner& Koppelman, 1987). The possibility of using noncertified individuals, supervisedby appropriately trained and certified/licensed personnel, as interventionists inearly childhood programs has been discussed as an appropriate and feasible strategy0 2E2 ARC 278 (Innocenti & White, 1988; Peters & Deiner, 1987). In fact, Head Start, the largestprovider of early intervention services in the United States, is primarily staffed by trained paraprofessionals. A question raised by this strategy for staffing earlyintervention programs is what levels of training and support are required for thesenoncertified individuals to deliver effective services (Peters & Deiner, 1987). Thepurpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of systematic training,ongoing technical support and assistance, and expanded materials and equipment toa program that used noncertified personnel asinter:entionists would result inenhanced child growth and improved family functioning when compared with the existing program. ReviewalRelated ResearchFor the purposes of this report, noncertified personnel will be referred to asparaprofessionals and defined as any individual, including those with a universitydegree and/or formal certification, who is providing services to a child in an areain which he/she is not specifically certified (Pezzino, 1984). Research on the effectiveness of paraprofessionals has demonstrated that paraprofessionals can teachnew skills disauilities 1973;Schortinghais & Frohman, 1974; Shearer & Shearer, 1972). A difficulty with themajority of this research is that intervention vs. no intervention was compared;therefore, it is difficult to determine whether paraprofessional training proceduresresult in intervention that is any better for children and families than what theywould have received in the absence of special training to the paraprofessional.The most commonly used training procedures for paraprofessionals consists oforientations and inservice sessions (Frith & Lindsey, 1982).Research studiesinvestigating these common approaches generally provide information only on changes inteacher knowledge and attitudes (Farrell,1982;Johnson & Ferryman, 1969).2E3 ARC 279 Information that has beenpresented on teacher behavior as aresult ofthis inservice, classronm-type training has not been positive (Farrell, 1982). Data on how these teacher changes affect the children with whom they are working is usually not presented.An alternative to this inservice training model for paraprofessionals is the therapy or collaborative consultant model (Striefel & Cadez, 1983).With this model, a certified professional provides the assessment of the child with a disabilities and outlines the programming to be given. The professional trains the paraprofes- sional in the implementation of a program and in data collection practices until theparaprofessional metts a specified criteria. The paraprofessional then assumes responsibility for the program. The professional makes regular contacts with the paraprofessional to observe the implementation of the program, provide feedback (and retraining if necessary), check the program data, and make program changes as needed.A variation of the therapy consultant model was used by the Social IntegrationProject (SIP) to provide services to children who were disabled and were placed in an integrated daycare center where the primary teaching staff were paraprofessionals (Rule, Killoran, Stowitschek,Innocenti,& Striefel,1985; Rule et al.,1987). Children with disabilities in SIP demonstrated significant skill increases while inthe program, and paraprofessional attitudes were positive toward the program (Ruleet al., 1987). Children in the SIP program were also compared to matched children ina professionally staffed intervention program (Rule et al., 1987).Resultsindicated no difference between programs on measures of child functioning.The results of the studies reviewed.above suggest that paraprofessionals canbe effective intervention agents. A variety of training procedures for para-professionals have resulted in children making development gains, but comparativestudies of differint training procedures are rare. A comparative study of aparaprofessional versus a professional implemented intervention program found no 2E4 ARC 280 differene in child functioning (Rule et al., 1987).Unfortunately, this study was confounded in that the paraprofessionally implemented program was mainstreamed (it occurred in a daycare setting that mixed children with and without disabilities) and the other was not; children were matched and not randomly assigned to groups, and the size of the subject sample was small.The uurrent study partially replicated the Rule et al.(1987) study while avoiding some of the confounds they encountered. Random assignment was used to assign subjects to groups, andalarger subject sample was employed. Another difference from the Rule et al. study is that this study compared the effect of two different methods of training paraprofessionals (variation of the consultant versus the inservice model) on child and family functioning. A final difference is that this research occurred in an inner-city intervention program, an identified personnel shortage area (McLaughlin et al., 1986), rather than a suburban setting. Overview of StudyThis study contrasted a commonly-used paraprofessional service and training model with a paraprofessional service model that included a more intensive training component in a center-based, inner-city service program. The purpose of this study was to provide information on the effect of these different training procedures on interventionsuccessas measuredbychildand family functioning, while also considering cost-effectiveness data. The Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC) in New Orleans provided center-based developmental intervention services for childrenwith disabilities from birth to 3 years of age living in the inner-city area.Paraprofessional staff who were trained through monthly inservice sessions and hadlimited supervision or contact with professional personnel implemented the program.The ARC was separated into two programs for this study. One program carried on without change (basic program). In this program, staff continued to receive monthly inservicesessions.Theotherprogram wasaugmentedthroughtrainingfrom 2 E 5 ARC 281 professionals using a variation of the therapy consultant model.Training for the augmented program focused on increasing the structure of the program by teaching systematic intervention strategies, by providing ongoing technical assistance and support, and by providing expanded materials and equipment.Results from the study provide important information in a number of areas not usually addressed. 1.Although the primary focus was on child growth, benefits to the familywere possible,and measures of family functioning were obtained.Family functioning has been an overlooked area of early interventionresearch in the past (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Dunst, 1986). 2.Under P.L. 99-457, many programs will have to engage in training andcertification of some type with their noncertified personnel to comeinto compliance with the law (Innocenti & White, 1988; Peters & Deiner,1987).Knowledge regarding the efficacy of various training methodswill be needed. 3.The ARC program was very typical of what now exists in many rural andinner-city programs (Huntington, 1988; Teaching Resources, 1985). 4.As cost-effectiveness data from different approaches will be importantfor making administrative decisions, that data was also collected. Methods This study was conducted in conjunction with the New Orleans Association forRetarded Citizens (ARC), a nonprofit, United Way agency affiliated with both the National ARC and Louisiana ARC. At the time of the study, the ARC was governed by a board of directors compo3ed of experts in the field of education for the disabled,consumers of the services, and people in the community. Funding for the ARC camefrom United Way and the Louisiana Office of Ment:1 Retardation and Developmental Disabilities.When this study was conducted, the ARC was the largest provider ofservices to 0- to 3-year-old children with disabilities in the New Orleans area.Three ARC-operated centers provided services to children (the Main, Jefferson, andWest Bank sites) as well as operating a work activities center for adults withdisabilities at the Main site. 2 E. G.7,91 ARC 282The interyention programs studied as a part of this project was a 5-day-per-week, center-based program that operated from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. During thefirst year of the study (1986-87), two classrooms at the Jefferson and West Banksites, and three classrooms at the Main site participated in the research. At eachsite, teachers were randomly assigned to either a basic or augmented classroom.During the second year (1987-88), only two of the sites (Main and West Bank)participated in the research due to internal changes at the ARC. Six classroomsfrom these two sites participated (four classrooms at Main). Classrooms remained in the basic or augmented group dependent on the teacher's previous year assignment.The classroom and teacher new to the study at the Main site was designated anaugmented classroom.Due to delays in starting the research program, the first year of interventionwas 6 months in length.The study began late in January 1987 and continued toAugust 1987. Thesecond year of intervention coincided with the traditionalacademic year, from September 1987 to May 1988 (9 months). Subjects.As shown in Figure 5.1, subjects were enrolled in the study in twodifferent years. Forty-five children (24 basic, 21 augmented) between 10 and 34months of age (mean = 23.7) participated in the first year of the study. Of these45 subjects, 31\"graduated\"to preschool programs operated by the local schooldistricts at the end of the first year. The remaining 14 (8 basic, 6 augmented)continued in classrooms of their assigned group.Duringthesecondyear,19new subjects (8basic,11augmented)beganparticipation in the research. Ages of these subjects ranged from 12 to 32 months(mean = 23.0).The primary analyses for this report is on allsubjects who have receivedinterventions. This includes subjects whc have received 6, 9,and 15 months ofintervention.This group consisted of 64 subjects (32 basic, 32 augmented) rangingin age from 10 to 34 months (mean = 23.3) when they began intervention.

Using adevelopmentalquotient calculated bydividing BDItotalageequivalentby chronological age and then multiplying by 100, 78% of the children had developmentalquotients below 65. Almost half (48%) of the children had developmental quotients below 50. Recruitment.The criterion the ARC used to identify a child as disabled wasestablishedbytheLouisiana Office ofMentalRetardationandDevelopmental Disabilities.This criteria qualified a child as disabled if he/she exhibited a mild delay in two or more developmental areas, a severe delay in one or more developmentalarea, or had a condition diagnosed by a physician that may lead to life-long develop-mental delays. The majority of children identified for service at the ARC had moreinvolved disabilities; for example, 17 children in the study had Down syndrome, 8had cerebral palsy, and 9 were multiply disabled (the degree of involvement was alsoindicated by the developmental quotients of the children, as will be reported later).All children and their families who were identified as disabled and werescheduled tc participate in the ARC program were considered for inclusion in the study.Services at the ARC were provided on a first come, first serve basis untilall slots were filled. From this pool, subjects were included in the study basedupon parents' willingness to participate prior to knowing to which treatment groupthey would be assigned. Aformed consent to participate in this study was obtainedfrom the parents. Parent failure to provide informed consent did not exclude a childfrom receiving services at the ARC.Assignmenttogroups.Randcm assignment of teachers to classes (discussedearlier) was accomplished with coded information so that knowledge of which teacherwas associated with which class was not known during subject assignment. The 2;10 ARC 285children at each site were categorized by 6-month age groupings. Independently,another set of researchers, who were familiar with the children's disabilities,categorized children intothreefunctionallevels ranging from leastto most impaired.Based on these categorizations, children were paired by functional levelwithin age category (a 5 x 3 matrix). If pairings were not possible using thisprocedure, children within the same age categories were paired with children in anadjacent functional level category. If that procedure was not possible, childrenwithinthesamefunctionallevelcategories were paired within adjacentagecategories.After all pairings were accomplished, a random procedure (coin toss)was implemented to .assign one member of each pair to the basic condition and thecorresponding pair member to the augmented condition.During the second year, a similar procedure was followed. At each site, an ageby functioning matrix was developed. This resulted in a 4 x 3 matrix, as only onechild (a 12-month-old) was in the 0- to 12-month age range, and the 13- to 18-monthgrouping was expanded to include this subject. Subjects continuing from the firstyear were placed in their assigned groups within the matr:x. Yhe remaining subjectswere randomly assigned to complete matrix pairings.Attrition.In the first year (1986-87), 46 :ubjects participated in the study.One child (augmented) moved from the area during intervention and transferred toanother program. Twenty-three subjects were pretested and began study participationat the beginning of the second year (1987-88). Four subjects (two basic, twoaugmented) withdrew from the study during the year. These subjects withdrew fromall ARC program participation due to individual family problems. These five childrenwere not posttested and are not included in analyses for this study, leaving 64children in the Posttest #1 analysis.54 children were tested for Posttest #2.

Demographic questions related to income, occupation, andother potentially \"sensitive\" variables were left unanswered by some parents. Also,in families where both parents were not living at home, information on fathers wasdifficult to obtain.The demographic profile of the subjects in the two comparison groups at Posttest#2 is very similar to the demographic profile for Posttest #1 (see Table 5.2).Infact, groups at Posttest #2 show fewer intergroup differences than at the earlier posttest.Data regarding differences between the groups for subjects included in the Posttest#2andPosttest#3analysesarepresentedinTables5.2and5.3 respectively.Similar to Postte4t #1, the majority come from Black, low-income families.The demographic variables suggest very similar groups overall for thethree posttest groups of subjects. Intervention ProgramsThe ARC offered two types of early intervention programs for young childrenwho were developmentally delayed: (a)5-day-per-week, center-based program that operated from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.; and (b) an infant service program that provided1 hour of intervention per week to infants with disabilities and their families atone of the three ARC sites. All children involved with the EIRI research were inthe center-based program.In the center-based program, the typical classroom organization contained eightchildren served by a teacher and aide. Teachers and aides were paraprofessionals;most teachers had a bachelor's degree, but none had teacher certification (see Table 5.4).Prior to the participation of the ARC in the EIRI research, classroom staff ARC 291Table 5.4Edu, ational and Teaching Experience of Teachers Involved Study ClassroomSiteEducation #3 Jefferson Bachelor's Degree Education 12 1Teacher #4 West Bank High School Diploma * * 102AUGMENTED CONDITION:Teacher #5 Main 3 Years of College * * 102Teacher #6 Main 3 Years of College * * 17 1Teacher #7 Jefferson Bachelor's Degree Early Childhood 1 1Teacher #8 West Bank Bachelor's Degree Early Childhood 32 * Major not presented unless teacher had a Bachelor's Degree received training through general, agency-wide inservice sessions (see Table 5.5).Child goals and objectives were determined by consultants in the areas of speech andlanguage and motor therapy, but these consultants interacted minimally with each other or with the classroom staff. Instructional activities occurred throughout thecourse of the day, but the quality and quantity of these activities varied.

ARC 292Research at the ARC investigated two different methods for training parapro-fessional teachers to work effectively with young children with disabilities. Theinterventions consisted of a continuation of services as they had been provided inthe past where classroom staff received training through inservice sessions versusan augmented condition in which teachers and aides received in-classroom training from professional consultants who held a nationally recognized certification ;teachercertification, CCC, OTR, etc.) and who had experience in early intervention. Tables5.4 and 5.5 present information on the experience of teachers who were involved inthe study and the inservices received, by classroom assignment of teachers in bothconditions, while the study was occurring.Basic interventionprogram.In the basic intervention program, classroompractices were similar to those that were in effect prior to beginning the study andare similar to those described above. Paraprofossional classroom staff received a series of topical workshops throughout the course of the school year (see Table 5.5).As described, classroom staff in the basic intervention program had minimal contactwith the professionals who recommend specific goals for children. A multidisci-plinary therapy model was used that dia not focus on staff communication. Teachersand aides were not trained in the implementation of specific curricula or in theimplementation of specific child vograms. For staff in the basic interventionprogram, no procedures for providing feedback on their child programs or on specificteaching techniques was available.Childrenin these classrooms received Individual Habilitation Plans (IHPs)developed by teachers based on professional recommendations and on ateacher-administeredcriterion-referenced instrument(HarrisonCountychecklist).Instructional activities were generally structured in a one-to-one teaching fornat.Instructional activities occurred throughout the day, but no daily systematiclearning plans were available. This created variability in the types and frequency 288 ARC 293 of instruction that occurred within a class and across classrooms.The lack of a systematic strategy resulted in teaching practices that would not be considered \"best practice\"in special education. For example, instructional activities that wereimplemented in the basic classes were often not related to child goals,child progress through instructional sequences were often not data based, and appropriate teaching techniques were not consistently applied. Educational materials existed in these classrooms, but were not adequate to meet all child development goals.The teacher for each classroom established a daily schedule where activities were listed by general developmental areas; for example, gross motor time, fine motor time, cognitive time, etc. Activities that occurred during this time were teacher dependent.Some individualized activities occurred, but not systematically. During times when teachers worked individually with a child, no planned activities occurred for the other children.Augmented intervention program. The experimental intervention, referred to asthe augmented intervention program, involved the employment of a collaborative consultation model in the classrooms. Subjects attended ARC classrooms, staffed bysimilarly qualified staff, on the same days and for identical hours as subjects in the basic condition. For classrooms in this condition, the paraprofessional staffreceived training from professionals in their classroom throughout the school day.Professionals were from an interdisciplinary team from the Louisiana State University (LSU) Human Development Center. The professionals worked with classroom staff two to three times per week helping them to design and implement child-specific programs.Professional staff were certified and experienced in infant early intervention.Classroom staff were directly instructed in the purposes of various childobjectives, were taught teaching strategies needed to meet specific objectives, andwere provided regular feedback on their teaching techniques. The fucus of teachingactivities was on teachingchildren needed skills during naturally occurring900w I; 7 ARC 294 classroom routines (i.e., incidental teaching methods during snack, music, free play, etc.; c.f., Haring & Innocenti, 1980). Child IHPs were collaboratively developed by classroom staff and professionals. In addition, materials and equipment neededto meet specific child and group goals or for various classroom activities were provided asnecessary.This equipment included such itemsas:(a)adaptiveequipment for children with physical disabilities; (b)materials for specific programs (such as language cards, adapted bowls and spoons);(c) developmentally appropriate toys, where needed; and (d) additional food items to be used at snacktimes to aid in the implementation of incidental teaching programs.Classroom staff in the augmented intervention program were trained in the use.of a specific curriculum (Louisiana Curriculum for Infants with Handicaps) thatincluded activities to meet objectives, as wellasinadapting curriculum for specific child needs. The majority of instruction in this condition was provided through group individualized formats. That is, although children were primarily ingroup settings, specific child skills were focused on within these settings so each childreceivedinstructionappropriatetohis/herskillsandneeds.TheIndividualized Curriculum Sequencing Model (Guess & Helmsletter, 1986) served as a framework for instructional activities. Treatment VerificationA number of procedures were inccrporated to verify that the interventions werebeing implemented as intended. Table 5.6 presents some of these data. One methodto verify that treatment was received was to collect child attendance data during the intervention. If a child did not attend a program regularly, then evaluatingtreatment effectiveness was confounded by their absence. Daily records on attendancewere kept by ARC staff, and these records were forwarded to EIRI on a monthly basis.In addition to the attendance data, general health data on the children were also collected.Health factors can )otentially effect child progress.

This emphasis on parents was minimal in this study. Parentsof subjects were not required to be involved in their child's education except forattendance at one IHP, meeting and children were transported by the program to andfrom school.This programs' de-emphasis on parents, along with related demographicfactors (i.e., many parents did not have phones, project staff were prohibited fromvisiting federal housing projects for work-related activities, etc.), made obtainingparent related data difficult. Parent satisfaction with the intervention programwas obtained.These data are presented in Table 5.6. Parents in both groups wereequally satisfied with their child's program.Teachers were also asked to rate their perceptions of each child's parents cndimensions of support, knowledge, and attendance. Because this rating was based onvery limited contact between parent and teacher, these ratings should be interpretedwith caution.Teachers' ratings of parents at the ARC did not result in groupdifferences (Table 5.6), and most parents were positively rated. Parents were free to access other services that were available in the community.However,sincetherewerefewse(vicesavailable,relativelyfewchildrenparticipated in such programs. Information was obtained from parents at each of thethree posttests on the quantity of services subjects received outside the ARCintervention.Parent reports of additional services did not result in the fundingof group differences for the three posttests reported in Table 5.6.Site review.An important aspect of treatment verification is the site review.The purpose of this review was to collect information about the nature and qualityof early intervention services that were being delivered at the ARC, to verify thatthe research being conducted by' EIRI was being implemented asintended, and to ARC 297 collect needs assessment data that may be useful to site administrators when seeking technical assistance.The first site review was conducted April 24, 1987. The ARC was found to be complying with EIRI research expectations. Specific areas were reviewed, and clear d'fferences between basic and augmented conditions were found. For interested readers, greater detail is given in the site review report available from EIRI. The second site review was conducted on April 26 and 27, 1988 (a site review report is available). The process differed for this second review in two major respects:(1) The review team included a member not affiliated with EIRI, but a person who was familiar with early intervention practices (David Sexton, Professor and Chair of Special Education, University of New Orleans); and (2)instead of treating the ARC as one program, the basic and augmented conditions were evaluated as if they were separate programs. Ona site reviewevaluation form (available from EIRI), the basic program received 75.3 of a possible 150 points, and the augmented program received 103.7 points of 150. It was clear that the ARC research was being implemented as intended and that there was a substantial difference in the nature of the services being provided in favor of the augmented condition. This fact was represented quantita- :ively, but qualitative differences in conditions further emphasized the distinction. The ARC was doing a competent job. The inclusion of procedures used in the augmented condition clearly appeared to raise intervention near a level that would be considered\"best practice.\" Overall,the site review team agreed that the augmented condition contained the procedures of choice based on available resources. Costs of alternative interventions. During the 1987-88 academic year, cost data for each of the intervention programs were obtained using an \"ingredients\" approach.On Table 5.7,all cost estimates were adjusted for inflation to 1990 dollars.In addition, at the bottom of lable 5.7, the figures are discounted at 3% 3 [. 3 ARC298 and 5%.This approachincludes resources such asdirect services childbehavior.3 4 ARC 299 Table 5.7Cost Per Child Per Year for ARC (1990 Dollars) Intervention ProgramsIn ARC Paraprofessional Training Study ResourceBasic(N Occupancy 373 (5%)Agency Resources $10,827Total Resources 11,594$12,64713,044 $13,39813,819 * Totals may not add up due to rounding errors. 3 5 ARC 300 The observation system developed fo .. this study was based on the model of ecobehavioral assessment as described by Carta and Greenwood (1985) and was modeledafter the Ecobehavioral System for Complex Assessment of the Preschool Environment [ESCAPE] (Carta et al., 1985).The instrument, the Ecobehavioral Assessment for Infant Programs [EAIP] (Atwater, Welge, & Rider, 1988) was designed specifically forintervention programs serving children below the age of three. The EAIP accommodates the behavioral competencies ofvery young children with disabilities and thecharacteristic features of very early intervention programs.Observation for the EAIP were conducted in April and May 1988. Sixteen childrenwere observed in augmented classes and 15 in basic classes. This represents allchildren who were receiving intervention from the program at that time except one from each group. These missing children were absent from school when observations were scheduled. Observations occurred in all six classrooms that were involved in the study.Each classroom was staffed by two paraprofessionals (teacher and aide).The EAIP assesses three major features of center-based early interventionprograms for infants and toddlers: the program ecology, the behavior of teachersand caregivers, and the behavior of child participants. Three specific ecological variables are assessed: the format of a rhild's activity, the materials used in theactivity, and the child's physical location during the activity. For teachers, behavioral variables include teacher direction and the qual;ty of teachers' responses to children.For children, behavioral variables include appropriate engagement inactivities, communica.ive behavior, and competing (or inappropriate) behavior. Abrief description of EAIP variables ispresentedinTable 5.8 (definitions ofvariables can be obtained from EIRI).All variables were recorded on a time-sampling basis as they pertained to anindividual child who was the target of the observation. Data wer,,! recorded during successive 15-second intervals, each consisting of 5 seconds for observation followedby 10 seconds for recording.

At the end of each 10-minute sample,a new target child was observed. An average of 12 10-minute samples, distributedacross several days and different classroom activities, were obtained for every child(range = 9 to 15 samples per child). For each variable (e.g., activity format), onecategory (e.g., snack) was selected to represent each interval. To assess the reliability of the observation system, two observers recorded dataconcurrently and independently for 19% of the samples. Agreement between observers,calculated as the percentage of intervals in which both observers selected the samecategory for a particular variable, averaged 85% across variables, with a range of 74% to 96%.Comparative data from the ecobehavioral analysisfor classrooms from theaugmented and basic conditions are provided in Table 5.9. The percentages representthe average portion of total observation time that children in each condition spentin specific ecological contexts, received direction and response from teachers, andexhibitedparticularappropriateandinappropriatebehaviors.Toevaluatedifferences between conditions, two-tailed t-tests (df = 29) were performed onindividual percentage scores. Asillustrated inTable5.9,teacherswhohadreceivedtheaugmentedintervention services provided more structured and varied classroom experiences thandid teachers who had received only in-service instruction. When compared to thosein basic classrooms, children in augmented classrooms more often participated insnack and participant routines (activities involving joint participation and turn-taking with other children). In basic classrooms, children spent over half theirtime in no identifiable activity. The comparable proportion of times no identifiableactivity occurred was significantly lower in augmented classrooms.30S ARC303Table 5.9Percentage of Time in Categories Observed by the EcobehavioralInstrument for the ARC Paraprofessional Training StudyBasic (n - 15) Augmented (n 16) ES^Value -x(SD) (SD) t ECOLOGICAL CONTEXTSActivity Format Snack 11.079.0526.4313.663.671.70.001Personal 54.0610.5119.7616.486.86-3.26.000 motor equipment 8.828.438.834.95.00.001.998Non-toy materials 17.886.9324.8714.411.741.01.096Pretend play toys 9.578.106.685.921.14-.36.265Manipulatives 16.708.7515.909.95.23-.09.816Books and audio-visual materials 5.565.516.988.00.57.26.572Sensory-perceptual toys .21.583.204.942.415.16.029Other materials 1.351.86.391.071.75-.52.094No access to materials 9.6213.6119.8220.781.60.75.119No contact with materials 30.288.9913.319.425.12-1.89.000 LocationHeld by a teacher .751.59.58.93.38-.11.711Crib or playpen .491.88.00.00Seated table 29.1514.0731.8716.02.50.19.620Adaptive seating 6.7221.5714.5424.44.94.36.354Free-standing chair 6.477.0219.6713.413.461.88.002On floor 21.7510.4822.6220.17.15.08.881None of the above 34.6720.4210.729.764.12-1.17.001 TEACHER BEHAVIOR TOWARD CHILDRENDirectionPhysical direction 5.385.197.544.831.20.42.240Gestural prompts and direction 6.654.686.043.56.41-.13.684Questions 1.851.391.591.22.54-.19.593Environmental 30.9714.5033.1713.31 task feedback .39.29.17.272.22-.76.034Praise .28.44.46.431.20 .41.241Positive .14.28.16.20.20.07.846Ignoring .661.18.19.481.45-.40.163 (continued) BEST COPY AVAILABLE3r: ARC304Table 5.9 (continued)Percentage of Time in Categories Observed by the EcobehavioralInstrument for the ARC Paraprofessional Training Study Basic (n15)Augmented (n 16) tES^Value (SD) (SO) CHILD BEHAVIORActivity EngagementEngagement 35.0514.7729.6015.91.99-.37.332Cooperation with physical direction attention ESAugmented i - Basic i Basic SDThe sign of the ES is not intended to indicate that more or less of the category is better. It only indicatesthe direction of the result. A plus sign indicates the category occurred more for the augmented group: a minussign indicated a higher occurrence in the basic group. Results of the ecobehavioral observations indicate that the augmented interven-tion did have an effect on teacher behavior as it relates to the structure of theirdaily activities, butnotasitrelatedtotheirbehaviortowardchildren.Unfortunately, these activity changes were not accompanied by significantly higher,at the p < .001 level, rates of teacher prompting (categories of physical directionand gestural prompts and demonstration), or positive teacher responses (categoriesof praise and positive task feedback). These teacher behaviors are expected to occurmore frequently when using incidental teaching techniques (Haring & Innocenti, 1988).In addition, they were not accompanied by more positive teacher direction such as 3 10 ARC 305physical and verbal directives. Gestural prompts and demonstration occurred morefrequently-2h% more of the time spent--the p-value at .07 was not significant.An interesting aspect of the ecobehavioral data is the finding that activeengagement was not significantly different between groups. Active engagement isconsidered the critical child behavior to increase to maximize child learning (Cartaet al.,1988).The classroom contexts most frequently used by the teachers inaugmented classrooms appears to have primarily effected child visual attendingbehaviors.This result may require the re-examination of some assumptions regardingthe use of incidental teaching for toddler-aged children and/or the way in whichothers are trained in its use. Data CollectionA variety of measures of child and family functioning were used to examinewhether the interventions resulted in differences between the groups.Recruitment, training, and monitoring of diagnosticians. Local test examinerswere recruited from staff at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Human DevelopmentCenter who were not involved with the ARC research. Examiners were \"blind\" toindividual subject's group assignment. Examiners were certified as competent BDIadministrators through procedures developed by EIRI. These procedures required aminimum of three practice administrations prior to a test session, one of which wasobserved and rated by the LSU site liaison or EIRI assessment coordinator. In addition,examinerssentonevideotapedBDIsessiontotheEIRIassessmentcoordinator for review prior to their first test session, and one each year theyserved as examiners.These training procedures occurred in addition to monitoring in the form of a10% shadow score of all test administrations by the LSU site coordinator for all 4tests administered. All test protocols were then rechecked by EIRI clerks prior toentryoncomputer,anddataonexaminerswaskept.Noproblemsintest ARC 306administration or scoring have been revealed by this process with the ARC examiners.The reliability averages for pretest = .82, Posttest #3 = .93.Examiners also handed surveys and measures to parents to complete during test sessions.These measures were described to parents and assistance was given incompleting the surveys where needed. If unusual circumstances occurred (e.g., aparent unable to read), a second examiner was brought in to assist the parent.Parents were asked not to discuss their child's classroom placement.The BDI examiners also administered the other posttest measures. These measureswere administered at the intervention sites but not in the classrooms. At Posttest#1 (1988), an exception was made, and the Early Intervention Developmental Profile(EIDP) was administered in the classroom. Although examiners were not told whichcondition classrooms were in, differences may have been evident. The EIDP was thelast measure administered. Ten percent of these measures were scored by anotherexaminer (shadow scored), and no problems were encountered. Examiners were alsotrained in the administration of these measures prior to their use. The examinerswho administered Posttests #2 and #3 were examined r.hildrenat Pretest and Posttest #1, thus decreasing the probability that the examiners knowsubject's group assignment.Posttest #1 examiners were recruited from the LSU Human Development Center whilePosttests #2 and #3 were given by Graduate Students at the University of New Orleans.All examiners were blind to the group assignment of the subjects who were tested.Battelle Developmental Inventory. All children were administered the BattelleDevelopmentalInventory(BDI).TheBDImeasuresfivedevelopmentaldomains:personal-social, adaptive, motor, communication, and cognitive. A total BDI score,based onalldomains,can also be determined. Asanorm referenced measureappropriate for children from birth to age 8, the BDI served as the primary measure 312 ARC 307 of child development. Test characteristics of the BDI allow valid assessment in anumber of developmental domains, and the age range it spans allow for its use in longitudinal research. The BDI was selected for use in the EIRI research based upon the results of an expert panel convened to help determine appropriate measures and is used at all EIRI research sites.Measures of faimily functioning. Parents of children in the study completed thefollowing scales of family functioning: Parenting Stress Index (PSI),Family Resource Scale (FRS), and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES).These measures assess, respectively: parent stress, family resources, and functioning of the family in respect to an \"ideal\" family. Family functioning has been an overlooked area of early intervention research (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986); thus, a variety of family functioning instruments were used to detail changes that may occur given different types of early intervention services. These measures also allowed thetermination of services that were more beneficial to certain types of families.These family measures and the BDI (core measures) are completed it each test session.Early Intervention Developmental Profile (EIDP). The EIDP is based on a listing of developmental skills and provides a more comprehensive breakdown of skills by age levelthanis available through the BDI. Withthe severity of of children'sdisabilities in this study, the EIDP may be more sensitive to child gains than theBDI and, thus, a more accurate indicator of child change.Interactive Communication InventorY (ICI). Communication skills were a primaryfocus of the augmented condition, and the majority of children enrolled in the ARC exhioited language delays. The ICI assesses language development in 7 areas (e.g . morphology, phonological, etc.) and, like the EIDP, will allow a more sensitive assessment of child language skills than provided by !.he BDI. ARC 308 Pretest.Subjects involved in the study during the first year were pretested in November and December 1986. Subjects newly enrolled in the study for the secondyear were pretested in October and November 1987. Testing occurred at.each child's respective school. The BDI was administered, and parents, mostly mothers, completedthe family measures. These included those measures described earlier, as well asthe Family Support Scale (FSS) and Family Inventory of Life Events (FILE). Parentsalso provided demographic information. The FS and FILE were measures in the EIRIcore battery for assessment of families. Concerns were raised by site staffregarding the number of family measures with this subject population in light of thenature of the study and intervention services, and some of th family measures weredropped in subsequent years. Families were paid $20 for participating in the datacollection activities.First vosttesting. Posttest #1 occurred at the end of the intervention periodfor all children in the study. For some of the subjects this occurred in August1987; for others, it took place in May of 1988 (see Figure 5.1). The posttestbattery consisted of the core battery of tests and surveys as well as complementaryand treatment verification measures described earlier. Procedures described earlierwere followed for posttest assessment. Parents were paid $40 at Posttest #1.Second posttestino. In 1988, when 1987 \"graduated\" subjects were to receivetheir second pot:ttest, budget negotiations were occurring between the LSU HumanDevelopment Center (HDC) and EIRI. The result of these negotiations was that theHDC Nould not be involvedinpost intervention follow-up activities. As thisnegotiation process was not resolved until lateFall1988,combined with thepreparations needed to train new examiners and locate subjects, it was decided thatall subjects would receive post-intervention follow-up testing during Summer 1989.DavidSexton,professorandchairoftheSpecialEducationDepartment,University of New Orleans (UNO), served as local site coordinator for follow-up 314 ARC 309 activities during the 2nd and 3rd Posttests. Graduate students and faculty at UNO received EIRI Battelle Training and were certified as examiners. Posttest #2 testingbegan in May 1989 and was completed in September 1989 for all subjects who received intervention.Analysis on these data is included in this report.Third posttestina. Posttest #3 was completed for 55 subjects in September, 1990.Assessments were coordinated and given by the same staff at the University of New Orleans _ho conducted follow-up for Posttest #2. Parents were paid $55 forcompleting the Posttest #2 battery, which included the HI, FACES, PSI, FRS, anddemographic and additional services information. Results and Discussion This study examined the effects of two different procedures for trainingparaprofessionals on child and family functioning outcome measures. One training procedure, the basic (control) condition, islow intensive involving only minimalcontact between professionals and paraproiessionals. The other procedure, the augmented(experimental) condition, ishighintensiveandmakesuseofa collaborative consulting model that involv!s frequent and sustained training contactsbetween the professional and paraprofessional.The following section will examine group comparability on pretest measures andpresent the effects of intervention on child and family functioning for all subjectsafter intervention for three posttests.

On measures of parentand family functioning, group differences were found only on PSI measures of child related and total stress. Parents of subjects in the augmented group report greateramounts of stress than parents of basic condition subjects. Families of subjects in buth groups appear comparable in relation to sources of support, occurrence of major life events, and perception of the family in relation to the \"ideal.\"In view of the fact that comparisons were made on 16 different variables, itwould not be surprising to find statistically significant differences on two of them,even if the groups are completely comparable. The average effect size across allpretest measures was -.06, suggesting the groups were comparable. Assuming thatfamilies of children in the augmented group are showing greater levels of stress(effect size of -.29 on thv: PSI Total and FILE), this effect was balanced by greaterlevels of support and resources, and by functioning closer to an ideal family (effectsize of .14 on FRS, FSS, FACES Total). Overall,it appears that the groups were comparable on pretest measures.Posttest #2.Group comparability on pretest measures for subjects compared at this posttest is presented in Table 5.11. These results are similar to the Posttest #1 comparability results. No differences exist between groups on the BDI. The onlyfamily measure where a group difference is indicated ison the PSI.Parents ofchildren in the augmented group reported more stress at pretest. Other familymeasures tended to favor the augmented group, though not significantly so. The average effect size for the family measures of -.10 suggest overall equity of family functioning.The average effect sizes for all pretest measures was -.07. Thissuggests groups were comparable at pretest.Posttest #3.Pretest differences on family and child functioning measures forthe subjects included in Posttest #3 are presented in Table 5.12. Using a p-value 3 Ali ARC 314significance of < .05, differences between the groups were found on the PSI child- related score and PSI Total. For these measures of family stress, the fami1ir5 inthe augmented group continued to report significantly more stress. The averageeffect size across all 16 different pretest family and child functioning measures is -.08.This suggests, as in the previous two posttests, that the groups werecomparable on the measures prior to intervention.

Analysis of covarianceprocedures are useful for two purposes: (a) to increase the statistical power of astudyby reducingerrorvariance;and(J)to adjust forany pretreatment differences which are present between the groups. In either application, the degreeto which analysis of covariance is useful depends on the correlation between tcovariate(s) selected and the outcome variable for which analyses are being done.However, since one degree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, it is generallybest to use a limited number of covariates in any given analysis. All pretest anddemographic variables were considered as potential covariates.

Effects for measures other than childfunctioning included on Table 5.13 were analyzed using an analysis of variance procedure.Ihe results of the analyses reported in Table 5.13 demonstrate nosignificent effects of intervention in favor of the augmented condition as assessedby the BDI, EIDP, or ICI. On the BOI Personal/Soci3l and cognitive scores, thechildren in the basic intervention scored significantly higher than those in the augmented group wit :.-values of .09 and .04, respectively. The average effect sizeacross the total from allthree measures was -.10. These results provide someevidence that the basic group performed better although the BDI scores are notconfirmed by the other child measures.Posttest #2 results are similar to Posttest #1.

These results suggest that alternateforms of intervention did not have a significant effect on parent stress, familyresources, or family adaptation and cohesion. The FRS, with a p-value = .07, impliessignificantly higher resources in the augmented group families than the basic group families.No differences between groups were found on any of the family measures atPosttest #2.This result isnot unexpected based on the group comparability atpretest and the nature of the intervention.Parental stress related to the child is clearly higher for the families who werein the augmentea program than for those who received services in the basic programat Posttest #3. The p-value for the child related PSI has a significant value infavor of the families in the basic group, .03 and an effect size equal to -.60. Noneof the other family measures show significant differences between the groups.Subgroup Analysis. The argument could be raised that one year of interventionwas not sufficient for group differences to emerge. Although this argument haslimited functional utility, as the majority of ARC children only receive one yearof intervention, it can be explored with the 13 children in this study who receivedtwo years of intervention. Tests were conducted to assess the comparability of groups for these 13 childrenon the demographic measures and pretest measures. No differences were found on anyof the demographic characteristics. The combined results on those subjects whoreceived two years oi intervention does not provide support for the augmentedcondition.This is L.ased on analysis of the BJI, EIDP and ICI child functioningmeasures and PSI, FRS, and FACES family measures. Posfiest#1 Severity Analysis. Many subjects in this study exhibited more involveddisabilities, and the developmental quotient of half the subjects was below 50.These factors raised some concerns regarding the possibility of differential effects3'_ 111 ARC318Table 5.14Posttest Measures of Family Functioning for Alternative InterventionGroups for ARC Paraprofessional Training Study One Year of Intervention Variable CovariatesBasic Intervention Augmented Intervention ANCOVAFValueES x(SD)Adj.in x(SD)Adj.;n POSTTEST#1 Parent 193.7-.28TOTAL for each subscala of the FACES are derived from an \"ideal\" score.

To examinethis issue, subjects in each group were placed into a severe or mild disability category based on their pretest scores. A d,.,velopmental quotient (DQ) was obtained by dividing the BDI Posttest #1 total age equivalent by chronological age at Posttest #1 and then multiplying this sum by 100. Subjects ilith a DQ 1(ss than 50 were placed in the severe category, the others in the mild category. A group by severity ofdisability (2 x 2) analysis of variance was then conducted. The results of this analysisforchild functioning measures show that interactions between group assignment and severity of disability are not supported by the data. Using a cutoff of p < .10, none of the BDI or EIDP domains has a significant interaction effect. Conclusions Thisstudyinvestigatedthe effectsoftwodifferenttypesoftraininginterventions for paraprofessionals who worked with toddler-aged children with disabilities.The investigation examined the effect on the paraprofessionals, thechildren they taught, and the families of these children. Training interventions compared were an inservice-based, minimal contact with professionals model--the basiccondition (a commonly-used training arrangement)--versus a consultative model thatused frequent and regular contact with professionals focused on teaching \"best-practice\" intervention strategies (the curriculum sequencing model)--thE augmented condition.The results of this investigation present an interesting mix that hasimplications for many areas of early intervention for toddler-aged children with disabilities.A logical place to begin is with the question, \"did the intervention effect thetarget group at which it was aimed; i.e.,the teachers?\" All of the treatment 3 ARC 320verification data suggest Loat the augmented classroom intervention was beingimplemented as intended. Both of the site reviews suggest that the interventionsin the two classrooms were different, qualitatively and quantitatively favoring theaugmented classrooms. The ESCAPE data and analysis suggest that the paraprofessionaltrainingin the augmented classrooms probably affected the classroom ecology byincreasing the percentage of time children spent in structured formats. All of thevariables for which there were differences in teacher behavior toward childrenfavored the augmented teacher behaviors. Significant differences include lessnegative task feedback, more environmental arrangement, and more gestural promptsand demonstrations inthe augmented teacher responses to children. The datasuggests that the augmented intervention was measurably different from the basicintervention and was providing an intervention that was closer to that which is considered \"best practicc' when compared with the basic condition. However, one area not affected by the augmented intervention was child-engaged behavior. The area maybe an important one in respect to positive child developmental outcomes (Carta etal., 1988; Greenwood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1984; Innocenti, 1990).The second question concerns the effect of the interventions on the childrenin the two intervention groups. :he answer to this question cimes from severaldifferent analytical perspectives. First,it was shown that the child developmentscores were not significantly different at pretest. An analysis of subjects by groupassignment at Posttest #1 showed personal-social and cognitive scores that shiftedin favor of the basic group with effect sizes of -.27 and -.23, respectively. Nordid the severity analysis show any significant interactions between intervention andseverity of disability. Posttest #2 results show personal-social scores stillhigher for the basic subjects when compared with the augmented group, with an effectsize =-.31in favor of the basic subjects, and no differences that favor theaugmented children. Posttest #3 analysis by group showed the largest differences 3.A; ARC 321 to date.The analysis of effects by group results in effect sizes for 13 Posttest#3 measures of family and child functioning which favor the basic group of subjects. Significantchildfunctioning differences were foundonthepersonal-social,cognitive, and total BDI scores. Clearly, the results of the analysis favor thebasic group.A third question concerns the effect of the intervention on the families ofchildren involved in the research. The intervention itself directly affected allfamilies equally: length of daily and yearly intervention is the samein bothgroups, all children are bussed to classroom sites, and all parents are expected tointeract with ,rogram staff at the same level (one IHP conference). Therefore,differencesbetweengroupsinfamily functioning were notexpected,and fewdifferences were found. Only the Family Resource Scale was different at Posttest #1and favored the augmented group. The Parental Stress Index, and the FamilyAdaptation and Cohesion Scale suggested no positive significant differences thatfavor the augmented group. At Posttest #2, there were no significant differenceson any of the family measures. Posttest #3 results suggest that families in thebasic group have less child-related stress than families of children in the augmented group.Twenty-one family measures were evaluated over the three posttests so thatit may be more significant that only two showed significant differences over time.It is clear that the augmented intervention was not cost-effective for childrenor families The augmented program cost $2,200 more than the basic program. For thechildren with mild and severe disabilities the additional services that were providedwith this extra expenditure did not result in increased functioning and may havedecreased their functioning relative to the children with similar disabilities whowere in the basic program. Overall, the results of the current study suggest thata less intensive intervention training program is preferred over the more intensivetraining program that was implemented in the augmented program for paraprofessionals ARC 322working with toddler-aged children with disabilities. There is one caveat, theaugmented intervention did not impact child engaged behaviors even though it waseffective in impacting teaching contexts and teacher behavior. The issue of childengagement deserves further emphasis in efficacy research and training programs.The findings of this study do impact on \"best practice\" beliefs (cf., Dunst et al.,1989; McDonnell & program a home-based program that provides weekly visits.LOCAL CONTACT PERSON: Connie Luthe, Coordinator, Illinois Illinois)DATE OF REPORT: 4-9-1991 Rationale for the Study Anumberofquestionscurrentlyexist regarding the efficacy of earlyinterventionforyoungchildren with disabilities (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986;Dunst, Snyder, & Mankinen, 1989). One ofthesequestionsconcernstheintensity of the program in which the childparticipates. Thecommonassumption for early intervention service is \"more intense is better\" (White et al., 1985-86).However, there is little evidence to confirm or refute this conventionalwisdom for children with disabilities (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Dunst et al., 1989).The intensity issue is a critical issue that speaks to program effectivenessand may directly affec_ funding and services. The recent passage of P.L. 99-457,although opening up service opportunities for a large number of previously unservedchildren, has placed additional financial demands on those organizations that provide 3 Wabash 324intervention services. One area where the issue of effective services and fundingis most pronounced is in regard to providing services to infants and toddler- aged children with disabilities. P.L. 99-457 has left these intervention servicesto state discretion, and funding issues are not well defined. In lieu of clear,experimental evidence regarding the intensity of programs, restrictive funding mayforce service provision agencies into apparently cost-effective, but experimentally untested,options.The purposeofthisstudy wastoinvestigate two commonapproaches, that vary greatly in intensity, for providing early intervention servicesto toddler-aged children with disabilities. The two approaches being contrasted area home-based program that pruvides one weekly visit and a center-based program thatprovides services 5 days per week. Information from this empirical investigation, andotherssuchasthis,willprovideaknowledgebaseforPartHprogramadministrators, parents, and others when developing early intervention programs. Review of Related ResearchThe most common service delivery model for infant and toddler-aged childrenwith disabilities is the home-based model (Bricker, 1986). This model typicallyprovides services on a 1-hour-per-week basis (Bricker, 1986) and generally takes oneof & Zehrback, 1977):(a) services where an early interventionist visits the home (home visiting), or (b)services where parents and child visit an early interventionist at acenter.Regardless of form, the services provided to both children and families are similar.These services usually consist of some form of developmental intervention for thechild and the provision of parent support. Parents are usually provided trainingin intervention techniques and are expected to provide training to the child eitherthrough direct intervention or incidental teaching between visits.The majority of evaluations conducted on home-based models has occurred withchildren at-risk for delay because of environmental or biological factors (GAO, 39()..), Wabash 325 1990).Evaluations on interventions for these types of children have reported suchpositive outcomes as: better child health, improved child welfare, healthier babiesat birth, and improved development (GAO, 1990). Unfortunately, as the GAO reportmakes clear, there is a paucity of studies that experimental]) '( pare differenthome-based interventions or home-based intervention to other intervention strategies.Research regarding the intensity of home-based models has focused primarily onvarying the frequency of home visits. Burkett (1982) compared home visits forpreschool-aged, at-risk children that occurred once per week vs, once every otherweek, vs, a group that received no visits. Burkett found no differences in childdevelopment between the experimental groups, but did find that both experimentalgroups made significant gains when compared to the no-visit group.Powell and Grantham-McGregor (1989) compared home visiting services for toddler-aged at-risk children provided: once per week, once every two weeks, once per month,or not at all. In terms of cognitive development, significant differences werefound in favor of the once-per-week and once-every-two-weeks groups over the othertwo groups.The once-per-month visit group was no different than the no-visitcontrol group. Those visited weekly also demonstrated greater gains than thosevisited every other week.The results from the home-based services reported above, which focus on at-riskchildren studies, are equivocal from an intensity perspective. The research from similarintensity comparisons using children with disabilities isnotat allsupportive of greater intensity programs. Studies, for children younger than threeyears of age, comparing one home visit per week vs. 2 per week (Lo,4itzer, Arkansas study, this report), and 1 per week vs. 3 per week (McLinden, SMA/Lake McHenry study,this report), did not find differences in child development or family functioningas a result of frequency of home visits. In a long-term study, Sandow et al. (1981)compared preschoolers with disabilities whose parents received home visits for a 3- 331 Wabash 326 year period at either 2-week or 8-week intervals. After one year, children in the more frequently visited group made greater progress. By the end of the second year,the children in the 1 !ss frequently visited group demonstrated greater progress.By the end of the third year, no group differences were found. Sandow et al. (1981)also compared the children who received home visits to children who received uuintervention and found differences favoring both ex,:erimental groups over the no intervention group.Other studies have focused on the intensity question for children younger thanage 3 by combining home- and center-based intervention and comparing this combinedintervention to a no-intervention group (Bryant & Ramey, 1987; Field, 1982; Infant Health and Development & Bryant, 1983; Ramey, Bryant, Sparling, &Wasik,1984;Seitzetal.,1985).Thesestudieshaveallfound positive differences in favor of the experimental group. These studies, however, all focused on at-risk children, and the center-based components were primarily daycare oriented.The most comprehensive of these studies (Infant Health and Development Program, 1990)did not find differential effects of intervention for children with IQs below 70.Comparisons of these studies to children with disabilities cannot be drawn, and thecomparisons that can be gleaned do not support programs of greater intensity.Studies that compare a center-based program without additional components tono intervention (Schweinhart & Weikart, 1980) or to a home-visiting intervention(Love et al., 1988) are rare. Schweinhart and Weikart found differences favoringthe center-based program; but Love et al. andhome-basedintervention oracombined center andhomeintervention withpreschool-aged at-risk children as subjects.The studies reviewed above neither confirm nor refute the contention that moreintensive services are better for children with disabilities. Support is providedfor this contention with at-risk children (also see Bryant & Ramey, 1987; Dunst eL 33 2 Wabash 327 al.,1989; Casto & White, 1985). It does appear that all children benefit from intervention.For children with disabilities who are younger than 3, the research doesnotsupportthe\"moreintenseisbetter\"statementforhome-visiting interventions. No research has addressed the comparison of home-visiting versuscenter-based interventions for these children. Although home-based programs are currently more common for children younger than 3 (Bricker, 1986), there are at leasttwo reasons to compare home-visiting programs with center-based programs. First, incre'ses in the labor force participation rates of mother's with very young childrenhave greatly increased the number of families who cannot accommodate home visits during the day. Second, research, discussed above, on varying the frequency of homevisits has not found increasing frequency of visits improves either children or family outcomes. Thus, if greater effectiveness is to be sought through more intenseintervention, it may be necessary to change the delivery mode. Overview of StudyThe purpose of this study was to investigate one aspect of the question ofintensity of programs that serve children with handicaps under 36 months of age, bycomparing two early intervention programs of different intensity. Children in one group received 5-day-per-week, 21/2 hours per day services in a classroom establishedto provide educational/developmental services for children with disabilities (center- based model).The children in the other group received 1-hour-per-week interventionservices at home by a trained home intervenor (home-based model). Program efficacywas addressed by assessing child and family outcomes. The effect of interventionprograms on families has been overlooked in the majority of early interventionstudies (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Dunst,1986; Dunst et al., 1989), animportant area that should be considered (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Dunst, 1986). It 333 Wabash 328 seems reasonable that the home- and center-based interventions might differ in their effects on parents. Method PrograrnOrganization and BackgroundThis study was conducted in conjuncti)n with the Wabash and Ohio Valley SpecialEducation District (WOVSED). WOVSED provided special education services to nine counties in rural Illinois State fund'ng was granted to WOVSED to expand birth-to-3 intervention services while comparing home-based services for toddler-agedchildren with disabilities to center-based services (i.e., services provided in a classroomsetting).EvaluationactivitieswereaugmentedthroughtheEarly Intervention Research Institute. Although home-based services had been provided bythe Illinois Division of Mental Health, conditions in the state grant to WOVSEDrequired that all early intervention services be coordinated by WOVSED. A programcoordinator was selected from WOVSED staff to coordinate all early interventionactivities reported in this paper.Collaborative activities between EIRI and WOVSED occurred for about two years.Research activities halted in November, 1987, due to varied concerns by the collab-orating agencies. Although a larger number of subjects had been identified and wereparticipating in the program, this paper presents data only on those children whohad received pre- and post-assessments when collaborative activities halted. SubjectsTwenty-six subjects are included in this study (13 in each group). The home-based group consisted of 9 males and 4 females; the center-based group of 6 malesand 7 females. All subjects were classified developmentally delayed except for onesubject in the center-based group who had cerebral palsy. Subjects age at pretestranged from 8 months to 31 months.334 Wabash 329Children who demonstrated a -1.5 standard deviation delay on any Battelle DevelopmentalInventory(BDI)(Newborg et al., 1984)domain were eligible for intervention services. Judgment of delay was based on cldomain deviation score (domain age equivalent divided by chronological age). This is a liberal definitionof disabled, and the study sample reflects this definition. Twelve of the 26 subjects demonst..ated delays on less than 3 domains. Only 12 suNects demonstrated a -1.5 standard deviation delay on the BDI total score.Six subjects demonstrated a delay on all BDI domair;. Delays were primarily exhibited on the BDI communicationdomain (19 of 26 children), the BDI personal-social domain (18 of 26), and the BDI cognitive domain (17 of 26). The mean deviation quotient for the study sample (and standard deviation) inthese three areas were: personal-sr:jel1-72 (SD = 22),communication-67 (SD = 18), and cognitive--75 (SD =16).The mean deviation quotient for the BDI total score was 78 (SD = 14). Recruitment.Study requirements narrowed the eligible study population tochildren from two counties served by WOVSED. All children who were eligible forWOVSED-provided early intervention services in these counties (based on the -1.5standard deviation delay criterion) were considered for inclusion in this study.All parents were informed about the study and the intervention options. The home- based option was offered as the typically provided intervention program. Interestedparents completed an informed consent procedure which stated that they were willingto allow their child to be randomly assigned to one of the program options. The informed consent form also described other features of the study (e.g., parent andprogram responsibilities, etc.).Assignment to group. Two facilities in two different counties were establishedfor the center-based program. Subjects were separated into two groups based, ongeographic location, and were randomly assigned to either the home-based or center-based service program. Fourlevels of severity and twoage breakdowns were 335 Wabash330 established.The ages were: (a) 0-10 months, (b)11-20 months, and (c) 21-31 mo,i..11:).Levels of severity were determined by Battelle total DQs and were: (a) severe, 0-52; 0)) moderate, 53-68; (c) mild, 69-84; and (d) at-risk, 85+.

Demogre.phic characteristics. Ihe majority of children included in this study were Caucasian, and all spoke English as their primary language. The families ofthese children lived in a rural area where parents generally worked in unskilledoccupations or were unemployed. The mean yearly income for these families was below $15,000.The majority of parents had some high scLoc..1 education.Demographic information for subjects and their families, by group, are presented in Table 6.1.3roups were not statistically significantly different on any of the major variables assessed (at < .05). Experimental InterventionsThe two groups being contrasted are children whc received either home- or center-based services. The following descriptions provide information or the groups.Center-basedgroup.Subjects in this group received 5-day, 215 hour-per-day, programming in a classroom setting. Classrooms maintained an 8:2 child:staff ratiL.Staff consisted of a certified teacher and a paraprofessional aide. Classrooms useda number of published curricula and emphasized instruction on developmental skills.Individual goals were established for each child based on a sequence of objectivesthat had been developed by the district. Teachers were responsible for program development for each student and for classroom schedules. Classrooms included socialand group experiences in addition to time periods during which individual goals wereaddressed.Daily sessions typically included gooup activities for music and languagedevelopment, free play, self-help skills development, and individual child goals.

Parents could, however, contract privately for these services if they wanted. Transportation to and from the classrooms was provided by' the district.Teachers kept parents informed of their child's progress through phone contacts and individual notes sent home. The center-based program operated for 911 months, with a break from June 15 to August 15.Home-based group. Subjects in this group received once-per-week, 1-hour home visits by one of two early intervention program staff. The tno home teachers were employed by the Illinois State Division of Social Services and had bachelor's degrees, but were not certified teachers. Home visitors were under the supervision of the special education district. Using the pretest measures, the home teacher and parents developed an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for the child that focused on developing language, motor, self-help, and cognitive skills. The home teacher, when doing home visits, worked primarily with the child on these IEP goals. Parents were encouragedtoobservetheseprogram activities andweretrainedinprogram implementation. Parents were expected to work with their child between visits. As a secondary activity, home teachers worked with the parents to provide support and information on child development, and to help them access additional community services.A family service plan, based on these types of activities, was developed for each family. As with the center-based services, contracting additional services(e.g., therapies) was the responsibility of the parent. The home program provided services throughout the year. Treatment VerificationVerification of the independent variable should be an aspect of all experimental research.The failure to obtain these aata can potentially result in an erroneuusconclusion (Barnett et al., 1987; Cooke & Poole, 1980).A variety of data were Wabash 333 collected for treatment verification purposes.Theseincluded:(a)teacher (interventionist) ratings of parents' attendance, knowledge, and support based on their interactions with parents be it at home or school; (b) a general health rating of the child completed by the parent which addressed various health issues as well as general health; (c) an estimate of time parents spent working with their children on program-related activities on their own time; and (d) parent reports of hours oftherapies and services received outside the program in which they were involved. Allofthese measures, except the estimate ofparenttimeon program-related activities, were collected at posttest. The collection of parent time estimates is discussed later. T-tests were conducted with these data, and no differences were found between groups (Table 6.2).

Efforts were made to determine how much time parents in each group spent workingwith their child on enhancing the child's developmental growth. Parents were askedto return a preprinted postcard each week indicating the amount of time they hadspent working on areas suggested to them by the early intervention program staff. Wabash 334During the 1986-87 academic year, 24 postcards were given to parents to return.Seven parents in the home-based group returned postcards; 11 parents in the center-based group returned postcards. Parents returned an average of 64% of postcards sent.The data from these postcards is presented in Table 6.3. The results suggestthat parents in the two groups did not spend different amounts of time working at home with their child on program-related activities. Table 6.3Information Obtained from Parent Postcards Describing Time Parent Spent WorkingWith Child on Intervention Program Related Activities for Wabash Intensity Home-Based - (home-based) SD (home-based)Data from one parent was excluded because it was an extreme outlier. Tris parent reported over 20 hours spentworking at home per week. Analysisincluding this variable does not alter the finding of no significantdifferences (2 - .43). Parent satisfaction. Data about parent satisfaction regarding the interventionprogram in which they participated are presented in Table 6.4. These data wereobtained from an EIRI-developed questionnaire that uses a 4-point Likert scale (4= highest satisfaction). Parents of children inthe home-based group weresignificantly more satisfied with their child's intervention program in the areasof their participation in the program, the treatment program in general, and on acombined score of al; questions from the parent satisfaction questionnaire. Itshould be made clear that all parents expressed overall satisfaction with theirrespective program; all scores but one were 3 or above on the 4-point scale.

Site review.Another aspect of treatment verification was a site review. The purpose of this review was to collect information about the nature and quality of early intervention services that were Deing delivered, to verify that interventions were being implemented as intended, and to collect needs assessment data that may have been useful to the site. A site review visit was conducted in June 1987.Both the conter- and home-based programs were visited.The summary of the site review indicated that intervention services were being appropriately delivered, but raised concerns regarding qualitative aspects of both service delivery formats. These concerns were related to \"best practice\" issues, as services being provided were appropriate. Mita CollectionParents of each subject who participated inthe study provided demographic information.All children were administered the BDI (Ne4borg et al., 1984).

In addition to the training, all protocols were checked for errorsby EIRI staff upon receipt. Both pre- and posttesting occurred at a center that was centrally located to all programs but not involved in the study. This ensured that the testing setting was equally familiar for all subjects. Pretest.Subjects involved in this study were enrolled on a continuous basis.That is,as children were referred for assessment for placement in interventionservices, they were tested and, if appropriate, enrolled in the study. Childrenwere initially identified for placement in this study during the latter part of the 1985/86 school year. Children continued to be identified through summer, 1986, andthe initial part of the 1986/87 school year. All children were administered the pretest BDI prior to enrollment in the study. Mothers completed the family measures and the demographic form following the administration of the 801. The research study was discussed with parents of children who were determined eligible for intervention 343 Wabash 338 services.If interested, they completed an informed consent form. Once in the study, parents were offered an incentive of $20 for completing the pretest battery. Posttest.All posttests were administered by a diagnostician who was unaware of subject group placement. Parents brought their child to a center for testing. Following test administration, parents completed the MCDI, the family measures, the demographic forms, and other information related to treatment verification.Parents were again given an incentive of $20.Posttesting occurred in May 1987 or earlier for children who transitioned to preschool-aged intervention services. Only children who had been enrolled in intervention for a minimum of 6 months were scheduled for posttesting. Results and Discussion This study examined the effects on the children and their families of once-per- week home-based versus 5-days-per-week center-based intervention service to toddler- aged children. The following sections present the results of that comparison. Comparability of Groups on Pretest MeasuresGroup differences on pretest measures were compared using t-tests and are presentedinTable 6.6.Subjectsin thehome-and center-based groups were comparable on all BDI domains, on the BDI total score, and for chronological age of child at pretest. Parents of subjects in the center-based training had more child related stress (at k < .10) than parents of suhjects in the home-based training group; on the other PSI domains (other stress and total stress), the parents reported similar stress. Family support (FSS) and resources (FRS) were comparable. These results suggest that the groups were comparable at pretest. 344 Wabash 339Table 6.6Comparability of Subjects on Measures of Child and Family Functioning for Wabash intensity StudyNI Subjects Included In Analysis Home-Based Center-Based ValueES5 (SO) (SO)Age of child 101 to 504)Family Resource Scale (FRS)&(range 30 to 12 10 922.7 71.876.187 065.973.477.1 9 20.026.223.917.017.616.1 30.3 1.013 131313131313 13 13 13 12 1281 .16 .74-.25 - 03-.48-.10-.13-.21-.21 -1.05 -.20 -.82 .65 29 Statistical analyses for BDI scores were conducted using raw scores for each of the scales.

Forthe FSS, the score represerts the sum of perceived support divided by number of reported sources of support. Higher scores are considered better. Analysis for the PSI is based on raw scores. Lower scores are considered better. ESx (center-based) - (home-Dased) SO (Home-Based) Measures of Child FunctioningResults of posttest data analysis on child functioning are presented in Table6.7, which shows the effects of alternate forms of intervention on measures of childfunctioning.Results presented for each measure in Table 6.7 are based on an analysis of covariance completed using SPSS-PC. Analysis of covariance proceduresare useful for two purposes: (a) to increase the statistical power of a study byr.Aucing error variance; and (b) to adjust for any pretreatment differences which are present uetween the groups. In either application, the degree to which analysis 345 Wabash 340 of covariance is useft. depends on the correlation between the covariate(s) selectedand the outcome variable for which analyses are being done. However, since onedegree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, itis generally best to use alimited number of covariates in any given analysis. All pretests and demographic variables were considered as potential covariates. For this study, number of monthsbetween pretest and posttest and length of intervention were also considered aspossible covariates. The final selection of covariates depended on a judgment (basedon correlation and multiple regression procedures) of which variable or set ofvariables could be used to maximize the correlation or multiple correlation withthe outcome variable in question. In each analysis, the specific covariates usedare indicated in the table.ResultsoftheanalysesreportedinTable6.7 demonstrate statisticallysignificant effects (p < .10) of intervention on the personal-social, communication,Table 6.7Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Home-Based andCenter-Based Wabash 26.0(4.0)25924.0(7.0)2510.01.C1.00Fine Motor 6 Communication 6 30.0(11.0)27932.0(14.0)35103.18.09.73Situationll Comprehension 628.0(7.0)26930.0(9.0)31102.46.14.71Self-Help 6 26.0(4.0)24923.0(8.0)2410.00.98.00Personal-Social 624.0(7.0)23925.0(8.0)26101.69.21.43 Statistical analysis for SDI and MCDI scores were conducted using raw scores for each of the scales.

Effect sizes suggest educationaldifferences on these domains. Parent reports of child development, based on theMCDI, did not find statistically significant differences between the groups excepton the MCDI subscale of comprehension-communication, in faror of the center-basedyoup.When using a sample size as small as that used in this study, findings of statisticalsignificance with a<.10suggestthatgroupswereimpacted differentially. These differences are clear in all areas on the EMI except motor and adaptive behavior skills. Although the MCDI did not show significance, except on one domain, the average ES for the MCDI was .44. This indicates a positive impactin favor of the center-based group. If the gross motor and self-help domains arenot included (because they are not supported by the BDI findings), the average MCDI ES is .58.Overall, these findings strongly suggest group differences in favor ofthe center-based group occurred as a result of intervention. Measures of Family FunctioningTable 6.8 presents effects of intervention on measures of family functioning.Analyses of covariance was used for the PSI. Analysis of variance was not used withother family measures because variables which would have been useful as covariates(based on the described covariate selection procedures) were not available at pretestfor all subjects. Therefore, the effect of using these would be to decrease the sample size.Except for the FILE, no differences between the two groups were foundon measures of family functioning and parent stress. These results suggest that thealternate forms of intervention did not have a significant effect on parent stress,family resources, or perception of family toward an \"ideal.\" The significant result from the FILE is difficult tc interpret. The finding indicates more significant lifeevents occurred to parents of subjects in the center-based training.347 Wabash 342Table 6.8Posttest Measures of Family Functioning is def ined here as the difference between the group means (center-based minus home-based) dividedby the unadjusted standard deviation of the Nome-hased Group.

To examine this possibility, the procedure to select covariateswas repeated including the FILE as a variable. The only measures on which the FILEwas determined to be an appropriate covariate were the child and other relateddomains of the PSI and the Family Support Scale. The effect of using this variableas a covariate on these measures is presented in Table 6.9. These results do notchange the earlier finding of no differences between groups on these measures.0 IS n-r41 Wabash 343Table 8.9Posttest Measures of Family Functioning Including the FILE as a Covariate for Home-Basedand Center-Based Groups for the Covariates4Nome4aSed Center -BasedANOVAFValueES X(SO)Adj.;%Ile\"n (SO)Adj.;Vile.'n P4sreir Stress Index 4 Support Scale' 1 1.5(.7)1.6 91.7(.5)1.6 11.00.98.00(FSS) 4Eftect Size (ES) is defined here as the difference between adjusted group means (center-based minus home-based) divided by the unadjusted standarddeviation of the home-based group.

Conclusions This study demonstrated that a center-based, early intervention program fortoddler-aged children who with mild disabilities was more effective than aless intensive home-based program. These results address some concerns that have beenraised regarding the intensity of early intervention services (e.g.,Casto & Mastropieri,1986).Moreintensiveservicesprovidedtochildrenwith milddisabilities who were lessthan36monthsofage was effective in producing statisticallysignificantandeducationally meaningful developmentalgainson measures of child functioning. These interventions appeared to have no differentialimpact on parent stress levels or family functioning. Parents of subjects in thecenter-based group were found to have more significant life events occur to themwhile their child was enrolled in intervention.An issue indirectly addressed by this study is related to differences in programstructure as well as intensity. It is evident that the interventions used in this 349 Wabash 344study differed in structure as well as intensity. In fact,it would be difficult,and inappropriate from an intervention perspective, to provide the same structure when the intensity difference is 1:12.5, as it was in this study. In some respects,though, the programs were similar. Children in both groups had individual programplans developed using the same assessments, and the early interventionist (teacheror home visitor) was the responsible person for addressing child goals. Otheraspects of the programs differed, and such differences can only be expected usedon the two different models used.If the structure of programs, as well as intensity, becpmes the major concern ofresearch efforts, thenitbehooves researchers todevelopinstruments forassessing process variables. Such an instrument has been developed for preschoolclassrooms(Carta et al., 1988)and adapted for use intoddler-age classrooms (Atwater et al., 1988). A similar instrument is needed for use in the home-based model.Thistype ofinstrument would greatly aid alone isnotthe only known independent variable.Effective processes, once identified, could then be compared across models.The results of the treatment verification data raise an interesting point. Itwas found that there were no group differences on parent reports of time spentworking at home with their child, on their own, on what pa nts considered programrelated activities. This clearly violates one assumption behind the home-basedmodel, which suggests activities parents learn during home visits will be doneregularly without the presence of the home visitor. If parents do not comply withthis assumption, then the child outcomes of this research are not surprising.The question that must be asked then is: Were these parents different from ortypicalofparents who are enrolled inhome-based programs? Parents can beencouraged to do activities at home (e.g., Shearer & Shearer, 1976). High rates of 350 Wabash 345 parent activities are generally noted with the home-based model, demonstration type projects.Other research has demonstrated that parents are unwilling to regularly engage in activities they see as structured (Culatta & Horn, 1981; McDonald, Blott, Gordon, Spiegal, & Hartman, 1974). In the interim report of the Sandow et al. (1980) study (Sandow & Clark, 1978), it was hypothesized, based on their two-year finding that less frequently visited children were showing greater improvement, that the less frequent visits forced parents to rely more on themselves rather than waiting for, and relying on, the home visitor to do everything for the parents. Regardless of parent motivation (or lack of it), itis clear that the involvement of parents in their child's program, when the home trainer is not there, requires greater emphasis in research and practice.The importance of parent satisfaction in early intervention programs has been proposed as avariable of great importance (Strain, 1988).Clearly,consumer satisfaction must be consideredinany program.The results from the parent satisfaction data in this study indicate that the parents whose children made less progress were more satisfied with their program. Philosophically, it must be asked, \"is the goal of early intervention to increase child outcomes or to satisfy parents (perhaps empowering them)\" (Dunst, 1986). Both are reasonable goals, and they are not mutually exclusive. The failure of other family and parent measures used in thisstudy to demonstrate any group differences to support the parent satisfactionfindings raises questions about the adequacy of measures assessing parents and families as they are being used in early intervention research.Three major weaknesses are also apparent in this study. One is related to the degree of disability exhibited by the children. The majority of subjects in this study, although qualifying for services, has mild disabilities. A similar comparison involving moderately toseverely delayed children may have resulted inother findings.A second weakness is related to the lack of more detailed treatment Wabash 346verification data. Data that addressed actual amount of intervention received andthefocusofintervention activities (i.e.,processdata)would enhance thegeneralizability. The failure to obtain these dita requires that conclusions beguarded because of the potential for erroneous conclusions. The final weakness isthat the research is not longitudinal. It is not known if, or for how long, thesechild outcome differences will endure. As with the Sandow et al. (1981) study,initial difference may not maintain in future years.This study does suggest that center-based model services for toddler-agedchildren with mild disabilities can be effective and was more effective than a home-based model service option. Support is provided to the contention that \"more intenseis better\" and that center-based model services provided at the toddler ages can beeffective.Also,varying interventions can differentially effect toddler-agedchildren,suggestingthattheage-at-startissue(i.e.,whenchildrenbeginintervention) must be examined inlight of interventions known to be the mosteffective.It is clear that this is only one of many needed studies to help completethe puzzle regarding knowledge of early intervention efficacy.From a practicalperspective, this study suggests that more intensive center-based model servicesappear to be the preferred service option for toddler-aged children with milddisabilities.This information needs to be considered by decision makers whenrequesting funding and by those training early interventionists. Belleville 347BELLEVILLE PROJECTProject #7 COMPARISON: Mildly to Severely Handicapped 4-9-1991 Rationale for the Study Althoughthereisawidespread belief that early intervention will have beneficialeffectsforchildren withdisabilities, very little well-designedresearch exists to support this belief.Almost all of the existing research iseitherpoorlydesigned(seeDunst&Rheingrover, 1981, for a discussion of themethodological shortcomingswithexistingresearchwithchildrenwithdisabilities), or done with disadvantaged children (e.g., Berrueta-Clement et al., 1984; Ramey & Haskins, 1981). In spite of the paucity of research evidence, programadministrators must still make decisions about whether to provide early intervention services;if so, what type of services and what intensity of services to provide.Although a single study cannot answer such a complex question, itisimportant tobegin establishing an empirical basis to guide programmatic decisions about early intervention.The purpose of this study was to compare the effects on child andfamily functioning variables for preschool children with disabilities who received 3r3 Belleville348 home-basedearlyintervention services with those who received nohome-based services. Review of Related Rescarch Few,ifany, early intervention studies have been done with children with disabilities which make a treatment versus not treatment comparison.Studies which h3.,e examined the effects of different intensity levels of intervention are certainly rflevant to the issue. If early intervention has a beneficial effect, it seems reasonable that the more intensive the intervention, the greater will be its impact. Unfortunately,very few studies have been identified that directly tested this ,Issumption among children with disabilities. In a study by Sandow et al. (1981) using a quasi-experimental design, children with severe intellectually disabilities were matched and assigned to either a high intensity (2-3 hours every two weeks) or low-intensity (2-3 hours every two months) home-based intervention and compared to a no-treatment control group. Outcome IQ measures were obtained by the authors.While the high-intensity group demonstrated greater IQ gains after one year (ES = 0.55), the low-intensity group equalled the high-intensity group in terms of IQ gain in the second year of the study. There was no difference between the two groups after three years. Both groups made greater gains than the no-treatment controlgroup after three years (ES = 0.47 and 0.37, respectively). In a study by Jago et al. (1984), 24 language-delayed children aged 18-36 monthswere matched for age and etiology (allbut two were diagnosed as having Downsyndrome) and assigned to one of two levels of a center-based intervention. Thehigh-intensity intervention group received 7.0 hours of weekly services in which totalcommunication wasstressedcontinuouslyandparentsandchildren were encouraged to engage in exploratory play activity. The low-intensity intervention group received an average of 2.5 hours of weekly service in which total communicationwas taught for only 5-10 minutes per session. After seven months of treatment, 354 Belleville349 childreninthe high-intensity group increased their number of acquired signs fivefold while the low-intensity group increase was only 16%. However, there wereno statistically significant differences on a developmental measure. In addition,the authors noted that the high-intensity intervention was confounded with thegreater number of teacher hours subjects received in that group. Theabovetwostudiesillustratemethodological shortcomings ofearly intervention efficacy research as described by White and Casto (1985)--experimentaldesigns were not randomized, data wasnotimpartially obtained, there wasnodescription or documentation that the intended treatments were actually delivered, and,at least in the Sandow et al (1981) .tudy, and there was no discussion ofwhether the outcome measure used (IQ) was the most appropriate. Regardless of the results, these threats to the internal validity of the experiments make it difficult, if not impossible, to draw any firm conclusions. In summary, little empirical data existsthatclearlysupportsorrefutestheassumptionthatmorepreschool interventionprogramsforchildrenwithdisabilitieswillpositivelyaffect developmental progress. Chiendevy of StudyThis study addressed some of the deficiencies listed above. Children rangingin age from 4 months tc .19 months with a variety of disabilities were randomlyassigned to either a home-based intervention condition (treatment group) or a no-intervention condition (control group). Children in both groups were ssessed by \"blind\"diagnosticians overaperiodof9-13monthsusing3standardizeddevelopmental masure to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Methods The Belleville Project was conducted by a private state-funded facility inIllinois that offered services to individuals with disabilities from birth to 21 Belleville 350 years of age.There were vocational work and classroom programs at the site. Thehome-based treatment program provided services to children birth to 3 who were identified as disabled. A home teacher or intervenor served as the coordinator of thehome-basedprogram which servedatwo-county,primarily rural, Caucasian population.Funding for this home-based intervention, the only section of theagency's program that participated in this longitudinal study, was provided by agrant from the State of Illinois as a part of the Preschool Pilot Program funding initiative.Prior to this state funding, the facility only offered center-basedintervention and many birth to 3-year-old children in this rural area did not receive services. Subjects Asapart of this research project, the facility expanded services to twocounties in which no early intervention services were being provided for children 0 to 3.County-wide screenings were conducted with a goal of identifying 60 infantsabd toddlers with mild to severe disabilities between these ages. Originally, statemoney was provided for the purpose of offering services to a random half of thesesubjects (i.e., 30 children). Justification for doing a randomized study was thatthere would be more children who needed services than available financial resourcesto provide those services. Therefore, random assignment to groups was a fair wayto decide which children would receive services. However, after morl than one yearof extensive recruitment efforts, only 24 children had been recruited for the study,12 of whom received services. At that point, the state funding agency decided that it could no longer justify withholding direct services from th .! control group sincethere was sufficient money to provide full services to all the children who had been identified.The decision was made to terminate the comparative research and providefull services to all children. Belleville 351 Assianment to groups. Identified subjects were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control groups. For each child included in the study, parents signed a consent form agreeing to participate in either the treatment or control conditions.Group assignment took place in two stages. Subjects were stratified according to ageandseverity of disability (mild, moderate,orsevere)andthenrandomly assigned. Assignment procedures are explained in more detail in the 1986-1987 Annual Report.Group assignments were made by the EIRI coordinator to ensure that noprogram staff had knowledge of where a particular incoming child would be placed. SubJect attrition. The home-based treatment had been implemented for only sevenmonths when the comparative study was terminated due to low enrollment. At that time, all subjects were posttested. Because not all subjects had been pretested atthe same time, with some having been pretested five months before the actual start-up of the treatment, there was a range of pretest-posttest intervals (3-13 months).It was decided that a nine-month pretest-posttest interval was the minimum amountof time to assess significant developmental change as well as to assess any effectsof the intervening treatment program. Three subjects did not meet this criterion.A fourth subject had moved and could not be located for posttest. Thus, of the 24subjects recruited for the study, only 20 were included in the posttest analysis.The pretest mean BDI scores of the four subjects riot included in the posttestanalysis (three Controls, one Treatment) were virtually identical to the pretest meanBDI scores of the 20 subjects who were included. Also, the individual pretest scoresof these four subjects did not significantly deviate from the pretest mean scoresof the respective group to which each of the four subjects had been assigned. Thus,it appears that the 20 subjects included in the posttest analysis were comparableto the original sample of24atleastintermsofpretestBDIscores.Thedisabilities for these 20 children are listed in Table 7.1.

For the 20 subjects who were post-tested, 19 wereCaucasian and one was Black. Income ranged between $15,000 and $20,000 annually.The mean number of years of education for mothers and fathers was 12.7 and 13.1,respectively.The subjects primarily resided in rural areas of western Illinois.Descriptive data for subjects who were includedinthe posttest analysis arepresentedinTable 7.2.Incomplete data for the father-related variables wasattributable to the fact that some subjects from both groups came from householdsin which the father was not present.The only variables for which there were statistically significant differences (p <.10) between groups were the number of siblings and the percent of fathersemployed in technical/managerial positions. Given the number of statistical testsof significance conducted, one expects some group comparisons that are statisticallysignificant even if the null hypotheses were true. At the same time, with the smallnumber of subjects in this study,the power to detect statistically significantdifferences if the null hypothesis were not true is minimal. An examination of tneeffect sizes for the posttested subjects in Table 7.2, some of which are positive 35S Belleville 353 and some negative, suggests that any group differences were due mostly to sampling fluctuation and that the groups were comparable demographically.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE35;) Belleville 354Experimental interventionsThe services provided to the treatment and control groups are described below. Treatment group. The intervention consisted of twice-weekly home visits in which the Teaching Research Curriculum in combination with the Portage and Carolina curricula were used. Content of each home-based session was based on (a) recommen- dations made oy a multidisciplinary assessment team, which typically included a psychologist, speech/language pathologist, OT/PT, educator, and the child's parent, and (b) the child's progress over time. An Individual Habilitation Plan (IHP) wasdeveloped for each child based on this information and was used to guide the intervenor in working with the parent during intervention. A variety of assessment instruments and curricula were used to develop the specific objectives in the IHP. The home intervenors were trained in a nondirective family-oriented approach. The Belleville project provided inservice training of staff conducted by local professionals and outside experts. The home intervenors kept detailed documentation of each home-based session. Their files included all necessary information, well developed IHPs, and family treatment plans. The home visits were conducted in twoweekly sessions with a total duration of approximately 3 to 4 hours per week. Intervention was based on individual needs of the families and the targeted child. The home intervenors provided the necessary information and spent a portion of the visittncouragingthechild'sparenttoexpresstheirneeds,concerns,and frustrations.In some cases, the intensity of the intervention with the parent was equal to the intensity of the intervention with the child. The treatment philosophywas based on meeting the needs of both the child and the parent(s) within the framework of family systems theory (Haley, 1976).The intervention with the child was carried out with the parents as involved as possible, by observing and learning. The home intervenors instructed parents inmethods, strategies, and knowledge for working with their own child. The direct 3 CO Belleville 355 programming for the children was individualized and based on developmental sequences.Activities were designed and implemented to meet individual goals set in the areas of language/communication, gross/fine motor, cognitive, self-help, and family needs. The schedule of a home visit included: a warm-up play period; discussion of current concerns and child's status; direct 1:1 programming designed to meet specific objectives; work with the parents; discussion of progress made towards objectives, and data recording. When ending the visit, the teacher reminded the parent of thenext visit and of any planned activities. Data sheets, program descriptions, detailed instructions, and materials were left for the parent to use, and the parent was given encouragement and praise. In some cases, the only data recorded by parents was whether or not the activity took place or how well the activity proceeded. For example,ina feeding program, the key data recorded was that the child was successfully positioned or that the child consumed two ounces of food orally.The intervenors kept detailed data on number of trials, correct response anderror rates, and a specific description of what progress took place towards each objective.Their anecdotal records described the session, the parent's and child'sresponse, and plans for the next session. The IHPs were evaluated on a quarterly basis.All goals which had been achieved were recorded on a quarterly summary bythe multidisciplinary team. During the site visit by the EIRI coordinator, 10% of theIHPs were randomly sampled and evaluated and found to be age appropriate, developmental, and functional in nature.The project offered a twice-monthly sharing group and a twice-monthly support group.The sharing group was informational in nature, with parents instructed ondifferent issues related to child development and disabilities. The support groupwas more informal, with parents discussing their immediate needs and concerns. Control Group. Children in the control group were pretested and posttested.They received no direct services during the pretest-posttest interval except for any 311 Belleville 356 additional services that their parents sought for them outside of the project. The home intervenors placed monthly phone calls to the parents of each child in this group to maintain contact with the family and to ensure their continued participation in the study.Parents were invited to the twice-monthly sharing and support groups described above.Treatment verification. A number of procedures were used to verify that treatment was being implemented as intended. They included weekly contacts with the site and three site visits to assess the quality of the intervention.The following additional data were collected:Collection olattendance data. The child's participation in the programwasrecorded according to the length of the session, the staff involved,the number of home visits, and the length of intervention in months.Nonattendance atregularlyscheduled sessions was alsorecordedaccordingtothe reasonfornonattendance (e.g.,childillness,holiday, etc.). Attendance averaged over 80%; all missed sessionswere rescheduled for make-up. As presented in Table 7.3,the meannumber of home visits was 32.5, with a range of 14 to 50 visits, whilethe mean length of intervention W6S 5.5 months, with a mode of 7 monthsand a range of 3 to 7 months.Table 7.3Intensity of Treatment and Additional Services for PosttestedSubjects for Belleville Project VariableControl Group Treatment Group SDn SD Mean number of home visits 32.515.111 Mean length of 5.51.911intervention in months% of 927% 11.78> 10 Hours AdditionalTreatment Servicess sThese include speech therapy, physical therapy, and preschool services. 3( Belleville 2:Annual teacherevaluallontAnnual teacher evaluations were conducted bythe administrative director. Results of the evaluations indicatedthat the teachers were highly competent, qualified, and performed ata high level of excellence. 3.Additionalservlcesdata. Additional services data were collected to assurethat there were true differences between groups in services received.While some subjects in each group did receive either additional speech,physical, or preschool services, it can be seenin Table 7.3 thatthere wasno difference inthe percent of subjects in each groupreceiving additional services. Furthermore, the number of hours forthosesubjects who did receive additional services was generallycomparable across groups. Finally, while formal records were not kept, it waS reported by project staffthat it was mostly parents of the treatment group who attended the parent supportand sharing groups. Thus,this project approached becoming atruly randomizedtreatment-no treatment study.SaeVisitInformation gathered during the three on-site visits by the EIRI coordinator wasuseutoevaluatetheinterventionprogram.Thisinformationincludedobservations of home visits, review of subject folders, and observations of trainingsessions.The project site coordinator completed a Program Verification packet, asdid the EIRI site coordinator.The results of the on-site evaluations indicated that each child had an ap-propriate and current IHP. Both home intervenors developed detailed lesson plans,with data collection systems that were observed being implemented inthe homevisits.Family treatment plans that documented family needs, long- and short-rangegoals, medical problems, and special services that the child or family received werealso reviewed. These plans were reviewed quarterly and revised as needed.The staff were observed providing good modeling for both children and familymembers.The staff acted as a resource to the families and provided strategiesaimed atimproving parent-child interactions. Staff provided agreat deal of 363 Belleville 358 positivereinforcement andespeciallyreinforcedsmallincrementsinskill development.It was evident that the intervention had been implemented as planned. Data CollectionRecruitment,traincng and monitoring of diagnosticians. Two diagnosticians were trained to administer pretest and posttest Battelle Developmental Inventories (BDI).One diagnostician had a master's degree in psychology,the other had a bachelor's degree and experience as a parent-infant educator. Both diagnosticianswere \"blind\" to the child's group assignment the research percentof the BDIs were \"shadow scored\" with interrater reliabilities of 90% obtained. Pretesting.Parents of each child participating in the study completed an informedconsentformandprovideddemographicinformation.Childrenwere administered the BDI. Parents completed the following measures: the ParentingStress Index (PSI), which assesses stress in the parent-child system; the FamilySupport Scale(FSS), which assesses different sources of support available tofamilies with young children; the Family Resource Scale (FRS),which measuresdifferent kinds of resources available to the family; the Family Inventory of LifeEvents and Changes (FILE), which measures life events and changes experienced by thefamily during the previous 12 months; and the Family Adaptability and CohesionEvaluation Scales (FACES III), which assess the separateness or connectedness of the family members to the family. BDI testing occurred at a center which was centrallylocated to the program. This ensured that the test setting was equally unfamiliar to all subjects. The primary caretaker completed the farWy measures following theadministration of the BDI.The diagnostician completed atesting report andtransmitted all site coordinator. 3c4 Belleville 359 Posttesting.Posttest BDIs were collected after children had been enrolled in thi. ^rogram (pretest-posttest interval) for a minimum of 9 months and a mean average Results and Discussion Comparability of Groups on Pretest MeasuresThe pretest data were carefully scored and checked prior to being analyzed. It can be seen in Table 7.4 that, for BDI scores, there were no statisticallysignificant differences between treatment and control groups,although control subjects slightly outperformed treatment subjects on most measures. Among family measures, there were also no statistically significant differences (p < .10) between groups on any of the measures. As with the group comparisons on the demographicvariables, the scatter of positive and negative effect sizes of various magnitudes on the BDI and family measures suggests that any group differences were mostly dueto sampling fluctuation and that the groups were basically comparable on these measures at pretest. Posttest Measures of Child FunctioningThe posttest BDIs were scored and checked prior to data analysis. Mean scores for each of the BDI domains were compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), which increases the statistical power to detect differences between the sample group means.ThepretestBDItotalraw score was usedasthecovariateforallcomparisons, accounting for anywhere between 69% and 84% of the variance of the posttest BDI dumain scores. However,it can be seen in Table 7.5 that there wereno statistically significant differences between the groups on any ofthe BDI measures.In fact, except for the BDI cognitive domain score, the control groupoutperformed the treatment group on all mean BDI domain and total scores (adjusted and unadjusted).3G5 Table 7.4Comparability of Groups on Pretest Measures for the Belleville Project Subjects Included in Posttest AnalysisBelleville360 VariableControl Group Treatment Group 54 TOTAL(range 101 to 505)256.044.09230.049.011.23.59 Family Adaptation and CohesionEvaluation Scales 0 1188-.07Family Support Index of Life 11.24.7911.56.311.90-06Events (FILE)' (u)Statistical analyses for MI scores were conducted using raw scores for each of the scales.

Eligible children were stratified by severity or type of disability and age and randomly assigned toeither a home-based intervention group or a no-treatment control group. Subjectsand their families were pretested to determine any pretreatment group differences,and the groups were found to be comparable. Treatment verification procedures wereused to document that the early program was implemented in an appropriate manner. Theintensityanddurationoftheinterventionforthetreatmentgroupwas 367 Belleville 362comparable to what is delivered in typical practice and stood in contrast to thevirtual lack of services received by the control subjects and their parents.Therewere no statistically significant between-group differences on any of the posttestBDI measures. This study was not without its flaws. It would have been desirable to have hadposttest family measures and additional child measures to assess more broadly anypossibe treatment effects.In addition, the period of treatmentmay have been tooshort to have had a measurable effect. However, the fact remains that randomlyassigned subjects demonstrated no treatment effects following a significant periodof intervention.These resultsare consistent with the Sandow et al. (1981) study and challengethe assumption that the more intensive the intervention, the greate2r will be theimpact.What makes this study more compelling than the Sandow et al. (1981) studyis that subjects were randomly assigned to groups,the child assessments weredevelopmental in nature and obtained by \"blind\" diagnosticians, and the treatmentintervention was well documented.These resultsunderscore the arguments made byWhite and Casto (1985) and their associates that we need tocontinue to empiricallytest many of the assumptions on which delivery of early intervention services arebased.The bestway to do this is often with randomized experimental studies inwhich the effects of alternativetypes of interventions are rigorously tested. 3f;S 363REVIEW OF EARLY INTERVENTION WITH MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN Approximately 180,000 medically at-risk infants are born annually in the United States.Despite the fact that survival rates for these infants are improving, due in part to improved standards of care in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), the mortality rate for low birthweight infants, particularly very low birthweight infants (less than 1000 g), remains high. A substantial percentage of low birthweight (LBW) infants suffer a permanent disability (Danto, 1984), and infants who have spent considerable time inNICUs make up a disproportionately large segment of thepopulation with disabilities, with estimates ranging as high as 60%.The conditions that predispose an infant to be medically at risk are well known,but an operational definition for what constitutes a medically at-risk infant is difficult to state. As Bennett (1987) points out, there has been a tendency to usethe terms cautiously with theunderstanding that for the major4y of biologic insults, most survivorswill not develop the developmental camplications for which they haveincreased epidemiological risk (Scott & Masi, 1979). As a corollary tothisimportantdistinction,manyinstancesof severedevelopmentaldisabilities are idiopathically encountered with no apparent biologicalrisk.These facts emphasize the need to differentiate precisely risk anddisability, both clinicallyand for research purposes, to avoid carelesslyinferring one from the other or using the terms interchangeably. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY MEDICAL COMPLICATIONSTraditionally, low birthweight infants (LBW) (less than 2500 g) have been seenas being medically at-risk. It has been suggested by Bennett (1987) that the lowbirthweight infant may be the prototype for understanding the development of mostbiologically at-risk infants, including those with periventricular-intraventricularhemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatalasphyxia, central nervous system trauma (accidents, abuse, ingestion of toxics),substantial hypoxia, etc. This statement is made because survival rates for lowbirthweight infants bear a direct relationship to their birthweights, these infants3) 364 areparticularlyvulnerable 1987).Following ofreasoning,onemight suggestthat an evenbetter prototype g).Consider thedramaticdifference inmortality rates morbidity between infants weighing less than1000 g andthose weighing 1000 g datafrom Bennett(1987). Birthweight 2500 g30%86% Neurodevelopmental morbiditrates arealso (VLBW)(Klein, Hick,Gallagher, &Faneroff, 1985). Very low focus lowbirthweight infants asopposed to very low birthweight infants andthose infants with the types ofmedicalcomplicationsdescribed above. In this context, both short-and lcng-termfollow-up of low birthweightinfants have been conducted. Generally, short-term follow-ups have found that lowbirthweight infants experience early developmental abnormalities which may disappear overtime (Drillien, 1972). That is, theseverity ofneonatal illness itself is not a good predictorof later 37'0 365 developmental outcome.Followinginfantswithanidentifiedcondition(intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH]), Sostek et al. (1987) determined that severity of IVH was related to Bayley mental and motor scores at one year of age but not at two.Goodwin et al. (1987) found that severity of IVH was not related to outcome at ages 5 and 6, but both mild and severe groups lagged behind their age mates in terms of developmental outcomes. These studies demonstrate that more complex risk formulations using complications such as IVH, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc., still constitute limited models of prediction. This finding was confirmed by Casto et al. (1987), who found very low birthweight alone to be a better predictor of outcome than specificmedicalsequelae,includingthepresenceofIVHor bronchopulmonary dysplasia.An increasing number of studies have followed low birthweight infants into the school years.For the very low birthweight infants below 1000 g, a study by Nickel, Bennett, and Lamson (1982) found that 65% of VLBW survivors were experiencing fairly severe school problems.Ralston(1985)locatedtherecords of 22 very low birthweight infants who had received services in newborn follow-up clinics. Fourteen of the 22 children (64%) followed had significant neurodevelopmental disabilities.Several of the 14 children had more than one major disability. Thus, the very low birthweight infant is not only prey to major disabilities as an infant, he/she is also victimized by later learning problems. This finding underscores the importanceof early intervention as well as continuous follow-up of this population. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO INTERVENTION WITH LOW BIRTHWEIGHT INFANTSFaced with a high-risk population, researchers and practitioners have designedand implemented many different types of intervention programs beginning in the NICU or shortly after. NICU-based interventions have been based on varying theoreticalperspectives as well as diverse interpretations of the NICU environment. Bennett (1987) has addressed this issues as follows:Does this unusual medical setting constitute a source of (1) sensorydeprivation, requiring a variety of added stimulations; (2) constant ever-371 366stimulation, requiring less handling and less intervention of all typesand more time for uninterrupted sleep; or (3) an inaprropriate pattern ofinteractions rather than shliply too much or too ii.tle stimulation andincluding aspects of both deprivation and over-stimulation? (p. 88)Intervention studies have been reported in the research literature which are based on each of these positions. For example, Rosenfield (1980) reported a study which was based on the first interpretation. In this study, tactile and vestibular-kinesthetic stimulation activities were provided inthe NICU for two 20-minute periods daily. This study included 29 infants (15 experimental group infants and 14 non-treatment controls). The experimental group attained higher \"state\" rating system scores, and experimental group mothers visited significantly more often. A recent study by Als et al. (1986) provides an example of intervention research based on the second interpretation. This study focused specifically on very low birthweight infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and tested the hypothesis that the functional states ofthe verylow birthweight infant could be altered by preventing inappropriate sensory input in the NICU. The study produced statisticallysignificant results which favored the experimental group.Representative of studies taking the third perspective is research by Thoman(1987), who hypothesized that the premature infant would be able to learn to controlthe level of stimulation received in the NICU and to self-select the appropriateamount of stimulation. Two groups of premature infants 32 to 34 weeks conceptional age were given the opportunity to self-regulate contact with a breathing bear (Group 1) or a non-breathing bear (Group 2). A third group of infants had no bear in their isolette,but were observed to untrol for movement to the area the bear would occupy.The breathing bear, a small teddy bear with a breathing apparatus implanted,was set to breathe at one-half of the rate of the individual infantit was with. Thisrate wasdeterminedduringaperiod cf quiet sleep.Allinfants werecontinuously monitored using time-lapse video recording. After less than three weeksexposure to this stimulation, the infants in Group 1 spent far more time incontact with the breathing bear than infants in either of the other two groups.372 367 Furthermore, the infants exposed to the breathing bear showed significantly more quiet sleep than the infants in either of the other groups.The three groups did notdiffer oneither ofthese measures duringthefirstthreedaysofthe intervention. CONCLUSIONS OF PREVIOUS REVIEWERSVaryingdefinitionsofwhatconstitutes amedicallyat-riskchildand perspectives of NICU environments have influenced intervention programs greatly and have had a direct bearing on questions about th efficacy of early intervention programs for such children. To understand th context for studies done with medically fragile children as a part of the Longitudinal Studies, it is important to consider briefly the conclusions of previous reviewers in this area. Atleast12previousreviewshaveassessedthe effectiveness ofinfant stimulation programs for low birthweight infants. The previous reviews examined an average Gf 14 primary research studies (range = 8 to 29). Previous reviews almost uniformly concluded that early intervention programs for low birthweight infants are effective,althoughonereview(Cornell&Gottfried,1976)concludedthat effectiveness had only been demonstrated in the motor area. Other reviewers reportedeffectiveness over the dimensions of improved cognitive functioning, weight gain, visual alertness, sleep patterns, and fewer apneic periods. Most reviewers concludedthat only short-term gains had been documented and articulated a need for longer- term follow-up. The most comprehensive review was done by Casto et al. (1987) in which 29studies were reviewed using meta-analysis techniques. Casto etal.concluded that acrcss all intervention conditions, infant stimulation programsproduced gains that averaged 11 of a standard deviation, although there are several qualifications. 373 368AN ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY RESEARCH STUDIESStaff ofthe Early Intervention Research Institute (EIRI)at Utah State University have been able to identify and analyze 47 studies which have investigated the effects of early interventiun with medically fragile infants. Studies were locatedbyacombinationofthe following procedures. A detailedsearch of computerized data bases including, Index Medicus, ERIC,PsychologicalAbstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, and SSIE Current Research was done. Also,letters were written to prominent early intervention researchers and service providers requesting their assistance inthe identification of efficacy research which might not be reported in the professional literature. Previous reviews of the early intervention literature were also examined for reports of efficacy research, and efficacy reports referenced in studies already obtained were identified. Studies were included if the study dealt with low birthweight infants (under 2000 g) and tested some type of non-surgical intervention.A coding system was developed to analyze the outcomes and characteristics of each study identified. Based largely on an analysis of previous reviews of earlyintervention efficacy literature (White et al., 1985-86), variables in each of thefollowing areas were coded for each study: 1.A description of the subjects included inthe research (20 itemsincluding demographic variables on both infant and family). 2.Themodeofinterventionused(37itemsincludingmodeofintfrvention, the setting, child-intervenor ratio, etc.). 3.The type and quality of research design employed including preseNceof various threats to validity and whether data collectors were \"blind\"(17 items). 4.The type of outcome measured and the procedures used (19 items). 5.The conclusions reached by the study including the magnitude of thestandardizedmeandifferenceeffectsize,thesourceofthatinformation, and the conclusions of the author(s) (7 items). 369 For each of the items coded for each study, conventions or definitions were written.For example, mode of intervention was coded according to the following guidelines:/ =Afetfical- any drug or therapeutic intervention designed specificallyto ameliorate or facilitate the physical health, function, or wellbeing of the child except for interventions coded as \"4\" below.Include in this category occupational therapy or physical therapyprograms.2= SettingChange-the movement of the child from one milieu toanother, or a substantial change of the child's milieu without anaccompanying education, medical, or therapeutic intervention.3 =StinulatkIn - the deliberate exaggeration (amount or frequency) ofsensory stimuli or stimuli to other (physical modalities) such as thevestibular system.4 =Diet-a deliberate adjustment of food intake in order to ameliorateor facilitate a physical or nonphysical condition.5 =Other- therapies which cannot be classified in the categories aboveshould be coded in this category and a specific note made describingthe type of therapy.The magnitude of the effect attributed to each intervention was estimated using a standard mean differ ice effect size, defined as (gE - gE) 4.SD (Glass, McGaw, & Smith,1981).This \"effect size\" measure is essentially the difference betweenexperimental and control groups measured in Z score units and has been widely used in recent years to describe the impact of educational programs (Cohen, 1977; Glass, 1976; 1978; Horst, Tallmadge, & Wood, In cases where there wasnocontrolgroupandpre-postdesignswereused,thestandardized mean ;osttestprctest7 difference effect size was defined as ( SD (Glass et al., 1981). In other words, when no control group was utilized, pretest scores provided the best estimate of how subjects would have performed had they not received the treatment.Because multiple raters were involved in the study, interrater consistency .hecks were done for a sample of the studies coded (87% average agreement). Also,all Effect Size (ES) computations were independently checked, and a sample of 370keypunched data was checked against the original coding. More extensive explanationof the procedures utilized are available in Casto et al. (1983). Information about t;everal key variables for each of the 47 studies is includedin Table I.The effect sizes included in the analysis came from studies conductedfrom 1964 to 1988, most since 1970. These studies were reported mostly in medicaland psychological journals; but some came from educational journals, books, ERICdocuments,government reports, and dissertations. Not surprisingly, the mostfrequently measured outcome was some type of health measure, usually weight gain.Other infant change measures included motor, IQ, social-emotional, and behavioralmeasures such as amount of quiet sleep, amount of eye contact, etc. Various typesof mother/infant interaction measures were also included.The nature of the intervention as reported in Table 1was identified basedprimarily on Bennett's (1987) classification of interventions delivered to medicallyfragile infants as being auditory stimulation, tactile stimulation, vestibular-kinesthetic and vestibular-kinesthetic and multi-modal sensory stimulation. In thestudies Usted in Table 1, 15 used some type of tactile-kinesthetic intervention,3 used aud'tory stimulation, 8 used waterbeds, and 7 trained mothers to deliver sometype ofstimulation or intervention.Only one study attempted environmentalmanipulations. The duration of the interventions ranged from one week (Edelman,Kraemer, Korner, 1982) to b2 weeks (Ross, 1984).The average effect size across allstudies was.46;although the overallresults suggest that infant stimulation programs produce modest short-term effects.There are some disconcerting inconsistencies. For example,if one considers onlythe developmental outcomes of the 26 studies judged to be of good quality, theeffect sizes range from -.30 to 1.79. Furthermore, some of those interventionswhich are the most intense or of longest duration find some of the smallest effects.Consequently, definitive conclusions as to the effects of early intervention withmedically fragile infants are still elusive and more research is urgently needed. 1rI3';'(; Table 1CHARACTERISTICS OF EARLY INTERVENTION STUDIES WITH MEDICALLY AT-RISK Author/Year #E5DualityDesignToldNATURE OF INTERVENTION -- HospitalHomeHrs.

Thus, conclusions about early intervention effectsfor this population have been drawn largely from studies with low birthweight, but intact, infants. Fiverecentstudieshaveincludedlowbirthweightinfantswithmedical complications. For example, Als et al. (1986) studied 16 low birthweight infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Experimental group infants received a program designed to reduce excessive NICU stimulation, while cohtrol group infants received the regular NICU regimen. Experimental group infants performed significantly higher on the Bayley scales at 9 months, but no longer-term follow-up data is available.Helders (1989) designed a similar stimulation program for very low birthweight infants under 1500 g who had no medical complications. He followed very closely the intervention program of Als et al. (1986). He found short-term effects of the samemagnitude as Als et al., but when he collected longer-term follow-up data,heconcluded that the intervention program actually had a deleterious effect on theexperimental group. His study underscores the importance of collecting longitudinaldata over a longer period of time. Resnick, Armstrong, and Carter (1988) studied 221 infants with birthweight lower than 1800 g. The 107 infants in the treatment group received developmental interventions in the nursery, followed by home visits untiltheinfants reached 12 months adjusted age. Experimentalgroupinfants performed significantly higher on the Bayley Mental Scale and the Greenspan-LiebermenObservation System (GLOS). At two-year follow-up, 19 experimental group infants and22 control group infants were assessed, and the experimental group retained its advantages.These studies provide an important context for the three studies being conductedby Early Intervention Research Institute as summarized later in this report. These studiesarerandomizedtrialswithlowbirthweightinfantssufferingfrom 374 intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, orhaving birthweights below 1000 g.The fact that infants in the control group are performing as well as experimental group infants at 24 and 30 months is puzzling when these results are compared to the Als et al. (1986) and the Resnick et al. (1987) findings. It clearly becomes important to replicate the studies with much larger samples before definitive conclusions are drawn. CONCLUSIONSIn summary, of the five recent studies which nave included infants with medical or neurological sequelae, three studies found no significant differences, while twostudies, one with small sample sizes (Als et al., 1986), and one with large sample sizes (Resnick et al., 1987), found significant differences. If the two studieswhich found differences can be replicated successfully, they represent low cost, easily replicated, interventions which deserve more widespread use. Until such time as replication occurs, however, it might be wise to withhold final judgment as tothe efficacy of early intervention programs for medically at-risk infants. This isparticularly important in the absence of longitudinal data of the type reported by Helders (1988).In the remainder of this section, the results of four studies are presentedwhich were done with medically fragile children. The first three are age-at-start comparisons. Itisimportanttoremember,however,thatuntilthedelayed intervention began, they are really measuring the effects of intervention versus no intervention. SC IVH 375CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA IV Intraventricular Hemorrhage Infants (IVH)--Services begun at 3 months adjusted age versus services at 12 months.LOCAL CONTACT PERSON: Conway Saylor,Ph.D.; Medical University of Ph.D.LOCATION:Charleston, South CarolinaDATE OF REPORT: 4-10-1991 Rationale for the Study One of the primary contributors to infantmortalityislowbirthweight (LBW).In the USA, 6.8% of all newbornb.abies are LBW (weighing 2500 g or lessat birth), and about 1.2% are very-lowbirthweieht (VLBW) (weighing 1500 g or lessatbirth).Thisamountstoapproximately225,000low-birthweightinfants per year (National Center for Health Statistics, 1989).Forty percent of low birthweight infants (or approximately 90,000 infants peryear) suffer periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhages (PVH-IVH) within 72 hours of birth.These hemorrhages produce abnormal bleeding from cranial capillaries andresult in different degrees of neurological damage based upon the severity of thehemorrhage (Volpe, 1981). tomography (CT) scanning are used to make a positive identification ofIVH and to classify the hemorrhage into one of four grades of severity, with Grade 3'3 SC IVH 376 I IVH the most mild form of hemorrhage, and Grade IV the most severe (Papile et al., 1978).Dramatic clinical symptoms such as seizures, loss of muscle tonus, cessation of breathing, and unreactive pupils, may mark the onset of IVH; however, at times IVH is clinically silent (Tarby & Volpe, 1982). The importance of PVH-IVH as a major health problem is underscored by the following statistics (Volpe, 1987): For each 1,000 LBW infants born--400 suffer PVH-IVH100 of the 400 (25%) die immediately85 of the remaining 300 (28%) suffer major neuropsychological impairmentInformation as to the future developmental progress of PVH-IVH survivors islimited and controversial (Hynd et al., 1984). Williamson et al. (1982) found that 29% of Grade I and II IVH LBW infants exhibited moderate disabilities by the age of 3,whereas Papile et al. (1983) found that only 15% of such children could be diagnosed as having these disabilities. Both Papile et al. (1983) and Williamson et al. (1982) found that up to 80% of premature LBW survivors who experienced Grade III or IV IVH demonstrated moderate to severe disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, by the third year of life. Sostek et al. (1987) concluded that the severity of IVHdid not predict the infant's developmental progress at 2 years of age; however 40% of the infants in that study showed significant delays at 2 years. Finally, BozynAi et al.(1984) indicated that these infants are at especially high risk for later motor problems.Although there is a fair amount of research on interventions for premature low-birthweight babies (see Bennett, 1987; Casto et al., havefocused on in-hospital stimulation or parent training as opposed to a comprehensive intervention;virtuallyallhaveexcludedchildrenwhohavesufferedmajor neurological insults such as IVH. 3E4 SC IVH 377Two recent studies examined the effectiveness of early sensory motor therapyfor infants at-risk for developmental delays. Goodman et al. (1985) divided infants intohigh andlow riskfor motor problems based on an early assessment, and alternately assigned them to control and intervention groups. A program of weeklyhome visits began for the intervention group at three months of age. The results of thisstudy indicated that the intervention group did not benefit from the intensive intervention. One methodological flaw-with this study that was not clearlydiscussed in the report was the fact that infants in the control group who startedto develop motor problems were removed from the control group and given intervention.This protocol might have resulted in those infants who could have demonstrated theefficacy of the intervention being removed from the analyses.Palmer et al. (1988) randomly assigned 48 infants with mild and severe spasticdiplegia to groups receiving either 12 months of physical therapy or 6 months ofinfant stimulation followed by 6 months of physical therapy. After 6 months oftherapy, the infants in the physical therapy group had lower mean motor scores andwere less likely to walk. These differences persisted after 12 months of therapy.In addition, there were no significant differences in the number of infants withcontractures or needing bracing, and the physical therapy group had lower mentaldevelopment scores. The major difference between this study and the current studyis the enrollment of children who already show motor problems, rather than those atrisk for development of these problems. Overview of StudyAs noted earlier, intervention programs forlow-birthweight infantshavegenerally focused on in-hospital stimulation or parent training intervention, andmost have excluded children who have suffered major neurological insults such as IVH(for reviews see Bennett, 1987; Casto et for this study are the SC IVH 378ffects and related costs of beginning intervention at different ages for infantswho have serious medical problems and who routinely spend up to three months inintensive care units.The specific comparison for this study was between infants receiving intensivemotor-development oriented intervention beginning at 3 months corrected age and infants who began receiving comprehensive developmental services at 12 months of age.This comparison was chosen because a high proportion of the developmental problemsencountered by these infants are motor development related. Since these infantsroutinely receive only medical follow-up until a particular problem or delay isnoted, this study provided a good opportunity to test the age-at-start hypothesis. Methods This study was implemented in collaboration with the Departments of Pediatricsand Psychiatry of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina.The full-time staff of this intervention project consisted of a homeinterventionist and two physical therapists. The project was overseen on a part-time basis by a director and supported on a part-time basis by a coordinator, adiagnostician, and a secretary. SubjectsThe sample was composed of 64 infants recruited from both urban and rural areasaround Charleston. Subject recruitment was closed in October, 1988. All 64 infantshave received a pretest and a one-year posttest, 58 infants have had their two-yearposttest, and 36 infants their three-year posttest.Recruitment.Infants qualified for participation in the research if they hadbeen patients in the NICU at the Medical University of South Carolina, if they hadexperienced intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or had a birthweight of les: than 1000g, and if they resided in the catchment area for treatment (60-mile participate ineither theexperimental upon they were placed byrandomassignment.Infants withIVH wererandomly assigned to treatmentorcontrolconditions did not The onlypeople and 380Table 10.1 represents the available demographic data for these infants.

All of the participants live in homes where English was the primary language, and there were slightly more two parent than single parent families (57% vs 43%).

There were no statistically significant differences betweenthe groups in either the overall sample or those infants used for the first posttest analyses. Alternative Intervention Programs The conparison for this study was of an early versu , delayed intervention program.Intervention occurred id two phases. During Phase,I, the subjects assignedto the early intervention group received a sensorimotor intervention beginning whenthe intants were 3 months of age, and the delayed intervention group received theroutine medical follow-up services available to the community in general. In PhaseII, the delayed intervention phase, all infants received home intervention servicesand sensorimotor services as needed. Before the implementation of this project, all infants who were in Neonatal Intensive Care Units were referred to the South Carolina 3 cQ SC IVH381 Table 10.1.South Carolina Medically Fragile Study: infant Demographics VariableGroups ValueES+Delayed Intervention Early Intervention X(SD)NX(SD)N Age of child in monthsas of 7/1/9030(12)3027(11)34.27-.25 Age of mother in years 29(3)3028(6)34.401.121 Age of father in years 31(7)2931(6)31.870 Percent male' 30 3068 34.0021.821 Years of education formother13(2)2812(2)34.30-.5 Years of forfather13(2)2612(2)31.60 Percent with both parents'living motheremployed16(19)2916(18)34.84 cf household income Percent with English'as primary language100 100 1.00.0 4 Effect Size (ES) is detined here as thedivided by the standard deviation of the1977: Glass, 1976: Talimadge, 1977 for a Statistical analyses for these variablestrait or characteristic were scored \"1,\"difference between the groups (Expanded minus Basic) onBasic Intervention Group (see Cohen,more general discussion of the concept of Effect Size). were based on a t-test where those children or familiesand those not possessing the trait were scored as \"0.\"3S9the X scores, possessing the SC IVH 382Table 10.2South Carolina Medically Fragile Study: Comparability of Groups on Medical Chars.r.deristics Subjects Included in First Posttest Analyses (N - 56) VariableDelayed Intervention Early Intervention ValueES 34.81.05(% VLBN, (%) 43 3053 34.45-.20 (%) (%)Retinopathy (%) State Department of Health Neonatal Follow-up Clinic and received routine medicalfollow-up from private physicians or clinics. Previous funding for these serviceswas provided by the South Carolina Department of Health, for those utilizing thefollow-up service; or by patient self-pay, for those using private physicians or clinics.These services remain the standard level of care for all infants in the treatment area. Infants who were assigned to the control group for this projecttypically received no other services during the first phase of the study, as very few services were available. However, parents were able to access services in thecommunity if they desired. Parents were queried about services they have a...essedduring the time period of the study, and these results are summarized next. SC IVH 383During both the early and delayed phases of the intervention project, the typesof intervention services received were based on the Curriculum and Monitoring System (CAMS) (Casto, 1979).The Curriculum and Monitoring Systems (CAMS) is an earlyintervention curriculum system designed to meet the educational needs of young children with handicaps served by the Multi-Agency Project for Preschoolers (MAPPS).The project collected data attesting to the efficacy of the program and was validatedas an exemplary program for national dissemination by the Joint Dissemination Review Panel(JDRP) of the U. S. Department of Education. It was revalidated in 1985.MAPPS is one of only 21 early intervention projects validated by the JDRP. MAPPS isalsoaNationalDiffusion Network (NDN)program and has replication sites nationwide.Each of the curriculum programs is printed in an easy-to-use block style designand bound in a notebook. This format was selected to allow persons administeringthe program to phctocopy individual pages for use by the parents or trainers workingdirectly with the children. With training, CAMS can be used by parents, teachers,and paraprofessionals in the home or an institutional/school setting.The CAMS is designed to stimulate optimal development by progiams in five areas:(a) receptive language, (b) expressive language, (c) motor development, (d) self-help skills, and (e) social-emotional development. The delayed intervention offersthe other four domains of the CAMS in addition to the motor domain that was offeredduring the early intervention. TheReceptive Language Program teaches the student skills that do not requirehim to talk but are necessar:, in the understanding of oral language. Skills includeidentifying objects, following commands, and touching body parts.TheExpressive Language Program teaches children general speaking skills,beginning with the formation of sounds and proceeding through the development ofsimple grammatical sentences. It 384 TheMotor Programis designed gross and fine motor skills. The program stimulates normal motor development, beginning with raising the head and proceeding through running, hopping, and drawing shapes. This program is intended for children with mild to moderate impairments. TheSelf-Help Program is designed to teach basic skills for self care. Included in the curriculum are feeding, dressing, personal hygiene, and toileting skills. The Social-EmotionalProgramis designed to teach basic social-emotional skills to both normal and developmentally delayed children. The program, which is sequenceddevelopmentally, begins with teaching a child to respond to a person and proceedsthrough teaching him to handle fruscration and exhibit self-control. Early Intervention PrograonBetween 3 and 12 months corrected age, subjects in the early intervention groupwere scheduled for twice-monthly one-hour sessions with the physical therapist. Thetherapist worked with the infant and parents using the Motor Program of the CAMS (Casto, 1979). First, a placement test was administered in the motor skills domainto determine which objectives should be offered to the child. Second, curriculumbooks were provided with developmentally sequenced objectives and activities for assistingina child's gross and fine motor development for ages bir':h to 5 years of age.Each child's program was individualized.A typical intervention session was conducted by a therapist who worked with the child, with the parent present. The physical therapist also instructed the parenton exercisesthatthechildcould doathome,andthe parent practiced anddemonstrated competence on the exercises before beginning home intervention. Theparents were requested to work with the child at home for at least 20 minutes perday, 5 days per week, on techniques ths?y learned in the intervention sessions. The physicaltherapist telephoned the parent on weeks they did not meet to answer questionsandprovideguidanceonimplementation ofinterventiontechniques. SC IVH 385 Attendanceandprogress were monitoredonanongoingbasisbythephysical and the motor program placement test checklist were updated as goals were met. Delayed Intervention ProgramAt 12 months corrected age, all subjects in the early and delayed intervention groups began expanded intervention programs utilizing all five domains of the CAMS programs.A child development specialist administered the CAMS placement tests, determined developmental levels, and set appropriate goals fcr intervention in each domain.All subjects were given placement tests in motor, social-emotional, self- help, receptive language, and expressive language domains and then participated in an expanded intervention program, which included weekly contacts with an infant specialist.The interventionist alternated twice monthly home visits with telephone contacts and encouraged parents to attend monthly center based sessions for parent- infant dyads.A child development specialist was scheduled to meet with parent and child for one-hour twice each month and provided intervention. For each session, an objective was determined for the child, the child development specialist modeled the training for the parent, and the parent demonstrated the technique. The parent was asked to spend 20 minutes each day, 5 days each week providing similar intervention with their child at home. The child development specialist called the parent via telephoneweekly between home visits to check on progress and answer questions. When the child was seen for the next session, the child development specialist had the parent elicit the new behavior from the child. If the child demonstrated competence in thatarea, a new objective was chosen and modeled for the parent.For example, the objective for a child might be to point out facial features. ine specialist would teach the parent an exercise to teach the child facial features.At the next meeting, the specialist would have the child point out facial features. :3 : 3 SC IVH 386If the child showed competence in that area, a new objective would be established.Depending on their needs, some children would have objectives in several domains, others in only one. Recommendations were also provided to parents regarding problemsor concerns such as toileting, feeding, or misbehavior.If a child in the delayed intervention group was identified by the placementtest as having a motor delay, s/he was referred to a physical therapist for motorintervention through the usual community or MUSC-based programs. Those children inthe early intervention group who still required motor services either continuedmeeting with the physical therapist or was referred on as above. If a child whoreceived motor services in the early intervention group no longer required thoseservices, those services were discontinued and home intervention was delivered basedon the needs of the child.Treatment verification. White et al. (1987) dic.c,:ssed tno important issues inverifying that an early intervention program occurred as it was intended. First,delivery of intervention must be examined to ascertain that the program which isbeing delivered is the same as that which was described in the methodology of theproposal and reports. Second, the extent to which infants and their parents receivedand participated in the program must be examined. The SC-IVH project implementedseveral procedures to verify that the intervention was implemented as intended.The first treatment verification procedure was a formal site review, conducted annually.The SC-IVH site reviews were conducted on September 20-21, 1987, April 25,1988,and June1,1989.The purpose of the site review was tocollectinformation regarding the nature and quality of the early intervention servicesdelivered at this site. Documentation of treatment implementation occurred toascertain that the intervention services were provided as intended and that theproject remained faithful to the research protocol. The site review was conductedaccording to procedures described in the Guide for Site Reviews of EIRI Research3()4. 41: SC IVH 387 Sites, Handbook for Research Sites (EIRI, 1987).The site was rated excellent on all aspects of the evaluation at all visits, except forimplementation of Individualized Family Service Plans. A final site review was conducted in May 1990, to discuss the evaluation and intervention for the infants under the EIRI protocol. Inadditiontoverifyingthattheinterventionprogram continued tobeimplemented as originally intended, three methods were used to examine parentalparticipation in the intervention. First, the interventionists tracked the numberof center and home based visits that an infant attended during each month. Second,the interventionists asked the parents once a month to estimate the amount of timeduring the past week that they spent working with their infant on activities suggestedbytheinterventionist. Whentheinterventionist recordedthis information,they also rated the parents' accuracy of estimation. Finally, the interventionist were asked to rate the parents on,:e a year on three aspects of theirparticipation in the intervention program. The interventionists used three point scales (1=low,2 = average, and 3 = high) to rate the parents' attendance ofscheduled appointments, their knowledge of the information that the intervention wasdesigned to provide, and their support of the goals and methods of the intervention program.Table 10.3 represents the data from these treatment verification methods.Cost of alternative interventions.

As illustrated in Table 10.4,program costs included direct service and program and university administration,occupancy, equipment, transportation, materials and supplies, and telephone used forthe respective groups.Direct service personnel costs included wages and benefits for the physicaltherapist, and the interventionists. Each of these are pro-rated according to actual time spent on intervention-related activities.

This served to reduce costs allowing the program to serve more children and further reduce the cost per child. Data CollectionData were collected for this study to determine the effects of intervention upon the child and the family.The assessment instruments were chosen to provide some consistency of data collection across sites, but also to provide information about children who experienced intraventricular hemorrhage at birth and the unique experiences of their families.A local diagnostician who was unaware of the group membership of children or the specific purposes of the study was hired to administer the pre- and posttest measures.Testing was scheduled directly with the diagnostician by the site coordinator.Shadow scoring of 10% of test administrations was performed. Pretest.At 3 months corrected age (prematurity corrected to 40 weeks plus 3 months), all infants' were tested with the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BOI). Atthesametimetheparentscompleted the Parenting Stress Index(PSI),an assessment of the stress perceived by the parents; the Family Support Scale (FSS), a measure of the number of different sources of support available to families with young children; the Family Resource Scale (FRS), a measure of the different kinds of resources available; the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE), which assesses the life events and changes experienced by the family during the previous 12 months; and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III), an assessment of the cohesiveness and adaptability of the family. All test and questionnaire protocols were senttotheprogram coordinator for scoring and placement in a data file. Parents were paid $20 for their time i;1 completing the 'Th-first nineteen infants who were enrolled only received the Butte lle Developmental inventory at pretest.3(1()\\I -`11 SC IVH 392 evaluation session. This battery of tests provided information regarding both the infant's developmental level and early family reaction to the newborn. Posttest.Posttesting occurred first at 12 months corrected age and annually thereafter.The posttest battery was administered by the same diagnostician who was \"blind\" to the subject's group assignment. The child was given the BDI; the parent completed the PSI, FILE,FACES III,FSS,FRS,asurvey of additional services received by the child in the last year, a report of child health during the previous year, and a parent demographic survey. Additionally, videotapes were made of mother- infant interaction in a semi-structured play session and of infant motor development. Parents were paid a $30 incentive for the testing and videotaping.The videotape of motor functioning followed a specific script.The child performedthefollowingbehaviors(baseduponthechild'slevelofmotor development):reaching and grasping from a supine position, rolling over andreaching and grasping from a prone position, creeping and crawling, sitting and reaching, pulling self up to stand, walking, and squatting to pick up a toy.The parent-child interaction videotape involved the parent and child in play activities.In the first section, the mother and child were asked to play together for 15 minutes \"as they would at home.\" Then, for one minute, the parent encouraged the child to put the toys away. For the next two minutes, the parent read to the child.Then the parent was asked to leave the room for 45 seconds, and tapingcontinued for two minutes after the parent returned to the room.The posttest battery was designed to provide information regarding the child'sdevelopmental change in the first 12 months (and yearly thereafter), and the effectof intervention services upon the child's development. Change in the family during this time, were also examined. The posttest battery consisted of the same measures that were used at pretest. 4 ( 0 SC IVH 393Results and Discussion The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an early,intensive motor intervention compared to a delayed comprehensive developmentalintervention for a group of infants at risk for developmental delays because of ahistory of intraventricular hemorrhage or very low birthweight. Comparability of Groups on Pretest MeasuresTable 10.5 represents the comparability of groups on the pretest child andfamily functioning measures. There were no statistically significant differenceson any of the pretest measures of infant or family functioning. Effects of Early Versus Delayed Interventionon Measures of Child and Family FunctioningThe effects of the early intervention program on child functioning as measuredby the Battelle Developmental Inventory were analyzed using one-way analyses of covariance(ANCOVA).ANCOVA procedures were employed for two purposes: (a)to increase the statistical power of the analyses by reducing error variance; and (b)to statistically adjust for any pretreatment differences between the groups. For either purpose, the degree to which ANCOVA is useful depends on the correlationbetween the covariates selecteo and the outcome variable for which analyses are being done.However, since one degree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, it isgenerally best to use a limited number of covariates in any given analysis. Allpretests and demographic variables were considered as potential covariates. Thefinal selection of covariates depended on a judgment of which variable or set ofvariables could be used to maximize the correlation or multiple correlation with the 411 SC IVh394Table 1C.3South Carolina Medically Fragile Study: Comparability of Groups on Pretest Measures GROUPS VariableDELAYEDINTERVENTIONEARLYINTERVENTIONANOVAFVALUEES of Life& 11(6)1811(11)25.002.930.0Events and Changes (FILE) 6Effect Size (ES) is defined here as the difference between the groups (Early minus Delayed) means, divided by theunadjusted standard deviation of the Delayed Intervention Group (see Glass, 1976; Tallmadge, 1977: and Cohen, 1977for a more general discussion of the concept of Effect Size)Scores for each subscale of the FACES are derived from the \"ideal\" score reported in the techrical manual.

Accordingly, these data were analyzed in a three-stage process. First, pretest BOI scores, demographics, and medical demographics were examined for potential differences.As reported above, the only statistically significant pretest difference between the groups was in the proportion of males in the groups.The second stage of the analyses was to examine the relations between posttest Battelle scores and the pretest measures via multiple regression analyses, again looking for potential covariates. These analyses indicated that a variety of pretestvariables accounted for significant proportions of the variance in the posttest Battelle scores. Thu;, differences between the early and delayed intervention Groupswere analyzed using one-way univariate analyses of covariance, with BDI pretest scores as covariates. Table 10.6 represents the data for the one year posttest HIscores for the early and delayed intervention groups and indicates the specific covariates used in each analysis. These results indicate significant differencesbetween the groups, with the early intervention group scoring lower than the delayed intervention group on 4 of the eight domains.As discussed above, only a subsample of the overall group received the complete pretest battery. Forty-five subjects received both a one-year pcsttest and all ofthe family measures (PSI, FSS, FRS, FACES III, and thr; FILE) at the pretest. Thus, the use of pretest measures other than the BDI as covariates would have reduced thenumber of subjects who had posttest data available for analyses. Thus, the family measures were analyzed without coviriates. These results are also represented in Table 10.6.The,'e were no significant differences between the early and delayed intervention groups. 4/ex,3 SC IVH 396Table 10.6First Posttest Measures of Child and Family Functioning for AlternativeIntervention Groups for South Carolina Medically Fragile Study GROUPS VARIABLE Covariates^DELAYEDINTERVENTIONEARLYINTERVENTIONANCOVAFpValueES4 X(SD)Adj.Xni(SD)Adj.Xn Age in Months at Posttest 801 score, 2 801 Persona' Social, 3 801 Adaptive Behavior, 5 801 Gross Motor, 6 801 Total Motor 4 Effect Size (ES) is defined here as the difference between the groups (Early minus Delayed) means, divided by the unadjusted standard deviation of theDelayed Intervention Group (see Glass, 1926; Tallmadge, 1977; and Cohen, 1977 for a more general diSCuSsion of the concept of Effect Size) Scores for each subscale of the FACES are derived from the \"local\" score reported in the technical manual.

Analyses %I the FSS, FRS, and FILE are based on raw scores indicating the number of Supports. Resources, and stressful life events occurring. The results of the analyses of the child and family measures indicated thatafter one year of intensive motor oriented intervention, the infants in the EarlyIntervention group were performing more poorly in several developmental domains.It is particularly important that the infants were doing more poorly in the gross BEST COPY AVAILABLE4C4 SC IVH 397 motor domain as the intervention during the first year was specifically targeted to motor development.The same analysis procedure was followed for the second posttest which was given at 2 years of age. Fifty-nine infants received this posttest. The results of the analyses of the child and family measures are presented in Table 10.7.At the second posttest, there were no significant differences between the two groups on the Battelle Developmental Inventory although the early intervention group performed better on the fine motor domain (ES = .30).On the family measures, there were no statistically signficiant differencesbetween the groups, but the delayed intervention group had higher scores on the Parenting Stress Index (ES = .38),the Family Resource Scale (ES = .33) and the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (ES = .33). Conclusions It is clear from the analyses of the demographic data of the overall group thatrandom assignment worked well and created groups which were comparable with respectto relevant characteristics of children and families. The groups were balanced onall demographic and medical characteristics except the proportion of males in the groups.This imbalance did not, however, affect the outcomes. In addition, the groups did not differ on any of the pretest child or family measures. The results of theanalysis of pretest child and family measures also indicate that randomassignment provided balanced groups for this study. There were no significantdifferences between the early and delayed intervention groups at pretest.The results of the first year posttest indicate that after one year of intensivemotor oriented intervention, theearlyintervention group demonstrated poorerdevelopmental progress. The early intervention group preformed more poorly on the SC IVH 398Table 10.7Second Posttest Measures of Child and Family Functioning for AlternativeIntervention Groups for South Carolina Medically Fragile StudyGROUPS DELAYED EARLYINTERVENTION INTERVENTION VARIABLE Covariates^X(SD)Adj.XnX(SD)Adj.XnANCOVAFpValueES4 Covariates, Posttest 1 BDI Scores: 1Total score, 2 Personal Social, 3 Adaptive Behavior, 4 Fine Motv, 5 Gross Motor, 6 Total Motor.7Expressive Communication, 9 Total Communication, 10 Cognitive + Effect Size (ES) is defined here as the difference between the groups ((arly minus Delayed) means, divided by the unadjusted standard deviation ofthe Delayed Intervention Group (see Glass, 1976: Tallmadge, 1977: and Conen. 1977 for a more general discussion of the concept of Effect Size) Scores for each subscale of the FACES are derived from the \"ideal\" score reported in the technical manual.

Itremainstobeseenwhether interventions that are more broadly based and are more intensive would be effective in preventing or remediating developmental problems. SLC/IVH400SALT LAKE CITY IVH IV Intraventricular Hemorrhage Infants (IVH)--Services begun at 3 months adjusted age vs. services begun at 18 months adjustedage.LOCAL CONTACT PERSONS: Gary Chan, University of Utah Medical Center; JackDolcourt, Primary Children's Medical UtahDATE OF REPORT: 4-10-1991 Rationale for the Study Conventional wisdom suggests thatthe earlier interventions are initiatedwith children who have, or who are atrisk for developing, disabilities, thegreater will be the positive effects of thoseinterventions. Whiteetal. literatureindicatedthatearlierintervention was more effective thanlater intervention.In meta-analysis of 74 studies of early intervention with childrenwith disabilities from birth to five years of age, however, Casto and Mastropieri(1986) concluded that there was little evidence to support the \"conventional\" wisdomthat earlier was better.An important question related to the age-at-start issue which needs furtherclarification is the age at which intervention should start for infants who haveserious medical problems and who routinely spend up to three months in intensive care 4 SLC/IVH 401 units.Because infants who experienced intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the neonatalperiod have been identifiedasapopulationatriskfordeveloping subsequent disabilities, this study compared the effects of intervention initiated \"early\" with the effects of intervention initiated \"later\" in the lives of medically- compromised young infants with IVH. Review of Related ResearchGiven that IVH infants comprise a subject population which is at extreme risk for experiencing neonatal complications associated with developmental dysfunctions (e.g.,severeasphyxia,intrauterinegrowthretardation,neonatalmeningitis, encephalitis, seizures, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, apnea, and vision and hearing problems),it was deemed important to determine ifinterventions beginning early inlife could prevent the development of later disabilities IVH infants and reduce the levels of stress experienced by the families of these infants.The National Center for Health Statistics (1989) reports that 6.8% of all live births in 1986 were of infants weighing less than 2500 g; infants weighing less than 1500 g accounted for 1.2% of live births. Approximately 40% of low birthweight infants IVH (Bowerman, Donne, Silverman, Joffe, who suffer IVH survive (Volpe, 1981); however, information on the future developmental progress in this population is limited andcontroversial (Hynd et al., 1984). Sostek et al. (1987) found that although level of GradeI or II vs. Grade III or IV IVH was not related to Bayley mental and motorscores at two years of age as a group, 40% of the children suffering IVH showed severe delays. At older ages, the findings are somewhat equivocal. For example, Williamson et al. (1982) found that 29% of IVH Grade i end II LBW infants exhibitedmoderate disabilities by the age of 3; whereas Papile et al. (1983) found that only15% of such children could be diagnosed as having these disabilities. Both Papile SLC/IVH402 et al. (1983) and Williamson et al. (1982) found that up to 80% of premature LBW survivors who experienced Grade IIIorIVIVH demonstrated moderate to serere disabilities by the third year of life.Bozynski et al. (1984) suggested that neonatal IVH typically resulted in motor rather than mental impairment, particularly in survivors of Grade IV hemorrhage.Recent earlyinterventionliterature has described various ages at which interventions with low birthweight infants began and hasreported conflicting results.Resnick et al. (1988) reported that the combination of in-hospital multi- modal intervention and home-based developmental intervention during the first 12 months of life resulted in significant gains in child mental development and in the quality of parent-child interactions. These findings are in direct conflict with the findings of Palmer et al. (1988), who found that after 12 months of infant stimulationandphysicaltherapythatthecomparisongroupoutperformedthe experimental group in both motor and cognitive areas. More recently, the Infant Health and Development program (1990), a multisite, randomized study, compared the effects of an intensive, educationally-focused, early intervention program which included a family support and a pediatric follow-up component to a pediatric follow-up only program. Results of this study indicated that childrin who received the intensive early intervention performed the same as control group children during Years 1 and 2, but performed better on the Stanford- Binet Intelligence Scale and had fewer behavior problems at 36-months corre2ted age than did children who received pediatric follow-up alone. Insum,the recent research findings regarding interventions begun early in life are somewhat equivocal and support the need for further studies.Previous to this study, IVH infants in Utah received only medical follow-up. This situation provided an opportunity to test an early versus later intervention hypothesis by offering more intense services to one group of IVH survivors. which received an NICU in thetreatment area. Subjects inthe delayed interventiongroilp received no other servicesassociated with this projectuntil they were 18months of ege. in 16 weeks aftq 411 SLC/IVH404 child was enrolled, the project provided apackageofservices delivered by independent providers, including licensed physical or occupational therapists, child development specialists, and trained developmental examiners.Services provided by these professionals were coordinated by the EIRI site coordinator. Methods This section prescJits the procedures for subject recruitment and assignment, the demograpkic characteristics of the groups, a description of the alternative intervention programs, and a discussion of the procedures for treatment verification and cost analysis. SubjectsThere are currently 57 children between 10 months of age (age corrected to 40 weeks to control for prematurity) and 54 months (actual ages were used after the children reach three years of age) enrolled in Lilt.: study.Subject recruitment ended in March 1989, at which time a total of 58 subjects were enrolled. Recruitment.Infants qualified for participation in the study if they were a patientinaNeonatalIntensive Care Unit (NICU) at either Primary Children's Hospital or University of Utah's Medical Center, if they experienced intraventricu-lar hemorrhage (IVH), and if they resided inthe catchment area for treatment.Subjects were matched on severity of hemorrhage and birthweight prior to randomassignment to experimental or control groups. Severity of IVH was divided into mild (Grades Iand II IVH) and severe (Grades III and IV IVH). Assignment to groups Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were identified upon discharge from the respective NICU. Parents of eligible infants were contacted via meil by the medical center in which the infant was a patient the month prior to reaching 3 months corrected age. Infants who met the study criteria were considered fur inclusion if the parents indicated a wil 412lingness to participate in either of the SLC/IVH405 experimental conditions, depending upon where random assignment placed them. Infants were randomly assigned to the early intervention or delayed intervention conditions by a roll of a four-sided die after stratification by severity of IVH (mild or severe) and birthweight (under 1500 g or over 1500 g). Parents were informed of their infant's assignment after they gave approval to participate in the study.The only person at the site who knew the actual order of eligibility and enrollment of subjects was the EIkI site coordinator. Additionally, the dates on which infants were identified as being eligible for this study were tracked to ensure that infants were assigned in the order in which they were identified. Subject attrition. Many of the children in this study had medical concerns which necessitated returning to the hospital for a period of time, yet the study was extremely successful in assessing infants on schedule and had very low attrition. Of the 58 infants enrolled, only one child, who died after the second posttest, was lost to attrition. Thus, 98% of the original sample remained in the study.To minimize attrition, the interveners and site coordinator in this project maintained updated telephone numbers and addresses for the participants. jata were collected in person or by mail approximately every 6 months for the child's first 18 months and monthly after 18 months, so there was frequent contact with the families.A semiannual newsletter kept parents informed of the study. Arrangements were also made to provide intervention services and assessment for those participants who moved to another state. For example, children were assessed in the states of New Jersey, Georgia, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, California, and Idaho.In each cac.,e,qualified examiners who were \"blind\" to the child's group membership andspecific hypotheses of the study were located to administer follow-up assesments.Demographiccharacteristics. Demographicinformationwasgatheredby questionnaires regarding family income, ethnic background, parent occupation, numberof siblings, and primary caretaking responsibilities of the participating families. SLC/IVH406 At the time of the last testing reported herein, most of the children were from families residing in the urban areas surrounding Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah.Seventy-nine percent of the subjects lived in the Salt Lake City and Ogden area, while 10% lived in rural areas of Utah, Idaho, or Wyoming. Three subjects lived in California, one subject each lived in Nevada, Georgia, and washington.The current sample is composed of 89% Caucasian infants and 11% non-Caucasian infants from both urban and rural areas. One hundred percent (yr the participants lived in homes where English was the primary language, and most all (95%) lived in two-parent families. The educational level of the mothers ranged from 8th grade to college graduate, with a mean education level of 13.1 years. The fathers' education level ranged from 9th grade to Ph.D., with a mean of 13.8 years of education. Annual family incomes ranged from $2,500 per year to over $50,000 per year. Median yearly income for the families was$20,001.Acomparisonofthe earlyand delayedinterventiongroupson demographic characteristics appears in the Results section. Intervention ProgramsThe intervention was conducted in two phases for this project. The first phaseprovided sensorimotor intervention to the early intervention (experimental) groupbeginning at 3 months corrected chronological age, while the delayed intervention(control) group received the current level of community service (referral to the NICU Tollow-up clinic). The second phase, delayed intervention, was received by all infantsin both groups. Delayed intervention began when the infants reached 18 months corrected age and consisted of home- and/or center-based intervention servicesbased on the Curriculum and Monitoring System (CAMS). TheCurriculumand Monitoring Systems(CAMS)wasdesignedtomeettheeducational needs of young children with disabilities served by the Multi-AgencyProject for Preschoolers (MAPPS). The project collected data attesting to theefficacy of the program and was validated as an exemplary program for national L 4 SLC/IVH 407 dissemination by the Joint Dissemination Review Panel (JDRP) of the U. S. Departmentof Education. It was revaligited in1985.MAPPSisone of only 21 earlyintervention projects validated by the JDRP. MAPPS is also a National DiffusionNetwork (NDN) prcgram and has replication sites nationwide.Each of the CAMS programs is printed in an easy-to-use block style design andbound in a notebook. This format was selected to allow persons administering theprogram to photocopy individual pages for use by the parents or trainers workingdirectly with the children. With training, CAMS can be used by parents, teachers,and paraprofessionals in the home or in an institutional/school setting. The fiveCAMS programs are: (a)receptive language, (b) motordevelopment, (d) self-help skills, and (e) social-emotional development.The Receptive Language Program teaches the student skills that do not requireverbalization but are necessary in the understanding of oral language.Skillsinclude identifying objects, following commands, and touching body parts.The Expressive Language Program teaches children general speaking skills,beginning with the formation of sounds and proceeding through the development ofsimple grammatical sentences. It focuses on language-building and articulation.The Motor Programis designed to teach gross and fine motor skills. The programstimulates normal motor development, beginning with raising the head and proceedingth:.ough running, hopping, and drawing shapes. This program is intended for childrenwith mild to moderate impairments. The Self-Help Program is designed to teach basic skills for self-care. Includedin the curriculum are feeding, dressing, personal hygiene, and toileting skills.The Social-Emotional Programis designed to teach basic social-emotional skills,including both child-adult and peer interactions.Earty intervention service.

SLC/IVH410 For example, if the objective for a child was to point out facial features, the child development specialist taught the parent an exercise to teach the child facial features.When the next meeting occurred, the child development specialist asked the child to point out facial features. If the child showed competence in that area, a new objective was established. Some children had objectives in several domains, while others had only one. The child development specialist provided recommendations to parents regarding problems or concerns such as toileting or behavior. If a child in the delayed intervention group was identified by the placementtast as having a motor delay, s/he was referred to the physical therapist for motor intervention.Those children in the early intervention group who still requiredmotor serviccs continued meeting with the physical therapist. Ifa child who received notor services in the early intervention group no longer required those services, s/he terminated services with the physical therapist and received services from the child development specialist only. The physical therapist followed the sameprocedures outlined in the early interveJtion service section.During the final two years of the study, the focus of service provision changedslightly as appropriate community services became more available to young childrenwith disabilities. In compliance with P.L. 99-457, the Utah Departments of Healthand Education developed more early intervention and education programs to meet thespecial needs of these children. While ch.ildren in Lilt study continued to receive theinterventions as previously described, parents were assisted inaccessingcommunity services when their children entered the delayed intervention phase.Children receivea both public and private preschool services, occupational, physical,and speech/language therapies, and services to the hearing and visually impaired.In summary, all children were involved in individualized intervention servicesat 18 months corrected age. Some children also obtained other services in the community.The acce..-,s of service:: by the family was monitored on a yearly basis when SLC/IVH 411 parents completed an \"additional services form.\"The results of that assessment are discussed later.Treatment verification. A number of procedures were implemented to verify that treatment was implemented as intended. Table 9.1 shows treatment verification data for subjects posttested at 18 months CCA (Posttest #1) and 30 months CCA (Posttest #2).Verification data include the following. 1.Collection ofattendance data. Both home visits and clinic visits were recorded in the subject's file. Phone contacts also were noted in the subject's chart by both the physical therapist and child development specialist. For the delayed interven- tion group,statistics regarding utilization of the NICU follow-up service were obtained from that agency. Only 2% of the children referred to the NICU follow-up service actually used that service. Between Pretest and the 18-month Posttest at 18 months corrected age, infants in the early intervention group attended an average of 43 physical therapy visits. Between the posttest at 18 months corrected age and the posttest at 30 month corrected age, the average number of intervention sessions reflectsvisitsfromthephysicaltherapist,visitswiththedevelopmental specialist, and visits to community early intervention services. 2.Parent satisfaction with program. Annually, parents were requested to complete a questionnaire regarding their satisfaction with the intervention services delivered by this program. The questionnaire consisted of seven program qualities that wererated on a scale of 1-4, with 4 being the most favorable rating. The seven items were averaged to give a rating of satisfaction which ranged from 1-4. Parents in both the early and del yed intervention groups consistently rated the intervention favorably and group eans ranged from 3.40 to 3.67.

The parent qualities were rated on a scale of 1-3, where 3 represented the most favorable rating.Mean scores ranged from 2.20 to 2.71, indicating that intervenors rated parents as having above average parent involvement qualities and as knowing a great deal about their child's condition. At Posttest #2 and #3, parents of children in the delayed intervention group were rated as having significantly more knowledge of their child's condition and program and significantly more support of the program than parents in the early intervention group. 4.She AngeNKFormalsite reviews were conducted during each year of the project.The last formal site review of the Salt Lake City IVH project was completed on August 17, 1990.Ti.ise participating inthe site review included the site coordinator, the physical therapist, and two child development specialists. The purpose of the review was to collect information about the nature and quality of early intervention services that were delivered to verify that the research conducted by EIRI was implemented as intended, and to collect needs assessment data which would be useful to site administrators.The site review was conducted as a part of tne treatment verification process which is described in the Treatment Verification Handbook for Research Sites (Frede, 1988), and was implemented according to the general procedures described in the Guidefor Site Reviews of FIRI Research Sites, which is found in Part II of the handbook. The site review took place at K2D2, the facility where most of the sensorimotor andCAMS interventions were delivered and included a review of eight randomly-selectedsubject records, observations of one sensorimotor and one CAMS intervention session,interviews with intervenors, and inspection of the facility. 44, SLC/IVH414 The review team found that there were substantial differences in the services provided to each group. Intervention services judged to be of high-quality were provided to the early intervention group prior to 18 months CCA and to both groups after 18 months CCA. Assessment procedures were carried out regularly, appropriate plans and records documenting interventions and child progress were in place. It was found that several of the older subjects in the study were working on the final objectives in the CAMS curriculum. Cost of Alternative Interventions.The cost pc- child for the early intervention group (23 children) represents an accumulated cost of intervention form July 1986 to July 1988, the total program cost for two years and two phases of intervention as outlined under the intervention program description. The cost for services was from the date these 29 children turned 18 months of age and services began until 1988, the end of FY 1987-88. In Table 9.2,all cost estimates were adjusted for inflation to 1990 dollars.In addition, at the bottom of the table, the figures were discounted at 3% and 5%. To arrive at the cost per child, tc,tal program costs were determined for each group and divided by the number of children in the group. As illustrated in Table 9.2, program costs incl.-ed direct service and program and university administration, occupancy,equipment,transportation, and materials respective groups.Personnel costs included wages and benefits for the physical therapist,and supplies used for the thedevelopmental specialist, diagnosticians, a graduate assistant, and a secretary.Each of these were pro-rated according to actual time spent on intervention-related activities.Research costs in this, and all other resource categories, naturally,were excluded. Program administration included salaries and benefits for thepercentage of FTE administrative personnel worked on the project. The university administrative cost applied to the small portion of the project that was operatedC.:3 $1..C/IVH415Table 9.2Cost per Child for Salt Lake City IVH Site (1990 dollar) Resources Early intervention(n = 23)Delayed 2,135 *Totals may not add up due to rounding errors. out of Utah State University. For this, the university indirect rate for general,departmental, and sponsored projects administration was used (31.78%). Occupancycharges included rent paid for office space, utilities, maintenance, and insurance.Equipment costs included the cost of office furniture, computers, intervention toys4 '4 .1 SLC/IVH 416 and treatment equipment, and a supply of equipment available for loans to parents (seating devices, walkers, etc.). These costs were based on market replacementvalues for each item and annualized at a rate which accounted for interest and depreciation to determine the annual equipment cost. Agency transportation costsfor home visits were'calculated at $.21 per mile blsed on actual mileage. Because the program relies 1.:eavily on parent participation for both intervention and, as the child got older, for transportation to the center, the opportunity costof parent time was .also determined. These costs were presented as \"contributedresources\" on Table.9.2. Parent time included time spent in (1) center and homevisit sessions with either the physical therapist or the developmental spe:ialist at one hour each; (2) intervention activities recommended by the program (20 minutes daily) for each parent and child at home; and (3) transportation time and expenses.Parents spent an average of 142 hours in Year One and 71 hours in Year Two in session withprofessionals andconductinginterventionactivitiesathome.Parenttransportation costs in Year Two were gathered via telephone interview during whichparents reported the number of trips taken to the center, the round-trip distance, and travel time. As reported in the economic section of the report, parent time wasassigned the value of $9 per hour based on the average hourly earnings plus benefitsfor all working women in the U.S.Thus, for children entering the program at 3 months adjusted age and receiving twoyearsofindividualized interventionfrombothprofessionals andtheirprofessionally trained parents the undiscounted cost of the program was $5,434 perchild; for children entering the program later at 18 months, the cost was $1,845,including the value of parent time. The cost per child for two years of interventionis more than twice the cost for one year. This can be attributed to the emphasison physical therapy in Year 1, which cost more than services from the developmental specialist.At 18 months, the program switched its emphasis for all children in the SLC/IVH417 program from physical therapy to speech, self-help, social, and other age-appropriate skills. Mae CollectionData were collected to determine the effects of intervention upon the child and the family.The assessment instrumen+-: were chosen to provide some consistency of data collection across sites, but also to provide information about children with intraventricular hemorrhage at birth and the urique experiences of their families. Additional assessments described in this section were administered as the subjects developed additional skills not present in younger children. Table 9.3 presents a schedule of pre- and posttest measures and the ages at which they are administered.

Since there was achance that the childdevelopment specialist could have learned of a child's assignment by posttesting,posttest diagnosticians were chosen who had no involvement with tt,Aoject or the interveners.In this way,it was ensured that diagnosticians were \"blind\" to thechild's group assignment in the study.Child functioning was measuredatpre-andposttests with the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a norm-referenced, standardized assessmentof skill development in children from birth to 8 years of age and assesses five developmentaldomains:personalsocial,adaptive,motor(grossandfine), communication (receptive and expressive), and cognitive.Fami'.y functioning was also assessed at pretest and at each posttest. Themeasures of family functioning included: the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), an assessment of the stress present in the parent-child system; the Family Adaptabilityand Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III), an assessment of the separateness orconnectedness and adaptability of the family members to the family; the Family Support Scale (FSS), a mea;ure of different sources of support available for familieswith young children; the Family Resource Scale (FRS), a measure of different kindsof resources available to the family, the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE),an assessment of the life events and changes experienced by the family during the previous 12 months. Family demographic information was gathered throughthe Parent Survey.Recruitment. training1 andmonitorina of ensurethe qualifications andreliability of the diagnosticians administering assessments for the SLC/IVH study.Diagnosticians were required to independently become familiar with the BDI throughstudy of the test manuals and viewing of a videotaped test administration. The 4`.2 7 SLC/IVH419 diagnosticians then completed a 111 day tra'ining conductedby acertified assessment trainer.Duringthetraining session, BDItesting procedures were explai. ed, demonstrated, and practiced. Following the training session, diagnosticians completed three practice BDI administrations. The final practiceadministration was videotapedandthenreviewedbytheassessmeni. coordinator.After the assessment coordinator verifiLd that the diagnostician hadcorrectly administered the test, the diagnostician began testing children for the study.Three diagnosticians completed the requirements to administer the pretestand posttest measures. One diagnostician had a Ph.D. in psychology, and two were Ph.D. candidates in psychology. The Ph.D. candidates were recruited from Utah StateUniversity and the University of Utah Graduate Schools.To maintain records on the continued quality of the test results, shadow scoringof 10% of test administrations for each diagnostician was conducted by anothertrained diagnostician who had three years of experience in administering the BDI.Interrater reliability indicates that the diagnosticians are administering the testswithareliability level above.90.Testing was scheduled directly with the diagnosticians by the site coordinator.Pretesting.At 3 months corrected age (prematurity corrected to 40 weeks plus3 months), all infants were tested with the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI);parInts completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), the Family Support Scale, (FSS),the Family Resource Scale (FRS), the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes(FILE), and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III). All test and questionnaire protocols were sent to the EIRI site coordinator for scoringand placement in the EIRI file. Parents were paid $20 for their time in completingthe evaluation session. This battery of tests provided information regarding boththe infant's developmental level and early family reaction to the new-born. 4Q SLC/IVH420 Interim testing. When infants were 6 months corrected age, their parents weremailed the Carey Infant Temperament Scale to complete. This questionnaire was returned directly to the site coordinator via postpaid mail. Parents were paid $10 for completing the questionnaire.The Carey Infant Temperament Scale assessed the parents' estimate ofthe infant's temperament. Scoring categorized the infant into easy, intermediate, slow- to-warm, and difficult categories. This information was compared with the ratingsof the videotaped parent/child interaction to determine if the child's perceivedtemperament affected interactions with the parent. Videotapes of parent-infant interactionandoneofmotordevelopment were completed byatrainedchilddevelopment specialist or a licensed physical therapist when the infants were 12months corrected age. These videotaped sequences were rated by trained individualswho were\"blind\"tothestudy design andsubject assignment cnnditions.Parents were paid a $10 incentive for videotaping.The parent-child interaction videotape involved the parent and child in play activities.In the first section, the mother and child played together for 15 minutes \"as they would at home.\" Then for one minute the parent encouraged the child to put the toys away. For the next two minutes, the parent read to the child. Then the parent left the room for 45 seconds. Taping continued for two minutes after theparent returned to the room.The videotape of motor functioning followed a specific script. The motor scriptencouraged the child to perform the following behaviors (based upon the child's levelof motor development): reaching and grasping from a supine position, rolling overand reaching and grasping from a prone position, creeping and crawling, sitting andreaching, pulling self up to stand, walking, and squatting to pick up a toy.18 month posttest. Infants were posttested at 18 months corrected age andannually thereafter. The infants were administered the BDI; parents completed the SLC/IVH 421PSI, FILE, FACES III, FSS, FRS, a survey of the additional services received by thechild in the last year, a report of child health during the last year, and a surveyof demographic characteristics. Parents werepaid$20for completion of theevaluation.The posttest data provides information regarding the child's developmentalchange in the first 18 months (and yearly theAeafter), and the effect of interventionservices upon the child's development.30-month nosttest. The Jecond posttest occurred 30 months corrected age.The BOI and the Stanford Binet Intelligence Test Screening Test (Tnorndike, Hagon,& Sattler, 1986) were administered to the subjects. The Stanford-Binet IntelligenceScale measures general intellectual ability and was standardized for individuals from2 to 18 years of age. The screening test consists of one subtest from each domainand includes the following subtests: vocabulary, pattern analysis, quantitative, andbead memory.Correlations reported in the Stanford Binet Technical Manual betweenthe screening-test battery and the full battery range from .92 to .98. In additionto the child functioning measures completed at 30 months, the parent completed thePSI, FILE, FACES III, FSS, FRS, a survey of additional services received by the childin the last year, a report of child health during the last year, the survey ofdemographic characteristics, and the Carey Toddler Temperament Questionnaire. Inaddition, a videotape of parent-child interaction was completed. Parents were paid$25 for completion of the evaluation.42-monthposttest.Thethirdposttestoccurredat42monthsactualchronological age. The children were tested with the BOI and the Stanford BinetScreening test. They were also administered the Preschool Language Scale (Zimmerman,Steiner,& Evatt,1969).The Preschool Language Scale is designed to evaluatelanguage strengths and deficits in the areas of auditory comprehension and verbalability.It also assesses articulation and was designed for children ages 18 months 430 \"'kr SLC/IVH422 to 7 years, or children functioning within that age range. Parents were asked to complete the EIRI battery of family measures, the demographic, additional services, and child health surveys, and a parent-child interaction videotap,.. Parents were paid $35 for completing The tne PLS,the EIRI battery of family measures, the demographic, additional services, child health surveys, and a parent-child interaction videotape. Inaddition,furtherinformation was gathered regarding neuropsychological and behavioral functioning through assessment instruments that were not apprr)priate for younger children. Neuropsychological assessment provided information regarding not only areas of brain dysfunction, but attentional problems and leecning disabilities. Iocludedinthe 54-month posttest were the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1983), the Test of Visual Motor Integration (Beery, 1989), and the Draw-A-Man test (Harris, 1963).The Child Behavior Checklist was standardized for children from 4 - 16 years of age.It was designed to identify child competencies and behavior problems and was completed by the parent. It is reported to have good psychometric properties and has been widely used in both clinical and research settings.The Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI) is a standardized assessment of the development of eye-hand coordination skills. The test is designed for children 4 - 17 years of age. The VMI has also been used widely in clinical and research settingsand has been found to predict school success when used in conjunction with other assessments.The Draw-a-Persun test is a non-verbal test designed for children from 3 years 0monthsto15years11monthsofage.Thetest provides anestimate ofdevelopmental level and has been revalidated as a measure of cognition in young children(Kifune,1984).Parents were paid $35for completing the 54-month 431 SLC/IVH423 assessment battery.

Given the many variables on which comparisons were made, it is not surprising that there was a statistically significant difference on one; whenthe data are considered in total, it appears that the groups were very comparable in terms of demographics. The slight advantage which may existed was in favor of the group which received early intervention.A comparison of the infants' medical characteristics (see Table 9.6) indicatedthat at pretest, the groups were similar on all medical characteristics. Table 9.7 shows infant pretest scores on the BDI and family functioning measures.When all of the subjects who were enrolled in the study and who were alsoincluded in Posttest #I, and those subjects included in Posttest #2, were comparedat pretest on BDI scores, the groups were found to be similar on the personal/social,adaptive, and cognitive domains. The groups differed significantly at pretest onthe motor and communication domains, and on the BDI Total score. The results of the pretest comparison on the BDI score for only those subjects included in Posttest #3indicated significant differences between the groups on the cognitive domain. At pretest, the groups were found to be similar in terms of parenting stress as measured by the PSI.

However, since one degree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, it is generally best to use a limited number of covariates (usu&lly five or less) in any given analysis. All pretests and demographic variables were considered as potential covariates. The final selection of covariates depended on a judgment of which variable or set of variables could be used to maximize the correlation or multiple correlation with the outcome variable in question and stillinclude those demographic or pretest variables for which there are the largest pretreatment difft:rences. For example, number of days in NICU, pretest BDI receptive communication raw score, and pretest BDI Total raw score were use6 as covariates for 18-month communication raw scores.In each analysis, the specific covariates used are indicated inthe table.

Results of the ANCOVA indicated no significant differencesbetween the early and delayed intervention groups on outcome measures of family functioning at either 18 months corrected age or 30 months corrected age. At 42 months, the groups were significantly different on the cohesion score of the FACES. These differerres suggest that families in the delayed intervention group functionedmore optimally in terms of family cohesion. 4 40 SLC/IVH429 Table 9.8Summary of ANCOVA's on Measures of Child Functioning for AlternativeIntervention Groups for SLC/IVH Age-at-Start Study COvarlates4In (SO)Adj. 1li.85.35 Statistical Analyses for 801 scores were conducted using computed scores far each of the scale.Development Quotient (00) was obtained bydividing the \"Age Equivalent\" (AGE) score reported in the technical manual for each child's raw score by the child's chronological age at timeof testing.

All subjects werepretested at 3 months CCA and received Posttest #1 at 18 months CCA. Results of thePosttest #1 analysis are complete. However, all subjects who were pretested havenct yet received Posttest #2 at 30 months CCA and Posttest #3 at 42 months actual age.Therefore, the results preserted for Posttests #2 and #3 are preliminary.The results of the statistical analysis of the 18-, 30-, and 42-month posttestdata indicated that there were no significant differences between groups on themeasures of child functioning following intervention begun at 3 months vs interven-tion begun at 18 months corrected chronological age. Analysis of the data collectedon family functioning revealed only one statistically significant posttest differ- ence.At the 42-month posttest, families in the delayed intervention group werefound to be functioning more optimally with regard to family cohesion. This isolateddifference may suggest either a treatment effect, oraspurious relationship.Collection and analysis of data from the families in the sample who are not yet 42months of age will clarify this issue.The preliminary conclusion from this study, however, was that to this date theearlier intervention has not resulted in greater benefits to either children orfamilies.Those children who received earlier intervention did not appear to dosubstantially better than children who received the later intervention.The results of the current study present a contrast to results reported by Alset al.(1986),Resnick et al. (1987;1988), who found significant differencesfavoring infants receiving early intervention services. This study did, however,offer preliminary support and can be better compared to the findings of Piper et al.(1986) and Palmer et al. (1988), who concluded that early motor therapy did notsubstantially improve the developmental outcome of high-risk infants. It is possiblethat focusing early intervention efforts on sensory motor development isless445 SLC/IVH434 effective thaniddressing more generaldevelopmentalissues.It Intraventricular Very-Low-Birthweight Infants -- Treatment vs. No CONTACT PERSON: David Slade, Ph.D.EIRI COORDINATOR: Lee Huntington, Ph.D.LOCATION:New LouisianaDATE REPORT: Study major of (LBW).In the USA, 6.8% of all newbornbabies are LBW (weighing 2500 g or lessat birth), and about 1.2% are very-lowbirthweight (VLBW) (weighing 1500 g or lessatbirth).Thisamountstoapproximately225,000low-birthweightinfants per year (National Center for Health Statistics, 1989).Forty percent of low birthweight infants (or approximately 90,000 infants)suffer periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhages (PVH-IVH) within 72 hours of birth.These hemorrhages produce abnormal bleeding from cranial capillaries andresult in different degrees of neurological damage based upon the severity of thehemorrhage (Volpe, 1981). Brain-imaging procedures such as real-time ultrasonographyand computed tomography (CT) scanning are used to make a positive identification ofIVH and to classify the hemorrhage into one of four grades of severity, with Grade IIVH the most mild form of hemorrhage, and Grade IVthe most severe (Papile,4 7 NO/IVH 436 Burstein, Burstein, & Koffler, 1978). Dramatic clinical symptoms such as seizures, loss of muscle tonus, cessation of breathing, and unreactive pupils, may mark the onset of IVH; however, at times IVH is clinically silent (Tarby & Volpe, 1982). Theimportance of PVH-IVH as a major health problem is underscored by the following statistics (Volpe, 1987):For each 1,000 LBW infants born--400 suffer PVH-IVH100 of the 400 (25%) die immediately85 of the remaining 300 (28%) suffer major neuropsychological impairmentInformation as to the future developmental progress of PVH-IVH survivors islimited and controversial (Hynd, Harloge, & Noonan, 1984). Williamson, Desmond,Wilson, Andrew, and Garcia-Prats (1982) found that 22 of IVH Grade Iand II LBWinfants exhibited moderate disabilities by the age of 3, whereas Papile, Munsick-Bruno, and Schaefer (1983) found that only 15% of such children could be diagnosed as having these disabilities. Both Papile et al. (1983) and Williamson et al. (1982)found that up to 80% of premature LBW survivors who experienced Grade III or IV IVHdemonstrated moderate to severe disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, by the third year of life.Finally, Sostek et al. (1987) demonstrated that the severity of IVHdid not predict the infant's developmenta' 7-ogress at 2-years of age, however 40%of the infants in that study showed significant delays at 2-years.Although there is a fair amount of research on interventions for premature lowbirthweight babies (see Bennett, 1987; Casto et al., for reviews), most havefocused on in-hospital stimulation or parent training as opposed to a comprehensiveintervention, and most have excluded children who have suffered major neurologicalinsults such as IVH.Fiverecentstudieshaveincludedlowbirthweightinfantswithmedical complications. For example, Als et al. (1986) studied 16 low birthweight infants 443 NO/IVH437 with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Experimental group infants received a programdesigned to reduce excessive NICU stimulation while control group infants received the regular NICU regimen. Experimental group infants performed significantly higheron the Bayley scales at 9 months, but no longer-term follow-up data is available.Helders (1989) designed a similar stimulation program for very low birthweight infants under 1500 g who had no medical complications. He followed very closely the intervention program of Als et al. (1986). He found short-term effects of the samemagnitude as Als et al., but when he collected longer-term follow-up data,heconcluded that the intervention program actually had a deleterious effect on the experimental group. His study underscores the importance of collecting longitudinal ata over a longer period of time. Resnick et al.(1988) studied 221 infants withbirthweight lower than 1800 g. The 107 infants in the treatment group receiveddevelopmental interventions in the nursery, followed by home visits until the infants reached 12 months adjusted age. Experimental group infants performed significantlyhigher on the Bayley Mental Scale and the Greenspan-Lieberman Observation System (GLOS).At two year follow-up, 19 experimental group infants and 22 control groupinfants were assessed, and the experimental group retained its advantages. Overview of StudyA major issue in the study of early intervention in general is the effect of the intensity of treatment which the infants receive. The issue of intensity needsto be examined with particular care in infants who are \"at-risk\" for developmentalproblems because of severe medical complications. Because the nature of \"risk\" is probabilistic, itis a given that some if not many of the infants will improve andshow little or no deficits without any intervention. If 60% (according to recentestimates) of the infants who suffer Grade III or IV IVH show only subtle problemslater, then the effects of the intervention must be large enough to be detecteddespite the improvement found following the natural course the while the infant was in theneonatalintensive careunit; (2) athome, once 45o NO/IVH 439 to other services was immediate, with help accessing those services provided by the intervention team.Full-time direct service staff for CAPS consisted of a Program Coordinator,Occupational Therapist, and Speech Pathologist/Infant Specialist. Part-time direct service staff included a nurse, nurse practitioner, paraprofessional home-visitor,and a social worker. SubjectsThirty-two infants were enrolled in this study. Of these, 20 have received a one-year posttest. The large attrition for this study isattributable to the population that was being served. The subjects were primarily low-SES, inner-city residents.Maintaining this population's participation in a research program is extremely difficult. Those subjects who were enrolled in the intervention groupwere easier to keep track of because of the weekly scheduling of visits.Of the 16intervention group subjects who were actively enrolled on October 1, 1989 when theintervention portion of the project was terminated, 13(81%) received afirst posttest.The no intervention group subjects were more difficult to keep in touch with.Of the 14 that were actively enrolled in the program in October 1989, only7 were available for posttesting.Subjects included in this study were either diagnosed by ultrasound as havingexperiencedperiventricular-intraventricular hemorrhageorwerebornwithabirthweight lower than 1000 g. Subject recruitment closed in October 1988. Thecurrent sample is composed of 90% Black and 10% Caucasian infants from both urbanand rural areas of the greater New Orleans metropolitan area.Recruitment.Infants qualified for participation in the research if they hadbeen a patient in the NICU at Charity Hospital or Tulane Medical Center, if theyhad experienced perinatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of Grades III or IV severity,had a birthweight of less than 1000 g, and/orif they resided in the 4 51 NO/IVH440 catchment area for treatment. Subjects who met theinclusion criteria were identified while in the NICU. Parents of eligible infants were contacted while theirinfant was still in the NICU; telephone contact was made shortly after discharge.For each infant who met the study criteria, parents y.ere required toindicate willingneFs to participate in either the experimental or the control conditions depending upon where random assignment placed them.Assignment to groups. All assignment to groups was performed by the site coordinator at the Early Intervention Research Institute (EIRI).For the purposes of this study,it was necessary to ensure that the distribution of grades of IVHand birthweights be comparable between the treatment and control groups. The treatment and control conditions were thus stratified by severity of IVH (Grades III or IV) and birthweight (under 1000 g or over 1000 g) yielding a 2 (Grade; III or IV)x 2 (Birthweight; under 1000 g or over 1000 g) design. Imposing this stratification scheme on the treatment and control group yielded a 2 x 2 x 2 design.Those infants who did not suffer IVH, but were below 1000 grams, were stratified on the number of days that they were on a ventilator to ensure the comparability of the groups.Before any infants were assigned, a random number generator indicated theorder of assignment to treatment or control for each sequence of four children fitting a stratification cell. Thus, the four cells differed on the order in which children with those characteristics were assigned to the treatment or control group. After four infants with particular stratification characteristics were assigned, therandom number generator was used to designate another assignment order for the next four infants in that cell. Parents were informed of their infant's assignment afterthey gave approval to participate in the study.Demographic characteristics. Demographic information on the subjects and theirfamilies was gathered from a questionnaire and from medical discharge summaries.All of the children were from families who resided in the metropolitan area of New 4 ,5 NO/IVH 441 Orleans, Louisiana. The demographic characteristics of the sample, divided by groups is represented in Table 10.1.

A larger proportion of single parent than two parent families were represented in the study. The enrolled families were predominantly low income and included some single adolescent mothers. The pattern of the data for the reduced number of infants who received the firs posttest is similar to that for the overall group that was enrolled. The reduced group appears demographically comparable to the overall group. Intervention Programs The comparison for this study is between a group of infants who receive the medical follow-up program offered by the hospital and a group of infants who receive an organized early intervention program conducted by the Human Development Center. No interventionThe comparison group for this study consisted of infants who received the typical level of services in the community. These services consisted of the medical follow-up program described in the introduction. Because these families did nothave routine monthly contact with theintervention staff they were contactedapproximately every three months by the coorinator of the intervention program.The families were queried about their child's health, and reminded that they would be asked to return for later evaluation. Expanded intervention Program Theinterventionpackageforthisresearchprojectcon5:stedofselect educational procedures which have been used routinely in a number of settings. The intervention package consisted of three components: hospital-based, home-based, andcenter-based. 45 4 NO/IVH443Hospital-based component. ne hospital-based phase took place at CharityHospital and Tulane Medical Center Hospital. The purpose of this phase was to provide families of the experimental group with early contact with members of the intervention staff, to reinforce teaching conducted by hospital staff, and to provide informationonaccessingappropriatecommunityservicessuchasHandicapped Children's Services. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) was used to develop an individualized description of the infant to be used for parent training.For example, if an infant showed low autonomic stability on the NBAS, theinterventionist would plan ways to work with the mother onsoothing and not overstimulating the infant. The NBAS was administered by the Project Nurse who was certified by staff from Boston Children's Hospital in the administration of the NBAS.Home-based component. The second phase of the project began aftew' NICUdischarge, and consisted of home-based early intervention conducted cooperativelywith an existing social service agency home-based parent training program for low- income mothers. The purpose of this phase of the program was to provide the infant'sfamily with follow-up training on the proper care and handling of the infant. The infant was assessed, and an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) was developed incooperation with the parents. Treatment objectives were determined in the areas of the infant's and family's greatest needs, but typically included objectives from the motor,se f-help, receptive language, and social-emotional areas. The treatment program was delivered by the parents.Individual family and child activities were designed to be integrated into the normal daily activities of the families. The four curriculum domains were compatiblewith routine daily activities such as feeding, dressing, and playing. Traditionaldevelopmental domains such as communication, cognitive, and gross and fine motor,and therapy techniques such as positioning and handling, were integrated into theseroutine activities throughout each of the three phases. 4\"if!! NO/IVH444 Theprimaryinterventionists, inadditiontotheparents,werea transdisciplinary team, with one member of the team assigned as case manager for each infant and family enrolled in the intervention.The other members of the team provided regular input on family and child progress, and consulted in their areas of specialty when needed. Each family was scheduled for a weekly one-hour home visit.Simple, practical programs were left with the principal caregivers each week, and performance was monitored weekly through an observation checklist. Center-based component. The third phase of the intervention consisted of an optional center-based early intervention program conducted with the Urban League Parent/Child Center program. This program consisted of twice monthly parent group meetings conducted by a social worker and devoted to topics such as nutrition and childrearing.Each of the intervention phases was driven by an Individualized Family Service Plan which was developed by the transdisciplinary team. One of the full-time staff was designated case manager. The case manager could, therefore,have been an occupational therapist, speech pathologist, infant specialist, or social worker. Representatives from eachofthe collaborating agencies were involvedinthe development of initial and follow-up IFSP goals, objectives, and activities.The case manager was i-esponsible for assuring that direct service as well as referral objectives were met.Treatment verification. A number of procedures were developed to verify that treatment was being implemented as intended. For example, the intervention teamrecorded all home visits and telephone contacts with the family using a cumulative Monthly Contact Summary Sheet. Cancellations and hospitalizations were also noted.The data for the past year indicate that the infantsinthe intervention have received an average of 68% of the scheduled weekly home visits, accounting for 2.7 hours p9r month working at home with the interventionist. While 68% at first sounds 4 rTJ NO/IVH445 low,thecircumstanres ofthepopulationwho arereceivingservices must be handbook.This rated very highly onall for Individual Family NO/IVH446 interventions for medically fragile infants. Dr. Field spoke highly of the skills of the home interventionist whom she accompanied on a home visit.Costotly_k_qa_p_gIeear;trventiororam. The cost per child for the 18 children receiving services in 1988-89 was calculated based on the ingredients approach and is presented on Table 10.2. The ingredients approach is a systematic, well-tested procedure for identifying all of the socialcosts forimplementing alternative programs, including costs that are often omitted from cost analysis such as Table 10.2Cost of One Year of Intervention per Child for LSU-IVH Site Resources Cost per Child rounding errors4 o1 NO/IVH447 contributed (in-kind) and shared resources. In this approach, an exhaustive list of resources used by each alternative is developed, and the ingredients are costed according to observed market values (e.g., salaries) or opportunity cost (e.g., parent time).An opportunity cost is the value of a resource inits next best alternative use. For example, parents participating in intervention activities could have been engaged in other productive activities; these foregone activities represent acost toparents.Since we have no information about any oneindividual's opportunity costs, we estimated the value of an individual's time based on national data.The amount of parent or non-parent volunteer time required for the study was assigned the pecuniary value of $9 per hour based on the \"median usual weekly earning for full-time work\" plus benefits (U.S.Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989).All costs are in 1990 dollars. In cases where program costs were compared over several years, costs were adjusted for inflation using the Fixed Weighted Price Index for state and local government purchases (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1988). In addition, the total costs of program and contributed resources were discounted using discount rates of 3% and 5%. Discounting adjusts the costs for the real rate ofreturn that the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere.Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time.Costs were calculated for the intervention only; medical costs associated withIVH infants have been calculated for the Salt Lake City and South Carolina IVH studies and are available on request.Resources used for the intervention include direct service and administrativepersonnel, university administration overhead, parent time, occupancy, equipment,travel, materials and supplies, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses.Personnel costs are based on the salary and benefits for 2 case managers, aspeech therapist, a social worker, and administrative staff (the director and a NO/IVH448 secretary) according to the percentage of FTE worked on the intervention project. In Adriqion, neurological consultation services were purchased on a contractual 'hout the year. Consultation costs were based on the proportion of time ied to. dirt. t service. University administration overhead was calculated using the university's direct rate of 12.6% for general, departmental, and sponsored projects administration. Because this program relies heavily on parent time during home visits with professionals and also to learn and apply intervention techniques with their children, the value of parent time was included.The opportunity cost of parent timeis based on the average hourly wage rate for full time work plus benefits for women in the U.S., $9/hour. Parents in the study spent an average of 30 hours per year in home visits with a program professional, and 108 hours working at home with their child. Occupancy charges were calculated based on the approximate cost of office leasing in the area according to local realtors, $9 per square foot. This includes maintenance, utilities (except telephone), and insurance.The project used 294 square feet this year (pro-rated according to FTE).Equipment costs were calculated by taking inventory of all office equipment and furniture, assigning a market replacement value to each item, annualizing the cost accounting for interest and depreciation, and prorating cost according to FTE worked on the project.Travel costs are based on case managers' mileage records for home visits and one trip per family to the center at $15 per trip. Finally, the cost of telephone and materialsand supplies are based on annual project expenditures on these items. Furthereconomic analyses, comparing the cost with benefits of the project, are pending. Data CollectionDatawerecollectedforthisprojecttodeterminetheeffectofearly intervention upon the child and the family. The assessment instruments were chosen to provide consistency of data collection between sites. However, some assessment 4 GO NO/IVH449instruments were chosen for this project to assess child and family variables uniqueto early intervention with infants suffering Grade III and IV IVH.Recruitment,training,and monitoring ofdiagnosticians. Fourlocaldiagnosticians were trained to administer the pre- and posttest measures. Thediagnosticians had master's degrees. Testing was scheduled directly with thediagnostician by the site coordinator. Shadow scoring of 10% of test administrationswas conducted by another trained diagnostician. Interrater reliability data revealan average coefficient of .88.Pretesting.At 3 months corrected age (prematurity corrected to 40 weeks plus3 months) all infants were tested with the BDI, the Movement Assessment of Infants(MAI), and a neurological assessment. The parents complete the Parenting StressIndex (PSI), a measure of the stress perceived by the parents, the Family SupportScale (FSS),a measure of the number of sources of support available, the Family!lesource Scale (FRS), a measure of the adequacy of resources available, the FamilyInventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE), which tallys the stress producing eventsof the past year, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACESIII), which measures the cohesiveness and adaptability of the family system. TheBDI was administered by a trained diagnostician who was unaware of the infant's groupassignment.Test and questionnaire protocols were sent to the site coordinator forscoring and placement in a data file.A duplicate set of the data was sent to EIRI.Parents were paid $45 for their time in completing the evaluation session. Thepretest assessment battery provides information about the child's early developmentalstatusandneurologicalfunctioning. Inaddition,familymeasuresprovideinformation on family reaction to the newborn, parent stress, and family supportsystems.Posttestinq.Posttesting occurred at 12 months corrected age and annuallythereafter.The posttest battery was administered by a diagnostician who was \"blind\" 461 NO/IVH450 to the subject's group assignment. The child was given the BOI, the MAI, and a follow-up neurological examination; the parent again completed the PSI, FILE, FACES III, FSS, FRS. Parents also completed a survey of additional services received by the child in the last year, a report of child health during the last year, and a parent socioeconomic survAy. Parents were paid $35 for completion of the evaluation. Additional measures taken at 12-months corrected age were videotapes of mother-infant interaction and one of motor development completed by a tra,ned child development specialist or licensed physical therapist. Parents were paid $10 as an incentive. The videotape of motor functioning followed a specific script. The motor script had the child perform the following behaviors (based upon the child's level of motor development):reaching and grasping from a supine position, rolling over and reaching and grasping from a prone position, creeping and crawling, sitting and reaching, pulling self up to stand, walking, and squatting to pick up a toy.The parent-child interaction videotape recorded the parent and child in play activities.In the first section, the mother and child played together for 15 minutes \"as they would at home.\" Then for one minute the parent was instructed to encourage the child to put the toys away. For the next tivo minutes, the parent read to the child.Then the parent left the room for 45 seconds, and taping continuedfor two minutes after the parent returned to the room. Results and Discussion The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a family and childdirected early intervention program. Eighteen of the subjects had reached the ageof first posttesting, and two had received their second posttest. Thus, the data analyses for this report examined the initial comparability of the groups at pretestod the measures of child and family functioning at the first posttest. 4 fy NO/IVH 451Initial Comparability of GroupsTable 10.3 represents the comparison of pretest measures for intervention and control groups on the child functioning and family measures.

Thus, the demographic data and the pretest data combined indicate that the reduced group is representative of the overall group. Etfects of Early Intervention VersusMedical Follow-up Without Intervention onMeasures of Child and Family FunctioningThe effects of the early intervention program on child functioning were assessed using the Battelle Developmental Inventory. These data were analyzed using one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA). ANCOVA prlcedures were employed for two purposes:(a) tu increase the statistical power of the analyses by reducing error variance;and (b) to statistically adjust for any pretreatment differerces between the groups.For either purpose, the degree to which ANCOVA is useful depends on the correlationbetween the covariates selected and the outcome variable for which analyses are being done.However, since one degree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, it isgenerally best to use a limited number of covariates (usually five or less) in any given analysis. All pretests and demographic variables were considered as potential covariates.The final selection of covariates depended on a judgment of whichvariable or set of variables could be used to maximize the correlation or multiplecorrelation with the outcome variable in question and still include those demographicor pretest variables for which there are the largest pretreatment differences. Thus, the 1st posttest data were analyzed in a three-stage procedure.First, the pretest BDI, demographics, and parent measures were examined forpotential differences which might affect the posttest scores and which could thus 464 NO/IVH453 be used as covariates in the analyses of the posttest results. As reported above,there were no significant differences between the groups on the pretest measures.The second stage of the analyses examined the relations between the posttestscores on the child and family measures and the pretest measures via multiple regression analyses, again looking for potential covariates. Pretest variables thatwere strongly associated with the posttest measures were used as covariates in the third stage of the analyses; one-way between-groups analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs).The pretest variables that were used as covariates in a particular analysis areindicated in the column labeled \"Covariates\" in Table 10.4, which represents theresults of the analyses of the first posttest child and family measures.Analysis of the BDI scores indicated that the intervention and non interventiongroups did not differ significantly on any of the subscales or on the total BDI score.While none of the differences were statistically significant, all favoredthe early intervention group.Analysis of the PSI indicated that the groups did not differ significantly oneither the child related stress scale or the other related stress scale. The effect size for child related stress (.42) indicates a large aifference between the groups.With a larger sample size, this differew.:e might be statistically significant. This result would indicate that those parents who had received intervention reported lessstress related to their child than those who had not. On the other hand, the effectsize for other related stress is comparable (-.38) and suggests that the parents whoreceived the intervention services tended to report more stress related to factorsother than their child.The results of the analysis of the FACES III again indicated no statisticallysignificant between groups differences. Again, however, examination of the effectsizes indicates a substantial effect size (.36) on the cohesion subscale, indicatingthat those parents who received early intervention services tended to report a more C NO/IVH454Table 10.4Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Alternative Intervention Groupsfor LSU-IVH Treatment - No Treatment Comparison variables COvariateS4No Intervention Early InterventionANCOVAFValueES (SD)Adj.in (SD)Adj.in Age in fort4 7.4(7.2) 713.0(11.0) 131.17.29-.77Events (FILE) Statistical analyses for 8DI scores were conducted using raw scores for each of the scales. ror ease of interpretation, the information in thistable has teen converted from the raw scores to a ratio Development Quotient (DO) by dividing the \"dip equivalent\" (AE) score reported In thetechnical manual for each child's raw score by the child's chronological age at time of testing Scores for each subscale of the FACES are derived from the \"ideal\" score reported in the technical manual.

The large negative effect ;izes for the FSS and FILE, however, indicates that the intervention group reported fewer social supports and more stressful life events during the previous twelve months, a difference which might be significant given a larger sample size. Conclusions This project provided limited data on the efficacy of an intensive intervention program for prevention or amelioration of development?1 delays in infants at risk because of a history of complications of preterm birth. Analyses of the demographic dataandthe pretestdataindicated thatthe random assignment procedure was successful in assuring the initial balance of the grouns. There were no differences between the groups on the demographic measures, child measures, and most of the family measures at pretest.While the results of the parametric analyses indicate that there were no statistically significant differences between groups on the child or family outcome measures, the large effect sizes on some of the measures indicate differences which might havk been significant given a large sample size. Examination of the pattern of effect sizes reveals some interesting results. Of 16 analyses, 13 showed effect sizes greater than .25. Especially interesting, is the fact that 8 of the 13 effectsizes greater than .25 indicated differences in favor of the early intervention group.Closer examination of the effect sizes indicates a consistent pattern for the BDI results.All of the effect sizes on the BDI results favored the intervention group.The posttest effect size differences may be attributed to a drop in BDIscores on the part of the non-intervention group. This result is consistent with other reports of declining test scores in similar low-SES populations. This result NO/IVIA456 suggests that a similar decline may be reduced by the support provided by the early intervention program.The effect sizes for the PSI indicate a similar result. The child related stress scale of the PSI showed an effect size of .42 favoring the early intervention group.The pretest effect size indicated that the groups did not differ on this scale.In fact, at pretest, the early intervention group reporteo a higher level of other related stress, a difference which was found at the posttest, however, the size of the difference was reduced. Comparison of tl: group means for child relatedstress indicates that the average stress level reported by the early interventiongroup remained the same between pre- and posttest, while that reported by the nonintervention group increased by 9 points. The increase in the stress level ofthe nonintervention group could be the result of having to care for the needs of amedically fragile infant without the support of an intervention staff.The results of the analyses of the FACES III scales also are consistent withpositive effects of the early intervention program. The cohesion scale, which showedan effect in favor of the nonintervention group at pretest (ES = -.46) showed aneffect in favor of the intervention group at posttest (ES = .36). Examination ofthe group means again indicates that the change fn effect sizes is attributable tothe change in the score of the nonintervention group. While the level of family cohesion reported by the intervention group remained about the same between pre- andposttest, the nonintervention group reported less cohesion at posttest. This effect might also be attributable to the support provided by the early intervention program.The effect size results for the discrepancy scale of nie FACES III indicatethat the early intervention group races their ideal family pattern more differentfrom the actual pattern than does the nonintervention group. The pretest effect sizeindicatedthatthe groupsdidnot differ ontheir perceptions ofthis discrepancy.As was the case with BDI and PSI scores, the change in the effect size NO/IVH457 isattributable to a thatthe in the currentstudyindicatesthat the parents who work morewith theirchildren see more neurologic services beginning one month prior to hospital dischargevs. services begun at 3 years of age.LOCAL CONTACT PERSONS: Yvonne Gillette and Nancy Nancy OhioDATE OF REPORT: Study Althoughsignificant advances in perinatalandneonatalcare overthelast decade have proved the outlookfor the extremely premature infant, thisgroup of Hfants still accounts for 50%of the neonatal mortality rate, and thesurviving very (BPD) pulmonary disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia--BPD) atthe time of discharge from the nursery is one of the strongest predictors for.1!...tiple disabilities (Escobedo & Mellins, 1985). BPD is a unique disorder of the newborn infant whorequires mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy at birth (O'Brodovich & Mellins, 4 7' 0 Columbus/MF4591985).BPD has become increasingly frequent as smaller and smaller infants survive,and affects up to 40% of surviving infants weighing less than 1500 g at birth(Escobedo & Gonzalez, 1986). Although BPD is a severe disabling disorder, it differsfrom other forms of chronic lung disease in that many affected infants demonstratesubstantial improvement and recovery of lung function over the first few years of life.However, despite the encouraging improvement in pulmonary status, up to 40%of these infants have other major disabilities (Koops et al., 1984).The mostfrequent disabilities include growth failure, developmentaldelays,neurologicinsults, visual problems, and deafness (Koops et al., 1984).The etiology of the developmental delays observed in these infants is usuallymultifactorial and may be related to inadequate nutrition during a critical periodof brain growth and differentiation. In addition to demonstrating developmentaldelays, these infants have substantial health problems beyond the neonatal period,and up to 30% are re-hospitalized during infancy (Hack, Caron, Rivers, & Fanaroff,1983; McCormick, Shapiro, & Starfield, 1980).A second predictor for (IVH), perinatal asphyxia, and congenital neurologicanomalies.Recent advances have been made in the early identification of braininsults which predict later neurologic impairment in this group of infants. It isnow routine to monitor preterm infants for intracran4al bleeding with the non-invasive cranial ultrasound. Itis possible to identify infants in the first fewmonths of life who are at extremely high risk for later neurodevelopmental delayson the basis of structural brain damage.Perinatal care and medical advances have dramatically improved the short-termoutlook for infants with BPD and neurological damage. However, most of the gain inexpertise and knowledge is based in the tertiary care hospital and is not available Columbus/MF460 to the infant, family, or local health,social service, and early intervention personnel following hospital discharge. Consequently, many local primary care physicians and public health nurses are uncomfortable supervising and directing the care of these complex children, and those families that live two to three hours from the tertiary care hospital have difficulty accessing adequate local medical care.The resulting fragmentation of health care with multiple visits to multiple specialists at often geographically distant tertiary care centers is cited by parentsas a major problem in caring for their chronically ill children. Added to the problem of inadequate local health care resources, families may find that local earlyintervention personnel are not trained in the specialized medical, educational, and social needs of medically fragile infants and their families, and that home-based intervention delivery may not be available as a service option. In sum, a critical need exists to assess the efficacy of projects which begin intervention in the NICUand provide transitions to community-based intervention programs.Some evidence suggests that regionalization of care to the home and community can be an effective means of improving the functional status of the medically fragile infant.Several studies have successfully used home-based intervention programs tofacilitate developmental progress inlow birthweight infants (Infant Health and Development Program, 1990; Ramey & Campbell, 1987; Resnick et al., 1987).This project is unique in that all the infants being intervened with have serious medicalconsiderations. Philosophical and TheoreticalRationale for the ServicesThe practices of the Columus Medically Fragile Project (Columbus/MF) flow fromthe theoretical position set forth by Urie Bronfennbrenner (1979) in The Ecology ofHuman Development. Bronfennbrenner views theenvironment as asetofnested structures, each inside the next. The basic unit is the ei.tiog, such as the family,472 Columbus/MF 461 which includes the developing person. The relationships between settings form the nextlevelofinfluenceupondevelopment.Bronfennbrenner arguesthattherelationships between settings can play as decisive a role in development as theevents within a given setting. Consequently, this project endeavors to facilitate the family's ability to meet the infant's needs and impact on the transition betweenthe hospitaland the community, since both can greatly influence the infant's development.Bronfennbrenner also contends that the practices of society at largecan profoundly influence the developing person. The importance of this level ofinfluence is exemplified by P.L. 99-457, the public law which encourages states toprovide appropriate early intervention services to all handicapped infants and toddlers.As the Bronfennbrenner model suggests, the families of medically fragile infantsvary along several major dimensions: the functioning of the family, which includesand is affected by the status of the infant; the influence of the hospital; theeffects of the practices of society at large; and the community resources available to the family.Following this model, the Columbus project attempted to enhance thefamily's functioning, the status of the infant, and the community's ability to meetthe family's and infant's needs. The project also attempts to influence societalattitudes and practices as regards the care and development of the medically fragileinfant and his/her family. Figure 11.1 illustrates the model used to design servicesfor children and families participating in this project.The Columbus/MF program serves as a model for specialized care and support tothe home and community following hospital discharge of the infant, rather than basingthis support in the tertiary care hospital. As previously indicated, the medicallyfragile infant is at established risk for developmental delays due to serious long-term medical and nutrition problems, lack of coordinated follow-up and intervention services in the local area, and lack of specialized training for local health, social COLUMBUS MEDICALLYFRAGILE PROJECT 0 OCColumbus/MF462 Figure 11.1:Path of the Columbus/MF Project Model facilitating optimal family and infant functioningfrom the hospital to the community and home. service, and educational intervention personnel.There isa need to determine whether the developmental outcome of medically fragile infants and the functioning of their families can be improved through coordinated and comprehensive services to ease their transition from the hospital to their local community. Overview of StudyThis study compared the effects of a coordinated and comprehensive system of early intervention services initiated prior to discharge from the NICU with the effects of services obtained through hospital referrals following discharge. One group of infants, the early intervention group, received comprehensive coordinatedservices to facilitate their transition from a centralized source (the Columbus Children's Hospital), to regionalized sources (agencies within local communities). The randomly assigned comparison group of children received only the limited services available to CCH NICU graduates. The current level of services for children in this group have been described by Koops et al. (1984).These services include limited4 74 Columbus/MF463 medical follow-up and management, developmental evaluation, and referral through the hospital follow-up clinic. Little attention was paid to the child's developmental progress in this group, as will be noted later. Methods The Columbus/MF Project was a cooperative research effort with \"A Collaborative Approach to the Transition from the Hospital to the Community and Home Project,\" an HCEEP Demonstration Project of the Columbus Children's Hospital (CCH) in Columbus, Ohio.The project served graduates of CCH's newborn intensive care unit (NICU) and their families who lived :n Ohio's Perinatal Region IV.This region encompassed 33 counties in the mid- and southeastern sections of the state. The area was primarily rural, although it included the urban center of Columbus. The Columbus/MF HCEEP demonstration project was funded by the U.S. Department of Education from 1987-90. Year 1 was devoted to model development and focused on three objectives. The first objective was to establish collaborative intervention teams to service medically fragile infants and their families in the catchment area. Tomeetthisobjective,localadministrators ofhealth,socialservice,and education/early intervention agencies entered into collaborative agreements with the HCEEP project, and local intervention personnel were identified to provide services.The second objective was to construct an intervention and service delivery model utilizing the following multiple assessment factors: current status of infants and their caregivers, stresses on the family and extra-familial systems, and the availability and use offamilyand extra-familial supports.Assessmentand intervention protocols were developed and compiled to assess health and nutritional status, developmental status, parent-child interaction, home environmental factors, family stresses, and neeaed supports. The measures assessing infant and family Columbus/MF464characteristics are described in further detail in the data collection section of this paper.The final objective, which was met during the project's first year, was thetraining of local collaborative intervention teams in the family-focused, home-based intervention model. In addition to orienting the collaborative intervention teams to the model,a series of multidisciplinary workshops, focusing on the medical,educational, and psychosocial needs of these infants and their families was held for allteam members to promote collaborative case management, continuity,and transition of services.During the project's second and third funding years, the efforts concentratedon subject enrollment, coordination of services and service provision, and data collection. SubjectsThe Columbus project enrulled 52 subjects between October 1, 1988, and March 12,1990.A description of the recruitment and assignment procedures and thecharacteristics of study participants follows.Recruitment.Medically fragile infants who were hospitalized in the ColumbusChildren's Hospital Intensive Care Unit were eligible to participate in the studyif they were diagnosed with moderate to severe BPD and had a need for oxygen therapyand/or two or more pulmonary medications upon hospital discharge. Infants withneurologic conditions (severe [Grade IV] perinatalintraventricular hemorrhage,hydrocephalus, microcephaly) requiring specialized (i.e., feeding pumps,suction, and/or aerosol equipment) were also eligible.Eligible infants were identified for inclusion in the study when their weightreached 1500 g (approximately one month before discharge). At that time, the parentswere contacted by the project's clinical nurse specialist. The nurse explained tothe parents the nature of the study, requested their participation, and if parents 4 \"I' Columbus/MF465 were willing, obtained informed consent. If parents decided not to participate in the study, their infant received routine medical and developmental follow-up throughthe Neonatal Follow-up Clinic, and, if necessary, was referred to local agencies forlimited health, occupationaltherapy,physicaltherapy,and early intervention services.Parents were informed of their child's group assignment after theycompleted the informed consent procedure.Assignment to groups. Infants were enrolled in the study continuously between October 1, 1988, and March 12, 1990. Following enrollment, the infants were randomlyassigned to either the high- or low-intensity groups after being stratified by theirprimary diagnosis of BPD or neurologic damage. The BPD and neurologic groups wereeach further stratified into groups of more or less severe illness based on themedical severity index developed by the hospital staff. The severity index alloweda physician to rate the infants on a scale of 0-5, with 5 being the most severe orabnormal rating on nine variables thought to be related to predicted medical outcome. Thevariablesincludedtheinfant'sdegreeoftechnologydependence,oxygendependence, respiratory status, age at discharge, neurologic status, ultrasound/CT findings,head circumference, feeding status, and sensory impairme6t. A total severity score ranging from 3 to 45 points was obtained. Infants receiving a scoreof 18 and below were determined to be \"low risk,\" and those receiving a score of 19and above were considered \"high risk.\" Following both stratification processes,group assignments were randomly made by the EIRI site coordinator, who was unknownto the infants and their families.Subject Attrition. There were 52 subjects initially enrolled in the study.Four subjects (8%) died following pretesting. Of those subjects, three were assigned tothe high-intensity group and one was assigned tothelow-intensity group.Attrition accounted for three subjects (5%) from the high-intensity group who weredropped from the study at parent request. Columbus/MF466An analysis of pretest demographic data measures of child and family functioningindicated no statistically significant differences between the subjects who remainedin the study and those lost to attrition on any of the measures. Families of subjects lost to attrition had lower total household income, however, this differencewas not statistically significant.To minimize attrition, both the onsite coordinator and the EIRI coordinatormaintained updated telephone numbers and addresses of the participants. Data were collected in person every six months until the infant. reached 24 months age corrected for prematurity'. Infants and families in the high-intensity group were in frequentpersonal and telephone contact with study personnel as intervention services were delivered.By definition, infants in the low-intensity group did not meet with studypersonnel between assessments; however, the study was successful in assessing infantsin both groups on time. If needed, study personnel arranged for transportationservices to assist families in mePting scheduled assessment appointments.Demographic characteristics. Information was gatheredbyquestionnairesregarding family income, ethnic background, parent occupation, number of siblings,and primary caretaking responsibilities of the participating families. Results ofthe parent surveys indicated that 35% of the infants were from families living inColumbus, Ohio, and its immediately surrounding area. The remaining 63% resided intowns and rural areas of central and southeastern Ohio. One family moved from Ohioto the state of Indiana. The total sample was composed of 82% Caucasian infants and18% non-Caucasian infants. Seventy-seven percent of the infants were from two-parentfamilies, and 98.9% were from homes where English was the primary language spoken.Further information about the demographic characteristics of the infants and familiesin each group will be presented in the Results and Discussion section. 'In other words, a child who is horn 4 weeks prematurely would not reach a corrected age of 12weeks until 16 weeks after birth.4 7 Columbus/MF 467Intervention ProgramsThe Columbus/MF Project compared a high-intensity intervention program to a low- intensity intervention program. Children in both groups received medical follow-upafter their initial discharge from the NICU. The high-intensity intervention group also received coordinated and comprehensive services designed to improve their healthand developmental outcome, and to facilitate their transition from the tertiaryhospital to the local community. The low-intensity intervention group was referredto services identified at follow-up clinic visits.High-intensity intervention program. Intervention services provided to the high-intensity intervention group consisted of pre-discharge hospital visits, medicalfollow-upclinicservices,andcoordinated multidisciplinary home-based early intervention services. The intervention began with two to three weekly hospital-based visits with families approximately one month prior to the infant's dischargefrom the NICU. The hospital-based visits, which were initiated by the project'sclinical nurse specialist and/or social worker, provided an opportunity for familiesto begin to establish a support system with ties to both the hospital and their homecommunities, and to allow the project to assist families in planning for theirinfant's home care needs prior to discharge. These services were designed to helpfamilies begin to identify and initiate contacts with service providers in their local areas.Because medical concerns took a primary role in the first weeks after discharge, local services often initially included 24-hour home nursing care, rental or purchaseof durable medical equipment such as supplemental oxygen, ventilators, or positioningand feeding equipment. As the infants medical conditions stabilized in the homesettings, additional services included public health, social service, mental health,education, or occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Columbus/MF468After hospital discharge, infants received regular medical supervision anddevelopmental evaluation through Columbus Children's Hospital High-Risk NeonatalFollow-up Clinic. The first medical follow-up visit occurred two weeks post- discharge.Additional visits were scheduled for 6, 1?, 18, and 24 months of age (agecorrected for prematurity), and yearly thereafter. The clinic was staffed by aneonatologist, a social worker, a nurse coordinator, and an occupational therapistwho provided health monitoring and developmental evaluation. Full ancillary services(radiology, drug level monitoring, pharmacy, respiratory therapy, ophthalmology, andaudiology) were available in the hospital complex.Regular home visits were initiated following hospital discharge and continueduntil the child reached 24 months (age corrected for prematurity). The Columbus/MFproject's clinical nurse specialist and developmental consultant attended the homevisits with local service providers on at least a monthly basis. Whether or notthese collaborative home visits were interdisciplinary depended on the concernssurrounding the infant and the family needs. Participants in these collaborativehome visits included at least one member of the Columbus/MF project staff, one localservice provider, the family (or at least the primary caregiver), and the infant.When conducting a collaborative home visit, the resource team members followed afour-step approach: (1) update, (2) plan, (3) practice, and (4) integrate into thefamily routine.Update referred to the process during which the intervention group (resource teammember,localserviceprovider,andthefamily)reviewedanyrecentdevelopmental assessments and previous plans. From the information shared in theupdate discussion, the intervention group planned for subsequent parent educationand specific intervention for the infant and family related to developmental, health,and nutrition issues. Members of the team practiced specific intervention activities 4a0 Columbus/MF469 which were then integrated into family routines. Plans were put in writing and amethod for monitoring the program was selected.Local service providers were also encouraged to assist families in locating andutilizing additional community services such as respite care. The project gradually shifted responsibility from the resource team to the communities. The timing of thisshift was individualized to meet the family's needs and the ability of the localservice providers to take a more direct and independent role in working with this specialpopulation.The ultimate goaloftheproject wastotransferfullresponsibility for the care ofthe medically fragile infanttolocalservice providers(physicians,public health nurses, early educators, etc.).It wasanticipated that these agencies would continue to provide necessary services afterthe children reach 24 months of age al.: were no longer involved in this project. Lolv-intensitv intervention program. Infants in the low-intensity interventiongroup received the services that were available to all graduates of the NICU. These services included the same medical and developmental follow-up services of the High-Risk Neonatal Follow-up Clinic that infants in the high-intensity intervention group received.However, subjects in the low-intensity intervention group did not receivethe coordinated transition services or the home-based early intervention servicesavailable to the high-intensity intervention group. Infants in the low-intensityintervention group who were found to be delayed, at-risk for delay, or in need ofcommunity services by the follow-up clinic, were referred to community agencies bythe hospital follow-up clinic. These agencies were notified of the referral. Thesereferral agencies were utilized inconsistently at best. Records documenting howoften infants in the delayed group accessed referral services were kept and used in the ciata analysis.Treatment verification. Treatment verification procedures were carried out toensure that treatment occurred in accordance with the proposed intervention program4SI Columbus/MF470 plan.It conisted of data collected on the child, family, and intervention program.Treatment verification data on children in the high-intensity intervention groupincluded the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP), a log of individual servicesprovided, and attendance records. These data were collected ard recorded by thelocal service provider and transition support staff.Table11.1demonstrates that thehigh-intensity group receivedintensiveservices from the hospital transition team and local intervenor, while the low-intensity group did not receive those services. Information about additionalservices received by the child was collected from parents of children in both groupsat pretest and at all interim and posttests.Data on the family included an estimate of the quality of parent involvementby CCH project staff, a parent satisfaction questionnaire completed by parents atposttest, and an estimate of how well the parents felt they were able to integratethe infant's programs into their daily routine were also collected at posttest. Thequality of parent involvement was evaluated on a scale of 1 - 3 on t!.iree qualities:attendance, parent knowledge of child's condition, and parent support of intervention program.Mean scores ranged from 2.3 - 3.0 in demonstrating parent involvement.There were no differences between groups in terms of parent involvement. The parentsperception of how well they were able to integrate the program activities into theirfamily routines was measured on a scale of 1-3, with 3 being the most able, Therewas no significant difference between the groups on the integration variable atposttest.Tr. atment verification information was -also gathered on the interventionprogram itself. EIRI staff also maintained weekly telephone contact with the projectstaff, conducted three yearly site visits, and conducted an annual onsite review ofthe project.A site review of the Columbus project was conducted August 23-24, 1990.

The overall results of the Site Review were very positive. Comprehensive and coordinated services were provided to the early intervention group, and data were managed in an exemplary manner. Furthermore, a review of 12-month interim data by the site review team indicated that there were substantial differences in the number and intensity of interventions received by each group. A full report of the site review is available from the site coordinator. Cost of Alternative InterventionsThe cost of early versus later intervention was determined by analyzing costsfor both program alternatives on two levels. The first level consisted of the hospital-based CATCH teamwhich coordinated services for the child on the local level following release from the hospita'. The second consisted of the costs associatedwith the local agencies providing direct services to the children and families in the research study.CATCH team resources for children in both groups (see Table 11.2) includeddirect service and administrative personnel, occupancy, equipment, materials and supplies,travel, and miscellaneous expenses. Personnel resources allocated tochildren in the two groups differed according to the actual amount of time spent.the allocation of resources to the control group is explained in more detail below.Direct service personnel costs include salaries and benefits for the pediatrician,nurse, social worker, parent-infant educator, and an occupational therapist. Salaryand benefits were also calculated according to the percentage of FTE worked on theproject for program administrative personnel: project director, secretarial and45 nw,.r c.,.n- Table 11.2Columbus Medically Project Costs $ 7,09611,452$6223,020 $6463,044 support staff, and general hospital administration. The percentage of time devotedby the staff to the demands of the research were, of course, excluded from the costsof the service project. Hospital administrative costs were based on the hospital'sindirect rate for administration (.22 of direct expenses). Occupancy charges arebased on the 1989 rate per square foot for space used by the program, including plantoperation, housekeeping, maintenance, repairs, and insurance. The project used 328 4 E Columbus/MF474square feet at $12.86 per square foot for space, $2.43 per square foot for plantoperation,$7.21 per square foot for housekeeping, $14.73 per square foot formaintenance repairs and insurance, for a total of $37.23 per square foot. Equipmentincluded office equipment and furniture used for 3.0 FTEs. Market replacement valueswere ascertained for each item and an annualization factor was applied to arrive atan annual cost accounting for interest and depreciation. Travel expenditures werebased on actual mileage. The cost of materials and supplies and miscellaneousexpenses were based on the project's annual expenditure on these items.CATCH team personnel costs for children in the control group were minimal; thenurse spent time recruiting, testing, and collecting child and family medical data,chart keeping, etc.; the social worker set up appointments and coordinated the OTclinic; the occupational therapist tested the children; and the pediatrician receivedvisits from each child. These are all costs associated with the direct servicesprovided by the project. For each of these activities, the actual amount of timespent and the associated cost of the time was determined. This time cost is thedirect service cost for the control group. The direct service costs for the controlgroup equaled 9.4% of total direct costs. Thus, this proportion was used as the bestestimate of the proportion of indirect service resources used by the control group.As previously mentioned, cost analyses were also conducted to determine the costper child in both groups for services received in the community. Here, the emphasiswas on services which the child or family received as a direct result of the CATCHteam intervention and were services related to the child's condition or disability.Thus, social services such as WIC or subsidized housing, or social worker serviceswere excluded because these were not related to the child's disability. Alsoexcluded were individual physician fees, private home nursing care and equipmentcosts, and the cost of the NICU and readmissions to the hospital. These costs were Columbus/MF475 a function of the severity of the child's condition and were services the child/family would have received regardless of the efforts of the CATCH team. From the additional services form, it was obvious that the CATCH team referredchildren and families to three main services: public health nursing (PHN), early intervention programs (EI), and physical and occupational therapists (PT/OT).A few children were referred to speech therapy services; however, there were so few instances that they were not included in the cost analysis. The costs for PHN, EI, and PT/OT were determined by contacting representative agencies providing these services to young children throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to determine an average cost. In the case of the public health nursing, cost information wasgenerally available in cost per visit; thus, this is the unit used for PHN in the analysis.PHN cost per visits did not significantly differ between urban and rural locations due to the higher cost of transportation in the rural setting which offset the potentially higher personnel costs in urban settings. For PT/OT and El, costfigures were generally available in cost per hour and this is the unit used in the present analysis. Costs for PT/OT and El did vary 4rom urban to rural settings; the estimate used is an average of urban and rural figures obtained because childrenin the study were approximately balanced between urban and rural settings. Cost estimates used for the analysis were: (I) public health nurse at $72 per visit,(2) early intervention services at $37 per hour, and (3) PT/OT services at $75 per hour.An estimate of thequantity ofservices received was obtained from theadditional services forms filled out by the parents at the 2 week, 6 wnth, and 12 month assessments. Parents were asked to report, from a list of services, the numberof sessions attended, hours per session, total hours of service received, and theagency providing the services. Each form was studied for inconsistencies orincompletions, and followed-up with the CATCH team personnel and parents to obtain4 cs Columbus/MF476an accurate as possible estimate of the quantity of services received by each familyin the study.' Total hours for PHN, El, and PT/OT were tallied and multiplied bytheir respective costs per hour to determine total cost of these services in eachgroup.These were divided by the number of children in the group to arrive ataverage cost.All figureson Table 11.2 are in constant 1990 dollars.For purposes of thecalculation.of CATCH team cost per child, there were 21 children in the experimentalgroup and 24 in the control group--the actual number of children served through 12months at the time of this analysis; for additional services cost estimation, datawere available for 23 in the control group and 21 in the experimental group.At thebottom of Table 11.2, CATCH team costs have been discounted using discount rates of3% and %5.Additional services costs are current and, therefore, at the time of thisreport, not yet subject to the effects of discounting.As Table 11.2 indicates, the CATCH team had a signifft7ont impact on whether thefamiliessoughtandobtained early interventionservices for their children.Childrenin the experimental group received five times as many hours of earlyintervention services as children in the control group (1,210.5 hours versus 242hours).The CATCH team had a lesser impact on the amount of public health nursingvisits received--327 visits for the experimental group and 275 visits for the controlgroup children. There is a small difference between hours of PT/OT received bychildren in each group which favors the control group.Total hours were 308.5 forexperimental and 352 for controlOverall,the CATCH teamseems to have accomplished its goal of connectingchildren with early intervention services in their community. Thus, in addition tocase management and referral, the CATCH team is providing an important child-findservice.Due to random assignment, we can assume that there are at least as manychildreninthe controlgroup who are eligible for such services and are not 4 SD lfiff%1MT. ?PA' f r.\" 7::777.7 Columbus/MF477 receiving them. Since Ohio has decided to mandate services to infants and toddlers under Part H of P.L. 99-457, this is an especially interesting finding for the Department of Health who is the lead agency. In addition, the data suggest that public nurse home visits and whether or not the child receives PT/OT services are prubably independent of the CATCH team. In other words, children in both groups are balanced with respect to physical disability and will receive those services if they need them regardless of the existence of a CATCH team. Data CollectionData collected at the Columbus project included the results of outcome measures used across all EIRI sites and measures specific to this study.Outcome measures included assessments of both child and family functioning.As indicated earlier, infants were enrolled in the study approximately one month prior to their discharge from the NICU, and they were pretested two weeks following discharge. Pretest data were collected on 52 infants. Outcome data were collected on subjects at 6 and 12 months corrected age. All EIRI assessments took place at CCH in conjunction with NICU follow-up clinic visits.Recruitment.training.- and monitoring of diagnosticians. InJune1988, diagnosticians were trained in Columbus by the EIRI Evaluation Specialist to adMinister the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI), Three diagnosticians were Registered Occupational Therapists employed in the Occupational Therapy Department of Columbus Children's Hospital. The fourth diagnustician was an Early Childhood Specialist employed in the Child Life Department of Columbus Children's Hospital.While their work assignments involved in-patient and out-patient care, none of the therapists was assigned to the NICU or the Neonatal Follow-up Clinic. They evaluated the subjects as a part of the,,r regular employment and were uninformed as to the purpose of the study and the group assignment of the infants. 4 f: 1.jColumbus/MF478 Prior to the formal BDI training, the diagnosticians were required to become familiar with the BDI through a review of the test manuals, practice in scoring, viewing of a videotape of test administration procedures, and completing a self- mastery test.The diagnosticians then completed three practice BDI administrations.The third practice session was videotaped and reviewed by the EIRI Evaluation Specialistwhothencertifiedthediagnostician. Ineachyearfollowing certification, 10% of each diagnostician's test administrations were shadow scored for reliability by the onsite assessment coordinator. The assessment coordinator was responsible for tracking and scheduling evaluations for each subject. A more in depth discussion of test administration procedures is available in the EIRI 1986- 87 annual report.Pretesting.Two weeks following discharge from the NICU, all infants in the study were scheduled for the first visit to the Neonatal Follow-up Clinic, where their health status, growth, pulmonary function, and rehospitalization record were evaluated.At that time,infant assessments also included the BDI and the InfantNeurological International Battery (the Infanib), a measure of neurologic integrity in the newborn and infant. The Parenting Stress Index (PSI), an assessment of thestress present in the parent-child system; the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III), an assessment of the separateness or connectedness and adaptability of the family members to the family; the Family Support Scale (FSS), a measure of different sources of support available to families with young children;the Family Resource Scale (FRS), a measure of the different kinds of resourcesavailable to the family; the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE),which assesses the life events and changes experienced by the family during theprevious 12 months; and the Parent Survey (demographic information) were completed by the parents. Parents were paid $20 for completing the pretest assessment battery. Columbus/MF479 Tests and questionnaires were returned to EIRI for scoring, data entry, and storage. Table 11.3 presents a schedule for the administration of assessment measures.

The first outcome tests were scheduled when the infant was 6months old (age corrected for prematurity). At this time, the infant received a physical examination and was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Infanib. At that same time, parents completed the Carey Infant TemperamentScale, the FSS, and the FRS. An additional services form reporting services thatwere used since pretest in conjunction with infant care and development, and a socialwork questionnaire developed by the CCH team social worker were completed in aninterview with the social worker.A second outcome testing session was scheduled when the infants were 12 months(ages corrected for prematurity). At the posttest sessions, infants and their VI9 Columbus/MF 480parents again completed the pretest battery. In addition, parents complete theParent Satisfaction Survey and the Report of Child Health. The additional servicesform was completed during an interview with the social worker. The outcome test at18-months consisted of a physical examination, re-administration of the Bayley, theFSS, the FRS, and the additional services survey. At the 12 and 24 month po5ttlsts,parents and infants were videotaped during a scripted 16-minute period which includedfree play and structured activities. The videotapes are to be coded and scored asa measure of parent-child interaction. Parents were paid $20 for completing eachoutcome test battery.

Effects of High Intensityvs. Low IntensityIntervention on Measuresof Child FunctioningAnalysis of covariance procedures were used to measure differences between groups on measures of child and family functioning following early intervention services to one group of infants and delayed intervention to the other group. Analysis of covariance procedures were used for two reasons: (a) to increase the statistical power of the study by reducing error variance; and (b) to adjust for any pretreatmentdifferences which werepresentbetweenthegroups.Ineither application, the degree to which analysis of covariance is useful depends on the correlation between the covariate(s) selected and the outcome variable for which analyses are being done. However, since one degree of freedom is lost for each covariate used, it is generally best to use a limited number of covariates (usually five or less) in any given analysis. All pretest and (Jemographic variable were considered as potential covariates.The final selection of ccvariates depended on a judgmentof which variable or set of variables could be used to maximize the correlation or multiple cc. relation with the outcome variable in question and still include those demographic or pretest variables for which there were the largest pretreatment differences. For example, child's age, level of severity et discharge, score on Infanib and mother's age were used as covariates for 12 month Battelle Personal Social raw scores. The combination of these variables reduced the amount of unexplained variance in the 12-month Battelle Personal Social raw scores better4\"ej Columbus/MF485than other combinations of pretest and demographic variables. In each analysis, the specific covariates used are indicated in the table. ANCOVA results are shown in Table 11.8. The analysis of data collected at 12-months CCA indicated that infantsinthe highintensity group performed better than infantsinthelow- intensity group on the Battelle Personal Social domains (p < .10).

In light of the many different variables on which groups were compared, it was not surprising to findseveral on which there were statistically significant differences between groups.When data were considered in total, it appears that groups were well matched and very comparable.That the intervention was initiated as intended was evidenced by the fact that96% of the infants in the early intervention group were referred to their countycollaborative groups as they were discharged from the hospital, while only 4% of the infants in the delayed intervention group received such a referral. Posttest results revealed that families in the high-intensity intervention group report that they havesignificantly more resources available to them than families in the low-intensity group.Although this difference is a preliminary finding since not all of theposttest data has yet been gathered, it is encouraging in light of the goals of the intervention.It suggests that the hospital-based transition services may haveassisted families in accessing appropriate community services. It is also possiblethat many of the effects of the transition services may not be apparent fromstandardized measures of child and family functioning, although the results at 12months indicate differences favoring the high-intensity group on Personal/Social andAdaptive Behavior Domains. 488 A REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON PARENT INVOLVEMENTIN EARLY INTERVENTION Oneofthemostfrequentclaimsofresearchers,administrators, and practitioners involved in early intervention is that parent involvement leads to moreeffective intervention programs. The claim that parent involvement is essential tochild development and educational success is not new. Frederick Frobel, one of theprimary contributors to the establishment of American kindergarten programs, argued that,All are looking for reform in education....If building is to be solid, wemust look to the foundations--the home. The home education of rich andpoor alike must be supplemented....It therefore behooves the state toestablish institutions for the education of children, of parents and ofthose who are to be parents. (Hauschmann, 1897, p. 183, as cited in Karnes& Lee, 1978, p. 13)The emphasis on involving parents inthe education of their children hascontinued unabated to the present time. In every decade since the turn of thecentury, there have been many who have advocated vigorously for the importance ofinvolving parents in all educational efforts (see Florin & Dokecki, 1983, and Fein, 1980,foranexcellentsummary ofthehistoricalinvolvementofparentsineducational programs).With the federal funding of Head Start in 1965, and the Handicapped Children'sEarly Education Program (HCEEP) in 1968, early intervention became established asa full-fledged movement. Given the history of parent involvement programs in thiscountry, it was no surprise that the importance of involving parents was emphasizedas a key to the success of these programs. Since that time, the importance ofinvolving parents in early intervention programs for children who are disadvantaged,disabled, and at-risk has gained momentum until it has now been established as being 489axiomatic that early intervention programs will be more successful if parents are involved.'One ofthelatest demonstrations of support for the position that parentinvolvement is essential for successful early intervention programs was provided whenCongress passed the 1986 Amendments to the Education of the Handicapped Act (PublicLaw 99-457), which established what amounts to mandated early intervention programsfor all children with disabilities by the year 1991. The committee report, whichdescribes Congress' rationale behind the legislation, states,The committee received overwhelming testimony affirming the family as theprimary learning environment for children under six years of age andpointing out the critical need for parents and professionals to functionina collaborative manner. (From House Report #99-860 as cited inGilkerson, Hilliard, Scharg, & Shonkoff, 1987, p. 20) Thebreadthofsupportforthebenefitsofinvolvingparentsinearlyintervention efforts was noted by White et al. (1985-86) in their analysis of 52previous reviews of the early intervention efficacy literature. White et al. (1985-86, p. 423) reported that the most frequently-drawn conclusion in previous reviews wasthat\"parentalinvolvement isassociatedwithincreasedbenefitsofintervention.\" In spite of the pervasiveness of support for the benefits of parent involvement,it is unclear whether the available research evidence is consistent with frequentlymade claims, or whether opinions concerning the value of involving parents in earlyintervention programs have taken on a \"life of their own,\" and have grown in strengthand breadth asa result of socio-political factors instead of from defensible,consistent, scientific evidence regarding the benefits of such involvement.This secticn provides a detailed analysis of the evidence concerning thebenefits of involving parents in early intervention programs. We begin by discussing 'Even though itwill be discussed more specifically later in this section, itis important to point out here thatthe contention that early intervemion programs will be more successfid if parents are im,olved is very different fromthe conteluion that parents can be effective teachers of their own children. The question addressed by this reportis limited to tlw frequently-stated position that the involvement of parents in existing early intervention progams adds some benefit to the program. 490 the definitions of parent involvement (interestingly, such definition is absent inlegislation such as P.L. 99-457, and is seldom present in the research literature used to support claims about the effectiveness of parent involvement). Next,a summaryisgivenofthe reasons most frequently offered asto why parental involvement is so important. Using the definitions of parent involvement, and the reasons offered for involving parents, we then examine the data concerning the benefits associated with parent involvement, and conclude with recommendations Tor future research and practice. Defining Parent Involvement inEarly Intervention ProgramsIn spite of the pervasiveness of the position that parent involvement is the key to effective early intervention programs, very few previous authors have defined what they mean by parent involvement. Some indication of what is meant can be gleaned from the program descriptions in research studies which have included aparent involvement component; however, these definitions of intervention are oftenvague and were probably never intended to be comprehensive. Furthermore,the definition of parent involvement may well be different depending on whether we aretalking about early intervention with children who are disadvantaged, disabled, or at-risk'.In an effort to define parent involvement, Peterson and Cooper (1989) providedalistofsixdifferentcompohentsthatmaybeinvolvedinparent involvementprogramsassociatedwithearlyinterventionforchildrenwith disabilities.Those components are defined by Peterson and Cooper according to thefollowing needs that parents may experience: 2We make a distinction here between children who are disadvantaged (defined in tenns ofsocioeconomicconditions) and at-risk (defined in tenns ofmedical complications or predisposing factors such as low binhweight,trauma surrounding the birth process, or neonatal complications). Obviously, sonw children who 'neer our definitionof at-risk arc also disadvantaged, but not all children who are disadvantaged are also at-risk according to thisdefinition.We believe itis important to distinguish between children who are disabled, disadvantaged, and at-risk,since the typeofimervention programs, and consequently, the type ofparent involvement, 'nay be very different forchildren in euch ofthese three groups.Of course, there is a great deal ofoverlap in how parent invoNemenl istypically provided to children in each ofthese groups.5' 3 491Information is needed by parents to better understand their child'sdisability, how it will effect development, what special needs itcreates, and how this may alter their role and interaction with thechild.Professional Partnership is often needed by parents to function in themutual problem-solving necessary for caring for, managing, teaching,and integrating the child into ongoing family life.A support network is needed to share feelings, discuss concerns,receiveconstructiveandempatheticresponsestoquestionsandobservations, and enjoy a sense of friendship and camaraderie.Training is needed to help parents care for, stimulate, and teach theirchild with a disability; including training in how to best manage thechild and/or how to engage the child in activities that will promoteoptimal development and learning.Time off or respite care is needed on an intermittent basis to provide\"personal relief\" from the 24-hour demands for care and supervisionoften associated with having a handicapped child.Informal contact with staff is needed for parents to be a part of thetherapeutic and educational programming for their handicapped childwithout feeling overwhelmed by demands being made of them as parents.The six areas of need outlined by Peterson and Cooper (1989) describe the typesof activities tyi cally included to some degree in parent involvement programs, butthey do not refer to the concept of \"empowerment.\" In recent years,the temempowerment has been used frequently to describe the type of parental involvementthat many people believe is most effective in early intervention programs (see Cochran, 1988; Dunst et al., 1988; and Rappaport, 1981). In reality, the notion ofempowerment really focuses more on an attitude towards parents, and the \"balance ofpower\" between parents and professionals. In other words, parents could engage inany of the activities described by Petersen and Cooper (1989) in a situation where empowerment is nurtured or denied. This is clear when one considers the definitionsgiven by leading proponents of empowerment.Empowermentaninteractive process involvino mutual respect and criticalreflection, through which both people and controlling institutions arechangedin ways that provide those people with greater influence overindividuals and institutions that are in some way infloencing their effortsto achieve equal status in society. (Cochran, 1988, p. 72)Empowermentimplies that many competencies are already present or at leastpossible....Empowerment implies that what you see as poor functioning isa result of social structure and lack of resources which make it impossible5( 4 492 for the existing competencies to operate. It implies that in those caseswhere new competencies need to be learned, they are best learned in acontext of living life, rather than in artificial programs where everyone,including the person learning, knows that it is really the expert who isin charge.(Rappaport, 1981, p. 16)As Cochran (1989) points out, empowerment represents an effort to shift the balance of power from being primarily in the hands of professionals to substantially in the hands of the parents. Although empowerment is often discussed as if it were a new approach to parent involvement in early intervention programs, Mindick (1988) points out that it isa concept which has been advocated by some for many, many years.Researchers in other fields, such as Rotter (1966) and Seligman (1975) havelong emphasized the importance of people feeling like they are in control of the situation.In addition, from its inception in 1965, the Head Start program hasemphasized the importance of parental control and participation in governance. Thus,it seems that there are at least two important dimensions which shouldbe considered in defining parent involvement in early intervention programs. The firstisthe type of activities in which parents are engaged or the types ofresources and assistance which are offered to parents and families as a function of parent involvement. Peterson and Cooper's outline is one way of describing those activities.A second dimension is the attitude and context in which those activities are presented. The presence or absence of empowerment as described by Dunst andTrivette (1988) or Cochran (1988) is one way of describing this second important dimension.Since empowerment is defined largely in terms of the attitude with whichprofessionals involve parents, it is extremely difficult to determine from programdescriptions the degree to which empowelment is functioning. Not only are thedescriptions of parent involvement usually quite brief, but one can say that parentsare being empowered because it is the socially acceptable thing to be doing, whenin reality it is the professionals who are retaining total control of the program.The difficulty in determining the degree to which empowerment functions does not in 493any way reduce its potential value, but it does make it difficult to determine the degree to which the concept has value.Although conceptual definitions of parent involvement and discussion of thepotential benefits of empowering parents are useful, they do little to describe howparent involvement programs are typically implemented. To do that, we analyzed thedescriptions of early intervention programs used in172 different intervention studies which were judged to have substantial parent involvemenL components as a partof a comprehensive r,iew of the early intervention efficacy literature being carriedout at the Early Intervention Research Institute at Utah State University (see White, 1986,foradescription of thelarger database from which these studies were identified).Each of these studies was coded as to the way in which parents wereinvolved in the intervention program. As shown in Table 1, the types of parent Table 1Type of Parent Involvement in Early intervention Programs Parent as Therapist:Parent/Child RelationS.Sensory StimulationParent as Classroom Aides.

Piagatian Stages, motormilestones, psychological states, etc.) ( 494involvement used in past research can be divided into two broad categories: (I)programs where the parent was used in some way to provide assistance to the child;and (2) programs where some sort of assistance was provided to the parent or otherfamily members. Within in each of these broad categories, more specific types ofparent involvement can be identified. Each of the 10 types of involvement shown in Table 1 were present, alone or in combination with others, in past research studies.For each study included in our analysis, a judgment was made as to what the primaryfocus of parent involvement was in that particular study. For example, consid astudy where parents were trained to provide daily physical therapy to their childwith specific routines, behavioral objectives, and evaluation criteria; in additionto being invited to a parent support group which met once each month. Such a studywould be coded as having a primary focus of using parents as therapists, with thesupplementary aspect of providing emotional support to the parents. Figure I shows the percentage of the 172 studies included in this analysis whichused each type of parent involvement. As can be svc, using parents as therapists wasby farthe most frequent way in which past researchhasdefined parentinvolvement.In other words, in 80% of the studies we analyzed, parents were usedas therapists as either the sole focus or as the major focus of a parent involvementprogram which involved several other components. Assistance to the parents or otherfamily members was seldom the major focus of parent involvement proyrams. Thispattern was consistent whether the studies were done with children who arc disabled,at-risk, or disadvantaged.Regardless of which conceptual or theoretical definitions of parent involvementassociated with early interv-ntion are currently in vogue, the actual practice ofparent involvement establishes the context for deciding whether there are benefitsassociated with involving parents in early intervention programs. Based on thisanalysis of why parents are actually involved in the early intervention programsreported in the literature, we next consider the ways in which it has been suggestedthat parent involvement can be beneficial..7f?: 100 90 802. 1)70 60 35024 0 30 20 to Parents/Family Figure 1.Frequency With Which Different Types of Parent Involvement are used in Research Studies.J 496Why is it important to Involve Parentsin Early Intervention Programs?Using the discussion by Peterson and Cooper (1989) of the needs addressed byinvolving parents in early intervention programs in conjunction with our analysisof the ways in which parents were actually involved in the 172 research studiesreferred to above, we have identified six rationales that are frequently offered asto why itis important to involve parents. These rationales are summarized belowwithout any intent of judging which one is most appropriate.Parents are responsible for the welfare of their children. Mostparents want to have a voice in how their child is educated since theyare ultimately responsible for the well being and welfare of the child.Some argue that even if they wanted to relinquish that responsibilityto schools or government agencies, they should not be allowed to doso.Involved parents provide better political support and advocacy. Someclaim thatifparents are knowledgeable about early interventionprograms and have first-!land information about how they operate andhave observed the associated benefits, they will be in a much betterposition t..)advocate for the further growth and support of thoseprograms.Those who take this position argue that even if programshave very good evidence of benefiting children, itis absolutelyessentialin times of fiscal restraint to make sure that a broadconstituency understands and supports the continued growth and fundingof those programs.Early intervention programs which involve parents are more effective.It is often alleged that by involving the family, which is where thechild spends the majority of his or her time, the benefits of earlyintervention programs can be reinforced and strengthened. Som' peoplealso believe that the first years of a child's life are the mostcritical for learning and development; consequently, the parents arein a unique position to provide the child with appropriate interventionduring this time. According to this position, parent involvement isparticularly important if the possibility exists that parents mightunknowingly be working at cross-purposes with the professionals in theearly intervention program.By involving parents, the same outcome can be achieved at less cost.Early intervention requires a great deal of smull group or one-to-oneintervention time. Such services can be very expensive. If parentscan be used to de:iver a portion of the services, it is often suggestedthat the costs of early intervention can be dramatically reduced.The benefits of early intervention are maintained better if parentsare involved.Many people believe that early intervention cannot besuccessful unless a systematic effort is made to reinforce and buildupon the benefits which are achieved during the initial program. Itisoften argued that thebest way to systematically continue to5' i o 497 reinforce these benefits is to use parents, since they are the onlyones who will be consistently involved with the child. Responsibili-ties of agencies may change, the family may move, funding may be cut,but the child will always be a member of his/her family.Parent involvement provides benefits to Parents and family members aswell as the c ild. By helping parents to understand their child'scurrent situation and potential, and to understand how to manage theirchild's needs and demands, it is often claimed that parents will havereduced levels of stress, more satisfaction, and a more realisticperception of what is possible and desirable. Participation in earlyintervention programs also exposes parents to other agencies andservices which may be useful to them in other aspects of their life. If parent involvement is advocated as an essential part of early interventitm programs because of a conviction that parents are ultimately responsible for the welfare of their children, or because the program is trying to build an advocacy network to strengthen political and community support; then evidence concerning the benefits for children or parents of .such involvement is irrelevant.If, however, parent involvement is being done because it is believed that there are benefits for participating children or parents, or that the same benefit can be achieved at lesscost, or that benefits are more likely to be sustained over time;thenitis essential to evaluate the available evidence to iecide whether such claims can be supported.Such evidence is considered next. Evidence Concerning the Benefits of ParentInvolvement In Early Intervention ProgramsThree sources of information are useful in decid;ng whether currently available evidencesupportsclaimsaboutthebenefitsofparentinvolvement inearly intervention programs. As mentioned earlier, dozens of previous reviews have concluded that parent involvement is beneficial. How strong is the evidence from those reviews? Also, hundreds of early intervention studies have been done. If thosestudieswhichinvolvedparentstypicallyfindstrongereffectsforparticipating children and families than those studies wrich do not,it would provide some evidence in support of the benefits of involving parents. Third, a fewstudies have made direct comparisons of the effects of involving parents vs. not 5 :1 498involving parents in early intervention programs. How good is the evidence from these studies? The evidence from each of these sources is considered next.Conclusions of previous reviewers. Virtually all previous reviewers who haveexamined the benef.4 of involving parents in early intervention programs haveconcluded that parent involvement is valuable (see White et al., 1985-86, for a summary of these reviewers' conclusions). An important question is whether theeviderce on which tse conclusions are based is credible. To Inswer this question, we selected wdely-cited reviews of the early intervention efficacy literature which have specifically addressed the issue of parental involvement. The reviews includethose written by Bronfenbrenner (1974), the Comptroller General (1979),Datta (1971), Floren & Dokekc (1983), Karnes and Lee (1978), and Lazar and Darlington .1,1982).3The conclusions of these reviewers regarding parent involvement are notablyconsistent, as indicated below.Without family involvement, intervention is likely to be unsuccessfut, andwhat faw effects are achieved are likely to disappear once the interventionis discontinued. (Bronfenbrenner, 1974, p. 300)The most effective programs are those where the child participates at avery young age, ald where parents are closely involved in the programs.(Comptroller General, 1979, p. 30)Parents should be deeply invclved in the design and implementation of localprograms.(Datta, 1971, p. 67)We fould a cluster of five interrelated program chara(Aeristics relatedto positive outcomes....Direct participation by parents--the more thebetter.(Lazar & Darlington, 1982, p. 305)The results from objective measures of school achieement have not beenconsistentinallareas; however, one can conclude on the basis of alimited sample that parent education programs can improve children'sability to meet the minimal requirements of schools. (Florin & Dokecki,1983, p. 43)Parents and other family members play a significant role in promoting,reinforcing, and sustaining gains made during the preschool years. To 3Although Lazar and Darlington (1982) is really not a review of the literature, itis widely cited in otherdocuments as being a review. Actually, it is a report of a consortium of longitudinal studies which collaborated inpooling much of their data to aOress si!iiilar issues. h is included in this group of reviews because it is widely citedas a review, and is more i.t.e a rc..iew than it is like an individual rese2rch study. 499 prevent the handicapped child's regression to a lower stage of development,parent involvement is a must....No program for young handicapped childrencan be considered exemplary unless parents are actively involved. (Karnes& Lee, 1978, p. 14, 19) Asis evidenced from these conclusions, most statements about the value of parent involvement in early intervention are apparently not intended to address theissue of whether parents can be successful teachers oftheir children. Most statements about the value of parert involvement in early intervention programs, including these, imply that some type of program already exists, and that the addition of a parent involvement component will result in the program being more effective than if the parent involvemeat component had not been added.Although it may well be true that parents can be effective teachers of their children, that is a different issue than whether or not early intervention programs are more effective if parents are involved. T'..e issue of whether parents can be effective teachers of t:leir children is specifically not addressed by our analysis.To examine the crvdibility of evide ce on which conclusions of these six reviewers regarding benefits of involving pareas were based, we identified original research studies which were cited in support of the conclusions about parent involve- ment in each of the reviews. Research studies cited by each review are listed in Table 2.As can be seen, tha number of studies cited in support of the conclusion that parent involvement is beneficial for early intervention programs ranged from 14 in the Comptroller General's (1979) report to zero in Datta's (1971) report.We nExt obtained each of the studies cited by these reviewers to determinewhether the evidence from these studies supported the claims regarding the benefitsof parent involvement in early intervention programs. Table 3 shows the results of this analysis which suggests that the conclusions of these reviewers should be viewed with caution.For example, only three of the studies, two of whici: were judged tobe of poor methodological quality, involved a direct test of whether an early intervention prociram is more effective when parents are involved than when they arenot involved (Gilmer, Miller, & Gray, 1970; Karnes Citedby Prominent Reviewersin Support of theConclusion that Parent involvement Contributes to More Effective EarlyIntervention Programs Reviewers Florin & ComptrollerBronfenbrenner KarnesDokeckiGeneralDataLazarBeller Parent Gray & Klaus (1970)The XXXXX Gray & Ruttle (1978)The Family OrientedVisiting Program XKames et (11069)The (1975)National Home StartEvaluation XMiller & Bond. al.

Only one of the three studies which included a direct test of the hypothesis found a positive effectassociated with involving parents, and Karnes et al. (1970) and Radin (1972) found that children who participated in the group involving parents more actually performedworse than the children participating in the group that did not involve parents or involved them only to a minor degree. The methodological weaknesses in all of these studieslimits the credibility of these results. However,if the results were accepted at face value (which is not something we would advocate), they would suggestthat parent involvement has mixed results--more often negative than positive.Three additional studies cited in Table 3 provided an indirect test of thehypothesis that early intervention is more effective if parents are involved (Love et al.,1976; Miller & Dyer, 1975; Sprigle, 1974). In these studies, two or more alternative types of early intervention programs were compared. The test is indirectbecause the alternative intervention strategies varied in more ways than just thepresence or absence of a parental involvenAt component For example, Miller and Dyer(1975)comparedtheeffectsofparticipating inaBereiter-Englemann, Montessori,DARCEE,or traditional early intervention program. Only the DARCEEprogram (modeled after the work of Gray and Ruttle, 1976) involved a substantialparent involvement component. Theindirect test of the hypothesis that parentinvolvement is beneficial comes from a comparison of the results from the DARCEEprogram to the results of the other three programs. The reason itis an indirecttest is because it is impossible to sort out 0,hether any differences between groups onoutcomemeasuresareattributable tothepresenceorabsenceofparent 503 involvement,or to other differences among the programs such as philosophicalapproach, class size, or other aspects of the curriculum. In the Miller and Dyer (1975) study, those children in the group which involved parents actually did worse than children in the other three groups. In the Sprigle (1974) study, children in the group with parent involvement did substantially better, whereas in the Love et al. (1976) there was no difference between the groups. Theother14studiescitedbythesereviewers provide little,ifany, information on the question of whether early intervention is more effective if parents are involved. Five of the studies provide evidence that children in acenter-based intervention which involves parents perform better than children whoreceive no intervE 41on; four of the studies provide evidence that children who participate in early intervention programs delivered primarily by their parents do better than children who receive no intervention; and five of the studies did not even involve parents.It is also important to note that none of the studies cited by these particular reviewers even examined whether any alleged effects for children are maintained overtime or whether there were benefits for other family members. Furthermore, none ofthem provide evidence that it is more cost-effective to involve parents in early intervention programs. In fact, only two of the studies even collected data aboutcosts (Love et al., 197; Weikart et al., 1978), and neither of these directly addressed the cost-benefit issue of parent involvement. It is also interesting to note that all of these studies were conducted with children who are disadvantaged,even though some of the reviewers drew conclusions about children who are disabled.Whether the results of studies with children who are disadvantaged would even applyto children who are disabled is debatable. Given the severe developmental lags,management problems, and stress associated with having children with disabilitiesas compared to children who are disadvantaged, it would seem that the effectivenessof a particular type of parent involvement program might vary substantially for 504 children who are disadvantaged or disabled. Finally, it is instructive to consider the nature of the parent involvement in those 15 studies which involved parents in a substantial way. As can be seen in Table 3, all but one of the studies focusedprimarily on using parents as therapists, and almost no effort was made in these studies to assist parents or other family members.The fact that the majority of past research has focused only children who aredisadvantaged, has been of relatively poor methodological quality, and has implicitlydefined parent involvement only as using the parent as a supplemental therapistshould make us more cautious about the conclusions of previous reviewers that involvingparents willresultinmore effective early intervention programs. Irrespective of thesecaveats,theinformation inthe studies cited by these reviewers does not support the position that parent involvement contributes to moreeffective early intervention programs in any of the four ways cited earlier (i.e.,benefits for children, better maintenance of effects, the same effects at less cost,or benefits for family members).Are early intervention programs which involve parents more effective than thosethat do not?Hundreds of studies have compared the effects of some type of earlyintervention program to a no-treatment control group. One source of information which may explain why so many people believe that it is beneficial to involve parentsin early intervention programs may come from comparisons of the results of all ofthe intervention vs. no intervention studies which involved parents to the results of all of the intervention vs. no intervention studies which did not involve parents.This can be done by examining the average effect size of such intervention vs. nointervention studies for those studies where parents were involved and those studieswhere parents were notinvolvedintheintervention. Ifparentinvolvementcontributes to more effective early intervention programs, one would expect theaverage effect size for studies involving parents to be larger than the averageeffect size for studies which did not involve parents. 9 505Evidence of this nature is available in a data base at the Early InterventionResearch Institute at Utah State University which describes the characteristics ofprevious studies of early intervention effectiveness. Over 350 different studieshave been collected; each of the studies has been analyzed with respect to the natureof the intervention that was implemented, the characteristics of participatingchildren and families, the methodological quality of the study, the type of outcomemeasureswhich werecollected,andtheresultsofeachstudydefinedasa standardized mean different erfect size. One of the variables coded for each studywas the degree to which parents were involved in the early intervention program.Table 4 reports the average effect size for 193 intervention vs. no interventionstudies of center-based programs--some of which involved parents and some of which did not.Of course, the validity of such a comparison depends on the assumption thatall other variables that might have affected outcomes are equally balanced betweenthe two groups. For example, suppose that the earlier a child starts an earlyintervention program, the larger the effect of the program will be (a widely-heldassumption about early intervention). If most of those programs which had extensiv..1parent involvement also started earlier, then there might be an apparent advantagefor programs with extensive parent involvement which is really attributable to thefact that the children started earlier. We have checked for the presence of suchconfounding for the data in Table 4 and have found none (see White et al., 1985-86,for a more detailed explanation of this analysis). However, with so many differentvariables that are possibly related to the effects of early intervention, itisdifficult to be sure that such confounding does not exist. Thus, one must view thesedata with caution. Inspite of the possibility of confounds, these data areimportant to examine because of the possibility that they may be the source of thewidely-held be'ief that parent involvement leads to more effective early intervention programs.

Averages based on less than four studies (those for at-risk childrenand those for handicapped children where parents were involved to a minordegree or not at all) are not reported. there is no ddvantage for those home-based programs in which parents are more heavily involved.For children with disabilities, there was not sufficient information tomake sucha comparison,since very few studies of home-based intervention withchildren with disabilities have been done in which parents were not extensively involved.In summary, we can find no evidence that intervention vs. no interventionstudies which have involved parents are any more effective than similar studies whichdo not involve parents. Furthermore, we have found no evidence to suggest thatprograms which involve parents are any more cost-effective or mainAin benefits any 508 more thanthose that do notinvolve parents. Admittedly,the potential for confounding variables to obscuretruerelationships in a data set of this nature is great.Furthermore, as shown by the data reported earlier in Figure 1, most of these studies havefocused prime.ily or evenexclusively on using parents astherapists instead ofinvolving themin other ways. Thus,it would beinappropriate to conclude, based on these data, that parentinvolvement inearly intervention is not beneficial.Just as important, however, is the need to make aclear statement that no evidenceexists in this type of data to argue that parentinvolvement in early intervention will lead to any ofthe benefitsthat are oftenclaimed for children or families.Experimentalmanipulation of the effects ofparent involvement. The best information about the effectsof parentinvolvement comes from the limited number ofstudies which haveexperimentally addressedtheissueofvhetherearly intervention will be more effective if parents are involved.In other words,within the same study, some children were in a group with parentinvolvement, and others were in a group without parent involvement.Such studies can be categorized as to whether the degree of parentinvolvement is the only variablewhich isexperimentally manipulated (what we will refer to as a direct comparison), or whetherparent involvement is one of severalvariables (e.g., setting, age-at-start, nature of curriculum materials) which distinguish between the two groups (what we will refer to aF anindirect comparison).An example of a direct comparison would be a study in whichchildren in a center-based program which includes parent involvement are compared to childrenin the same center-based programwithout parent involvement.In this case,the presence or absenceof parentinvolvement is the only variablewhich differentiates the independent variable for the two groups of children.An indirectcomparison would be one where parents are moreheavily involved in the one group thanii theother 5IN.;4' 509 group, but there are also other differences between the two groups. For example, Barnett, Escobar, and Ravsten (1987) reported a study which compared a home- based intervention with parents acting as the child's therapist vs. a center-based intervention where speech therapists provided the intervention. In this case, it is difficult to know whether the differences between the groups is attributable to the fact that parents were more heavily involved in one group than the other, whether it was the setting in which the intervention took place (home vs. center), or whether it was the differences in the curriculum used in each of the groups.Table 6 summarizes all of the direct and indirect comparisons of degree of parent involvement we have been able to locate.As can be seen, there are 16 differentstudiesforchildrenwithdisabilities, 13forchildrenwhoare disadvantaged, and 2 for children who are at risk. We believe that the information from the indirect comparisons is so confounded with other variables that there is little, if any, information which is useful in determining whether it is beneficial tc involve parents in intervention programs. Nonetheless, since these studies are sometimes cited in the support of involving parents in early intervention programs, we thought it was important to include them, even though we believe the information is of little use. The important information comes from those studies in which a direct comparison is made.As can be seen in Table 6, there are no good quality studies with children with disabilities.Two studies (Barnett et al., 1987; Henry, 1977) which were judged to be fair methodologically, found small to moderate benefits associated with parent involvement.The Barnettetal.(1987)study was with children with speech impairments.The largest effects were found by Henry (1977) who added a parent astherapist component to one group of children in a daycare program while the other children continued to receive just the daycare. This is quite different from moststudies of early intervention since the children were not already enrolled in a comprehensive center-based early intervention program.

Whereas,addinga parent involvementcomponent to a good center-based early intervention program has little effects onchiidren because they are already making most of the developmental growth they arecapable of making as a result of the center-based program. Other stud;es withchildren with disabilities were judged to be of poor methodological quality 3nd foundeffects ranging from small to large.For children who are disadviditaged, we could find only one good-quality studyand one fair-quality study in which a direct comparison was made of the effect, ofinvolving parents in early intervention programs. !loth othese (Casto & White,1987; Radin, 1971) used parents primarily as therapists for their children. Bothfound that children participating in early intervention programs without parentinvolvement actually did better than those participating in programs with parent involvement.Although the information from studies of lower methodological qualityis less useful, it is not inconsistent with the results of the two studies of bettermethodological quality. In other words, of the seven other comparisons, three findnegative effect sizes, two relatively small benefits, and two moderately largebenefits associated with involving parents in early intervention programs. Again,almost all of the studies with children who are disadvantaged have used parents astherapistsfortheirchildrenratherthanprovidingotherformsofparentinvolvement. Conclusions Although there is broad-based consensus that early intervention programs whichinvolve parents will be more effective than those programs which do not, there isremarkably little evidence for this position. The evidence cited by prominentreviewers of the early intervention research literature is largely contradictory or J._0 512irrelevant to the hypothesis that programs will be more effective if parents are involved.Average effect sizes of treatment vs. no treatment studiesin which parents arr.. involved are about the same as the average effect sizes of treatment vs. no treatment studies in which parents are. not involved.Finally, the results of direct comparis3ns for children who are disadvantaged and disabled suggest that the benefits of involving parents in early intervention programs, at least in the way they have been involved heretofore, is non-existent or very small.Unfortunately, much of the data to date comes from studies of relatively poormethodological quality, and the type of parent involvement about which we haveresults from experimental studies is limited almost exclusively to those programswhere the primary type of parent involvement was to use them as therapists for their children.There is relatively good data that the use of p7rs.ints as therapists fortheir children ha!,negligible benefits for children with moderate tosevere disabilities already participating in a center-based early intervention program.For children with speech impairments, there is some evidence, although it is verylimited at this point, that a parent involvement component may have some additional benefits.For children whc are disadvantaged, less high-quality data is available,but the best studies suggest that the addition of parent involv ent to existingearly intervention programs, at least as parent involvement has been efined in past research, is of no benefit. For children who are at risk, little research concerningparent involvemeAt has been done, and no direct comparisons of the benefits ofinvolving parents could be found.Our conclusion from all of the veceding data is that persuasion and politicsabout the benefits of parent involvement in early intervention programs have gonefar beyond the available scientific evidence. It may well be that certain types ofparent involvement contribute to more effective early intervention programs forchildren who are disabled, disadvantaged, and at-risk. To date, however, we can findno credible scientific support for benefits of the nature described by prominent 513 researchers, policy makers, or administrators. More specifically, there isno evidence that the type of parent involvement used in past research studies has led to greater benefits for children, most cost-efficient programs, better maintenance of effects, or benefits for other family members.The factthat existinglaws mandate the involvement of parentsin early 4Romiintervention programs for children who are disabled and at-risk does not mean that we should notcontinue to examine what types of parentinvolvement are most benaficial for children and families. It may be that the best type of parent involvement for children with disabilities is to provide respite care, invitationsto a support group, and the involvement of parents in developing their child's Individualized Educational Program. Alternatively,it may be that more active involvement is necessary to accomplish the types of benefits that many people have claimed are associated with parent involvement.The studies of parent involvement included inthe Longitudinal Studies are designed to address the issues raised by the analysis of previous research. We have focused primarily on experimental manipulations which involve parents in the way they have been used most extensively in previous research (i.e., primarily as therapists with some emphasis on emotional support and knowledge of child development). In the remainder of this section, we present the results of five studies which investigated issues related to involving parents in early intervention programs. 11Also included in this section is a sixth study which compared the effects ofusing different modes of communication (Total vs Oral) for preschoolers with hearing impairments.Since this study is unique in many ways, it contains its own review as a part of the report. Des Moines 514DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLSProject #12 COMPARISON: Mi ldly to Severely Handicapped Children -- interventionplus parent involvement vs. center-based intervention onlyLOCAL CONTACT PERSON: Pat Hollinger, School Parentinvolvement isoften con- sideredanimportantpartofearlyintervention programs for young childrenwith disabilities. This belief is sostrong that ithasbeenincorporated intothelawmandatingservicesfor theseyoungchildren(P.L.99-457).Unfortunately, the empirical support forthis beliefis not as clear as one might assume based on the P.L. 99-457 mandate(White et al., 1989). Concerns have been raised regarding the efficacy of parentinvolvement in general and, specifically, to what types of parent involvement aremost beneficial to children and tamilies (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; White, Taylor,& Moss, 1989). This study examined the effects of adding one particular type of parentinvolvementtoan existing center-based early intervention program forchildren with disabilities. The type of parent involvement program investigated asa part of this study included weekly parent meetings which focused on: a) training Des Moines 515 parents to work with their children on skills/behaviors, b) educating parents in various topics, and 3) providing support to parents in the form of parent groups and assistance in accessing available resources. Review of Related ResearchThe issue of parent involvement in early intervention has been a subject of many reviews of literature (Bronfenbrenner, 1974; 1982).These reviews have almost unequivocally stated the necessity of involving parents in early intervention for their child. In examining the research studies cited by these reviews, Whiteet al. (1989) found that the individual results did not support the conclusions of the reviews.White et al. raised further concerns by concluding that the researchcited in these reviews had focused only on children who are disadvantaged, were of relatively poor methodological quality, and had defined parental involvement only as using the parent as a supplemental therapist.White et al. (1989) raised two concerns that are relevant to this study. (1) Whataretheeffectsofparentinvolvementprogramsonyoungchildren with disabilities and on their families? (2) What is the most effective way to defineand implement parent involvement programs for parents of children with disabilities? White et al. provided some information regarding the first question. Using data thathadbeenpreparedforameta-analysis ofearlyintervention(Casto&Mastropieri, 1986), White et al. compared effect sizes from 89 studies that usedchildren with disabilities as subjects. All these studies included some type of parent involvement. These studies were divided into two categories for analysis:studies that included extensive/moderate parent involvement and those that includedlittle/no parent involvement. The results of this analysis were equivocal withrespect to degree of parent involvement (i.e., more parent involvement was notnecessarily better). Itsh:luld be mace clear that not all these studies were 0rsr30 Des Moines 516examining parent involvement, only that these studies included parent involvement and the parent involvement could be coded.Studies (from the above analyses) that specifically investigated the effect of parentalinvolvementin early intervention for children with disabilities were individuallyexamined.Unfortunately, themajority ofthesewereindirect comparison, confounded by differences in the interventions being compared. Only five studies were found, other than those being conducted by EIRI, that directly comparedparent involvement eiith no parent involvement (Barnett et al., 1987; Henry, 1978; Miller, 1981; Minor et al., 1983; Scherzer et al., 1976). Although all these studies report positive effects of parent involvement, research methodology problems existed. In all these studies, parents were trained to provide some type of therapy.In regard to the second question raised earlier, parent involvement has beendefined by Peterson and Cooper (1989).They delineate six aspects of parentinvolvement programs: (1) information provision, (2) professional partnership, (3)support network, (4) training, (5) respite care, and (6) informal contact with staff.Although these aspects may overlap, studies primarily focus on a single aspect.Additionally, different parent involvement foci require different types of data for evaluation.Gatling and White (1987), in a review of 172 parent involvement studies,found that over 80% of studies focus on parent training (i.e., training parents toact as an intervenor or therapist for their children) as either the sole or major focus of the parent involvement program. This focus requires data on child outcomesto gauge effectiveness.Another issue that has been overlooked in the majority of research on parentinvolvement are issues related to changes that may occur in the family. If using anecologicalmodel(Bronfenbrenner, 1979;Dunst,1986),parentinvolvementactivities may affect aspects of family functioning that may impact on the child'slater development and functioning (see Blacker, 1984; Kaiser & Fox, 1986), even Des Moines 517 though immediate child effects may not occur. For example, families of children withdisabilities are likely to be highly stressed (Gallagher, Beckman, & Cross, 1983)and in possible need of assistance to continue functioning as a \"normal\" family unit. Parent involvement activities may reduce this stress. Unfortunately, research onthe efficacy of parent involvement programs have not included the assessment ofpossible impact on family functioning.As emphasized by the preceding brief review, there are a variety of unclearefficacy issues surrounding parent involvement that require examination. Problems in the parent involvement literature include equivocal effects from studies examiningdifferent levels of parent involvement on child developmental progress. Few studies have occurred that are free of treatment confounds, and methodological problems makethe results of these studies suspect. Parent involvement has not been clearlydefined across studies; although training the parent to act as an intervenor/therapist for their child is the most common intervention. Finally, most studies have failed to examine family functioning variables. The present study was designed to address these concerns in evaluating the effects of one particular type of parent involvement program. Overview of StudyThe primary curriculum for the parent attended meetings (Parents Involved inEducation [PIE]; Pezzino & Lauritzen, 1986) was structured to include that componentthat had been used most frequently in past research (i.e., training parents as anintervenor/therapist for their child). Providing parents with information and parentsupport issues were also included in the PIE, but the primary focus was on teaching parentstoprovide supplemental therapytotheir children with disabilities.Interventions similar tothePIEarecommonly offered asanadditiontoanestablished early intervention program (Gatling & White, 1987). The present studyapproached the question of parent involvement by comparing the PIE as a supplement Des Moines 518 to a center-based intervention program versus the effects of the center-based program without the PIE. This study assessed the impact of these nterventions on both child progress and family functioning across the time the intervention was in effect, and longitudinally.In addition,this study investigated the issue of whether parent-attendedmeetings with a training (PIEI)or support-oriented (PIE II) focus were more efficacious (cf., White et al., 1989). Parent support as an appropriate focus for parentinterventionactivitiesisreceivingattentionandinterestinrecent literature (e.g., Dunst, 1986; Hanline & Knowlton, 1988; Zeitlin & Williamson, 1988).No comparative information exists on the effect of a parent support intervention onchildren and families. To providesomepreliminaryinformation,parents who participated in PIE and whose children remained in the early intervention programfor a second year participated in an intervention focused on parent support (PIE II;Durbala & Hollinger, 1988). Results from parents and children involved in PIE IIwill allow comparisons to be made between those receiving intervention plus PIE andthose receiving center-based intervention only, as well as comparisons of thosereceiving both PIE and PIE II. Methods Subjects participating in this study were served through the Des Moines Public School System. The Des Moines public schools serve all children with disabilitiesin the Des Moines School District from birth through 6 years of age. (The State ofIowa has had a law mandating a free and appropriate public education to childrenwith disabilities from birth through 5 since 1975.) Children with disabilities inthe Des Moines Public Schools ages 0-2 are typically served through home-basedintervention programs, while preschoolers with disabilities, ages 3-6, typicallyreceive intervention services in center-based (classroom) settings. The general 53 3 Des Moines 519philosophy of the Des Moines Public Schools is to provide high-quality educationalservices that maximize each child's individual potential. Programs are developed basedoncomprehensive individualassessmentsconductedbymembersofa multidisciplinary team. Parents are required to participate in the development ofIndividualized Education Plans.Subjects participating in this study were served at the Phillips, Findley, andPerkins schools. This represents three of many schools in the Des Moines PublicSchool System in which preschoolers with disabilities are served. These specific schools were selected because teachers and professional support staff (psychologists,speech therapists, occupational therapists, social workers) who work in these schoolswere interested in conducting this research study in collaboration with EIRI. Theliaison at the Des Moines site who was responsible for coordinating the day-to-dayactivities of the research study was a school psychologist employed by the schooldistrict who had responsibilities at eac:, of the three participating locations. Subjects.The subjects enrolled inthis project can be divided into twodistinct cohorts (see Figure 12.1). Cohort #1 consisted of those subjects enrolledduring the 1986/87 academic year. There were 56 subjects in this cohort (30 control,26 experimental), 40 of whom were male. The subjects ranged in age from 35 to 72months at the time they became involved in the research. Cohort #2 consisted ofthose subjects newly enrolled during the 1987/88 academic year. There were 20subjects in this cohort (12 control, 8 experimental), 15 of whom were male. The ageof subjects in this cohort ranged from 36 to 72 months when intervention began. Asubgroup of the first cohort consisted of those subjects who participated in theresearch for2 years.This subgroup consisted of 34subjects (15 control, 19experimental), 22 of whom were male. These subjects ranged in age from 35 to 61months when their participation began. Intervention Fall 86Spring 87 Fall 87Spring 88 Spring 89Spring 90 Pr?. Post 1.

Posttest #1 included all subjects from the 1986/87 and subjects newly enrolled from tha 1987/88 academic years (see Figure 12.1). All subjects had received one year of intervention at Posttest #1.This group was comprised of 76 subjects (42 control, 34 experimental), 55 of whom were male. These subjects ranged in age from 35 to 72 months at the time they beganparticipation intheresearch.Approximately 75%ofthesesubjects demonstrated a developmental delay of unknown etiology characterized primarily by cognitive and language impairments. The degree of disability for all subjects ranged from severe to mild. The majority of subjects were mild to moderately delayed, 55%had developmental quotients (based on the BDI Total score) below 65.Posttest #2 includes subjects who continued in the early intervention program(19 control, 15 experimental) and subjects who \"graduated\" to 3chool-age programs. Subjects who continued in the program are those who were referred to earlier as the subgroup of the first cohort. The degree of disability for these subgroup subjectsvaried, and 60% had developmental quotients (based on the BDI Total Score) below 65.Approximately 70% of these subjects demonstrated a developmental delay of unknownetiology characterized primarily by cognitive impairments.At Posttest #3, all subjects had \"graduated\" from the intervention program asdefined by the research project. At Posttest #3, approximately 75% of the subjectswere in elementary school programs. The remaining subjects were in the preschool intervention program. No parent involvement activities, other than those described later in the center-only program, were provided.Posttest #4 currently includes information for 51 subjects from Cohort #1.Cohort #2 children will not be eligible for Posttest #4 until Spring 1991, becauseof staggered enrollment dates. All Posttest #4 children were in elementary school programs. r 4.7 Des Moines 522 Recruitment.Parents of children in participating schools who were scheduled for preschool placement at the beginning of the academic year were considered for inclusion in the study if the following criteria were met: (a) One parent was notworking or the parent could guarantee time off from work (this was done to help ensure parents had time available to attend parent meetings): and (b) the child was not profoundly retarded (preschool program staff were of the opinion that the needsof parents of these children would not be best met through the PIE).Parents ofchildren at the participating schools who met these criteria were individually approached by preschool program staff. Preschool staff described the research anddetailed parent and staff requirements. Placementinstudy group by random assignment procedures was described. If interested, parents returned an informed consent letter that clarified their requirements for participation, research staffobligations, and stated that assignment to groups would be randomly determined. Approximately 95% of the parents who were approached regarding the research agreed to participate.Assignment to groups. Subjects who met the criteria for inclusion were randomlyassigned to one of two treatment groups prior to the initiation of treatment, either to a group in which parents received the PIE (Center + PIE) or to a group in whichparents received no additional involvement other than what was provided to all parents through the center-based program (Center Only). Both groups continued toreceive the same level of center-based services that were previously availablethrough the school's program for preschoolers with disabilities.To increase the probability of having comparable groups, subjects were randomlyassigned to groups after being stratified as follows. Within each of the teachers' classes, subjects were categorized according to chronological age (35-42 months, 43-54 months, and over 55 months) and level of parent motivation (either \"high\" or\"low\") as perceived by each child's teacher. Categorizing subjects in this way53S Des Moines 523resulted in subjects falling into one of six mutually exclusive categories. Withineach of the six categories, subjects were rank ordered from low to high based ontheir scores on the CAPER (Continuum of Assessment Programming, Evaluation, andResources; Carran, 1983). The CAPER, a teacher-administered test of developmentalfunctioning, was administered by school personnel at an earlier date.After subjects were categorized, they were alternately assigned to one of the two conditions. Group determination of the first-listed subject (the subject with the lowest CAPER score) in each age by motivation category was accomplished randomly.Additional subjects within the same category were then alternately assigned to groupsbased on randomly predetermined sequences. Subjects that participated for 2 yearsremained in the originally assigned group.DemoaraehiC characteristics. Demographic characteristics are described belowfor subjects participating in each of the posttests. Seventy-six subjects receivedone year of intervention (Posttest #1). Subjects for this study represented a fairlyhomogenous sample (see Table 12.1). The majority of subjects were Caucasian maleswith one sibling. The parents of the subjects were in their late 20s or early 30sand had a high school education. The majority of subjects' families were intact,in that both parents lived at home; and traditional, in the sense that the motherwas the primary caregiver. English was the primary language for all families.Family income placed the families as lower to middle class.Table 12.1 presents data for subjects who received one year of intervention bygroup on demographic characteristics. Some discrepancies between the Center-Onlyand Center + PIE groups are indicated. Mothers of subjects in the Center + PIE grouptended to be older than mothers of subjects in the Center-Only group, and they alsohad higher levels of education. Fathers of Center + PIE subjects were much morelikely to hold occupations placing them in higher SES categories. In addition,household income for families of subjects in the Center + PIE group tended to behigher than that for Center-Only subjects' families. Thus,in spite of the random5 3C.

Variables where such discrepancies occurred were considered as covariates in later analyses.On measures that present demographic information on fathers, data are presented from a smaller \"n\" than many other variables. This can be partly attributed to data collection methods. Mothers were the primary providers of demographic and family functioning measures. In the majority of cases where \"father data\" was not obtained, it was not obtained from families where the father was not living at home. Table 12.1 also presents demographic data on subjects who received Posttest #2, Posttest #3 and Posttest #4. In each case, there was some additional attrition from thestudy.Differences between groups noted earlier rv.:nerally continued from posttest to posttest, suggesting a slight bias in favor of the Center + PIE group. Attrition.Of 86 subjects who received some intervention, 10 dropped from the study; all were experimental subjects. For control subjects, attrition was defined as the child withdrawing fromhintervention after having received a minimum of three months of intervention. All experimental group attrition was related to parent inability to attend parent training meetings and their expressed desire to be removed from the study. Attrition for the PIE group WA% defined as the parent indicating that he/she was not interested in continued participation in the research project or withdrawal for any reason after PIE sessions had begun. This differs from the case where the parent attended PIE meetings infrequently, but did not express a desire to be removed from the study. As a result of this attrition, 76 subjects completed one year of intervention.No attrition has occurred with those subjects enrolled in intervention for two consecutive years or from Cohort #2 subjects. Of those subjects who \"graduated\" intothe school-age program, six were lost to attrition during Posttest #2, Five were center-only subjects, and one was a Center + PIE subject. In the Center-only group, 544 Des Moines 527one family chose to discontinue participation, one family had moved, one child hadrecently been institutionalized and permission to test was not obtained, and theparents of tNo children refused testing at that time. In the Center + PIE group, the parent of the child refused testing at that time.Eight subjects were lost to attrition at Posttest #3 (total n = 68). Five of these subjects were from the Center-only group, and three were from the Center + PIE group.fhe reasons for not testing the Center-only subjects were the same as at Postte;t #2.In the Center + PIE group, the parents of two children refused testing,and one child could not be located. Once again, none of the Cohort #2 subjects were1ost to attrition.At Posttest #4, 51 subjects have been tested. Only 5 children from Cohort #1 were unavailable for testing. All these were Center-only subjects and were the samefive that had not been tested during past years. Follow-up for Posttest #4 forCohort #2 subjects seems positive based on past experience with this cohort, butposttestiny for this cohort will not occur until Summer 1991.Attrition analysis. To examine the effect of subject attrition on the pool ofsubjects, attrition analyses on demographic and pretest variables were conducted onthe 10 subjects who dropped during the first year of intervention.Where allattrition occurred in the Center + PIE group, the attrition analysis compared thesesubjects only with those that remained in the Center + PIE group. These data arepresented in Tables 12.2 and 12.3.Of the 32 variables examined for differences between those subjects who remained inthe study and those who dropped out, there wasa statistically significantdifference on only one pretest score from the Family Support Scale (FSS). Parentswho dropped from the training group reported less support as measured by the FSS.These analyses indicate that attrition was not systematic and did not bias theoutcome of the research.

UST COPYAVAILABLE Des Moines 530InterventionFqvgrarnsThe Des Moines Public School System provided educational services to preschool- aged children,ages 3 through 6, who exhibited developmental delays or who had disabilities.These children received center-based (clas:,room), half-day, 5-day- per-week intervention services. Children received services in educational formats (i.e., large group, small group, and one-to-one) according to their individual needs from special education teachers and teacher associates (paraprofessionals). Languageand motor therapists assessed children, provided teachers with objectives, helped teachers integrate instructional therapeutic activities into on-going routines, and provided individualized services as needed. Teachers were free to use various curricula or to develop their own objectives when developing intervention goals and strategies.The Des Moines Public School Early Intervention Program provided services to a wide variety of children with disabilities, from those exhibiting mild delays to those exhibiting more severe disabilities. The majority of children served wereCaucasian, and a wide variety of SES levels were represented. As part of these services to children, parents were regularly involved inIEP meetings; teachers attempted to include and keep parents informed of classroom activities as child and parent needs dictated. In practice, this resulted in regular contacts with parentsregarding child progress and participation at IEP meetings, but nothing else.The purpose of the research study occurring with the Des Moines Public SchoolEarly Intervention Program was to compare the effects of their current servicedelivery system with the same system enhanced by the inclusion of one type ofsystematic parent involvement. In both the control and experimental conditions,children received services inthe center-based Des Moines Public School Early Intervention Preschool Program. No changes were made to this system for the purposes ofthe study.Childreninthe center and parent involvement (center +PIE) '71Des Moines 531 intervention were not segregated by classroom or teacher in the center-based service. In the experimental group, parents of children enrolled in the early interventionprogram were exposed to a systematic parent curriculum.IN their first year of involvement, parents were involved in the Parents Involvedin Education (PIE I) package (Pezzino & Lauritzen, 1986). Parents whose children remained in the program for a second year and were in the experimental group were involved in the Parents Involved in Education II (PIE II) package (Durbala & Hollinger, 1988).Data on group assignment were presented earlier in Figure 12.1. Center-only intervention. Children assigned to this group attended an existing center-based, half-day, 5-day-per-week intervention program in which they received small group and individualized teaching sessions from special education teachers and paraprofessional aides.Allteachers were certified and were responsible for supervision of their respective aides. None of the aides were certified as teachers. The training for aides consisted mostly of periodic inservices provided by the school district that both teacher, aides, and support staff attend, and on-the-job training providedbytheir respective teachers andthe collaborating speechand motor therapists.Each class of approximately 10 children had one special educationteacher and one aide. Because each child's program was \"IEP driven,\" motor andspeech therapists' contact with children varied widely. In general,a motor andspeech therapist was present in each class for the equivalent of 1-day-per-week.During a typical day, children were instructed in the motor, speech and language,self-help, cognitive, and social skills areas. As part of the regular services tochildren, parents were involved in IEP meetings, and teachers provided parents with IEP updates.The CAPER, along with other curriculum-linked assessment tools, were used indetermininginterventiongoalsandstrategies.Interventionactivities were developed from comprehensive assessments and items drawn from a number of curricula. risv) inappropriatecenter-basedservices.Parents 55o Des Moines 533attended meetings structured by the Parents Involved in Educflion II (PIE II) curriculum (Durbala & Hollinger, 1988), The PIE II was developed based on a parent needs assessment and focused on parent support issues. Issues addressed included: dealing with parent stress, developing parent communication skills, teaching problem- solving skills, and providing information on areas of interest. The training format for PIEIIwas the same as PIE I,except 12 sessions were held. Parent home activities that were presented focused on support (e.g., practice parent-focused stress reduction technique, dealing with emotional issues of siblings) rather than child training issues. As in PIE I, a social support component was available at the end of each session.PIE I and PIE !I were conducted by preschool program support staff (e.g., school psychologist, speech and language therapists, consultant, nurse). Classroom teachers and aides were not involved in the PIE meetings and were only indirectly aware of the goals of PIE. Each PIE group was facilitated by a team of two staff members. All parent facilitators received instruction in PIE I and PIE II by their respective developers prior to its initial implementation. Meetings were primarily attended by the children's mothers. Table 12.4 lists session topics for PIE I and PIE II. The intent of the PIE Isessions was primarily to give parents knowledge of and to teach skills that would enable them to serve as interventionists in the home setting.PE I was based on the pnilosophy that child progress can be maximized bytraining parents as interventionists and that the skills parents learn (i.e., their success as an interventionist) will allow the family to more competently function (i.e., by reducing parent stress and uncertainty). In contrast, although the primary intent ofPIEIIwas also to provide knowledge, the knowledge dealt more with information on the effect of a child with a disability on the family, and strategies to normalize the functioning of the family. The philosophy behind this approach tiesinto the ecological model of development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979), in that positivechanges in the family are expected to have positive effects on each individual family551 Des Moines 534Table 12.4Content of PIE I and PIE II Session TopicPIE I 1.Introduction and overview2.Objective observation of child behavior3.Defining and measuring behavior4.Principles of behavior management5.Analyzing behavior teaching session14.Determining appropriate interventions15.Communicating with professionals16.Review, comments, concerns, questions PIE II 1.Parent needs assessment and introduction2.Child development and behavior management3.Stress reduction4.Strategies for improving social and language skills5.Strategies for improving self-help and cognitive skills6.Communication7.The grief process8.Community services9.Feelings of siblings and extended family members10.Understanding my child's rights: Dialogues with professionals11.Promoting family fun12.Review, questions, and evaluation member.In addition to the PIE, parents in the Center + PIE group we:e provided theopportunity to attend four sessions conducted by the school nurse. These sessionsfocusedoninvolvementofbothspouses,wherepossible,andonfacilitatingcommunication between families. These sessions were informal in nature and focused 552 Des Moines 535on a topic such as a discussion on child nutrition, and on activities (e.g., a familyswim night, making gifts at Christmas time). Treatment VerificationA number of procedures were implemented to provide an independent verificationof specifics of the intervention program.Failure to obtain these data can poten-tially result in an erroneous conclusion (Barnett et al., 1987; Cooke & Poole, 1980).Sources of treatment verification will be described below.One year of Werventfon. Treatment verification data are presented in Table12.5 for subjects receiving one year of intervention. Child attendance data forbasic servicesand parent attendance data for parents' training sessions wererecorded throughout the year.Child attendance was recorded daily, and parentattendance data (for the Center + PIE group) was recorded weekly; these data weresent to EIRI on a monthly basis. An initial analysis of attendance data indicatesno difference in child attendance rates as a function of group placement (Table12.5).Average attendance for all subjects was 88.2% of possible school days.Average attendance by parents at the training sessions was 47.6% of all PIE classesfor all parents. Fifty-seven percent of parents attended between 5 and 11 classes;only 13% of parents (5 parents) attended more than 75% of the time. These absencesoccurredinspiteof repeated attempts by program staffto encourage regularattendance.The local site coordinator regularly called absent parents to promoteattendance.These data pertain only to PIE Iand will need to be considered whenconducting data analysis and discussing results.A description of quality of parent involvement was also gathered annually bya direct intervenor (teacher) who worked most closely with the respective parent.The data obtained was the intervenor's perception (low, average, high) of how aparent rated on attendance, knowledge, and support.These data are presented inTable 12.5.Teachers rated parents in the Center + PIE group as having a higher Des Moines 536Table 12.5Treatment Verification Data for Subjects Receiving One Year ofintervention for Des Moines Study Variable General health of child&Percent child attendanceParent satisfaction^Teacher rating of a parent rating of the child's health where 1 worse than peers, 2- same as peers, 3 better than peers.Satisfaction is based on the sum of seven questions that deal with various aspects of satisfaction with the center- based program (range 7- 28).Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.Teacher rating is based on the sum of three questions assessing parent support, knowledge, and attendance at school activities (range = 3 - 9).

Parents rated the interventionprogram on seven questions that assess satisfaction in a variety of areas (e.g.,staff, participation, communication, etc.).Parents in both groups were equallysatisfied with the center-based program.Satisfaction data were not obtained fromparents who began intervention in 1987-88 (20 parents). \":. .*+.'',,a1,-914'FIr;1111011t Des Moines 537Health data on each child were also obtained as an additional verification measure.Data on hospitalizations (and length), days with fever, and general health rating of the child, and other factors were collected. Data on child general health are presented in Table 12.5. No differences between the study groups were found on any of the health measures.TeachersinDesMoines werealsoevaluatedannuallybytheirimmediate supervisor.These data are relevant to treatment verification. Teachers were rated by their supervisor either as being satisfactory or as needing training.The Des Moines School District uses only two rating levels as per an agreement with the localteachers' union, and no other evaluations can be conducted as per the contract. All teachers of subjects involved in this study received a satisfactory rating.Additionally, information was obtained at posttest on the amount of time eachchild spends in various activities/therapies such as daycare, speech therapy, etc. outside of the intervention program. The data for the two most frequently occurringadditional services are presented in Table 12.5. No group differences were found. Two years of intervention. Treatment verification data for subjects receivingtwo years of intervention are presented in Table 12.6. These data are presented by first and second year of intervention. Variables on which these data were obtainedwere discussed previously and will not be repeated. The groups were not signifi-cantly different on any of the treatment verification variables in either year.Parent satisfaction data obtained after the second year of intervention were different than those obtained earlier. Satisfaction questions focused on the parents involvement in, and understanding of, the child's educational program. This was donein an attempt to make the satisfaction questionnaire more sensitive to aspects ofparent involvement. The data presented in Table 12.6 indicate no group differencesusing this new questionnaire.

Average attendance atparent: training sessions during the firstyearof intervention ranged from 2 to 13 of 16 possible PIE I sessions, with a mean of 7.8 sessions (SD = 3.0). During the second year, of 12 PIE II sessions, parents attendedfrom 0 to 12 sessions with a mean of 4.6 sessions (SD = 4.4). Regular parentcontacts were made to nonattending parents in an attempt to increase attendance. The concern that the Center + PIE I + PIE II subgroup of the Center + PIE groupmight have been different from the other parents in the Center + PIE group thatreceived only PIE Iwas a concern that arose in relation to attendance at parentmeetings during the first year. A t-test between these two subgroups was completedon attendance at PIE I meetings, and no difference in attendance was found (t = 1.08, ....29). Des Moines 539 Site review.A final source of treatment verification information was a sitereview conducted annually by the site coordinator. The first site review wasconducted on April 10, 1987, and a second site review was conducted on May 10 and 11, 1988.The purposes of these reviews were to: (a) collect information about thenature and quality of early intervention services that were being delivered, (b)verify that the research being conducted by EIRI was being implemented as intended,and (c) collect assessment data that may have been useful to site administrators toguide internal changes and for use when seeking technical assistance.Purposes (a) and (b) are of primary interest in this report. The Des MoinesSchool District was conducting the research as intended by EIRI. Overall findingsindicated that: the preschoolprogram was of high quality; it was staffed byenthusiastic and qualified professionals; classroom environments were safe and appropriate;teachersemphasizedfunctionalskillsinnaturallyoccurring envlronments; theprogramwascompetentlyadministered,utilizedup-to-datecurricula, and had proper evaluation, assessment, and progress procedures; parenttraining sessions were well organized and well facilitated; and parent participationwas good.(For more information, a copy of the site reviews can be obtained.)Posttests #2, #3,and #4.Treatment verification data for subjects afterintervention had ended was less extensive than during intervention. Treatmentverification at these posttests consisted of information regarding the child's healthand information regarding services the child received outside of those provided byschool placement. (Hours of outside services data were not available for Posttest #4.)These data were obtained from parent report at posttest. These data arepresented in Table 12.7.No differences were found between groups in the health of the subjects for any ofthe posttests on any of the health variables examined.

Test of parentknowledge.Another aspect of treatment verification was a testof parent knowledge administered to parents at all posttests. The test of parent knowledge was designed as part of PIE Iand assessed the degree to which parents learned the concepts taught in PIE I.The test consisted of 30 multiple choice questions and higher scores indicated greater retention of concepts.Initial analyses (t-tests) of data from the test of parent knowledge indicatedthat parents in the Center + PIE group obtained significantly higher scores than theCenter-only group at all posttests. The test of parent knowledge results werereanalyzed to examine differences between parilnts who received intervention for oneyear (Conter + PIE) vs two years (Center + PIE I+ PIE II).Oneway analyses ofvariance were conducted between these two experimental subgroups and the control group.Thesedata arepresentedinTable12.8.Statistically significantdifferences were found at all posttests. A Scheffe procedure was conducted to determine specific group difference.

The Center + PIE cohort performed better than the control group at Posttests #1 and #3. No differences were found between the experimental cohorts at any posttest, although a trend toward higher scores is evident in the Center + PIE I+ PIE II cohort at all posttests. Cost ot Alternative InterventionsThe cost of the basic center-based program and the center-based + PIE I and PIE IIprograms,as described above, was determined using the ingredients approach (Levin,1983).Costs are based on actual expenditures for direct service and administrative personnel,occupancy,equipment,transportation, materialsand supplies, and contributed resources. The cost of the center-based plus PIE I andcenter-based plus PIE IIis simply equal to the cost of the basic center-based program available to 210 children pluF the additional cost of PIE I(provided to 8 families) or PIE II (provided to 19 families) in 1987-88. The cost per child was determined by dividing total resource cost in each category by the number of children receiving services in each program. Table 12.9 presents the cost per child in each of these resource categories. At the bottom of Table 12.9, costs are discounted at real rates of 3% and 5%. All costs arP in 1990 dollars. In cases where program costs were compared over several years, costs were adjusted for inflation using theFixed Weighted Price Index for state and local government purchases (Bureau of Economi.; Analysis, 1988). Discounting adjusts the costs for the real rate of returnthat the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere.Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time.Direct service and administrative costs included salaries plus benefits for eachstaff member according to the percentage of FTE allocated to each program. Becausethe program is operated within a public school system, school and general directadministration were incleed. Occupancy charges included the annual rent for the facility in which the program was housed, all utilities, insurance, and maintenance561 Des Moines 543 Table 12.10Cost Per Child for Des Moines Study Center-BasedCenter-Based + 247 2471,2841,2841,2841,284224224 22422433 33 33 334085 54 70 501 501 501 50136 36 36 36$6,579$8,160$7,024$7,592 91 54 720772 698734 Agency ResourcesTotal Resources$7,6167,616$ 9,44610,445$8,1319,002$8,7899,722 costs.Equipment costs were based on estimates of the market replacement value ofallclassroomandofficeequipment,annualizedtoaccountforinterestanddepreciation.Staff transportation costs for job-related travel were based on actualmileage at $.21 per mile. The average cost per child for children in special 562 Des Moines 544 education in the school district was used for child transportation osts. The cost for materials and supplies included the annualexpense to the program for all consumable items.Contributed resources included the value of parent time working at home with their children, attending training sessions, and the time and expense of driving to the sessions.Parents in the PIE I group spent an average of 16.5 hours and PIE II parents spent an average of 9.32 hours in training sessions, and, assuming that parents followed PIE curriculum requirements, 60 hours working at home with their child.In addition, parents in both groups were interviewed via telephone to determine their transportation expenses to attend sessions. These costs were assigned the opportunity cost of $9 per hour; mileage was a. iessed at $.21 per mile. Data CollectionIt is important to note that the data collected for this study were collected to assess the effects of intervention not only on the childreL, but also on their families.As noted earlier, pretest data and data from Posttest #s 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been collected. The instruments used to obtain data on children and their familiesandtheposttest administration information on theseinstruments is presented in Table 12.10. A brief description of each of these instruments is presented in Table 12.11.Recruitment, training, andmonitorina of diagnosticians. The Battelle examiners were doctoral candidates in the School Psychology program at Iowa State University and other professionals in the community (i.e., speech and language therapists). Their training included an extensive inservice on BDI administration and scoring; and each examiner, after administering a minimum of three practice BDIs, was required to pass a quality-control test administration before they were permitted to test. Further, each examiner was \"shadow scored\" at least once during each testing period.

All test protocols were also rescored by EIRI clerical staff and errors indicated. This rescoring has resulted in only minor errors being discovered, increasing confidence in the examiners. These examiners also administered the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) to mothers. This was done concurrent with the posttest BDI administration. None of the examiners had any involvement with the Des Moines School District program, so the likelihood of their knowing to which group a child was assigned was remote.All Stanford-Binets wt.:e administered by three trained doctoral candidates in the Psychology program at Utah State University. All Stanford-Binet examiners were uninformed about the subjects' group assignments. None of the Stanford-Binet examiners had any other involvement with EIRI or the Des Moines Public Schools, so the likelihood of their knowing group assignments was also remote. The Stanford- Binet was administered while the child was in his preschool classroom placemont.During the Spring 1988 posttesting, the Joseph Preschonl and Primary Self- Concept Inventory (JSI) was added as a measure. BDI examiners were trained in the administration of the JSI. Two examiners administered all JSIs (in 1988) to childrenwhile they were inthe classroom placement. In following years, the JSI was a.1istered with the other family measures.For Posttest #4, two BDI examiners were trained in the use of the Woodcock- Johnson Tests of Achievement and the Scales of independent Behavior. Certification 5G6 Des Moines 548 requirements for administering these tests was the same as those established for the BDI.The mean interrater reliability on these instruments for Posttest #4 was 97.8%. Administration of family measures has varied. At pretest, Posttest #1, and for some subjects at Posttest #2 (see second posttesting below), the measures were administered to parents while in a group by the site liaison.Parents were not allowed to discuss these measures during the session (except for individual questions to the liaison) and parents were requested not to discuss this information with other parents.This method of administration was selected to help ensure that examiners remained \"blind\" to subject group placement.ForsomesubjectsinPosttest #2,andfor subsequent posttests, parentscompleted posttest information during and following the time child measures were being administered. Examiners were familiarized with procedures to be followed for the family measures and with the measures. Pretest.The following procedures were completed at pretest. Parents of eachchild participating in the study completed an informed consent form and provided demographic information. In the first of two pretesting sessions, parents (usually the mother) completed the family measures. In a second pretesting session, whichtook place within 2 weeks of the first session, children were administered the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI). Parents were paid $20 after both pretesting sessions were completed.First Nnttesta. At the first posttest. a similar course of events occurred.Family measures were administered in one session and child measures during another session(see Table 12.10). At this andallsubsequent posttests, demographicinformation was updated and parents provided information relevant to treatment verification.At this posttest only, mothers were administered the Peabody PictureVocabulary Test--Revised (Dunn & Dunn, 1981). Parents were paid for participating in posttest activities. Payment was provided at all subsequent posttests. 567 Des Moines549Second posttestino. At Posttest #2, events differed slightly depending onwhether children were enrolled in the preschool intervention program or school-age program.Children in the preschool intervention program were posttested in the same manner as Posttest #1. Parents and children in the school-age program were tested during a single session. This change from two to one session for posttest activitieswas the only different aspect of the process.Third posttestinq. At Posttest #3, all measures were administered using thesingle session format.Fourthposttesting. The format for Posttest #4 activities was same thatdescribed for Posttest #3. At Posttest #4, the BDI was no longer used. The mean age for subjects at this posttest was 94 months. The BDIis inappropriate for many children at this age level. A number of ceiling problems had been noted on the BDIat Posttest #3. Child measures were changed at this point for all subjects (seeTables 12.10 and 12.11). In addition, information was obtained from each child'steacher on classroom placement and the teacher's judgment of child skills (SPECS).Parent permission to contact teachers was obtained. Teachers were mailed forms tobe completed with appropriate descriptive information. Teachers were remuneratedfor their participation.Cross posttestina issues. Two assessment issues cut across Posttest #3 and #4.These cross issues are the result of the staggered initial start dates for students.The teacher data (described above) have been collected for Cohort #2 subjects atPosttest #3 as well as for Cohort #1 subjects at Posttest #4. These data have beenanalyzed across posttests. Teacher follow-up forms were sent to 55 teachers,accounting for 71 children. Forty-five teachers have returned information (81%).This represents information on 58 subjects. Activities to collect these data fromnonparticipating teachers remains active. These teacher follow-up data consist ofa teacher-completed SPECS on each child and a classroom placement form. 5)0f.0 Des Moines550 Asecondissuethatcrossesposttestsisdatarelatedtoparent-child interaction.These theCenter + PIE group had morerri Des Moines 551 major life events occur in the past year than families in the control group. In contrast, scores from the Family Support Scale indicate that families in the Center + PIE group had more sources of support.Although the families differed on these three measures, their stress ratings (based on the PSI) were not different. Also, resources available to each family (FRS) by group were comparable. Current knowledge of family functioning makes itdifficult to interpret the effect these different patterns may have on subject or family functioning as a result of intervention.Also include on Table 12.12 are scores from mother's performance on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. This result isnot an outcome variable, even though obtained at posttest. These data are related to the comparability of groups. A significant difference was found between mother's standard scores on this test, with mothers in the Center + PIE group demonstrating higher scores. Standard scores on this test are highly correlated with IQ scores. Mother's IQ has been hypothesized to be related to intervention success.Overall, these results suggest that any group advantages at pretest favored theCenter + PIE group. These advantages occur in regard to demographic factors, tochildren's skill levels, and to overall family functioning.The pattern of results found for comparability of groups at Posttest #1 isessentially the same for Posttest #'s 2, 3, and 4(see Tables 12.1 and 12.12).Although there are minor changes from one to another, the general pattern is one ofcomparability between the groups with what few differences do exist being in favor of the Center + PIE group.

However, since one degree of freedom is lost for eachcovariate used, itis generally best to use a limited number of covariates in any given analysis. All pretests and demographic variables were considered as potentialcovariates.The final selection of covariates depended on a judgment of whichvariable or set of variables could be used to maximize the correlation or multiplecorrelation with the outcome variable in question and still include those demographicor pretest variables for which there are the largest pretreatment differences.

The CIO was des4ned to measure parentalbeliefs concerning control over theimprovement ofchildren who are physically, emotionally, or developmentally impaired. A significant difference wasfound on the chance subscale. The subscale assesses parental beliefs that theirchild's improvement is largely a matter of fate or of factors beyond their control.Parents of children in the Center + PIE group were significantly less likely tobelieve their child's progress was due to fate. A change away from believing fateis controlling child improvement.is a change that may be associated with PIE. One goal of the PIE was to help the parents improve their intervention skills to increasethe perceptions of themselves as a factor in their child's improvement. Therefore,change in the parent subscale of the CIQ was expected, but did not occur. This failure to find a difference decreases confidence in the parent empowerment aspectsof the PIE.Finally, significant differences were found on the total score and play subscaleof the Parent as Teacher Scale in favor of the Center + PIE group. These results,though, must be viewed with caution as the subject n is small.Only Cohort #2subjects received this measure at Posttest #1.In adOtion to the analyses reported in Table 12.15, the subscales of the PSIwere analyzed. Some cautioo is suggested when making interpretations based on theseresults, as the PSI authors recommend against using the subscales for interpretive purposes.These subscales were analyzed here for exploratory purposes. On thesubscales, a significant difference was found in parents' stress regarding theirsense of competence, with those parents in the Center + PIE group viewing themselvesas more competent (less stressed). No differences were found on thr.:12 othersubscales that compare the PSI. 5El Des Moines 561 Theresultsfrom measures offamilyfunctioningshouldbeinterpreted conservatively. The majority of comparisons show no differences between groups.The results of the FSS may be a treatment verification variable indicating thatsupport was indeed provided as part of the PIE. Itis also possible that inconducting as many analyses as were done here that findings of significance may occur, even when groups are comparable. The overall effects of the Center + PIE intervention on family functioning appears to be negligible.Posttest #2.A significant difference between groups was found on the FACES Totalscore(Table12.15).Families of Center-Only subjectsreportedmore appropriate family functioning. This result suggests family functioning closer to \"ideal\" functioning. If these FACES differences maintain over time, it would suggesta negative effect of parent-focused interventions such as the PIE.Differences were found onthechild and chance subscalesoftheChild Improvement Questionnaire. The finding on the chance subscale meats that foundat Posttest #1. Center + PIE families were significantly less likely to believetheir child's progress was due to fate. Center + PIE parents also attributed lessof their child's progress to their child (i.e., within child attributions). Bothof these differences could be attributed to the parent involvement component.A significant difference was again found on the CES-D, but this time favoringthe Center-Only group. This finding is the reverse of what occurred at Posttest #1.Overall, the results from family measures suggest that the only clear place theparent involvement may have affected families in on their attributions of progress in their child. Other impacts seem negligible. Once again, it should be noted thatsome children and parents continued in intervention at this posttest, while others did not.This confound will be examined in later analyses.Posttest #3.Results from this posttest are presented inTable12.15.Differences between the groups occurred on the parent and chance scales of the CIQ, 5E2 :,,-.:15.:4:5Inifir\"\"7-.7Yr.C.M.77:74.*711'770..\" .. ft.';0.;Y:(70:4 +PIE group toward the parentinvolvementcomponent.Overall, though, the impactof the parentinvolvement component posttest.

Videotapes were scored using the Parental Behavior Rating Scale (Mahoney, Finger, & Powell, 1985) by observers trained and supervised by the scale developer, Gerald Mahoney. TheParentalBehavior Rating Scaleassesses12factorsthatrelateto parent/child interaction: expressiveness, enjoyment, warmth, sensitivity to interest,responsivity,achievement orientation, inventiveness, verbalpraise, effectiveness, pace, acceptance, and directiveness. (Definitions of these factors can be obtained by writing EIRI or Dr. Mahoney.)Each factor is scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating greater amounts of the factor being measured. These 12 factors were divided into3majoraspects(encompassing10 factors)ofparent/child interaction based on a factor analysis.These three aspects are: 1.Affectcombines the scores from expressiveness, enjoyment, warmth, andacceptance.Affect assesses aspects of parent enjoyment with andemotional responses toward the child. 2.Reciprocationcombines scores from the sensitivity to child's interest,responsivity,and effectiveness factors. Reciprocation assessesaspects of the parent's responsiveness to child initiations and parentability to maintain engagement in interactions. 3.Control combines scores from achievement orientation, pace,anddirectiveness. This aspect assesses areas related to the parent'scontrol of the interaction.An analysis of covariance was conducted on scores from each of the 12 factors and from the 3 major aspects. Covariates were selected in the manner described earlier.No significant differences were found between groups on individual factors or major aspects. The results from the major aspects are presented in Table 12.16. These results indicate that aspects of parent/child interaction were not impacted by the parent involvement component.

A significant difference was found on teacher ratings of parent attendance (i.e., at PTA meetings,IEP meetings, parent-teacher conferences, etc.) in favor of the Center + PIE group (Table 12.18). No other significant differences were found.Results from the teacher-completed SPECS are presented in Table 12.18. These data and results are different from those presented in Table 12.14, as these resultscombine subjects at Posttests #3 and #4. No significant differences were found on any of the SPECS domains in this analysis. These results suggest that the earliersignificant results from the SPECS be cautiously interpreted until all Posttest #4data are collected. Analysis al One Year vs. TwoYears ad InterventionIn the analyses presented earlier for Posttests #2, #3, and #4, the existenceof a possible confound was mentioned. This possible confound is that the Center + PIEgroupconsists ofsubjects who received two years ofparentinvolvementintervention and subjects who received one year of parent involvement intervention.The analyses reported in this section was conducted to determine the effects ofthese different durations of parent involvement on the data collected.A oneway analysis of covariance was conducted on all child and family outcomemeasures, reported earlier, for Posttests #2, #3, and #4. The groups compared werethe Center-Only group, the group who received one year of the parent involvementintervention (Center + PIE), and the group who received two years of the parentinvolvement intervention (Center + PIE I + PIE II).Covariates used in the analyseswere the same as those reported for each measure on the earlier analyses (Tables 12.13 - 12.15). 5E8 . .

The measures on which a significant difference (p < .10) was found are presented with further analyses in Table 12.20. Overall, the results from Table 12.19 suggest thatthe different durations of participation in the parent involvement component was nota confound that impacted on earlier data analyses.Table 12.20 presented information regarding the direction of differences for the measures on which a significant difference was found in Table 12.19. This tablepresents the effect size for each possible two-group comparison and a probability value based on that effect size.Posttest #2.It is interesting to note that the group (Center + PIE I+ PIE11) who received the most parent involvement was reporting the highest levels of depressionmptomatology, significantly more than the Center-Only group. On thechance scale of the CIQ, the results indicate that the Center + PIE I+ PIEIIattributed significantly less of their child's progress to chance than either theCenter-Only group or the Center + PIE I group. In fact, the Center-Only and Center + PIEIgroups did not differ on this measure. Also, the Center + PIE I+ PIE II group attributed significantly more of their child's progress to professionals than the Center + PIE I group, while the Center-Only group attributed significantly lessof their child's progress to professionals than the Center + PIE I group. Posttest #3.The significant finding on the CIQ chance subscale reflect thosefound at Posttest #2.

These data are not based on the entire study sampleand, therefore, a cautious interpretation of results is required. Treatment Verification AnalysesAn analysis of the treatment verification data was conducted. The finding of group differences on the intervenor rating of parents (Table 12.5) raised questions regarding the reason for this difference. That is, did the PIE intervention provideparents with skills that enabled them to interact more effectively with teachers, or were the ratings the result of other factors (as pretest differences did exist between groups)? The relation of parent attendance at group meetings (by Clnter + PIE group parents) and parent satisfaction with intervenor ratings were other issues that were of interest.Correlational analyses were conducted to begin the examination of these issues.Correlations of parent attendance (by Center + PIE group parents), intervenor ratings ofparents(forallparents),and parent satisfaction (for allparents) with treatment verification measures, family demographic characteristics, and informationfrom posttest family measures were conducted. Correlations with family measures andthe majority of demographic characteristics revealed no significant correlations.Data presented in Table 12.21 represent correlations that provide some interestingfindings regarding the current data and raise suggestions for further analyses.Intervenor ratings of parents appear influenced by a number of factors, primarilyparent education and income, although child attendance at school and lack of childprogress in school also affected intervenor ratings. When these demographic factorswere included in an Analysis of Covariance with intervenor rating (sum of the three areas)asdependent variable and treatment group asindependentvariable,no differences between groups were found (F . 2.46, ES = 0.38, Q. = .13). 5;.) 7 Des Moines 574Table12.21Correlational Analyses of Treatment Verification Data For Des Moines Parent Training Study VariableParent Attendance& Intervenor Rating Parent Satisfaction\u00b0 I. on actual parent attendance at PIE I meetings.ABased on the sum of three questions assessing parent support, knowledge, and attendance as perceived by the teacher at Posttest#1Based on Seven questions assessing parent satisfaction obtained at Posttest *1.Child progress is based on difference in BIDI total raw score from Pretest to Posttest *1. These findings also suggested that the teacher ratings from the classroomfollow-up be repeated with covariates. If teachers are affected by these parent factorsin preschool, then these factors could affect teachers at other levels. Analyses of covariance were conducted on the teacher-provided ratings of attendance,knowledge, and cooperation (Table 12.18) using parent income and mother education as covariates. These analyses did change the results of all three analyses. Parent attendance was no longer significantly different (F.= .84, k . .37, ES = .14) between groups.The effect size for parent knowledge (ES = .13) decreased while thl ES forparent cooperation was unaffected.Parent education and income was also associated with parent attendance at PIE meetings.Perhaps parents with higher levels of education are more comfortable ina class-like setting and are more willing to attend regularly. Unlike parent attendance at meetings and intervenor ratings, parent satisfaction with the Center- 5LS Des Moines 575Based intervention program is unrelated with parent education, child progress, orintervenor perception. A number .Jf possibilities arise: (a) more sensitive measuresof satisfaction may be needed; (b) parents may not have a clear idea of whatrepresents a good versus poor program; or (c) parents may be truly satisfied.These treatment verification analyses raise interesting questions for the ficldof early intervention. Evaluations in the past have overlooked these variables andas a result may have obtained biased data (Casto & Mastropieri, 1986; Cooke & Poole, 1982).These initial analyses make clear the importance of verification data.Verification data cannot only help clarify results obtained, but also raise newareas for investigation. Conclusions This study investigated the effect on children, parents,and families ofplacementina center-based early intervention program supplemented by parent-attended meetings focused primarily on training parents intervention skills, comparedto the same program without the parent component. Results of this study indicatethat the supplemental parent involvement component had a minor impact on children'sdevelopmental progress immediately after intervention, but this progress WaS notmaintained over time or by the contimation of a parent involvement intervention.The only aspect of parent or family functioning consistently impacted was thatparents who received the parent involvement component were less likely than otherparents to attribute their child's developmental progress to chance. These impactsoccurred at a cost of approximately $1,700 per child for the parent involvementcomponent.It is difficult to succinctly summarize the results of such a comprehensivestudy.There are measures where a significant difference is found at one posttestbut not the next. Itis difficult to determine if these differences are true 5:?;) Des Moines 576 differences or random fluctuations within a large data set. Actual differences must be demonstrated by consistent findings within a posttest and across posttests. Such consistency was not evidenced on the majority of measures.Data from longitudinal aspects of this study that are examining teacher judgments and child classroom placements are providing some promising initial resultsin favor of the Center + PIE group. These results,however, must be viewed cautiously at this time. Longitudinal data will determine if these differences areactual, sustained differences or merely random fluctuations in the data. Itis clear that the parent component used in this study is only one type ofparent involvement possible from a continuum of parent involvement options.Theparent component used in this study, though, is representative of the most commonapproach to parent involvement (White et al., 1989) (i.e., parent meetings focusedon training intervention skills as a supplement to a center-based program). The findingsl'om this study do not imply that parent involvement is not beneficial nor that parents cannot be effective interventionists for their child with disabilities.These results only imply that parent involvement, when conducted as described inthis study, does not provide long-term benefits for child development or for family functioning.In interpreting the results of this study, it should be remembered that parent attendance at meetings was far from perfect. However, attendance at parent meetings in this study typifies findings when using lower SES groups (Baker & McCurry, 1984).Regardless of attendance, parents learned the concepts taught in PIE I(Test ofParent Knowledge), at least at a level that allowed them to verbalize information presented.This is probably due to the repeated presentation of critical knowledgein PIE, asin many other parent curricula provioing information (Innocenti, Rule,& Fiechtl,1989).These factors further support the \"typical\" nature of this intervention. Des Moines 577 This study represents a methodologically-sound analysis of one type of parent involvement intheform ofparentmeetingsfocusedontrainingparentsas interventionists as a supplement to center-based intervention services. The results of this study do not endorse this type of intervention if the goalis to make a sustained impact on child development or family functioning. This type of parent involvement may be defensible from a social/ethical perspective.Regardless of arguments for or against this type of parent involvement, this study demonstrates that questions regarding parent involvement can be addressed withmethodologically sound experimental studies. Research such as this will help todefine not only what types of parent involvement \"work,\" but will also help the field of early intervention elucidate its arguments for involving parents. Whatever the role of parents is determined to be, it should be one that is both empirically and logically defensible. 6 1 i Utah Parent Involvement 1986578UTAH PARENT INVOLVEMENT STUDY (1986)Project #13 Comparison:Moderately to Severely Handicapped interventionplus parent training versus center-based intervention only.Local Contact Director, Lake City, UtahDate of Report: Study The involvement of parents in theirchildren'seducationhaslongbeen consideredimportant.Whiteetal. (1989)identifiedsixrationalesfrequentlycitedastowhyparentalinvolvement is necessary: (1) Parentsare responsible for the welfare of their children;(2)Involved parents providebetter political support and advocacy; (3) Early intervention programs which involveparents are more effective; (4) By involving parents, the same outcome can beachieved at less cost; (5) The benefits of early intervention are maintained betterif parents are involved; and (6) Parent involvement provides benefits to parents andfamily members as well as the child. The last four of these rationales can be andhave been, to some extent, subjected to scientific investigation, but as yet, thereare few data which demonstrates how and if such involvement leads to better childoutcomes or benefits for the family (White et al., 1989). 61 2 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 579Methodologically sound studies which examine the effects of various types of parent involvement are needed.Research also has yet to demonstrate if any of the many types of parentinvolvement (i.e., see White et al., 1989, Table 1) has been identified as being clearly the best (Powell, 1986). However, programs which use parents t(J assist indelivering therapeutic activities(thataredesignedtoenhancethechild'sdevelopment) are the most frequent manner in which past research has defined parentinvolvement (White et al., 1989). Theoretically, such parent involvement shouldproduce child gains as parents and teachers become more effective partners workingtogether on behalf of the child.This studyinvestigated the immediate andlong-term effects of aparentinvolvement program which was primarily designed to involve parents in deliveringtherapeutic activities, thereby enhancing the development progress of their childwith a disability. Second, it was hoped that the program would benefit parents byproviding themwith a forumwhich allowed tnem to form liaisons and seek support fromother parents with preschoolers with disabilities. In addition to assessing theimpact of parent involvement on child progress measures, this study assessed theeffects of such a program on the family. The work of several investigators hassuggested alink between child management skills and family functioning (e.g.,Koegel, Schreibman, Britten, Burke, & O'Neil, 1982; 1979; Wahler, Leske, & Rogers, 1979); however, additional research is needed to determine the nature of these effects. Additionally, most previous studieswere conducted with children who are disadvantaged; children with moderate and severedisabilities mev pre,.:nt sufficiently different problems so that the relationshipbetween a parent-as-therapist program and overall family functioning may not bepresent or at least may be different. 613 Utah ParentInvolvement 1986580 This studyis measureof a parent involvementcomponent as an integral part of itsactivities.Bronfenbrenner's (1974) report was especiallyinfluential in 6C4 :rre- e\".7,\",e;i1 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 581arguing that early intervention with children who are disadvantaged was moreeffective when parents were involved in the program, asserting that the increasedparticipation of parents provided the value change that led parents to encourage andreward their children's learning activities. Lazar's (1981) oft cited analysis of14 studies of early intervention for children who are disadvantaged with follow-updata reaffirmed this contention in finding that direct participation of parents wassignificantly related to positive program outcomes.The benefits associated with parent involvementarebelieved to be wellestablished both for normal and disadvantaged children. IQ gains and fewer specialeducation placements have been frequently cited in the literature. Haskins andAdams (1982, p. 364), in a critical review of parent education, concluded, \"Even a conservative interpretation would indicate that parent intervention programs can,under some circumstances, produce long-term IQ gains inchildren.\"Children's sociability and cooperation may also show significant gains (Clarke-Stewart, 1982).Increased infant responsiveness, improvement in children's school performance, andpositive effects on maternal behavior (more facilitative language, flexible child-rearing patterns, awareness of parental role as educator) have also been found(Powell, 1986). Some of these effects would appear to be long-lasting; for example,one study found that the Yale Child Welfare parent involvement program still had apositive impact on family circumstances ten years after the intervention h?.d ended (Seitz et al., 1985). Another study found that children of parents involved in long-term parent instruction programs were less likely to be enrolled in special educationclasses 7 years after the conclusion of the inteovention (Jester & Guinagh, 1983).Although these benefits are impressive, a thorough understanding of all the variablesinvolved is not yet complete. In many of the studies which showed substantial childbenefits, parent involvement was just one of several components in the interactionprograms and the research was not designed to determine which elements were the6( 510 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 582 critical components. Also, Clarke-Stewart (1982) and Apfel (1978) have cautionedthat although immediate effects are often achieved, most follow-up studies show effects are not permanent or very long-lasting. The controversy over the endurance of benefits associated with parent involvement programs points to the need for more longitudinal research in this area.The research discussed thus far has generally been conducted with children who are disadvantaged. Because such programs have been considered to be effective with this population (and with more general populations as well), it was logical to extendthem into use with families of children with disabilities. The number of self-helpgroups formed by parents of children with disabilities would seem to support a perceived need for assistance to parents in this area. The recent passage of P.L. 99-457, which mandates involvement of the family in the young child's education, alsoasserts the federal government's acceptance of the belief that effective educationof the child must include the child's family. Parent education and instructionalprograms are a frequently used means of attempting to involve families and provideopportunities for parents to learn to work effectively with and for their childrenwith disabilities. As Foster, Berger, and McLean (1981, p.55)noted,\"Parent involvement isa good idea that has become an essential and often unquestionedcomponent of intervention programs for young handicapped chi.dren.\"However, White et al. (1989) have questioned whether parent involvement trulyproduces positive benefits to children, citing major problems with the integrity of the literature. Few studies of parent involvement with children with disabilitieswere found to be methodologically sound. A number of studies in this area utilizeonlyindirectcomparisons(thatis,parentinvolvement isoneofseveralexperimentally monipulated variables [e.g., setting or age at start]). Clarke-Stewart (1982) noted that often no control or comparison group is used, and random ,* :7* f'et ,n Tr; ;:I Utah Parent Involvement 1986583 assignmentis almost never featured, giving rise to questions about selection effects.Other limitations inthe research have been indicated. Often,treatment verification has not taken place to confirm that treatment was received by the parrtit as it was intended by the researcher.Also, the foci of the research has often been limited to child outcome measures. Studies have not been concerned with family effects,althoughmany researchers havearguedthatthebenefitsofparent involvement are greater than those demonstrated by the target child (Dunst, 1986). Another limitation is that few studies have given cost-benefit information, despite general claims that parent involvement saves money.Finally, a major limitation in the research so far stems from the fact that parent involvement has been defined in many ways (White et al., 1989). Two general types of parent involvement have been identified (Gatling & White, 1987): (1) Those that use parents in some way to enhance the child's developmental progress (parent-as-therapist), and (2) Those that provirfe assistance to parents or other family members to enhance family functioning, coping ability, satisfaction, or ability to manage the stress of having a handicapped child as a family member (family sr ..art). About 80% of the studies of parent involvement analyzed by White et al. (1989) used a parents-as-therapist approach as either the sole focus or as the major focus of a parent involvement program which involved several other components. Often the parent instruction curriculum has been added to a center-based intervention program.Since the type of program is typical, studies are needed to assess its benefits. Suchastudy needstobea well-designed, longitudinal, study that involves replication,randomassignmenttotreatmentandcontrolgroups,treatmont verification, and multiple measures of child and family functioning. Only then can the numerous questions concerning costs and effects of parent instructior componentsbegin to be addressed.;7* $t-li\"! ,47,17! 7 Utah Parent Involvement 19cY6 584Overview ol StudyThe long-term effectiveness of adding a parent involvement component with aparent-as-C,--3pist focus to an on-going center-based intervention program was investigated in this study. Fifty-six children with moderate to severe disabilities had been in a h-day, 5-day-per-week, center-based preschool program in the Salt Lake City, UtA.h, area. The children were randomly assigned to either the center-basedintenention plus parent involvement component or the center-based only intervention.The parents of the children in the parent involvement group took part in the ParentsInvolved in Education (PIE) program, which consisted of 15 11/2 hour weekly training sessions from Ja;,.ary through April, 1987. The parents of the other children (thecenter-based or comparison group) did not participate in the PIE program. All children were tested prior to, immediately after, and once yearly for three moreyears following the implementation of the parenting groups, making a total of four posttests.Parents also completed measures of family functioning at each post,est. Method SubjectsPreschool children with moderate to severe disabilities and their families whowere participating in an intervention program for children with ,isabilities wereconsidered for inclusion in this study. The preszhool intervention program wasoffered through the senices of the Developmental Disabilities, Inc.(DDI),a private,non-profitagencylocatedinSaltLakeCity,Utah.TheBattelleDevelopmental Inventory was used as a screening instrument to determine children'seligibility for services. Children scoring at 11/2 si6andard deviations below the meanin at least two areas, or 3 standard deviations below the mean in one area qualifiedfor services at the center. 6C S Utah Parent Involvement 1986585 Recruftment.Parents of eligible children were sent a letter inviting them to participate in the research. Sixty-seven parents responded, but nine were unable to participate due to reasons such as lack of transportation, illness, etc. Thus, 58 subjects were pretested but two dropped out of the program after the pretest. Parents signed an informed consent letter which stated their willingness to be randomly assigned to either group (center-based or center-based + PIE). The informed consent letter also specified other responsibilities of the parent, the intervention program and the research staff.Subject recruitment was completed in November, 1986. Assfaanent to groups. Subjects who met the criteria for inclusion were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Prior to the initiation of treatment, parents were either assigned to a group in which they participated inparent instruction based on the PIE curriculum or to a group in which parents received no additional instruction. The parents not receiving the PIE curriculum continued to receive the same lgvel of parent involvement that was previously available through the center's program for preschooler, with disabilities.To increase the probability of comparable groups, subjects were assigned to groups randomly, after being stratified as follows. Within each of the teachers' classes, subjects were categorized according to chronological age (22-34 months, 35- 47 months, and over 48 months) and level of parent motivation as perceived by each child's teachers. Stratifying subjects in this w, -esulted in subjects falling into one of six mutually exclusive cells. Within each of the six cells, subjects were rank ordered from low to high based on their developmental test scores obtained from the Battellc Developmental Inventory and other assessment instruments previously administere:i as part of the eligibility process for rectliving services at the intervEntion center. After subjects were categorized and rank ordered within categorles, the subject with the lowest DQ score in each cell was randomly assigned and others were alternately assigned to one of the two conditions. 619 Utah ParentInvolvement 1986586 Demoaraohiccharacteristics.

(Standard procedure for locating lost subjects wasfirst, to contact next of kin, and second, to send a certified letter. For thesecases, neither procedure proved successful.) Finally, two children do not haveBattelle Developmental Scores, but have family measure scores. Thus, second posttestdata was available for 20 subjects in the comparison group and 20 subjects in theparent instruction group.At Posttest #3, substantial efforts were made to retrieve subjects not testedat Posttest #2; 51 children and their families completed the measures (25 in theparent involvement group and 26 in the center-based group), leaving 5 who were nottested.Two of these lived in states where testers could not be located, the mothersof two who refused to participate at Posttest #2 refused to be reinstated, and onewas not located.The participation remained high at Posttest #4 with 52 children and theirfamilies tested. Allfour children who were not tested were from the parentinvolvement group. Two of these had declined to participate since Posttest #1, onedied in December, 1989, and one's mother declined to participate this year.A comparison of subjects who were tested at the time of the second, third andfourth posttests with those who were not tested at the same posttest may be foundin Tables 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4, respectively.

A description of these treatments follows. Basic intervention (center-based trvatment). Children in this treatment group attended an existing 3-hour-per-day, 5-day-per-week intervention program. A group of 9-12 children were instructed by a special education teacher who was assisted by a paraprofessional aide. The average number of children in the classrooms was 9.75. During a typical day, children were instructed in developmental areas such as motor, speech/language, self help, cognitive, and social skills. Instructional activities were developed from comprehensive assessments.Items were drawn from a number ofcurricula with no single, specific commercial curriculum being used to determine interventiongoalsandactivities.Childrenreceivedservicesindifferent educational formats (i.e., large group, small groups, and one-to-one) according to their individual needs, based on IEPs developed by the parents and the therapist, the special education teacher and aide. Teachers were certified in special education while aides were not. In addition, certified language and motor therapists providedindividualized language and motor instruction to the children. These therapists alsoassisted teachers and paraprofessional aides with implementation of activities. Thcteachers' primary contact with parents about their child's progress was when the parents brought or picked the child up from school.Exnanded intervention (center-based plus Parent involvement). Chi 1 dren in th is treatment group attended the same center-based program discussed above. The children in both groups were scattered among the classrous at the center. In addition, theparents participated in an education program based on the Parents Involved inEducation (PIE) instruction package which had a parent-as-therapist focus but also included information and support compoaents. This type of parent involvement program6 6 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 593 was chosen because it was similar to the parent involvement programs most frequently described in the existing literature.The parent involvement component for this study (PIE) was primarily structured with aparents-as-therapist focus, but sessions also contained information and support components. Specifically, thE PJF curriculum consisted of the following topics:(1) introduction and overview, (2) objective observation of child behavior, (3)defining and measuring behavior, (4) principles of behavior management, (5) analyzing behavior chairs, (6)theorier.,of child development, (1)testing and assessment, (8) criterion-referenced assessment, (9) developing learning objectives, (10) P.L. 94-142 and IEPs, (11) intervention strategies, (12) factors related to teaching success, (13) practice teaching session, (14)determining appropriateinterventions, (15) communicatinp with professionals, (16) stress management, and(17), review, comments, concerns, and questions.PIE instructional sessions were taught by a social worker and the director of the intervention center. Average group size consisted of between 8 and 12 parents.Instruction sessions consisted of 15 ninety-minute sessions, held weekly during thedaytime for a period of four months. In addition to the information provided, PIEinstructional sessions offered an opportunity for parents to form support networksand discuss challenges associated with parenting a child with a handicap. Treatment verification. A number of procedures were implemented to verify that the intervention program occurred as planned. Child attendance at the center-basedprogram was recorded daily and sent to EIRI on a monthly basis. It can be seen inTable 13.5 that child attendance exceeded 65% for both the parent involvement andcomparison groups, but that the attendance of the children in the center-based groupwas slightly higher.Parent attendance data (at the instruction classes) was recorded weekly; thesedata were also sent to EIRI on a monthly basis. The parents, on the average, 617 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 594Table 13.5Comparison of Treatment Verification Variables for Center-Based and ParentInvolvement Group at Posttest #1 for 1986 Parent Involvement Study Center-Based Program Center-Based + (SD)n (SD)nValueES A Test of Parent Knowledge 14.05.42818.05.528.01.74Child's progress 3.3.47263.1.5723.38-.43Additional outside servicesreceived (hours)Speech 1 Therapy: 10.72810.7281.00.00% received more than 1 hourper monthDaycare: less than 10028100281 00.005 hours per weekPreschool/Head Start: % received 3.6283.6281.00.00less than 5 hours per week NOTES:sData are based on teacher ratings ot parents' attendance, support, and knowledge range (1-3).

While the mean ratings for these variablestended to be high (2.62 for attendance, 2.40 for knowledge, and 2.42 for support),nearly half the sample ranked as low or average on one or more of these categories,indicating that interveners were discriminating in the ratings they applied. Bothparent attendance and intervener ratings of the parents are typical of the situationsexperienced by many early intervention professionals who work with parents (Lochman& Brown, 1980).The parents in the instruction group learned the material t'At was presentedto them.At Posttests #1 and #2, all the parents took the PIE Knowledge Test. Theitems assessed the knowledge of the information learned in the PIE instructionalsessions.It can be seen in Tables 13.5 and 13.6 that the test of parent knowledge scores were significantly higher for the parent involvement group at first and secondposttest time (Posttest #1 =.01, and Posttest #2 p = .03).This informationindicates that parents in the parent instruction group retained the informationtaught them in the parent instruction sessions. At both Posttests #1 and #2, the parents rated the educational services at theintervention center on a 4-point Likert-type scale. The mean scores for both groupsat both posttests are 3.0 or above indicating that the parents were pleased with theeducational services offered. Although the parents in the Center-based + PIE grouprated the services higher than did the center-based only at Posttest #1 soon afterthe instructional sessions, the ratings were not significantly higher. At Posttest#2, the two groups rated the educational services similarly.

Center-Based PIE 7(- Center-Based )7 Center-Based SD During the initial year of the project, the site visit was conducted to makesure that the interventions were occurring as planned. The results of that sitevisit (a detailed report of which s available from the institute) found that allthe children participated in essentially the same center-based program, with themajor difference being that the parents of the children in the parent involvementgroup received the parent instruction and the parents of the children in the othergroup did not.Cost of alternative programs. It is important to determine the cost of addingany type of a parent involvement component to an already established center-based program.Should costs be high and relative benefits be low, money used to establisha parent program might be better spent elsewhere. Haskins and Adams (1982) pointout that there is a great need for cost analysis in the area of parent education toprovide evidence that such programs will justify their costs by increasing theproductivity of parents, their children, or both, and/or reducing the necessity for largerinvestments intreatment programs atsomelater date.This stuJy has6'0 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 597addressed these issues in part,and will provide more conclusive answers as it follows these children through their school years.The cost of the basic center-based program and the center-based plus PIE programas described above was determined using the ingredients approach advocated by Levin (1983).Costs are based on actual expenditures for direct servic.-: and administrative personnel,occupancy,equipment,t'ansportation, materialsandsupplies, miscellaneous, and contributed resources. The cost per child was determined bydividing total resourcE cost in each category by the number of children receivingservices in each program. On Table 13.7 all costs were adjusted for inflation to 1990 dollars.In addition, at the bottom of the table, the figures are discounted at 3% and 5%.Discounting adjusts the costs for the real rate of return that the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere.Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time.Direct service and administrative costs included salaries plus benefits for eachstaff member according to the percentage of FTE allocated to each wogram. Occupancycharges included the annual rent for the two facilities in which the program washoused, and all utilities, insurance, and maintenance costs. Equipment costs werebased on insurance estimates of the market replacement value of all equipment ownedby the center, annualized to account for interest and depreciation. In addition,the cost of rental and maintenance of other equipment not owned by the center was determined.Transportation costs were paid by the center for staff home visits,workshop attendance, and errands as well as to suiridize the cost of bringing low-income children into the center. Transportation costs for all other children wasassumed by their parents and is estimated under \"contributed resources.\" The costfor materiels and supplies and miscellaneous included the annual expense to the program for all consumable items and miscellaneous expenses incurred by each program. 62, 1 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 598Table 13.7Coat Per Child for the 1988 Utah Parent Involvement Study (1990 Dolls* Resources Center-Based Program Center-Based + PIE(n = 174) $7,398' $8,657\" Totals may not add up due to rounding errors. Contributedresourcesincludedthevalue ofvolunteerandparenttime. Community members contributed 426 hours during the year to the program. Each parent in the PIE group spent approximately 13 hours in instructional sessions; assumingthat parents followed PIE curriculum requirements, 67 hours working at home with their child.In addition, parents in both groups provided transportation for their Utah Parent Involvement 1986 599 children.The cost of child transportation was estimated based on information derived from parents via telephone interview. All volunteer time in the program was assigned the opportunity cost of $9 per hour. Finally, contributed miscellaneous resources included the market value of a computer donated to the program. Thus, the PIE program added approximately $1,000 to the cost of the basic center-based program.Table 13.7 presents results which demonstrate that the addition of this type of parent involvement is fairly inexpensive. On the average, the addition of parentinstruction to the center-based program only costs about $200 more per child indirect costs to the center. This is mostly due L3 increased personnel costs,although a small amount goes to supplies. However, when the value of contributed resourcesis addedin,this difference is approximately $1 000, reflecting the addition of the parents' time. Although the addiijon of this type of a parent involvement program (e.g., PIE)is fairly inexpensive in actual dollars for an already-established center-basedprogram,thereisasubstantialcostto participatingparentinterms oftheirtime.Thequestion oftherelativeeffectiveness of the parent involvement will be addressed in the results section. =a CollectionData collection procedures involved the recruitment, training, and monitoringof diagnosticians, and administration of measures at pretest and posttests.

All weretrained through a lengthy process which involved observations of videotapes, a two-day training seminar, and required certification after administering at least threeBattelles.At Posttest #3 and #4, new testers were trained.All were graduatestudentsor professionals inspecialeducationorlanguagetherapy and wereexperienced testers. All had worked extensively with children. Although thesediagnosticians were aware that research was being conducted, they were \"blind\" tothe specific details, hypotheses, and group membership of participants in the study.Shadow scoring was conducted on 10% of BDI administrations. Average reliabilityscores always exceeded 90%. Pretest.Pretesting took place in late October and early November of 1986.Parents of each child participating in the study completed an informed consent formand were interviewed concerning demographic information. Inthe first of twopretesting sessions, children were administered the Battelle Developmental Inventory(BDI), a measure of the child's developmental level. The BDI measures 5 areas ofdevelopment which include personal social, adaptive behavior, motor, communication,and cognitive development. These scores are then summed to a total developmentscore.The BDIs were administered by a trained examiner who was unaware of thechild's group assignment. Testing occurred at the center. In a second pretestingsession, which usually took place vithin two weeks of the 801 test session, parents Utah Parent Involvement 1986603 (usually the mother) completed the following family measures: the Parenting Stress Index (which measures stress and coping behavior in the perent-child system), Family Support Scale (assesses the availability and helpfulness of different sources of support to families), Family Resource Scale (measures the extent to which different types of resources are adequate in households with young children), Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (assesses life events and changes experienced by a family unit), and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales (assesses perceived and ideal levels of family functioning). Information pertaining to the reliability and validity of these measures may be found in the first annual report (White & Casto, 1985).Each of these two sessions lasted approximately 11/2 hours. Parents were paid a $20 incentive after both pretesting sessions were completed. Posttest #1.Initial posttesting occurred at the end of the school year duringthe last two weeks of May and the first week of June 1987, or approximately 7.5 months after pretesting occurred. The posttest battery took three test sessions to administer.The posttest battery consisted of the same battery of tests and surveysas the pretest battery as well as some additional measures. For mothers,the additionaltestsandsurveysincludedtheCES-DDepressionScale(measures depression), a survey of child health, a Child Improvement-Questionnaire, Revised(assesses parental beliefs about the factors controlling the improvement of theirchild with handicaps), a test of knowledge regarding PIE curriculum, a satisfactionwith educational services questionnaire, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (ameasure of verbal intelligence). (Although the PPVT was given at Posttest #1, it wasincluded withthe pretest measures as anotherinitial comparison measure,reasoning that attending PIE instruction would not affect the mothers' verbal intelligence.) MGthers also completed the Minnesota Child Development Inventory(MCDI), an additional measure of the child's developmental level as perceived by the mother.The posttest BDI and PPVT were administered by the trained diagnosticians. Utah Parent Involvement 1986 604Parents were paid a $40 incentive for completing the posttest battery. Additionally,mother/child interaction was videotaped for 16 minutes using a standardized protocol,and mothers were paid $10 for the videotaping session. Posttest #2.A second posttest was conducted on both treatment groups in June, 1988.No monitoring of parental implementation of training principles took placebetween the first and second posttesting. Parents were contacted via telephone andappointments were made for both parents and their child(ren) to complete the coremeasures.The children were administered the BDI while parents filled out variousfamily measures. In addition to family measures, parents in both treatment groupsagain completed the questionnaire assessing the parents' satisfaction with thepreschool educational services and a test of knowledge regarding PIE curriculum.All parents were interviewed and were given the opportunity to comment on servicesreceived at the center. The parents who had also received the PIE instruction wereasked to discuss their attitudes, knowledge, and satisfaction with the instructional program.They were also asked to discuss how their parenting techniques had changedas a result of the PIE, as well as how they handle stressful parenting. Parent-child interaction was again videotaped. After the completion of both the BDI andparental measures and interviews, parents were compensated $30 for their time. Forthose few children (12)who were already inpublic school, specialpermission was obtained to contact the teachers of study participants. Theseteachers were asked to complete a questionnaire developed to ascertain teachers'impressions of parent's knowledge of their child's program and progress in comparisonwith other parents. This questionnaire also gathered information on the child'sclassification, school attendance, classroom placement, tests administered, teachercertificates held, and teacher's recommendation for the child's future placement. Utah Parent Involvement 1986605 As anincentive for teachers to participate, two posters appropriate for classroom use were mailed with the questionnaire. This questionnaire had a 100% return rate.Posttest #3.A third posttest was taken during the summer of 1989.Proceduresfor this posttest were similar to that of the second posttest.Parents were contacted via telephone and appointments made for parents and their children to complete the core measures. Assessments were conducted at a local community college and a nearby preschool. The children were administered the BDI while parents completed the Parenting Stress Index, Family Support Scale, Family Resource Scale, Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales, and a demographic survey. Testing sessions lasted approximately two hours and parents were paid $35 for their participation. Posttest #4.The procedures for the testing at Posttest #4 remained the same. The parents were contacted by letter in January, 1990, telling them of the schedule for testing and encouraging their participation. Permission to contact tiie school teachers, and the teacher's name and school of their children were also requested. Most of the testing took place at a special education center in the Salt Lake City area with some testing (primarily for those living out of state) being tested in their homes.Most of the testing was completed in April with some being done in May, June, and July.Most of the measures used were the same as were used previously. The children'sdevelopment was again assessed with the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BOI).Parents (in most cases, mothers) completed the core family measures, except theFamily Inventory of Life Events, which was discontinued at Posttest #2. They also completed a demographic survey, a child health survey, a survey of their children'scurrent educational program, and the test of knowledge regarding the PIE curriculum.Videotiping of parent-child interaction was also completed, using the standardizedprotocol that was used at Posttests #1 and #2. The length of the taping was Utah Parent Involvement 1986606 increased to 20 minutes and toys appropriate for older children were included. The testing session lasted approximately 21/2 hours and parents were paid $50 for the family's participation.The public school teachers also completed measures of child development, using the Develoomental SPECS(System toPlan Early Childhood Services) (Bagnato & Neisworth, 1989). This measure asks tLe teacher to rate the child's development in19 areas using Likert-type scales with the possible scores ranging from 1 to 5. Onthese scales a score of 5 signifies that the child's behavior is typical of thebehavior most of the children of the same age, and a score of 1 signifies severeproblems or very atypical development in that area. From the 19 ratings, six scoresof different types of development are computed, including communication, sensori-motor, physical, self-regulation, cognition and self/social. The teachers also completed a questionnaire describing the children's present educational program andevaluating the parents' participation inthe children's education. Withthequestionnaires, teachers were again sent classroom posters to thank them for their participation. Results and Discussion The primary question that these analyses sought to answer is what are theimmediate and long-term effects of parents as therapist instruction on the youngchild with disabilities and on the family system? Second, is the magnitude of theeffect associated with the degree of parental participation? Comparability of Groups at PretestAs was noted in the section on demographic characteristics, the two groups werevery comparable (refer back to Table 13.1); there were no statistically significantdifferences between the groups on any of the variables (at .a <.05). 6 3 0 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 607 The two groups were also comparable on the pretest measures. As can be seen inTable13.10,there were no statistically significant differences on child development or family measures. P-values range from .97 to .11. The data in Table13.10 indicate that the children, with an average total developmental quotient (developmental age chronological age x 100) of 58, were moderately retarded. The parents were experiencing significant child-related stress (measured by the PSI) with average child-related stress ranking at the 88th percentile (compared to PSI norms).The parents evaluated their resources (FRS scale) a little lower than average andtheir support (FSS scale) a little higher than average when compared to all theparents (over 900) in the EIRI Longitudinal Data Set. The parents albo felt they had experienced a fair number cf disrupting events. (Life events are measured bythe FILE for which national norms are available; a low percentile indicates moredisruption and stress.) Selection of CovariatesThe majority of analyses presented in this section are based on analysis ofcovariance procedures completed using SPSS-PC. Treatment group served as the independentvariable,anddependentvariableswerescoresobtainedfromthe assessmentinstrumentsdescribedearlier.(Analysesotherthananalysesofcovariance are described as such in the text and/or table.) Even though subjectswere randomly assigned to groups, analysis of covariance procedures are useful fortwo purposes:(a) to increase the statistical power of a study by reducing errorvariance; and (b)to adjust for any pretreatment differences which are presentbetween thegroups.Ineither application, the degreeto which analysis ofcovariance is useful depends on the correlation between the covariate(s) selectedand the outcome variable for which analyses are being done.

In each analysis, the specific covariates used are indicated in the table. When examining results, the critical 2, value for assuming statistical significance was set at .10. Measures of Child FunctioningPosttest group comparisons. The groups were found to be basically comparableon the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) across all tests (see Table 13.11). At pretest, the center-based + PIE group scored a little higher than did the center-based group and this advantage generally was evident across all posttests, with thescores of the two groups ending in the same relative position as they started.The center-based +PIEgroup maintained anadvantageacrossposttestseven with controlling for the differences, and at Posttest #2, the total BDI score of the center-based + PIE group was statistically significantly higher (iL= .07) thancenter-based group. In fact, out of 20 subscale scores, the children in the center-based + PIE group scored better on 17 scores than did the children in the center-based group. However,the average ES across measures of child's developmentalfunctioning was only .11 at Posttest #1, .21 at .16 at Posttest .14 at Posttest #4. Children in the center-based group scored the same as those in the center-based + PIE group on motor development at Posttest #3 and higher on motordevelopment and communication at Posttest #1).The developmental doMains in which the children in center-based + PIE groupshowed the most consistent advantages were the cognitive and personal social domains.633 Utah Parent Involvement 1986610Table 13.11Comparison of Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Subjects in Center.Based andParent Involvement Groups at Posttest #1 in the 1986 Utah Parent Involvement Study Variable Covariates$Center-based only Center-basedPIE 30.9(10.5)31.92834.1(13.8)33.127.12.74.11Situation Conceptual 6 31.0(14.3)32.42831.7(13.4)30.327.69.41-.15Self-Help 257.9(17.8)31.62865.0(12.0)31.527.00.96-.01Personal-Social (continued)Covariance meanSFor of Interpretation, Battelle scores nave been convected from tne raw scores to a ratio Development luptirnt fDDI n% the 'ageequivalent\" (AE) score reported in the technical manual for each child's raw score by the Child's chronological age at time of testing. \u00b0Results computed among t-tests.

The analyses at Posttest #1 showed no significant differences between the groups.The Developmental SPECS (Bagnato & Neisworth, 1989), administered at Posttest #4,provides the teacher's evaluation of the child's development in six areas, communication, sensorimotor, physical, self-regulation, cognition, and self/social. The correlations between the BDI total development quotient and the six scales of SPECS ranged from .34 to .60. Therefore, the pretest total developmental quotient was used as a covariate for all six analyses.The children whose parents attended PIE did better than the children whose parents did not on four of the scales, but the only difference that was statistically significant was for the communication subscale (g = .09).At Posttests #1, #2, and #4, parents rated their children's health from 1 to 3 with a rating of 2 signifying that their children's health was similar to their peers and a rating of 3 being better and 1 being poorer. The children's generalhealth remained fairly constant across posttests with the ratings staying close to a112\" for both groups.Parent attendance: High and no attendance comparisons. Group comparisons(center-based only vs. center-based + PIE) may not provide an adequate test of theeffectiveness of this type of parent involvement program because data for familieswhose parents were invited, but did not attend regularly were included in the parent involvement group data. Attendance at the instructional sessions varied a great dealwith parents from one family not attending any of the 15 sessions, and parents fromone family attending all 15.On the average, the parents attended 9 of the 15 6 \").\":4111 ;;,` Utah Parent Involvement 1986613 sessions.Thirteen parents attended 11 or more sessions (73%), 6 parents attended 7 to 10 sessions (47%), and 9 parents attended 6 sessions or less (40%) .Analyses were performed comparing the Battelle scores of the children whose parents attended most of the instructional sessions (11 or more) with those whose parents were in the center-based group and were not invited to the PIE sessions (28) to provide a test of the question of whether attendance at, the PIE instruction affected subsequent child development.To compare group differences between the high attending parent group and thecenter-based group, preliminary analyses were performed to identify covariates. The covariates, usually the same scale taken at pretest, are identified in Table 13.12.The children's whose parents were high attenders scored statistically significantly better than didthe children inthe center-based group on the personal/social scale at Posttests #1 and #3 and on the total scale at Posttest #2 (see Table 13.12). At Posttest #4, the children of the high attenders still had higher scores on the BDI, but none of the differences were statistically significant. Average effect size across all subscales of the BDI are .20, .31,.35, and .24 for Posttest #1, #2, #3, and #4, respectively. These data suggest that there may be somepositive effects attributable to this type of parent involvement, but that the strength of the effect waned with passing time. Measures of Family FunctioningResults of the analysis of measures of family functioning for the four posttestsare shown in Table 13.13. The groups generally appear similar across posttests on measures of stress, resources, social support, and family functioning.Both groups seem to be experiencing fairly high stress as measured by the Parenting Stress Index across testing. The families in both groups consistently experienced more child-related stress than parent-related stress with the percentiles for both groups generally being 85 or higher.6 3 7 Utah Parent Involvement 1986614Table 13,12Comp Aeon of Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Children of Parents Who Attended 11or More PIE Instruction Sessions, and Children of Parents in the Center-Based Only Group Variable CovariatesACenter-based onlyAttended Scale Taken at Pretest; 100 Total at pretest; 2 DO cognitive at pretest; 3 DO Communication at pretest For ease of interpretation.

Utah Involvement 1986618The resources available (as measured by the FRS) to families in both groups are comparable, with both groups reporting more resources at Posttest #4 than at Pretest.The information orovided by parents concerning income supports this finding. The families earned an average of $4,000 more in 1990 than they did in 1986. The socialsupport scores (measured by the FSS) fluctuate more than do the family resource scores.The parents who attended the PIE sessions reported slightly higher scoresafter their pixticipation (at Posttest #1) and a year later (at Postteltt #2), possibly indicating some effect from the support of the instructor and other parents.One item in the Family Support Scale out of 19 deals with support from other parentsand two items deal with support from pre-P;ional helpers and school. However, at neither Posttest #2 or #3 were the scores of the parents who attended the sessionssignificantly different than those of the parents who did not attend. Overall, for both the FRS and FSS measures these families' scores lie midway among the familiesin the EIRI Longitudinal Studies.On the PSI, FRS, & FSS scales, the relative position of the two groups changefrom one posttest to another with neither group having a consistent advantage.However, on the measure of family functionings (FACES) the parents who participatedin PIE consistently had better scores (but not statistically significantly better)scores across posttests on the total FACES score and the cohesion subscore than didthe parents inthecyht.er-based group. The Family Adaptability and CohesionEvaluation Scale-III (FACES III) provides a general picture of family functioningby assessing the family's level of adaptability and cohesion. A lowerlesion score(closer to 0) represents a balance between extreme low cohesion (disengagement) andextreme high cohesion (enmeshment). Therefore, since the advantage is consistentacross time,possibly the PIE instruction assisted the families by positivelyimpacting the degree of cohesion within the family unit. .7\"\" Utah Parent Involvement 1986619In sum, the families in the two groups seem to be handling their stresses, families, and lives equally well over time. The only possible advantage seen forthe families of the parents who participated in PIE is more cohesion within the family unit.Analyses comparing the scores of the high-attending parents with thecenter-based parents onthe family measures didnot revealany statistically significant differences between the groups. Other AnalysesParent-child interaction. Another way to investigate possible effects of the instructional program is to measure parent-child behaviors in free-play interaction sequence.Parent-child dyads were videotaped at Posttests #1, #2, and #4. These interaction tapings were approximately 20 minutes in length and followed a protocol. Toys and books were provided. Most of the time WdS spent in free play, followed by a cleaning up of toys, joint book reading, parent leaving for 45 seconds, returning and more free play. The videotapes were coded by two parent-child interaction rating scales (i.e. The Parent/Caregiver Involvement Scale [PCIS], Farran, Kasari, Comfort& Jay, 1986, and The Parental Behavior Rating Scale [PBRS], Mahoney, 1988).The codings were completed by coders under the direction of the respective authors.The PCIS scale measures 11 parent or caregiver behaviors. These scales include:physical involvement, verbal involvement, responsiveness, play interaction, teachingbehavior, control, directives, relationship among activities in which caregiver wasinvolved, positive statements, negative statements/discipline, and goal setting.Each of these caregiver oehaviors were rated separately for amount of behavior,quality of behavior, and appropriateness of behavior on 5-point Likert-type scales.The amount scores for the 11 variables were summed and averaged resulting in anamount score.Similarly, quality and appropriateness scores were computed. Incomparing these cumulative variables for the two groups, Table 13.14 demonstratesthat the parents in the two groups were rated similarly except for quality of \"V*Utah Parent Involvement 1986620 behavior at Posttest #1. Child age, sex and BDI total development score at pretest Aere considered for covariates, but the correlations were so low, they were not used in the analyses. Table 13.14Comparison of Parental Behaviors as Coded by the PCIS (Ferran) For Parents in theCenter-Based and a Likert-type scale, range 1-5)overIIparent/caregiver behaviors (PhysicalInvolvement, Verbal Involvement, Responsiveness to Child, Play Interaction, Teaching Behavior, Control Activities,Directiveness/Demands, Relationship Among Activities, Positive Statements/Regard, Negative Statements/Regard, GoalSetting).Average ratings were then computed for the amount, quality, and appropriateness of the parent/caregiverbehaviors.b Average for general impression ratings given above. ES=Center-Based + PIE Adj.i - Center-based Adj.i Center-Based SD The PBRS (Mahoney) rates 12 parental behaviors including warmth, expressiveness, enjoyment, acceptance, sensitivity to child's interest, responsivity, effectiveness, directiveness, achievement orientation, pace,inventiveness,and verbal praise. Based on a principle axis factor analysis (using the SPSSPC) of these 12 variables for 462 observations of parent-child interaction from the EIRI studies, 3 factors were identified which together accounted for 61.8% of the variables. Factor 1, affective relationship with child, included expressiveness toward child, enjoyment of interacting with child and acceptance of child's behaviors. Factor 2, orientation to child's interests and behaviors, included sensitivity to child's interests, responsivity and effectiveness of parent to engage child in play interaction.Factor644.0 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 621 3,performance orientation, included achievement orientation, pace of parent's behaviors and intensity and frequency of directives. Two variables, verbal praise and inventiveness, did not load high enough to be incluied in any factor. The three factors were compared for the two groups at Posttests #1, #2, and #4.Covariates were included in the analyses when their correlation with the outcome variables were high.The parents in the center-based + PIE group were slightly more effective andmore oriented to the child's interests than were the parents in the center-based group at Posttests #1, #2, and #4, but not statistically significantly so (see Table 13.15).The relative position of the two groups for the ratings on performanceorientation changed over posttests and were also not statistically significantly different at any posttest.Again, to investigate whether the PIE instruction affected parent behaviors,the behavior ratings of those parents who attended 11 or more of the PIE sessions were compared with the behavior ratings of the parents in the center-based only group as measured by the PCIS (Farran et al., 1986) rating scale.As can be seen in Table13.16, at Posttest #1, soon after the sessions were completed, the parents who attended 11 or more sessions had statistically significantly higher scores than didthe parents in the center-based only group on the average scores for quality andappropriateness ofparentingbehaviors. AtPosttest#2,thequalityandappropriateness scores were still higher for the high attending group, but thedifferences were not statistically significant. No differences were found between these two group,: Jri the MBRS rating scale at any of the posttests. Insum,theparent/childinteractionfindings are mixed. Over allthe posttests, the rating system variables do not reflect differences in parent behaviors between the group. However, at Posttest #1, soon after the PIE involvement sessionswere completed, the group comparison (center-based only vs. center-based + PIE) show Utah Parent Involvement 1986622Table 13.15Comparison of Parental Behaviors as Coded by the PBRS (Mahoney) for the Parentsin the Center-Based and Parent involvement Groups for Posttests Utah Parent Involvement 1986623Table 13.18Comparison of Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Children of Parents Who Attended 11or More PIE Instruction Sessions, and Children of Parents in the Center-Based Only Group Variable Covariates&Center-based onlyAttended 11 at Adj.i - Center-based Adj.;ESCenter-Based SD that the center-based + PIE group scored statistically significantly higher in the quality of the parenting behaviors. This finding is strengthened when the comparisonbetween the high attenders at PIE sessions and the center-based group is made. Again, at Posttest #1, high attenders were statistically significantly higher in boththe quality and appropriateness of their parenting behavior. However, statisticalsignificance of these differences did not remain at Posttest #2. Possibly thecontent of the PIE instruction helped the parents in their interaction with theirchildren for a short period of time.647 Utah Parent Involvement 1986624 Parent satisfaction with services. Parents in both groups were satisfied withthe services provided (refer back to Tables 13.5 and 13.6).With the ranges of responses (1-4, representing poor to excellent), the mean scores were all 3.0 or above.At Posttest #1, soon after the intervention was completed, there was a trendfor the parents in the parent instruction group to be more satisfied with their opportunity to participate than the parents in the center-based group (k = .09). At the time of Posttest #2, there were no statistically significant differences .between the two groups' satisfaction with services, with the exception of a trendfor the comparison group to rate their ability to communicate with program staff slightly higher.Interviews conducted with parents at the time of the second posttest revealed that the majority were satisfied with the center-based services they received.Only one parent of the 40 interviewed reported leaving the center's intervention programbecause of inadequate services. Several reported problems with transportation (6 parents) or scheduling of the child's classes (3 parents). The most frequently cited service mentioned as most helpful by these parents was speech therapy.Parents who participated in the PIE programwere asked specific questions about their classes. (Seventeen parents completed these questionnaires.) The majority(14) of these 17 parents found the center-based program more valuable than the PIE instruction.However, most reported less stress in their lives after the instruction(11) or no change in stress (2 parents). Fourteen of the 17 parents reported thatthey felt the PIE program positively influenced their interactions with theirchildren, with these parents claiming greater objectivity ard more effective use ofreward and punishment. Fifteen of the 17 parents were satisfied with the parent-involvement package and the information provided. Of the two parents who did notreport satisfaction, one seemed simply indifferent to the program and attributedsome of herindifference to her poor attendance (which was due to scheduling 64S J1, Utah Parent Involvement 1986 625 conflicts).The other parent did not feel the information was useful and was, therefore, dissatisfied.Parent knowledge of PIE curriculum. Aswasdiscussedinthe treatmentverification section, all the parents took a test based on the PIE curriculum at Posttest #1 soon after the 15 instruction classes were finished and a year later at Posttest #2.The center-based + PIE group answered the questions significantly better than the parents who didn't attend the classes (the center-based group) at both posttests #1 2 = .01; #2 2 = .03). (See Tables 13.5 and 13.6).The test was also administered three years after the instruction was completed at Posttest #4. At this time, the scores of the PIE group were stillhigher than the center-based group (parent instruction 7 = 17.42 and center-based = 14.61; 2 = .11).P.I.E. instructor effect. Because instructor effects have been previously notedin influencing parent involvement (Hoover-Dempsey, Bassler, & Brissie, 1987),anadditional analysis was completed on the posttest data which compared the effect ofparenting group instructor on outcome measures for the parenting group. (Twoinstructors taught the parent workshops; one had one class of 9 parents while the other had two classes which also consisted of 9 parents each.) Table 13.17 presents these results. No statistically significant effect due to instructors was evidenton child or family functioning measures.Intervener retinal. The rating of the parents by the child's preschool teacher at the time of first posttest would appear to have some predictive utility. Because most direct interveners feel confident that they can accurately identify parents whoare motivated and engage in a high quality pf involvement with the child's interven- tion program,it was thought that this data might be useful in predicting parental successin implementing the parent program. Table 13.18 shows the correlationsbetween the child's total developmental scores at first posttest and the intervener Utah Parent Involvement 1986 626Table 13.17Comparisons of Effect Due to Instructor at Posttest #1 in the 1986 Parent Involvement Parents and Children's Total BattelleScores at Three Posttests in the 1986 Utah Parent Involvement Study Teacher Rating Posttest 1(n = 50)Posttest 2 (n = 38) Posttest 3 (n = 42) Parent Attendance r = -.08p =.60Parent Knowledge r =.07p =.61Parent .04p = .80r = .16p = .28 ratings of the parents. It can be seen that intervener rating of parent attendanceand knowledge is poorly correlated with children's Battelle scores. Intervenerrating of parent support is most highly related to the child's developmental scoresat all three posttests; but the correlations are still small. C Utah Parent Involvement 1986 627Other analyses revealed that intervener rating of parent knowledge (r[23] = -.06,= .393) and parent support (r[23] = .25, g = .123) were not significantlycorrelated with actual parent attendance. Not surprisingly, intervener rating ofparent attendance and parent attendance at parent training sessions were signifi-cantly and positively related, r[23] = .47, g = .011. (Considering that intervenerrating included factors beyond the parent training sessions, such as attendance atIEP meetings, this moderate correlation is as would be expected.) However, in thisstudy, the predictive utility of intervener ratings are not confirmed.Public school follow-up. Information allowing the investigation of the effectof parent instruction on later schooling was provided by teacher questionnaires atPosttests #2 and #4 (see Table 13.19). By the summer of 1990, at Posttest #4, theyoungest child in the sample was over five years of age. At this time, with 50 ofthe children in some type of public school program (preschool to second grade), onein a private preschool program, and one in a home-based program. Table 13.20 showsthat the group comparison of grade placement (as reported by the teacher) revealedthat there were no statistical differences between the groups (Chi square sig = .14).However, the teachers provided grade information on only 33 of the questionnaires.Possibly when children of various levels are grouped together in self-containedclassrooms,gradeisnot ameaningful marker. An excellent opportunity was,therefore, provided to evaluate the effect of the parent instruction on the child'ssubsequent education. Forty-eight teacher questionnaires and 52 parent follow-upquestionnaires were completed.The following information was provided. Four children (center-based =1;center-based + PIE = 3) of the 47 for which data were available did not presentlyneed special education services while forty-three (center-based = 24; center-based+ PIE = 19) received these services. Teachers provided information concerning thepercent of school time each student spent in regular classrooms, self-containedclassrooms, resource rooms, and other types of classrooms. Typically, the children651 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 628Table 13.19Public School Teacher Ratings of Children who had Participated inThe 1986 Parent Involvement Study vario- .e Covariates$Center-based only .27-.28Special Education Percent Time in regularclassroom26.3(34.5) 26 37.3(OM 211.00.32.32 in self.contained 211.90.18-.45 $ Covariates: 0 Total Income ANOVA F, 2. value. and ES are computed on adjusted means when adjusted means were computed.

Only 33 teachers completed this item. 23 did not in both groups spent more time in self-contained classrooms, but yet spent some timein regular classrooms, with the average percent for the entire sample being 68% oftime in self-contained classrooms and 32% in regular classrooms. Only five children spent timein resource rooms and/or other types of classrooms. Eight children (center-based = 3; center-based + PIE = 5) spent 90% or more of their time in regularclassrooms, while 23 (center-based = 14; center-based + PIE = 8) were inself-contained classes for 90% or more of their time. In comparing the groups, the children in the center-based + PIE group spent a greater per( nt of time in regular Utah Parent Involvement 1986629 classrooms (39.2%) than did the children in the center-based group (26.3%), but the difference was not significant (p = .25). Conversely, the children in center-based group spent a greater percent of their time in self-contained classrooms (76%) thandid the children in the center-based + PIE group (57.5%), but the difference again was not statistically significant (p = .14).Group differences for percent of time spent in resource rooms and in other types of classrooms were not significantly different.Seventeen children (center-based = 9; center-based + PIE = 8) were receiving some type of therapy (e.g., speech therapy) as part of their regular educational program.Some of the children received more than one kind of therapy (see Table 13.21).Teacher's rating of Parents. At Posttests #2 and #4, teachers rated the parents' participation in the educational program from less than other parents (1)to more than other parents (3) on 15 items.The items were summed into threevariables (parent attendance, parent knowledge, and parent support). At Posttest #2, the number of children in public school were few, and no differences were seenbetween the groups inparent attendance, knowledge,and support. However,at Posttest #4,the group comparison (see Table 13.19) showed that the parents who attendedthePIEinstruction were considered more knowledgeable about theirchildren's education (p = .02, ES = 1.39), more supportive (p = .07, ES = .70), andattended more of the educational meetings (p = .02, ES = .92) than did the parentswho did not participate in PIE.The variables of mother and father's education and total income were consideredas covariates and entered into the step-wise multiple regression procedures. Onlytotal income was found to be significantly related to parents' support, so it wasentered asa covariatein the analysis of covariance for this variable. These resultsindicatethatpossiblytheparticipation intheinstructionsessions Utah Parent Involvement 1986 630\"prepared\" the parents to feel that they have responsibility and power to take partin their children's education.Additional services followuo.Outside of the school program, some of thefamilies were providing other care, therapy, and programs for their children. Table13.21 provides the reported data. Only slight differences were found between the groups.ThirteFn families in the center + PIE group were providing additionaltherapy or educational programs for the children, while II families in the center-based group were. Also, slightly more children in the center-based + PIE group (6)participatedin group activities for the disabled than did the children inthecenter-based group (4). Conversely, more of the children in the center-based group(8) spent time in day care than did children in the center-based + PIE group (4).The parents also provided information concerning their own activities. Thirty-two parents (center-based = 18; center-based + PIE = 14) reported that they had nottaken any classes in parenting in the last two years. Nineteen (center-based = 10;center-based + PIE = 9) reported they had. Few of the parents reported participationin support groups for children with disabilities. Eight (center-based = 5; center-based + PIE = 3) reported participating in these support groups. In sum, relativelyfew parents participated in either parenting classes or support groups and for thosewho did, the participation was comparable. Conclusions The primary purpose of this investigation was to ascertain the immediate andlong-term effects on the child with disabilities and the family system of theaddition of a parent involvement program to a center-based intervention. In thistype of parent involvement program, the parents were trained to provide therapeuticintervention for their children. This longitudinal study was methodologically soundwith random assignment to treatment, treatment verification measures, multiple child ' ,11,1` Utah Parent Involvement 1986 631 Table 13.21Parents' Report of School and Additional Services Center-Based Center-Based + PIE In School (n = 52) 28 24 Public 27 23Private 1 0Home 0 1 Services at schoolspeech therapy 21 15occupational therapy 9 11physical therapy 10 8orientation/mobility therapy 5 2adaptive P.E. 12 9behavioral specialist 5 3 Daycare (center or home based) 8 4 Additional services (outside of school services)speech therapy 2 3physical or occupational therapy 2 2adaptive P.E. 0 3private therapy -- ....handicapped children group activity 4 6additional tutoring 1 6additional classes 3 2 Parent InvolvementHours in parenting programduring last 2 years10 hours or less 4 111- 30hours 2 3over 30 hours 1 2some time (amount not specified) 3 3none reported 18 14Hours in support group relatedto child's handicapless than 100 hours 2 2over 100 hours 1 0some time (amountnot specified) 2 1none reported 23 20 655 Utah Parent Involvement 1986 632and family measures, and \"blind\" assessment at all posttests. Child development effects, faoily effects, and later school effects will be summarized.Some advantage was demonstrated for the children whose parents were in the parentinvolvementgroup.Onthe child development measures across the four posttests, the children in the center-based + PIE group consistently did better than did the children in the center-based group, but only at Posttest #1 and #2 were anyof the differences statistically significant (2, < .10). A similar picture emergeswhen the groups were compared according to the parents' attendance. The childrenwhose parents attended 11 or more of the instructional sessions did statisticallysignificantly better on the personal-social and cognitive subscales at Posttests #1and #3 and Posttest #2. The Posttest #4 analyses (for BDI and SPECs) revealed that the center-based + PIE group still scoredbetter but that no statistically significant differences were found when comparingthe center-based and the center-based + PIE groups or the high attending parents and the center-based group. It appears that the advantage, if real, did not remain over time.It is important to note in these conclusions that both groups of childrenmaintained their total development quotient over the posttests. The children made age-equivalent progress over the 31/2 years of the study.The school data collected at Posttest #4 also appears to show possible benefitsfrom the addition of the parent involvement component. The school placement of thetwo groups was somewhat different. At Posttest #4, of the children in the parentinvolvement group, fewer were eligible for special education services, more were inregular classrooms, and fewer were in self-contained classrooms than were the childreninthecenter-basedonlygroup(althoughthedifferenceswerenot statistically significant). School placement varies with school district and is notnecessarily determined by the child's development level. However, these findings, inconjunction with the child development findings, reported above appearto 6ri: Utah Parent Involvement 1986633 demonstrate that the addition of the parent involvement program might have had a beneficial effect on the children's development.The comparison of the two groups on the family measures did not show effects on the family system in terms of parenting stress, support, resource, and overall family functioning from the addition of the parent involvement component. The families in both groups across posttests similarly experienced high child-related stress.They also reported similarly available resources and supports.The one difference between the groups was in the family cohesion scores. The center + PIE group maintained a slight advantage in terms of family cohesion scores across posttests, but the difference was not at any time statistically significant. In sum, from the measures used the families in the two groups appeared to be handling their lives equally well.Differences inparent behaviors were foundinsomeofthe parent/child interaction measures at Posttest #1 ano the teacher evaluation at Posttest #4. For the parent/child interaction measures, parents who attended the PIE instruction sessions scored statistically significantly higher in the rating of quality of parent behavior in comparison to the parent': in the center-based only group. When only the prents who attended 11 or more PIE sessions were compared to the center-based group, the quality and the appropriateness of parent behavior ratings were significantly higher.These differences were not sustained at Posttest #2.The two groups varied statistically significantly on the teacher's evaluation of the parents' knowledge, support, and attendance at Posttest #4. The parents in the PIE grnup were judged to be more knowledgeable, supportive, and attend more ofthe educational meetings than did the parents inthe center-based only group.Possibly the curriculum of the PIE program encouraged the parents to be more responsible and involved in their children's education. With the importdnce of the parent empowerment issue today, the effect of the parent involvement program on later Utah Parent Involvement 1986 634participation in the child's education is an intriguing and important finding that needs further study.Cost effectiveness is a concern in early intervention. The cost of the additionof the parent involvement program was minimal for the agency. With the effects found, although the results were not entirely conclusive, it appears that the programwas cost effective.The findings of this study demonstrate somewhat different effects of the parentinvolvement component than do the findings of the Utah Parent Involvement 1985 Studyand the Des Moines Study. (These studies are discussed elsewhere in this report.)Together these replicative studies show that questions regarding the efficacy ofparent involvement can be studied empirically. The questions are not all answered,but empirically defensible information has been added which will help interventionagencies better plan their programs and define their rationale for involving parents. C58 ASSOCIATION FORCHILDREN WITHDOWN SYNDROME(ACDS)Project #14ACM635 COMPARISON: based programplus ParentalInvolvement(Individualized Parent Training) LOCAL CONTACTPERSON:Fredda Stimell, Executive Director, Association for Children with popular issuesconcerning early inter- vention is thegenerally accepted state- ment thatinvolving parents heavily in theinterventionprogramsoftheir childrenresultsinmoreeffective intervention services. Inboththeearlyintervention literature (Peterson & Cooper,1989) arecent statute(P.L. 99-457), case for parentaland familyinvolvement has been made.The case inthe research literature has been made almostuniversally.White et al.(1987), in a review of previous reviews of earlyintervention efficacy, found that parent involvement was the mostcommonly citedconcomitant variable of intervention effectiveness with 26 of 27 reviewers concluding that \"more is better.\" Public Law 99-457 mandates thedevelopment of an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) and requires that a statement ofthe family'sstrengths andneeds 659 ACOS636relating to enhancing the child's development be includedas well as the majoroutcomes expected for the child and the family. Thus, given the great emphasis onparent involvement in the field and in legislative mandates, one might surmise thatthe major issues related to parental involvement have been explored and there islittle need for further research.Three provocative findings suggest that this maynot be so.First, Casto and Mastropieri (1986), in rcnorting the initial results of ameta-analysis of the early interqention researc ,.found that parents could indeedbe effectiveintervenors;programs that heavily involved parentsin addition toprimary services provided by professionals did notappear to be any more effectivethan programs that did not.In addition, they pointed out the fact that most of thestAies that had investigated the question of parent involvement directly had beendone with children who are disadvantaged rather than children who are disabled, hadmany methodological flaws, used narrow and often inappropriate outcome measures, anddid not verifywhether parents in high involvement groups actually participated tothe extent they were supposed to in the interventionprogram.Second,in reviewingoutcome measures used in previousintervention research,Casto and Lewis (1984) found that family outcomes have been assessed infrequentlyin past research, accounting for less than 10% ofoutcome measures collected.Third, White et al. (1989), ina review of 172 early intervention studies thatincludedasubstantialparentinvolvement component, concludedthat parentalinvolvement studies could be subdivided into two maincategories: (1) studies thatused parents to assist insome way with the developmental therapy of their children,and; 2) studies in whichsome type of support was provided to parents and/or familymembers.They found that 80% of thc studies were limited solely or primarily tousing parentsas developmental therapists for their children, with support servicereceiving little research attention. 6110 ACDS 637 Given the above findings, it was deemed important to further investigate issues related to parental involvement. Since parents were used principally as therapistsin 80% of the studies reviewed by White et al. (1989), this issue was chosen for further investigation. Chamdevy al MeStudyThe Association for Children with Down Syndrome (ACDS) had a basic parentalinvolvement program in place before this study was begun. This basic programincluded a nine-week course in effective parenting, parent support meetings, afathers' rap group, a sibling group, peer counseling, and general family supportservices from an ACDS social worker. This relatively \"rich\" parental involvementprogram provided an opportunity to ascertain if teaching the experimental group parents specific skills in working with their child would be powerful enough to showgroup differences as previous research has suggested. Specifically, the research question investigated was whether assisting parents in implementing specific teachingstrategies would result in significant gains in child and family outcomes over theexisting center-based and parent involvement program.Program organization. The Association for Children with Down Syndrome (ACDS)preschool program was a privately operated program consisting of several programunits directed toward children at various developmental levels. The infant programunit was for children from birth to approximately 14 months of age, while the toddlerand preschool program was directed to children from 14 months to 5 years of age.At age 5, children were referred to their local public school district's Committeeon SpeLial Education for appropriate educational placement.Curriculum in the program was based on a Piagetian model of development and assumedthat youngchildren with Downsyndrome follow the samesequenceofdevelopment as children without disabilities and can show gains in developmental sk;11s.The primary goals of the program were to have each child with Down syndrome661 ACDS638 working at his/her optimal potential by identifying learning strategies and effectiveteaching techniques for the individual child in all the following developmental areas:gross motor, visual-fine motor, communication (receptive and expressive), self-help (feeding, dressing, grooming, and toileting), socialization (awareness of self, adaptation to environment, adaptive behavior, play skills),and cognitive (object permanence, generalization, and concept development). The intervention program evaluated by this study lasted from September 1987 to June 1988.An underlying assumption of the program was thatinterventions should be implemented using principles of behavioral psychology and reinforcement. Behavioral interventions were based upon the applied analysis of behavior, were habilitative, prescriptive, andemphasizedpositivereinforcements thatcanoccurinthe educational environment. The goal was to promote developmentally-appropriate andsocially accepted patterns of adaptive behavior by reinforcing appropriate behaviors.ACDS utillzed a transdisciplinary approach to the early intervention program consistingofspecialeducationteachers,assistantteachers,speech/language pathologists, socialworkers,psychologists, physicaltherapists,occupational therapists,nurses, movement and music specialists, volunteers, students and a consulting pediatrician-geneticist. The teacher acted as the team facilitator inintegrating the expertise of the entire team. Team meetings were held to discuss the progress of individual children as well as to develop strategies for programming.Staff also met with parents on an individual basis at least once a year or moreoften as needed.The curriculum The basic curriculum for the center based program used a numberof published early childhood education and special education curriculums such as:You and your small child (Karnes, M.B.,1982; Circle Pines, American Guidance Service,Inc.); 5.eauenced Curriculum for the Severely and Profoundly MentallyRetarded and Multiply Handicapped (Kissinger, M. E. M., 1981; Springfield: Charles 662 ACDS639 Thomas Publisher); Down syndrome programs. University of Washington/Comolication of programs (Hayden, A., 1981; Seattle: Child Development and Mental Retardation Center,University of Washington); Time to begin (Dmitrieu, V., 1982; Milton, WA: Caring, Inc.).A typical instructional day included sensory integration, small and large group instruction (in all areas of development), individual task time, and free exploratory playactivities.Throughouttheday,arange oftherapeuticservices were implemented for goAls such as eye-to-eye gaze, orientation to name, attending skills, and other adaptive behaviors. As children got older, activities were planned toemphasize independence and functional skills in order to prepare children for integration into the least restrictive environments. Data collected from children's IEPs,formalized assessments, informal behavioral observation, and standardized checklists were used for program evaluation.As noted earlier, there was a pre-study parent involvement program in place.The parent involvement activities are described below.Optional intervention services. In addition to the basic program for eachgroup, ACDS provided a variety of additional activities and services for families who chose to participate. Families in either the Basic or Expanded Services group were eligible to participate in these services. Most of these services were provided through the social work/family services department. These services included:Fathers Meetings - A father's rap group was held several times each year in theevenings and was led by a social worker.Coffee and Conversations - All parents were invited to group meetings held once permonth to gather information, discuss concerns and bring up relevant issues.Horne Mils - Home visits were made on a monthly basis for infants. Toddler families were visited twice yearly. The minimum number was once per year. Familieswith acute needs received more home visits on an 'as needed' basis. 663 ACDS 640STEP- Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (American Guidance Service),a program designed to enhance parenting skills, was offered in a nine-week course.Siblings- Siblings were invited on a specifically planned day to participate in a shortened school day. A series of sibling raps were offered to inform siblingsabout Down syndrome, enabling them to meet other siblings of children with Downsyndrome and provided siiilings with an opportunity to express concerns and feelings.Share - A group meeting was held once per month for the parents of studentsgraduating from ACDS. This was designed to help prepare parents to separate fromACDS, familiarize themselves with the child's needs, become advocates for theirchildrenandtounderstand the available public schoolprograms forSpecial Education.Peer Counseling- Peer counselors were parents of children with Down syndromewho received systematic training through the Family Services Department to advise,counsel, and provide support and information to new parents. Peer counselors wereavailable to go to the hospital or the home when new babies with Down syndrome were born.Peer counseling was designed to be short-term and time-limited.SocialVi(orkServices-Thesocialworkersservedasliaisonbetweenthetransdisciplinary team and parents. They offered referrals, resources, and concreteservices such as: referral to social services, public assistance, food stamps,daycare, etc., as well as providing direct care information for out of state familiesand agencies. The social worker assisted the child's family and teacher indeveloping strategies for working with the individual family as well as to helpfacilitatea parent-professional partnership. Conferences,relatingtoissuesconcerning children with Down syndrome and their families, were scheduled. Asystematic information data base on all other related services and agencies wasestablished and maintained. 664 ACDS 641PersonnelServices were provided by a multidisciplinary staff of 75 people who servedapproximately 130 Down syndrome children. Each child was provided services by atransdisciplinary team that has been assigned to that child. The way in which thestaff were incorporated into the program is described next.TeacherslAssistant Teachers were the primary facilitators of the team. M. S. levelspecial educators were responsible for knowing each child's IEP that has beendesigned with each team member's input.Social Workers interfaced with teachers to develop strategies for working withindividual families and facilitated a parent-professional relationship.Psychologistsprovidedchild assessment (formalandinformal)and parental counseling and training.Registered Nursescared for youngsters who did not feel well, and acted as aresource to keep parents and staff up-to-date on health and safety issues.Speech Pathologists provided the children at ACDS with an intensive speech andlanguage therapy program both on an individual and group basis to minimize the severedelay in the area of language development and speech most children with Down syndrome exhibit.Physical Therapists followed a neurodeveloprintal and sensory integration approachwhere each child was brought through the stages of development using the priorstage's components as a building block for the next stage. Occupational Therapists at ACDS worked within the child's occupation (i.e., play)by evaluating and developing a course of therapy to enhance sensory, gross and finemotor, activities of daily living and behavioral and perceptual skills.The Movement and Dance S,:xialist worked with children from their earliest months at ACDS.Music, which is stimulating and expressive, helped motivate each child tolearn and to use his/her body coordination. 665 ACDS642 Volunteers (including student and community residents) who came to ACDS from thesurrounding communities were trained inspecific tasks within the educational program. Methods SubjectsAll children in the study had Down syndrome. There were 23 preschoolers inthe basic parental involvement group and 26 in the expanded parental involvement group.Recruitment.The project served families with children with Down syndrome in Suffox and Nassau Counties, New York state. A few children from surrounding counties on Long Island were also served through interagency agreements. Subjects qualified for inclusion in the study if they had a diagnosis of Down syndrome. They were then matched according to their performance on the Uniform Performance Assessment System(UPAS) and randomly assigned to the existing parental involvement program or to theexpanded parenta' involvement program. Children who had Down syndrome and othercomplicating conditions (need of additional family support, severe developmentaldelay, seizures or other medical difficulties) were enrolled in the ACDS \"ExtendedDay Classroom,\" and were not included in the study. All families in the programwere invited to participate through written announcements and group discussions ledby program staff and EIRI personnel.All families who elected to participateunderwent an informed consent procedure and signed consent forms. A few familieschose not to participate due to personalreasons andtoinvolvementin other research. Assfanment to groups. Developmental level in months was measured by the child'sscore on the full Uniform Performance Assessment System (UPAS) that was administeredby classroom teachers in the fall of 1986. Names were listed in six groupings by 6 66 ACDS 643 chronological age of list also included information concerning sex of the child and whether the child had a heart condition. The first two names on the list were considered a pair, the third and fourth a second pair, and so on through the list. In each of the pairs the first member was assigned a group by the use of a table of random numbers. The other member of the pair was assigned to the other group. E_ADemorajtsftaracterlitigs. The basic parental involvement group and expanded wparental involvement group were compared for gender distribution and heart condition and found to be simi:ar. Tables 14.1 and 14.2 depict demographic characteristicsand show pretest peciormance for children in each group. As.may be noted, both groups were statistically significantly different at pretest in only one area at the .05 level and 3 additional areas at the .10 level. The expanded intervention groupreported fewer stressful life events at time of pretest (p = .05).This variableand the years of education for fathers (.06) were used as covariates in posttest analysesSubject attrition. One child died of a respiratory condition during 1988. This subject was the only attrition the study suffered. Twenty-six children and theirfamilies were treated during the 1987-88 year and were the group used for follow- up.Twenty-three children and their families constituted the comparison group.

Both groups received the basic services of the ongoingACDS center-based programs. This program varied depending on the age of the child as described below.Want CUsses were held at the school two times per week where parents andinfants met for individual direct service programming with the transdisciplinary team.Individualized programs were developed and implemented during two hours ofdirect services. At each session, parents received written suggestions and printededucational materials for them to continue working on at home. Pertinent workshopswere presented on a monthly basis, which also included rap sessions for parents.In addition, monthly home visits were made by the infant teachers. Specialists may also have accompanied an infant teacher on a home visit. The infant program includedchildren of age 2 months to 14 months. An average day included: 9:30 -9:45Movement therapy which included dancing and exercising9:45 - 11:30Direct services, with parents, infants, transdisciplinary teammembers to individualize sensory stimulation programming11:30 - 12:30Parents from morning and afternoon classes meet for Rap withthe Family Services Department. During this time the childrenremain in the infant classroom with the transdisciplinary teamand interventions are continued. Afternoon Class - p.m. Parentscome to classroom after Rap and follow same schedule as above. TheToddlerand Preschool Classes were held at the school for three hours a day fivedays per week. Children were transported via bus or by their parents to the school.Notebooks were used for daily communication between staff and parents. Formalparent-teacher IEP conferences were held a minimum of twice per year. Parentsreceived a mid-year and year-end developmental report on their child's progress.Individual and group social services to the families were available on an \"as needed\" basis.Home visits were made by staff members on a twice yearly b,Isis. An open doorpolicy was maintained for the first few weeks of the toddler program or for any childstarting school for the first time in a preschool class to facilitate the child'sadjustment to the classroom. Parents were otherwise requested to schedule visits ACDS 647 a minimum of once per month to see appropriate personnel and to participate in the classroom programming and learn techniques that they cuuld carry out at home with their child.Workshops were offered to parents on topics of interest by specialists from ACDS as well as outside professionals. A typical daily schedule for a younger toddler included:9:30 - 10:00Sensory stimulation/free play10:00 - 10:45Small group activity. Children are taken from the group forindividual work on developmentally appropriate tasks and toreceive therapy.10:45 - 11:00Large and small group activity as well as painting, shavingcream, rice, water, and other sensory play. 11:00 - 11:30Gross motor activity.

Children in all units were trained onspecific individual skills as determined by the following procedures:Behavioral observation of child by teacher/OT & PT/speechtherapist/psychologist using checklists as guideline.Transdisciplinary team meeting to discuss the developmental needs of thechild.671 ACDS648Specific target behavior selected and criteria for acquisition of behaviordetermined in transdisciplinary team meeting.Baseline behavior observed on target behavior by psychologist or trainedobserver in classroom using General Observation Sheet.If work on behavior was appropriate as seen by baseline observation it isdiscussed with parents.Teacher and/or other staff members trained to implement in classroom.The pool of potential behaviors to be addressed as a part of the interventionprogram came from developmental assessments made by physical and occupational therapists,speech therapists, and teachers. Each of these professionals used assessment tools that emphasized their particular training expertise. For example,the teachers used the Uniform Performance Assessment System (UPAS), a curriculum-based criterion referenced scale which divides developmental skills into: pre-academic, communication, social/self-help, gross motor categories, and includes aspecific inappropriate behavior checklist. Items for the UPAS were taken fromexisting developmental scales.Professionals trained in disciplines other than teaching used instruments andprocedures designed to focus on child developmental status in those areas of specificexpertise of the particular discipline. For example, physical therapists assessedmobility skills, and occupational therapists assessed functional movement patterns.Speech, language, and communication skills were assessed by the speech therapists.Items from all of these child performance assessments were collected on checkli-4sthat were kept in the child's folder and updated daily. Rather than relying on thememory of those working with the child, the exact number of occurrences of specificbehaviors of each child were observed and recorded.After data from various instruments and clinical assessment were summarizedduring weekly staff meetings, behaviors that the child was ready to learn wereisolated and staff discussed the child's current overall functioning to select themost salient behaviors to be addressed as a part of the intervention for that child. ACDS 649Parents gave routine written and verbal input on areas of concern to them. Theseareas were observed and assessed by staff.When all of these measures had been integrated, the situation was discussed with parents and specific training sequenceswere developed that included the child's most immediate needs and the materials and rewards that were most effective with the child.Although any of the over 100 pages of items on the transdisciplinary assessment instrumentscouldhavebeenidentifiedasthechild'smostappropriateandsignificant learning need, certain skills were identified more frequently as beingneeded by children with Down syndromeinthebirthtofive year age range. Behavioraltrainingprograms had previously been written for some60skills. Additional programs were written as the process described above had identified otherskills pertinent to a particul - child's development. Each of these programs wasdescribed as aspecific sequence with suggestions for rewards and criteria for completion included. These training programs were implemented by the staff in thecenter-based program.Expanded intervention. Parentsin the expanded parental involvement groupreceived the same services as parents in the Basic Services Group except they werealso given additional services designed to enhance their abilities to tutor theirchild in specified skill areas. A series of videotapes were developed by projectstaff to use in training parents to teach certain specified skills to their child.Five basic areas were covered on the tapes. They included: (1) having thechild come to the parent; and(5)prosocial behavior. Thevideotapes were made by the school psychologists and used live actors for realism.Examples were interspersed with the training of the parents for each category.Practical examples were used (such as rewarding the child for coming when called)so parents could easily see what the desired behavior was and how to reinforce it. ACDS 650ACDS staff who were experienced in working with parents had found that althoughparents might learn to teach one skill effectively, and there may have been generalunderstanding of a new concept, it was necessary to train parents for each new skill. Thevideotapestargetedcompliancebehaviorsaswellasskillsincritical developmental areas.The parents in the expanded intervention group were trained individually in theuse of the procedures to teach the skills needed by the child and were asked to workwith the child at home. This training included teaching the parent the proceduresto be used and criteria for attainment of the skill. Parents were then required todemonstrate their ability to teach tne skill. Repeated contact was made by a licensed psychologist. Training included a monthly 1 hour face-to-face individual tutorialsession,andweeklyfollow-uptelephonecallsbythesamepsychologist.Parents were also be given a written copy of the training sequence anda calendar-like chart to keep a record of home training completed. Parents useH therecord as a prompt to tell the psychologist during the weekly call of the amount oftraining activities performed. The project social worker also contracted parentsto ensure that the parents' intervention activities were proceeding smoothly. Whena child reached criteria on each skill, a now program waS implemented on the nexttarget skill to be trained. Treatment VerificationA number of procedures were used to verify that treatment was implemented as intended.They included:Collection of attendance data. Child attendance in the regular program wasrecorded.The parent's attendance at training sessions was also recorded. Reasonsfor any extended absences were recorded. Experimental group children attended anaverage of 170 days. Comparison group children averaged 174 days in attendance. 674 ACDS 651 Optional service attendance. As seen in Table 14.3 both the basic and expanded groups had approximately the same attendance to the optional services. Because so many different optional services were offered,it was thought ex;edient to check parents' attendance at activities in case there was a difference between the basic and expanded groups.Table 14.3Optional Service Attendance for Basic and Expanded Services Groups ActivityBasicExpanded (%)N(%) Back-to-School Day ClassroomTOTALNUMBER OF FAMILIES2326 'Parents were asked to participate once a month in the classroom.There were a total of nine timt's (9 months) parents were askedto participate.

Table 14.4Cost per Child Re New York ACDS (1987-88) Resources Center-Based Center-Based & NOTE:Totals may not add up due to rounding errors. Direct service and administrative personnel costs included the base salaries plusbenefits according tothepercentage of FTEallocatedto eachprogram.Occupancy charges included the annual rent the ACDS program paid for the facility 673 ACDS 655in which itis housed, an annualized cost for capital improvements,as well asutilities, and insurance costs. Equipment costs were based on insurance estimatesof the market replacement value of the buildings' contents, which were annualizedto account for interest and depreciation. Materials and supplies and miscellaneouscharges were based on actual expenditures by each program on these resources.Contributed resources included parent and volunteer time and child transportation.Community members volunteered 13,400 hours, and student interns volunteered 435 hours.The estimate of parent time is based on the time parents spent in trainingsessions, telephone contact with the sociologist and psychologist, and the timerecommended by the program for working at home with their child. Total parent timewas estimated at 72 hours. While program records were available for the amount oftime parents spent in trailing and in phone contact, parert time spent working withtheir children at home was not available and was thus estimated based on what theprogram recommends. In addition, pediatric and cardiological examinations werecontributed by the medical community. The cost for medical team visits were based ontheir market value. Finally,the State of New York provided door-to-doortransportation for the children at no direct charge to ACDS or the parents. The costof this service is estimated based on asurvey of preschool special educationtransportation costs (Escobar et al., 1988). Data CollectionOutcome data were collected for children and families in both groups in thespring of 1988. Measures were selected to measure the effects of the program on bothchildren and families in a way that allowed comparison to other studies of earlyintervention as well as focusing in on some of the unique questions generated by thisparticular study.11Recruitment,training,and monitoring of diagnosticians. Anassessmentcoordinator and five diagnosticians were trained at the site by the EIRI assessment 6 79 ACDS 656 coordinator on September 2 and 3, 1987.The coordinator was a licensed school psychologist and had experience working with children who have Down syndrome. The diagnosticianshad experience and training with assessment for children with disabilities.All assessment personnel reached criteria on training materials, and pre- and posttesting for 1987 was completed without difficulty. The protocols were essentially error free.Pretesting.After parent consent was obtained and children were assigned togroups according to their scores on the UPAS, parents were contacted and individual appointments were made with parents for the pretest battery consisting of: Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI), Family Support Scale (FSS), Family Resource Scale (FRS), Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (FILE) and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III). The BDI was administered by a trained diagnostician who was not involved in providing other services to the family or the project and who was unaware of the child's group assignment. Testing occurred at the center where services were provided to all families. Parent report measures were completed by the parents and returned to the diagnostician coordinator.Pretesting in the Fall of 1987 was completed during the month of September.Parents were each paid $20 for participating. Since the newly trained personnel allhadconsiderableexperiencetestingpreschoolchildreninotherearly intervention projects in the area, their experience with children and families made the testing procedure run smoothly. Data concerning the children's progress on the UPAS +has collected inthe regular methods and was includedin the info:mation concerning pretest status of the children.Posttesting.Posttesting occurred during the last two weeks of May and thefirst week of June 1988. Appointments were made by the diagnostician coordinator,and assessments were completed by trained diagnosticians who did not provide otherservices to the family or the projeLc and who were unaware of the child's group 6L ACOS 657 assignment.In addition to the pretest measures, the child's progress was measuredon the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (to snow behavioral attainment), ReceptiveExpressive Emergent Language Scale (REEL) (to show communication competence), and the Uniform Performance Assessment System (UPAS) as an additional measure of child gain, and the child's behavioral style or temperament was assessed using the Carey Temperament Scale. Parent's skill in working with the child on the target behavior was recorded on videotape for analysis. A 3-point scale was developed to code theparent and child interaction on these tapes. The degree ofinvolvement of theparents as reported by the staff was further delineated to get more accurateinformation concerning the effectiveness of the additional parent training. In addition to progress as measured by the formal assessments, children were videotapedin the classroom on the target behaviors. These teacher/child tapes were scored similar to the parent/child tapes. Results and Discussion Results of posttest measures of child and family functioning are presented in Table 14.5.Results of the child functioning measures indicate that there were nostatistically significant differences at posttest between the basiL and expandedintervention groups on any of the measures.The results of posttest measures of family functioning appear as Table 14.6From this table, it may beseen that there were no statistically significantdifferences at posttest between the groups. The consistent low effect sizes alsodemonstrate how little difference there actually was between these two groups. TheFACES total score was significant at the .10 level and seems consistent with thetrend of the FACES subscales, but because of the large number of analyses done itis more than possible that this difference is due to sampling error. cL1 ACDS658Table 14.5Posttest Measures of Child Functioning for Alternative Intervention Groups for New York Study Variaole Covariates&.BasicIntervention GroupExpandedIntervention scores except wnere Total AE The means for 4esic or expanded education of father pretest scores were used in place of missirg data so computations could be made.

Effect Size (ES) is defined here as the difference between the groups (Expanded minus Basic) on the ANCOVA scores, divided by the standard deviationof the Basic Intervention Group (see Cohen, 1977; Glass, 1976; Tallmadge, 1977 for a more general discussion of the concept of Effect Size). On the Carey scale, all child indices were averaged into one score. The possible ranges were from 1 (perfect baby) to 6 (most difficult baby),thus higher scores are worse. The mother's view of child was rated as: 1worse than average; 2 average; 3better than average.

Because high raw scores are related to low percentiles, low raw scores and high percentiles are considered better. Scores for each subscale of the FACES are derived from the \"ideal\" score reported in the technical manual. Scores reported in the table indicatethe distance from 'ideal\" in raw score units. A score of 0 is Dest. Analyses for the FSS and FRS are based on raw scores indicating the number of supports or resources indicated Dy the family as being available.Nigher scores and positive ESs are considered better. No norming sample is reported for this measure. To assist with interpretation, a percentilescore is reported in the table based on all pretests collected as e part of the Longitudinal studies. A series of further analyses were done to test for other group differences.The first analysis tested whether actual attendance of parent and family members atoptional family events, such as the father's breakfast and sibling rap groups, wasassociated with higher scores on child and family measures. This analysis did not 6L 3BEST COPY AVAILABLE ACDS 660 reveal any significant differences between attenders and non-attenders. Next, the amount of time children with disabilities inboth groups spent in daycare wasexamined to see if a relationship existed between amount of time in daycare and scores on posttest measures. There were no significant differences on this measure. Finally, videotaped records of parent/child and teacher/child sessions were reviewedto determineif group differences existed. Results of this analysis showed nodifference in the parent-child nor in the teacher/child interactions. Conclusions As noted earlier, the rationale for doing this particular study was the thoughtthat equipping parents with specific skills to use in enhancing the developmentalprogress of their children would augment the regular parental involvement program enough to result in significant differences between experimental and control groupson project outcome measures. Much previous research had suggested that this wouldbe the case.Instead, there were few differences between the groups on project outcome measures. The most logical explanation for this finding is that the expandedparental involvement programwas not significantly different enough or intense enoughto produce group differences. An alternative explanation would be that the effects ofthe existing intervention program itself were so powerful that the parentalinvolvement component contributed very little to intervention effectiveness. Weconclude from the findings of this study that teaching parents specific skillsrequired to enhance the developmental progress of their infants and children was notpowerful enough to improve on gains made through the regular intervention program. CS4 Arkansas 661ARKANSAS SCHOOL FOR THE DEAFProject #15COMPARISON: Hearing Impaired Children -- Oral versus total communication (TC)training.CONTACTPERSONS:Jerrie Sue Finch, Director, Area Services; Gillis REPORT: 4-10-1991 Rationale for the Study Over the years there has been anation-wide controversy regarding thecommunicationmodeusedineducating childrenwithhearingimpairments(Greenberg, ralderon, & Kusche, 1984). Somearguethattotalcommunication q'D provides children with a better chance atearly,criticallanguageandcognitive development and most adequately prepares them for life in hearing and deaf communities.Alternatively, some argue that oral communication provides childrenwith a better chance of developing oral language skills they will rely on most inthe hearing world. Arguments accompanying these two stances are complex and thecontroversy remains largely unresolved. Despite the heated nature of this contro-versy, little well-controlled research has been conducted addressing the issue ofthe comparative benefits of each mode of communication used as an aspect of early intervention.This investigation compared the effects of two modes of communication 6L5 Arkansas 662as alternative forms of intervention on overall development of preschool childrenwith hearing impairments, with particular emphasis on language skill development.Since increasing emphasis in early intervention is placed on family-related needsand involvement, the impact of communication mode on family functioning was also addressed. Review al fRelated ResearchWhile proponents of oral/aural (use of spoken communication and development ofresidual hearing, hereafter referred to as \"Oral\") and total communication (use ofspoken language and development of residual hearing complemented by formal signlanguage and/or informal gestures, hereafter referred to as \"TC\") have long arguedthe relative benefits of these two approaches to education of children with hearingimpairments (White & Stevenson, 1975), empirical evidence in support of one methodover the other remains inconclusive. Grove and Rodda (1984) reviewed studiesindicating that children in TC programs had better cognitive and language skills thanchildren in Oral programs, while Nix (1981) reported only studies with the oppositefindings in his review. The studies reviewed by Nix led him to question claims madeby proponents of TC programs that children's auditory and verbal skills are enhancedby the use of signs.Research directly comparing Oral with TC approaches has been conducted usingquasi experiments with matched samples (e.g. Greenberg et al., 1984; Vernon & Koh,1970), or have evaluated the use of a pArticular communication mode using a pretest-posttest design. Further,very little data on early intervention with hearingimpaired preschoolers, per se, are aviilable. We have been able to find only twostudies of early intervention with hearing impaired children which have comparativelyaddressed the Oral/TC issue. In one of these studies, Greenberg et al. (1984) foundno statistically significant differences in communicative competence among childrenwho received Oral/aural or total communication training, but did report that TC6E6 :;:11:2 Arkansas 663 children had longer, more complex interactions with their mothers than Oral children did.These differences in parent-child interaction may have implications for family functioning.Moores (1974) compared children (21/2to41/2 years of age) in seven preschool programs over a four year period. Four of the programs used an Oral/aural approach, one used TC, and two used the Rochester method (i.e., word for word finger-spelling) at the start of the study, but by the end of the fourth year, only oneprogram was still using the Oral/aural approach. Despite this confound, Mooresconcluded that early use of TC isasignificant predictor of success in both communication skill and academic achievement. While the Greenberg study had fewer design flaws than Moores's study, both contained threats to their internal validity, such as questions about the comparability of children in the two groups, inadequate descriptions of intervention strategies, and questionable adequacy of the measures used.This study addressed issues raised in prior studies of children with hearingimpairments by using random assignment to groups, careful description of childrenand families included, selection of assessment measures that focus on communicationskills as well as cognitive and general development, and continuous monitoring oftreatment implementation. To establish the comparability of children in each of the groups,dataarepresentedregardingaidedandunaidedhearinglossesofparticipating children, their ages, length of exposure to Oral and/or TC programs,pretest scores on the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI), a parent rating ofgeneral health, indication of other services received, and parent hearing status.Family demographic measures are also presented, including socioeconomic status (SES),number of siblings and adults inthehome,and racial group membership. Theintervention strategy is fully described, and measures of child progress includeinstruments that were either developed specifically fJr hearing impaired populationsnr have been specifically adapted for use with children with hearing impairments. Arkansas 664Methods The Arkansas School for the Deaf preschool network consists of 10 center-basedpreschool sites throughout Arkansas, five of which participated in this study. Eachteacher at these five sites identified at least four children and their familieswilling to participate in the research program, and these children were enrolled in the project.The participating sites were located in Fayetteville, Forrest City,Fort Smith, Little Rock, and Russellville, Arkansas.A three hour, two-day-per-week, center-based program for children with hearingimpairments was conducted at the five sites. In addition, the preschool teachersmade home visits to the families in both groups using the SKI-HI program for homeintervention with families of children with hearing impairments. A comprehensiveset of treatment verification procedures were employed to document both treatmentgroup differences and overall program quality. SubjectsA total of 32 children and their parents were included as subjects in the study.The following section will summarize the methods used in recruiting and assigningsubjects to treatment groups. Additionally, results of the assignment to groups willbe presented with respec. to dlmographic characteristics and hearing loss andattrition that was experienced during the course of the three year study.Recruitment.Children participating in the early intervention programs at theArkansas School for the Deaf qualified for participation in the research on the basisof their degree of hearing loss. They had an unaided hearing loss of at least 50decibels (DB)in the better ear. An unaided hearing loss of between 50 and 90 DBwas considered moderate to severe, and a loss greater than 90 DB was considered profound.Chi)dren with additional disabilities were not eligible, with theexception of one child in the study who had mild cerebral palsy. cc c-s Arkanses 665 Parentsofallchildren who met these criteria were contacted and giveninformation about the research, and signed consent was obtained for approximately 90% of these children. Recruitment for this study ended in October, 1987.Assignment to groups. Children were randomly assigned to Oral or TC groupsafter stratification by level of hearing loss within preschool site (stratified bymoderate or profound losses).After stratification according to hearingloss, subjects were randomly assigned to groups by the EIRI coordinator to ensure that noprogram staff had knowledge of what program a particular child would receive. Fora complete description of the assignment procedures, see the 1986 Annual Report of the Early Intervention Effectiveness Institute.Subject attrition. As can be seen in Table 15.1, a total of 10 subjects droppedout of the study between pretest and the third posttest. Attrition was gradual.Thus, the first and second posttests have considerable more subjects than the third posttest.The main reason for attrition was parental preference toward a aifferentmode of communication, although two of the subjects dropped out because they movedout of the state and could not be located. One subject was not located for thesecond posttest but was located for the third posttest.

As can be seen in Table 15.1, no attrition was experienced in the TC group by the time of the first posttest, but two subjects attrited from the Oral group by that time. Attrition analysis of the Oral group atthe time ofthe first posttest indicated a significant difference between theattrited subjects and the active subjects in unaided hearing loss. The attrited subjects had statistically significantly greater hearing losses--the parents of whomfelt a TC program was more appropriate than the Oral program. This difference was no longer evident at the second and third posttests, however.At the time of thesecond and thlYd posttests, attrition appeared to have resulted in a significant group by attrition status interaction regarding percent of children in daycare more than 5 hours per day. These differences were not serious since it was likely theywere due to random fluctuation and because this variable is not strongly related tothe most critical outcome variables of this study. A statistically significantinteraction was found at the second and third pusttests on the pretest CommunicationTotal score of the Batteiie. The Communication score difference found on tne secondand third posttests attrition.analysis represents that the attrited Oral subjects,who, for the most part, attrited because parents felt their chi.d's level of hearingloss was too great to warrant an Oral program, perftrmed considerably lower than theothers in the study. It should also be noted that this subscale on the Battelle maybe biased against hearing-impaired populations and that these results maybe due tothe lack of reliability establiJled with this population. Other than these minordifferences, toe groups remained quite comparable on key demographic variables, andmeasures of child and family functioning, despite attrition.Demographic characteristics.

This difference was not evident between the groups included inthe second and third posttests. Another difference was found between the treatment group at each of the four testings regarding the years of education of the father.The Oral group reported significantly more years of education for the father than the TC group. This difference remained evident between the groups at each of the subsequent testings. Variables on which differences were found were considered for use as covariates in appropriate posttest analyses. Overall, however,the two groups were very comparable at pretest. Given the number of variables which were considered and the fact that the differences associated with developmental areas did not consistently favor one group, any slight differences between groups that wereidentified were likely the result of sampling fluctuation. Intervention Programs Asdicated above, all children received half-day center-based services at leasttwo days each week, and homeintervention using theSKI*HIcurriculum. Children in both groups received audiological services, appropriate hearing aids wereselected, and training in their proper use was provided to teachers and parents.Individuali7ed Education Plans (IEPs) were written for each child at programentry, and at the end of each academic year. Audiological, speech and language,psychological, and other assessment (e.g., occupational and physical therapy) were completed and used in initial IEP development. The Texas Language Curriculum Roadmapwas used during the schoolyear asthe basis for future IEP development and refinement.Audiological assessment was also conducted regularly, and comprehensiveassessments, including all of the above components, were conducted every three years.For purposes of description, the intervention can be divided into those serviceswhich were center-based, and those that were home-based.Center-based Program. Classroom activities were designed to promote expressiveand receptive language skills of all children, including word usage and concept Arkansas 672 development.Teachers administered the Ling Articulation Index to assess children's Oral development and followed up with the Texas Language Curriculum for general programmingguidelines.ObjectivesforIEPswereselectedbasedonthese instruments.A cognitively oriented approach to instruction that maximizes learning opportunities via structured and unstructured activities was used in the classroom. Structured activities were designed to match child interests and were presented via lesson plans that addressed specific objectives for each child.Using this child directed rather than teacher directed approach, activities could vary from the original planif the children demonstrated interest in related but unanticipated areas.For example, ina travel activity that was designed to take place in a pretend car, if a child decided that his car had wings and could fly, the activity could be redirected toward air travel.A typical schedule for a classroom day is presented below (all activities listed are in fact language activities, although only one is specifically called a \"language activity):9:00 -9:20 training time. Children take turns listeniny to theteacher with their backs to her as she makes various sounds.The child listening raises her/his hand when the sound isheard.9:50 - 10:10 AM: Free choice activity time. Children choose a play area inwhich they are interested (e.g. kitchen, chalk board, toybox), and interact with the teacher and other children in thatsetting.10:10 - 10:30 AM: Snack time. Milk and cookies are provided, and children mustvocalize or sign, as appropriate, to indicate what they want.Children are also given the opportunity to practice kitchenskills, such as pouring, measuring, etc.10:30 - 11:00 AM: Language activity. Children will play \"housekeeper\" today,using naturally occurring opportunities to communicate theirwants, needs, plans, and actions to the teacher and to eachother.11:00 - 11:30 AM: Gross motor activity. Children will play \"leap frog\" and\"London Bridge\" to develop both their motor skills and theirlistening/attending skills. f) 7 Arkansas673 11:30 - 11:50 AM: Clean-up andplantime.Children willhelp cleantheclassroom by putting toys away, etc. Plans for tomorrow'sactivities will be discussed, and the children's comments willbe used as appropriate to modify the teacher's plan. 11:50 - 12:00 PM: Prepare to leave and departure. Home visits.The SKI*HI curriculum (Clark, 1985) was designed for use in the homes of preschoolers with hearing impairments. It ptaided training for parents in managementf a child with a hearing impairment, hearing aid care and maintenance,language development activities (using the same mode of communication used in the classroom), and child management. Home visits were conducted by the child's center- based teacher to ensure consistency and generalization from school to home. The home visitors monitored child development and progress as well as parent skills and needs to facilitate appropriate home programming. The equivalent of an IEP was developed for this purpose. Home visits were initially made three times a month, and taperedoff as the family gained the skills and confidence to handle the daily concerns.of their child with a hearing impairment, as well as the concerns of the family.During the second and third years of the project, Oral and TC classes wereconducted by each teacher on different days of the week or at different times of day,such that treatment groups were separated at all times and the same teacher providedservice to both groups. Classroom dividers were used during the first year, andaltough groups were kept separate inthis manner,the teachers suggested that children be taught at separate times to improve both the quality of the.r instructionand their ability to teach in the appropriate mode (i.e., Oral or TC).Differences between oral and TCArograms. The Oral group was instructed using Oralintervention techniques including auditory training and development of Oral skills.Auditory training requires the child to respond to sound when Ole sound sourceisout ofsight,asinthe sample daily schedule below, andthe Oral procedures require the child to vocalize all communications. 6( 3 Arkansas 674The TC group was trained using a comprehensive communication program thatpromotes the use of Oral/aural skills (by encouraging vocalization and using the sameauditory training used with the Oral group) but encouraged the use of Signed ExactEnglish II (SEE II) and other gestures as needed for communication. Parents in the TC group were trained in SEE II as part of their SKI-HI program and were encouragedto use sign language with their child. Treatment VerificationA number of procedures were used to verify that treatment were implemented as intended.They are described below.Collection of attendance data. The child's participation in the program wasrecorded according to the days of attendance at the center-based program Attendance rates across the three years was comparable between the two groups (mean attendancefor the oral group was 75.7% while the mean attendance for TC group was 78.6%). Teacher evaluations. The preschool sk.A.c.,:isor evaluated teachers on a 3-pointscale (3 = criteria fully met; 2 = partially met; 1= not met) that assessed thefollowing: teacher assessment skills; IEP development skills; IEP implementationskills; presentation of instruction; and instructional environment. Average ratings by teacher were 3.0, 2.58, 2.9, 2.71, and 3.0. Additionally, teachers were rankedin quartiles (i.e., top 25%, top 50%, bottom 50%, and bottom 25%) relative to otherteachers the supervisor has worked with. Two teachers were ranked in the top 25%.two in the top 50%, and one in the bottom 50%. Since teachers taught children inboth groups, it is unlikely that the quality of teacher could have confounded thefindings of the study with regard to Oral vs.TC.These data suggest that thepreschool teachers at ASO were performing their duties as well as or better thanother teachers in comparable settings. Arkansas 675Chfld health and additlonal serviced. Ratings of child's health were collectedfrom each child's parent at the time of each testing and indicated no statistically significant differences on any in any of the health related areas. The two treatmentgroups were also comparable with respect to the amount of additional servicesreceived beyond that provide by the intervention program. The main areas in whichadditional services were provided were speech therapy (an overall mean of 45.6 hoursduring the year for all subjerts in the study) and daycare (an overall mean of 213hours during the year).Site review.Formal site reviews were conducted in April 1987, April 1988,and March 1989. While treatment differences were found to be adequate during thefirst year, the shift to alternating the times at which the groups were present forinstructionhadthedesiredimpactoffurther emphasizing those differences.Specifically, teachers were less likely to use sign with the Oral group when thatgroup was in class and the TC group was not. Dr. Roberto Gonzales of the Universityof Northern Colorado, an independent reviewer who viewed classroom videotapes fromthe 1987-1988 school year, reported that the quality of instruction fo,' both groupswas good and that clear communication mode differences were present and was the only,difference between the groups.Otherwise, the ASO program was judged to be in full or nearly full compliancewith EIRI site review quality criteria. IEP development and lesson planning weregood, with allIEP criteria being met or nearly met Uy all teachers. Teachingquality was found to be very good in both communication modes by the EIRI and ASOreviewers, as well as by the independent reviewer. Overall, the preschool programwas considered to be of high quality as compared to other TC and oral/aur3l programswith similar philosophical orientations.Use of communication mode at home. At the time of the third posttest, parentswere dsked about their use of communication modes at home. Out of the 9 children 7C Arkansas 676for whom data were collected in the Oral group, 7 spent the majority of their time away from school using Oral communication, although 4 of these reported using TC some of the time.Parents of 1 of the 9 children in the Oral group reported using TC themajority of the time, while 1 other parent reported using Oral half of the time and TC the other half.Out of the 11 children in the TC group, 4 of the parents reported using TC themajority of the time, although 2 of these cour reported using Oral some of the time. A total of 5 of the 11 children's parents reported that they used Oral and TC equally at home.Finally, 2 of the children in the TC group reported using Oral the majorityof the time.It is not surprising that parents in the TC group relied on oralcommunication fairly frequently since sign language can often be difficult for most narents to learn.Cost of alternative interventions. Program costs were calculated using the ingredientsapproach.Theingredientsapproachisasystematic,well-testedprocedure fcr identifying all ofthe socialcosts for implementing alternative programs,includingcoststhatareoften omitted from cost analysissuchas contributed (in-kind) and shared resources. In this approach, an exhaustive listof resources used by each alternative is developed, and the ingredients one costedaccording to observed market values (e.g., salaries) or opportunity cost (e.g.,narent time).An opportunity cost is the value of a resource inits ncxt best alternative use. For example, parents participating in intervention activities couldhave been engaged in other productive activities; these foregone activities represent acosttoparents.Since we have noinformation about any one individual'sopportunity costs, we estimated the value of an individual's time based on national data.The amount of parent or non-parent volunteer time required for the study wasassigned the pecuniary value of $9 per hour based on the \"median usual weekly earning 7C 1 Arkansas 677 for full-time work\" plus benefits (U.S.Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989).All costs are in 1990 dollars. In cases where program costs were compared over several years, costs were adjusted for inflation using the Fixed Weighted Price Index for state and local government purchases (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1988).In addition, the total costs of program and contributed resources were discounted using discount rates of 3% and 5%. Discounting adjusts the costs for the real rate ofreturn that the program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere.Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time.Because the only difference between groups in this study was the mode of communication used, between group cost differences were neither expected nor found. All costs were thus averaged across all children in the study. Total cost per child in 1990 dollars averaged $4,298 for school services only, and $6,413 when the cost of parent-provided time and transportation were included. Costs of direct service (teachers,aides,supervisor,and consultants) were or over 70% of the school services costand 45% ofthetotalcost with parent transportation. Parent transportation costs included both mileage and traveling time. Adjustments were made for parents who car-pooled. All cost data in Table 15.4 were adjusted for inflation to1990 dollars. Inaddition,atthe bottom of Table 15.4, the figures are discounted at 3% and 5%. Data CollectionData on all participants were collected at the time of group assignment andannually thereafter, as summarized below.Recruitment4rainin1and monitorin fdia nosticians. Threelocaldiagnosticians and an assessment supervisor were by EIRI staff to administerthe standard pretest and posttest measures. Professors at local universities and professionals in local social service agencies were asked if they or others they knew70 2 4 Arkansas 678Tabie 15.4Cost Pei Child for Arkansas School for the Deaf (1990 Dollars) Resources Cost Per Child may not add up due to rounding errors. were willing to do testing. One gradua1:e student and three professionals at a localrehabilitation program were trained in administration of the Battelle DevelopmentalInventory (BDI). The most experienced professional was identified as an assessment coordinator.All diagnosticians viewed videotapes of administration procedures for 21 Arkansac 679 the Battclle Developmental Inventory (BDI), reviewed the BDI administration manual,and completed a self-test of BDI procedures before attending a tro-day training session.11L_raining session addressed all facets of the BDJ, and included a competency test. Finally,persons who completed the training completed three practicetests,oneof which was bothshadow scored andvideotapedbythe coordinator.The videotape was sent to EIRI for review, and an interrater agreement of .85ias required before certification as a diagnosti:jen.The supervisor and two of the diagnosticians held Ph.D.s and the other had a master's degree. Student diagnosticians who administered the complementary measures were selected by faculty of the Department of Speech and Language Pathology atthe University of Central Arkansas (UCA) based on completioh of a specified set of courses in speech pathology. All diagnosticians were proficient in sign larguage.Student testers from UCA were trained in sign language and had access to the teacher daring testing, such that optimal communication with the child was ma;ntained. L.Ich diagnostician tests approximately the same number of children in each group. Testing was scheduled by the local coordinator in cooperation with the assessment supervior, who shadow scorcd 10% of the test administrations. Shadow scored tests indicatedan average of 93.3% agreewnt, with a range of 91% to 96%. Agreement was calculatedoy dividing the number of exact agreements in scoring items adClistered by the i.otal number of items administered. Exact agreement that scoredan item'0,\"1,' or '2.' Pretest.The pretest battery co.sisting of the Battelle Developmental Inventory(BDI), the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Family Support Scale (FSS), Family ResourceScale (FRS), Family Inventory of Life Events (FILE), and the Family Adaptability andCohesinn Evaluation Scales (FACES) was administered to 32 children and families.Families were given a $20 incentive for their participation in pretesting. Testingwas conducted by one of the diagnosticians, each of whom is a fluent signer and 0.1AI Arkansas 680unaware of the child's group assignment. Mode of administration for the BDI (i.e.,Oral vs. TC) was determined by the examiner after a period of interaction with thechild and family, and was noted on the test protocol. Testing occurred in roomsprovided at the preschool site where the child attended class. Mothers completed the fam'ily measures following administration of the BCI, and fathers (when possible)completed the Family Support Scale only. If the father or other male was presentii the home but was not at the testing session, the parent was given a copy of theFamily Support Scale to take home for him/her to complete. The diagnosticians completed testing reports and transmitted all data to the.assessment supervisor, whochecked the scoring accuracy and forwarded the protocols to EIRI via certified mail. Posttest #1.The first round of posttesting occurred during April and May, 1987for children enrolled during the 1986-87 academic year, and in April and May, 1988for those who were not enrolled until the 1987-88 academic year, allowing five tosix months of intervention between pre- and posttesting. The posttest battery wasadministered in two sessions, as described below.The first session was conducted by graduate practicum students from thedepartment of speech pathology at the University cf Central Arkansas (UCA). Testsadministered at this time were the Receptive and Expressive Language sections of theReynell Developmental Language Scales. Each of these measures was administered by thesame student toallchildren.Thatis,(w.e,student did all the ReynellReceptives, another all the Reynell Expressives, etc. Because of the nature of thesetests ard the experimental comparison (Oral vs. TC), these diagnosticians knew themode of communication used py the child, hut were unaware of the purpose of the study.Testc- were administered in the mode appropriate to the child's group. Thegraduate students were supervised by faculty from UCA.The 3econd session was adminisLered by the same set of naive diagnosticians,but not ne.cessarily the same diagnostician, who administered the pretests. In Arkansas 681addition to the instruments used at pretest, mothers completed the Parent SurveyForm, the Parent Report of Child's Health, the Additional Services Form, and the Parent Satisfaction with Services Form; teachers completed the Meadow-Kendall on each child in their classroom. Parents were paid a $30 incentive for testing. Posttest #2.The second round of posttest data collection was conducted fromApril through June, 1988. The procedures used and measures included were the same as those employed in the first posttest session. Posttest #3.Posttest #3 included all of the measures used in Posttest #2 withthe additional of a parent survey intended to elicit attitudes about their child'sexperienceintheintervention program. Additionally,a measure was used to determinethextenttowhichchildrenwereusingtheirassignedmodeof communication outside of intervention and to determine parents attitudes toward thecommunication mode being usea. The latter adaition included a semantic attitude.checklist developed by the project on which parents indicated how much of the timetheir communication with their child was, for example, \"productive.\" Other wordson which parent were asked to rate their communication included,for example: frustrating, rewarding, confusing, comfortable, relaxed, business-like, interactive,fun, natural, etc. Results and Discussion The following section will present the results of the study with respect to thefollowing research questions: 1.To what extent are the two treatment groups comparable on pretestmeasures or child and parent functioning? 2.To what extent are there differences between the treatment groups onmeasures of child functioning at first, second, and third posttests? 3.To what extent are there differences between the treatment groups onmeasures of family functioning at first, second, and third posttests? 4.Whatisthe relationship between thecosts and effects of eachtreatment? '7; Arkanlas 682Comparability of Groups at PretestPretest results from the measures of child functioning are summarized in Table 15.5 and includes the analysis of pretest scores for subjects that were included at each of the testings; pretest, first, second and third posttests. As can be seen, the two treatment groups demonstrated comparable abilities on the pretest measures of child functioning. While itis possible that attrition would have caused thecomparability of Ole groups to be negatively changed across the subsequent threeyears of the study, this was not the case until the third posttest.

Thus, thecommunication domain score on the Battelle was used as covariate in third posttest analysis.Regarding measures of family functioning, the groups appeared to be fairlycomparable on pretest measures over the cour:e of the four testings (see Table 15.6).The \"other-related\" score on the PSI was also identified as covariate to beused in posttest analyses, since a statistically significant difference was foundbetween the groups in each year's analysis. Additionally, a statistically signifi- cant difference (p = .09) was found on the FILE at pretest in favor of the TC group. Posttest Measures of Child FunctionihgTable 15.7 summarizes the results of pcsttest analyses on the measures of childfunctioning.As can be seen, no statistically significant differences were foundon the Battelle at the first, second, or third posttests with exception of a smalldifference found at the third posttest on the Fine Motor domain. No differenceswere found on the Reynell at any of the posttests indicating that neither mode ofcommunication used as a part of early intervention was superior with regard to itseffect on receptive and/or expressive language development. Further, no significantdifferences were found on the main scales of the Meadow-Kendall at any of theposttests with the exception of a difference on the sociable, communicative behaviorscales at the second posttest. In this case, the Total Communica'cion group scoredsignificantly higher than the oral group suggesting, perhaps, that the children inthis group had greater early success in communicating socially and that the use of totalcommunicationhad facilitated thisbehavior more sothandidtheoralcommunication mode. It is more likely, however, that .chese differences were due torandom fluctuation in light of the relatively large number of measures examined. ..11 SsL.

The results of thisanalysis indicated that the fathers in the TC group perceived their communicationwith their child more positively than did the fathers in the Oral group (F = 5.05, p=.05).Althoughnotstatistically significantly higher, the TC mothers'perceptions of their communication with their child were slightly more positive thanthe Oral mothers (F = 1.45, p = .25). Conclusions When posed with the issue of the most appropriate mode of communication to be used in early intervention, educators and experienced parents often have fairly firm Arkansas 691 criteriafordetermining what typesofchildrenand familiesshould receive intervention in what communication mode. Identifying specific child and families characteristics which are most conducive to a particular mode of communication would requireaverylargegroupstudy under which alternative interventions were carefully controlled. Such a large group study on a low incidence disability, such ashearingimpairments, isdifficulttoaccomplish.Thisstudy,thoughnot including large enough groups to warrant extensive analysis by specific child andfam'ly characteristics, indicated that when children and families from a variety of backgrounds,socioeconomic status, and familiarity with deafness were randomlyassigned to a mode of communication for use in high-quality early intervention programs, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of general child development (as measured by the Battelle) or on any of the other measures of childfunctioning which closely examined communication skills.Further,fewdifferences were found on measures of family stress, adaptability and cohesion.These findings suggest that the key to effective early intervention withchildren with hearing impairments may not be the mode of communication which is used,butislikely tobe foundin other variables effecting the quality ofintervention such as the level of training and experience of the teacher, teacher-pupil ratio, parent involvement, and any number of other variables which may be contributing.Future research should, therefore,be focused on determining the effectsofthesevariablesonearlyintervention with children with hearingimpairments and their families with the intent of refining the criteria for bestearly intervention practices with this population. 716 PITCH 692PROJECT PITCHProject #16 COMPARISON: Moderately speech disordered, 3and 4 year olds, home parenttraining speech therapy services versus clinic-based speech therapy services.LOCAL CONTACT PERSON: Bunny McCoun, Speech The. Project EisermanLOCATION:Salt Lake City, UtahDATE OF REPORT: 4-10-* 991 Rationale for Study P.L.99-457mandatesparentalinvolvement in early intervention. Thequestion of how to most appropriately involveparents,however,remainsa topic of much discussion and introspec-tion by thosein the field.A commonapproach to fulfilling the mandate is to involveparentsratherminimallybyoffering a monthly parent support group or some other informal mechanism for keeping parents informed about their child's progress and ways they might contribute. In other programs, however, parents are more intensively trained to work directly with the child and are given the responsibility to provide the primary, direct service intervention (Weiner & Koppelman, 1987)One area in which parents have reportedly been quite successful in providingprimary direct services to their special needs child is early intervention withspeech disordered children (Barnett et al., 1988; McCoun, 1988). Programs in which parents have been involved very minimally, however, have also demonstrated success Stoneburner, Studley, & Teska, 1968).Unfortunately, studies evaluating of both approaches are fraught with methodological weaknesses; furthermore,varying degrees of parental involvement have seldom been compared systematically (Gatling & White, 1987; Reeder & Casto, 1984; White et al., 1989). Experimental group studies, though one of the most valuable 1.f:search strategiesfor comparing Le effects of alternative interventions, have lot been adequatelyemnloyed to examine the effectiveness of a parents as therapists approach with a traditionalclinical approach to speech therapy. Thus,the present study was designed to compare the costs and effects of a home parent training arproach versus a traditional clinic-based approach to early intervention speech therapy using a randoffized experimental design. Review of Related Research Gatling and White (1987) reviewed 162 early inter:ention studies that included a substantial parental involvement component (including, but not limited to, speech- related intervention). They subdivided the studies into two main categories based on the types of parent involvement used: (a) parental assistance to the child; and (b) support provided to parents and family. Eighty-one percent of the studies with parental involvement components included primarily or solely involvement of the firsttype, parental assistance to the child, and specifically as developmental therapists for their children.Both the Gatling and White review and a review by Reeder and Casto (1984)reported that over 150 studies cited in recent reviews of the early interventionresearch supported the conclusion that parents can be effective teachers of theirchildren who are disadvantaged, at-risk, or disabled (e.g. Bronfenbrenner, 1974;Comptroller General, 1979; Dudzinski & Peters, 1977; Garland, & Hess, notappropriate, data collectors naive,interrater reliability for andto generalize thefindings to here ofpreviousresearch program in which children received services directly from aprofessionalspeechpathologist, or to 7I ()1% PITCH 695 a home parent training program in which children received services from their parents who were being trained by a professional speech pathologist twice a month. Project PITCH (Preschool Intervention and Training for Children with Handicaps) had served preschool children who were disabled and developmentally delayed (age birth to 5 years) within Granite School District since 1975. Since its beginning, Project PITCH had provided a home-based service with an emphasis on training parentsto provide special intervention services for their children. Special education teachers, speech pathologists, a social worker, and a registered nurse comprised theProject PITCH staff that provided services to approximately 100 children during a9-month school year. Forty of these children solely required speech and language related services.Based on a developmental evaluation using the Brigance Diagnostic DevelopmentalInventory of Early Development conducted by one of the staff members, itwasdetermined whether a particular child demonstrated serious developmental delays ora disability that would interfere with his/her learning. The specific criterion forinclusion in the program was that the child be at least 1 year delayed in at leastone developmental domain of the Brigance. Two speech pathologists provided thespeech related services examined by this study. Each carried a case load of 20 childrenand wroteanIndividualized Educational Program for each child with assistance from the child's parents.Program staff reported that previously collected data on student progress haddemonstrated that parents were able to work successfully as teachers for theirpreschool children who were developmentally delayed or disabled and were committedto their role in providing this service. While the traditional PITCH service modelwas based on the assumption that providing service via parents as interventionistsis more cost-effective than traditional child-centered therapy, PITCH personnel hadnever tested their assumption and were interestedinconducting an objective 71:0 PITCH696 evaluation of this hypothesis.Hence, Project PITCH personnel supported thisresearch project with the objective of determining whether involving parents in directserviceastherapiststotheir children isindeedas effective asa traditional clin4cal model with minimal parent involvement.During the first year of the study, research activities were coordinated by the two speech therapists who communicated directly with the EIRI site coordinator. Both therapists were informed of all research procedures, and regular weekly contacts with the EIRI coordinator assured that these procedures were followed.During the second year of the project, 12 of the 40 children whose age and speech delays still met thequalification criteria for the project continued to be served in their respective programs.The other 28 subjects no longer met the qualification criteria, either in terms of age or speech delays, but were followed and posttested at the end of the year.One speech therapist coordinated all of the research activities during the second year and also communicated directly with the EIRI site coordinator. In the remainder of this report, the cohort of subjects which continued to receive services during the second year will be referred to as the \"Two-year cohort\" and the cohortof subjects which exited the program after one year but who continued to be followed will be referred to as the \"One-year Cohort.\" During the third year of this study, all 40 subjects were in follow-up status. SubjectsA total of 40 3- to 5-year-old children and their parents were included assubjects in the study. The following section will summarize the methods used inrecruiting and assigning subjects to one of the two groups. Additionally, theresults of the assignment to groups will be presented with respect to demographic characteristics.Recruitment.Children were identified for speech therapy services in theGranite School District through several processes during the first 2 months of the PITCH 697 school year, beginning September, 1987. No subjects were enrolled in the study thereafter.The majority of those identified were children ofparents who, suspecting a speech problem, contacted their school or school district that, in turn, referred the children to the Project. Parents who had been served by Project PITCHin previous years were also asked to refer others to the program who might need service. Additionally, all schools in the district informed their teachers, who then informed parents of the Project PITCH services that were available. Other referral sources included the State Department of Health, local pediatricians, public healthnurses, and social services agencies, a special article in the area newspaper and public service radio spots.Children qualified for inclusion in the project on the basis of age and speech articulationabilities(children3-5 yearsofage,performingbelowthe5th percentile on the Goldman-Fristoe, Sounds-in-Words Subtest qualified). Additionally, these children were at least 6 months to a year delayed in one or more of the domains of the Battelle Developmental Inventory. Of the 41 children identified for services,40 of the parents elected to participate in the research. The parent who did not choose to participate was only interested in obtaining direct therapy for the child in the home; a service provided by neither of the treatments in the study.Assignment to groups. Children who met the age and speech requirements were included as potential subjects. After receiving informed consent agreements from the children's parents, the Project PITCH therapist in charge of coordinating childenrollment contacted the EIRI coordinator and provided the articulation status and age data.After stratification on these variables, subjects were randomly assignedto groups by the EIRI coordinator to ensure that PITCH program staff had no influenceon what treatment a particular child would receive. Additionally, since childrenwere enrolled continuously over a 2-month period, the dates in which children were PITCH 698 identified were tracked to ensure that children were assigned io treatments in the order in which they were identified.Demographic characteristics. Of the 40 children who qualified for service, 22 were 3-year-olds while 18 were 4-year-olds. At the time of enrollment, subjects assigned to the traditional clinic-based program ranged in age from 37 to 57 months (mean . 46.2, SD 5.32), while subjects assigned to the home parent training programranged in age from 39 to 58 months (mean = 48.0, SD 6.47).As can be seen in Table 16.1, with the exception of number of siblings, nostatistically significant differences (p < .10) between the two treatment groups were found oh any of the demographic variables. The sample population was predominantlymale, consisting of 33 males and 7 females, who, with one exception, lived in homeswith both the mother and father. The predominance of males inthis study is consistent with findings of several studies that have indicated that males tend tocomprise approximately 71% of the preschool children requiring specch and languagetherapy (Department of Education, 1984). The preponderance of children in this sample who were white and from two parent homes, however, is not representative ofthe total population of children who receive speech therapy. Thus, these variablesshould be kept inmind when generalizing the findings of the study to other populations.Thissamplerepresents asomewhatdiversegroup with respect toparent educational and income levels. A total of 10 (25%) of the mothers' highest completedyear of education was the 12th grade. While the other 30 (75%) of the mothersindicated some college education, a total of 16 (53%) of the 30 reported that thehigh school diploma was the highest diploma received. Of those who obtained college educations,12(30.,)received bachelor's degrees and 2(5%)received master's degrees.Although not statistically different, it should be noted that there werealmost twice as many mothers in the clinic-based group (9) who received college 723 PITCH699 Tabde 16.1Pretest Comparability of Groups on dernograWhic Characteristics Variable Age of child in months asof 7/1/87Age of mother in yearsAge of father in years Percent male'Years of education formotherYears of education forfatherPercent with bothparents living at home Percent of children who'are CaucasianHours per week motheremployedHours per week fatheremployed Percent as technicalmanagerial or abovePercent of fathers'employed as technicalmanagerial 4Total income 6Percent with mother as.primary caregiverPertent of children more 8.0(13.3)20.49 40.0(11.8)18 20 65 20.74 $26,149($9,262)20$28,749($8,131)20.35 95 20 100 20.32 10 20 o 20.15 2.3(1.4)20 3.3(1.9)20.08 100 20 100 201.00 Statistical analyses for these variables were based on a t.test where those children or families possessingthe trait or characteristic were scored \"1,u and those not possessing the trait or characteristic were scored BEST COPY AVAILABLE 7^ PITCH 700degrees than in the home parent training group (5). This finding is important because it has been suggested that parent education ,:orrelates positively with child performance (Scarr & Weinberg, 1983). Hence, the home parent training group may have been slightly disadvantaged in this regard.With respect to economic status, parents' incomes ranged from $11,000 to over$50,000 per year. A total of 25 (63%) of the parents reported a yearly income ofless than $30,000, while 12 (30%) of the parents reported a yearly income between$30,000 and $40,000 and 3 (8%) reported a yearly income over $40,000, only one ofwhom reported an income greater than $50,000. Itis also interesting to note that of the 40 mothers involved in the study,25 (63%) were not employed outside the home, although only 5 (13%) reported workingfull-time (40 hours per week or more). Since this study examined the effects of parents (mothers) as home interventionists, it is especially important to note thatthere was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the numberof mothers unemployed nor with respect to the number of hours employed per week.Table 16.2 summarizes the demographic data on the two cohorts from the secondyear of the study. As can be seen, no statistically significant differences werefound for the main effects of cohort or treatment group except for age of child whichwas expected since the older children were in the one-year cohort and the youngerchildren were in the two-year cohort. A statistically significant interaction wasfound for age of mother with home-based mothers in the two-year cohort being youngerthan home-based mothers in the one-year cohort, and clinic-based mothers in the one-year cohort being younger than clinic-based mothers in the two-year cohort. The samerelationship was seenwithrespecttoageoffathers where astatisticallysignificantinteraction was also found.

Intervention ProgramsDuring the first year of the project, two speech pathologists, one for each of the two interventions, devoted 20 hours per week to serving a caseload of 20 children each.The first year included a seven-month intervention period from October to May.During the second year, one therapist delivered both sets of services which included a caseload of 12 children; 7 in the clinic-based group and 5 in the home parent training group. The second year included an eight-month intervention period from September through April. In both years, the same phonetic and phonological approaches were used in each group. The phonetic approach included techniques such as: demonstration of sound placement; auditory training for sound discrimination; sound practice in isolation and nonsense syllables; sound rehearsal in single word production, short phrases, sentences, and extended speech. With the phonological approach, the relationships between sounds and language were examined.Instead of correcting each misarticulated sound one at a time, the child's speech was analyzed for patterns of errors, and the child was taught to contrast his or her incorrectfeature use with the use of the proper feature. Additionally, children in both groupsreceivedtraininginlanguageskillsandminimalpracticeinother developmental areas where delays were indicated including personal/social, adaptive,motor, and cognitive domains. During the third year, all of the children were enrolled in public school programs, and no early intervention was provided since noneof the subjects still qualified due to their age.Clinic-based program. One group of children received a traditional clinical approachin which therapy was provided to groups of two children by a certified speech pathologist. This service was delivered in a clinic-based setting for 1 hour each week.7 :: s PITCH 703 Using the iretest results, the speech pathologist for the clinic-based program paired children with similar sound errors. The parents in this group were involved in setting goals for the children's Individualized Educational Program (IEP), as isrequired by P.L. 99-457, although the parents were not present during any of the therapy sessions and received no formal training for working with their children at home.Based on records kept during the project, the speech pathologist in theclinic-based group typically spent 10 to 12 hours per week in service and 8 to 10hours per week in preparation and record keeping activities during the first year of the project. During the second year, the pathologist spent 2 to 3 hours per week in services (7 children) and 2 to 3 hours per week in preparation and record keeping activities.Home parent training. The second group of children received therapy at homefrom their mothers who were trained in speech therapy techniques. The training of the mothers occurred during 40-minute visits twice a month made by a certified speech pathologist.Parent training included techniques for correcting articulation problems,techniques in auditory training, and the appropriate sequence for teaching soundsas followed in the clinic-based group (isolation, nonsense syllables, single words, and connected speech). At each session, the speech pathologist evaluated the childinformally to instruct mothers in procedures to be used during the following weeks.Mothers were provided with task-analyzed procedures that included charting techniquesand data-keeping methods as a basis for the mother to adapt therapy as the child progressed.The speech pathologist in the home parent training group was responsible forevaluating the child and training the parent while the parent was responsible forconducting the child's therapy and maintaining the data. Parents were encouragedto work daily with their children and to maintain a minimum schedule of 20 to 30 7`' (44., '71' PITCH 704 minutes of therapy, four times weekly. Based on records kept during the project, the therapist in the home parent training program typically spent approximately 7 hours per week training mothers, 4 to 5 hours in transit, and between 7 to 8 hours in preparation and record keeping during the first year of the project. During the second year,the therapist spent approximately 3 to 4 hours per week training mothers, one hour in transit, and 2 to 3 hours in preparation and record keeping. Treatment VerificationBetween December 1, 1987, and March 15, 1989, data were collected to documentthe nature of the early intervention program at Project PITCH and to verify that the alternative treatments were being implemented as intended. Several different types of data including child attendance data, data about the degree to which parents were involved,videotapingofinterventions, andthesupervisor'sevaluationsof therapists were included and are discussed briefly below.Attendance Data. Attendance data were kept continually by each interventionist,and completed forms were submitted monthly to the EIRI site coordinator. Thecoordinator reviewed attendance to determine ifanysubjects'attendance was irregular.If this was found, the coordinator arranged to talk with the intervenor to see how attendance for that particular child could be encouraged. Attendance data were then compiled by an EIRI clerk who calculated each child's attendance rate. Attendance was high in both groups. During the first year, the mean attendance ratein the clinic-based treatment was 88%, ranging from 74% to 100% attendance.The mean attendance rate during the first year in the home parent training group was96%, ranging from 85% to 100% attendance. Although attendance was quite high in bothgroups, this difference in attendance between groups was statistically significantlydifferent (p < .001). As might be expected, this finding indicates that the home- 7 3 0 PITCH 705 based programwas more conducive to higher rates of attendance since the intervention was brought to the child's home.During the second year, the attendance ra w. for the home parent training groupremained at the same high level, but the attendance rate for the clinic-based group dropped somewhat. The mean attendance rate for the home parent training group was96% during the second year with the individual attendance rate ranging from 88% to 100%.The mean attendance rate for the clinic-based group was 66% during the secondyear, with the individual attendance rates ranging from 18% to 94%.The difference in attendance was found to be statistically significant (p< .05).Parent Involvement Data. Four procedures were used for assessing the level ofparent involvement during the first year: (1) parents were interviewed over thetelephone twice during the year by a third party interviewer from EIRI; (2) parentswere rated by the two therapists regarding their involvement with their child who was receiving therapy; (3) parents were interviewed (after the therapist evaluation)by the therapists regarding their involvement; and (4) parents were ranked by thetherapists using the Quality of Parent Involvement Form. During the second year, parents were interviewed by EIRI staff tnice regarding their involvement.The results of these first-year procedures (see Table 16.3) indicated that theparent reports to the therapist and parent reports to a third party interviewer weremoderately correlated (r = .459, p = .001) with a 65% agreement rate between the twotypes of reports. These data show that parents in the home parent training groupreported spending significantly more minutes per week working with their child thanparents in the clinic-based group. Itis important to note that although the twoare correlated, parents' reports given to the therapist were noticeably higher thanreports of time given to the third- party interviewer. Additionally, there was some indication during the interviews that parents in the clinic-based group we-e defining\"time spent with child\" differently from parents in the home parent training group.Clinic-based parents seemed to be more liberal in their definition, including time731 PITCH706 perweek5 > week Parents report to third-partyinterviewer 1- <1 hour perweek2 withtheir children onspeech related (p < (see Table 16.3). Interestingly,reports madeby thetherapists prior to PITCH 707 rating were found between the ratings and the third party interview and therapists' interviews, respectively). Both therapists estimated the parents in their group to be spending approximately 11/2 hours per week. For the home parent training therapist, this estimate was noticeably lower than either of the parents' reports of their time. Although less noticeable, the clinic-based therapists' estimate was also considerably lower than the parents' reports of their time.The fact that these data do not correlate highly with one another suggests that parent involvement is very difficult to assess without using observational techniques which were beyond the scope of this study. Consequently, these data do not provide a means for reliably partitioning parents according to the number of hours they spent working with their child each week. These data, especially the data reported by the parents themselves, do suggest that parents in the home parent training group tended to be more involved with their child's development than the parents in the clinic- based group, although an exact estimate of time differences is difficult to make. Table 16.3 also presents the results of the interviewers' ratings of the Quality of Parent Involvement. These results suggest that the groups were comparable with respect to parents' level of support for their child's respective program. As can also be seen, the parents in the home parent training group were rated significantlyhigher than parents in the clinic-based group with respect to knowledge of their child's condition.Supervisor's evaluation oftherapists.ThePITCHsupervisorconducted observational evaluations of the two therapists twice during the first year. During the second year, one therapist delivered both interventions and was evaluated once during the year. The evaluations indicated that the therapists were performing \"outstandingly\" in each of the areas evaluated: academic expectations, academic learning time, classroom/case management, curricular congruence, direct instruction, homework,parentalinvolvement,rewardsforachievement,teacherquestioning PITCH708 practices, monitoring student progress and evaluative feedback, and reinforcement of self-concept.Videotaping of the treatments. Two intervention sessions were videotaped duringboth the first and second year in each of the treatments with the objective of documenting the activities used in a typical session. The EIRI coordinator and a third-party evaluator observed the videotapes to determine if the sessions reflected the types of practices specified for each treatment. The third-party evaluator, who was unaware of the specific objectives of the study, was asked to provide a written description of each treatment and to specify how each was similar and different from the other.The results indicated that both interventions were consistent vdth what was proposed.Anecdotal records kept by therapists. Anecdotal records were kept by each of the therapists. These records documented the types of therapy included in eachsession and reflected the respective approaches described above. Site ReviewA formal site review was conducted during the first year by the EIRI coordinatorto ensure that the treatments were being implemented as intended and that all predetermined procedures were being followed as specified. The site review consisted of the following: a cumulative review of six subjects' folders, direct classroom and home visit observations, interviews with interventionists, and interviews withthree parents. Thesite reviewincludedareview ofservices for children,observations of interactions between staff and children, a review of curriculummaterials and administration, and an evaluation of the physical arrangements. Allof these areas ware found to be functioning in an excellent manner with very fewsuggestions being made for improvement. A full report of this site review is available from the EIRI site coordinator. '74'3.tt PITCH 709 Theranist's use of ttme. To determine if therapists during the first year were actually spending similar amounts of time to deliver services to 20 children, they were asked to track their time over a week period, twice during the year. The results of the time tracking indicated a negligible difference between the total hours spent by the two therapists each week.The first time tracking sample indicatedthat the clinic-based therapist spent19.5 hours preparing for and delivering services to her case load while the home parent training therapist spent 18.5 hours.Thesecondtimetracking sample indicated that the clinic-based therapist spent 20 hours while the home parent training therapist spent 17 hours. Both therapists reported that their time varies from week to week between 1to 2 hours either direction. The second year therapist spent her time, proportionally, in a similar way as the therapists from year one. She spent approximately 12 hours delivering the two services to the 12 children served the second year. CostofAlternative interventionsDetermining the cost of each program alternative requires identifying all the resources necessary to operate the programs (includingin-kind resources), and assigning a monetary value to them (Levin, 1983). In the present study, program personnel,parenttime,facilities,transportation,and materials made up the resource requirements for both alternatives, although the programs differed in the amounts used of each of these.The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the value of the resources to society rather than what the program actually paid for them. Although the program paid nothing for parent time, from a societal perspective, there was an opportunity cost (e.g., parents could have been engaged in other productive activities, and the foregone activities represent a cost to them). For the present study, the amount of parent time for the clinic-based group was assigned a monetary value of $9/hour \"Fl PITCH 710 based upon women's \"median usual weekly earnings for full-time work\" plus benefits (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989). The primary costs of parent time in the home parent training group were associated with the time parents spent with the speech pathologist learning intervention techniques and the time spentimplementing the intervention with their children. Costs for parent time wereestimated based upon (1) program records of the actual time parents spent with thespeech pathologist during home visits, and(2)the amount of time the programrecommended that the parents spend providing therapy to their children each week.The estimate of parent time spent with the speech pathologist is very reliable.The estimate of parent time working with the child is imprecise; however, assuminga \"ball park\" figure of 2 hours per week allows an illustration of the potential impact on program cost of the value of parent time.In the clinic-based program, parents' costs included only the cost of time spentin transporting children to the clinic each week (mileage costs were paid by the program).Time estimates were made from telephone interviews with parents duringwhich parents were asked the round-trip mileage from their home to the clinic, theaverage timeit tookto drive, and whether they car-pooled. The time cost oftransportation to parents was nontrivid.. In fact, parents in the clinic-basedprogram spent almost half as much time transporting their children back and forthto therapy sessions as parents in the home parent training group spent providingtherapy to their children (assuming the parents actually spent the recommended amountof time on therapy). Thus, both programs required substantial parental time. Thecost of the other resources used by the programs are discussed below and presentedin Table 16.4. These costs are adjusted for inflation so that all figures are incomparable1990 constant dollars. In addition, atthe bottom of Table16.4,estimates are adjusted to reflect real discount rates of 3% and 5%. PITCH 711 Table 16.4Cost Per Child of Each Program Alternative (1990 Dollars) kesources Clinic-Based(N = 20)Home Parent $2,075 $2,855 $3,540 Totals may not add up due to rounding errors. Staff personnel custs included salary plus benefits for direct service andadministrative personnel, accordingtothepercentage ofFTE devoted to each alternative program. Facilities costs were estimated using the school district'sdaily rate for rooms. Transportation costs were based on staff mileage plus allallowances for home visits and reimbursements to parents who drove their childrento the clinic-based program. Finally, the value of materials and supplies was 737 PITCH 712calculated based on the amount of consumable items used by each program during the intervention period. Data CollectionSeveralmeasures were usedtoexaminetheeffects ofthetwotypesof interventions with the speech disordered subjects. The focus of the data collection wasonassessingspeechproduction,languagedevelopment,cognitive/social development, and family adaptation. The specific measures used for pretesting and posttesting are discussed below.Recruitmenttraining1 and monitoring of diagnosticians. Three diagnosticianscompleted extensive training prior to au.inistering the Battelle Developmental Inventory.All of the diagnosticians had master's degrees and extensive experience assessinginfants andchildren with disabilities. Additionally, onespeechpathologist, holding a master's degree, completed all of the speech and languagetests, also after being trained. Each tester was naive to the subject assignments of those they tested. Shadow-scoring was conducted on 10% of the BDI administrationsand resulted in a mean of 96% interrater agreement. Pretesting.Parents of each child participating in the study completed an informedconsentformandprovideddemographicinformation. TheBattelleDevelopmental Inventory (BDI) was used in this study because several of the BDIdomains ware especially relevant tothisstudy(cognitive,communication, andpersonal/social). Additionally, parents completed the Parenting Stress Index, Family Support Scale, Family Resource Scale, the Family Adaptability and Cohesiu., ,ivaluationScales, and the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (used only at pretest).The BDI was administered by a trained diagnostician who was unaware of the child'sgroup assignment. Testing occurred at the center, ensuring a controlled testingenvironment for all subjects. The parent, usually mothers, completed the familymeasures following completion of the BDI. The Family Support Scale was given to the t61c)s:S PITCH 713mothers to take home if they had a spouse or spouse equivalent who could also complete it.The diagnosticians completed the testing report and then sent all data to EIRI via certified mail.Additionally, the following language, speech, and articulation tests were givento all subjects prior to intervention by a trained speech therapist who was also unaware of the subjects' assignments.Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation consonant sounds. Itisanationally normed test of articulation and has proved to be a reliable andvalid instrument in the field of speech pathology. The Sounds-in-WordsSubtest gives a raw score that is compared with national findings that,in turn, provides a percentile ranking comparing the subject's performancewith other subjects of the same age.Patterned Elicitation Syntax Test. The Patterned Elicitation Syntax Test(PEST) is designed to determine whether a child's expressive grammaticalskills are age appropriate. In addition to providing age-referenced norms,the PEST is designed to provide information on a broad range of grammaticalstructures that typically occur in children's speech.Preschool Language Scale (PLS). The Preschool Language Scale was designedto detect language strengths and deficiencies. It consists of two mainsections: Auditory Comprehension and Verbal Ability. A supplementaryarticulation section is also included. Language age equivalent scores areobtained for each section.Posttestinq #1. Posttest #1 measures articulation measures discussedabove withthe exception ofthe PEST, which was replaced by two additional language measuresdescribedbelow.Additionally, aparentsatisfactionwiththetreatment questionnaire and parent report of child's health were administered to the parents.Test for Language (TACL-R). The TACL-R auditory comprehension of language by assessing skills inthe areas of grammar, syntax, and morphology. The instrument enables theexaminer to assign the subject to a development level Jf comprehensionbased on his/her performance.Naturalistic Language Sample. Following the suggestions made by Barrie-Blackley,Musselwhite,and Rogister(1978),Shriberg and Kwiatkowski(1980), Miller (1981), and Bloom and Lahey (1978), a naturalistic languagesample protocol was developed. The protocol was developed to be usedtwice:(1) one sample taken between parent and child, (2) one sample takenbetween therapist and child. The protocol ccnsists ..)fprocedures and \"/3!) PITCH 714 materials to be used in collecting the sample. The sample produced anumber of different types of data, both qualitative and quantitative, infour domains: articulation,pragmatics,semantics, and syntax. Theadvantage of such a sample is that actual language is being examinedallowing for assessments of generalized skills (ascollectedintheparent/child sample) and optimal skills (as collected in the therapist/child sample).Posttestina #2. Posttest #2 measures were the same as for the first posttest with two exceptions. The PLS was no longer used because a number of subjects wereno longer expected to reach a ceiling.It was replaced by the Structured Photo-graphic Expressive Language Test II (SPELT) which is described below. Additionally,the FILE was discontinued as a measure due to complaints of parents regarding the sensitivity of information it elicits and its lack of relevance to the study. Structured Photographic Expressive Languacie Test II (SPELT II). The SPELTII examines the expressive use of morphology and syntax. It distinguisheschildren who perform significantly below others of their age intheproduction of grammatical structures and assesses their strengths andweaknesses in those productions.Posttestino #3. Posttest #3 measures were the same as for the second posttest with the exception of the naturalistic language sample which was no longer collected due to intensity of labor associated with this task and the lack of previous findings of relevance.Additionally, a measure was designed to evaluate parent's perceptionof the long-term costs and benefits of their respective interventions. Results and Discussion The following section will present the results of the study with respect to the following research questions: 1.To what extent are the two treatment groups and two cohorts comparableon pretest measures of child and parent functioning? 2.To what extent are there differences between the two treatment groupson measures of child functioning at the first, second,and thirdposttests? 3.To what extent are there differences between the two treatment groupson measures of family functioning at the first, second, and thirdposttests? 74 0 PITCH 715 4.What is the relationships between the costs and the effects of eachintervention? 5.To what extent are there differences between other subgroups in thetwotreatmentgroups,suchasothergroupsdeterminedbythestratification variables (i.e., child age, mother education, and levelof parental involvement), and the two cohorts at the second and thirdposttests?Each of these questions will be addressed in sequence in the section that follows. Comparability of Groups at PretestAs can be seen in Table 16.5, no statistically significant pretest differences were found on any of the measures of child functioning (with significance criteria at p < .10).These statistics indicate that the children in the two groups werevery comparable prior to the initiation of the intervention. The statistics also indicate the pretreatment cognitive and verbal ability levels of the subjects in the study.For example, resulLs on the BDI indicated that the children in the studywere mildly dsiabled, demonstrating delays in the personal-social and communication (totaland expressive) domains. Further,the pretest results on the Goldman-Fristoe, which is a more sensitive test within the communication domain than the BDI,ind;cated that subjects in both groups demonstrated severe speech delays andwere performing at approximately the fourth percentile. Results of the PEST, whichassesses imitative syntax ability, indicated that the children in each group were performing at approximately the 13th percentile. Inlight of the performance levels demonstrated on the BDI,the Goldman- Fristoe, and the PEST, the results of the PLS appear to be inflated, with DQs around100 and age-equivalent scores close to some subjects actual chronological ages. In fact,the PLS has been cited before for producing inappropriately high ageequivalents (e.g., McLoughlin & Gullo, 1984, p. 146). Nevertheless, it was used inthis study because itisa measure commonly used by practitioners to observerelative growth over time.

ES-.iome-based x- center-based Pooled SD These general trends are important to note since it might be expected that parentsin the home parent training group would experience additional stress as a result oftheir added responsibilities of working with their child. Results from the FACESIII adaptability subscale indicated that the parents in the home parent traininggroup may have been less able to adapt to changes in the home, such as the ability BEST COPY AVAILABLE PITCH 718 to adapt to increased stress levels as a consequence of providing services to their child.Based on this information, these variables were identified as potential covariates for posttest analysis. Nostatistically significant differences were foundonthe otherfamily measures,indicating that the families inboth groups had comparable levels offamily support (as measured by the FSS) and resources (as measured by FRS). Of a possible score of 72 on the FSS, both groups received a mean score of approximately 27, or 38% of the support available from individuals and agencies.Of a possible score of 150 (100%) on the FRS, the groups indicated that their material resources were 79% (118.0 points) to 83% (124.4 points) adequate for the home parent training and the clinic-based groups, respectively.The first, second, and third posttest analyses of the FRS, FSS, FILE, and the health form (which were not considered dependent variables, but important family description variables) indicated no statistically significant differences between the groups,ruling out reported shifts insupport,resources,significantlife events,orillnessasthreatstovalidity ofthestudy.Nostatisticallysignificant difference was found on additional services at the first or second posttests.However, at the third posttest, the home parent training group reporteda statistically significantly higher number of hours of speech therapy receivedoutside of the program. Since both group's speech and language scores from thesecond year were quite comparable, these findings suggest that the home parenttraining group may have resulted in an increased conscientiousness of parents tofind additional services for their child (perhaps even when no longer needed).A two-way analysis of covariance including the two treatment groups and the twocohorts was also computed on the pretest measures of child and family functioning.No statistically significant differences were found for either of the main effects PITCH 719of the interaction, suggesting that the treatment groups remained balanced within each cohort with regard to family resources and support. Posttest Measures cl fSpeech and Language AbilitiesFirst Posttest. Table 16.7 displays the results of the analysis of covarianceon the first posttest speech and language measures between the two intervention groups.Three standardized measures of speech and language ability were used: the Goldman-Fristoe, the PLS, and the TACL-R. These basic measures yielded 9 differentmeasures of speech and language functioning, three of which were statisticallysignificant at the .10 level and which favor the home parent training group in each case.The average effect size across the three total scores from the standardizedmeasures was .51.This suggests that there was a slight advantage for the homeparent training group on the measures of speech and language functioning. Table16.7alsoshowsthe main scores yielded from the twonaturalistic language samples. Six scores were computed and analyzed from the parent-childlanguage sample to examine generalized speech and language skills in articulation, pragmatics, and syntax. The number of unintelligible utterances due to articulationproblems correlated significantly with the number of errors made on the Goldman- Fristoe (r = .36, p = .03), the PLS Auditory Comprehension Subscale point score (r = -.30,p = .06), and the PLS Language Age (r = -.28, p = .09).As is evident inTable 16.7, no statistically significant difference between groups was found on thenumber of unintelligible utterances.Pragmatics were analyzed by examining \"requesting\", \"responding\", \"teaching\", and \"spontaneous\" language. Table 16.7 shows that, proportionally, the home parenttraining group had significantly more child responses to parent requests thdn theclinic-based group, although the percentage of parent requests to the child wascomparable between the groups.

ThisDSS indicates that optimal functioning was between the 10th and 25th percentile (Lee,1974).Results of the analysis of covariance indicated no statisticallysignificant difference between the two groups.Second Posttest. The results of the second posttest one-way analysis of covariance on measures of speech and language abilities are displayed in Table 16.8.As can be seen, no statistically significant difference was found on the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation, although the home parent training group scored .41 ofa standard deviation better than the clinic-based group. It is important to notethat both groups made impressive gains since the pretest, improving from the 4thpercentile to the 30th and 41st percentiles in the clinic-based and home parent PITrH 722 training groups, respectively.While no statistically significant differences betweenthe groups were found in expressive use of morphology and syntax, as Aed by the SPELT II, the home parent training group scored one-third of a tandaru Liation higher than the clinic-based group. Differences of three-and four-tenths oiI standard deviation, as was found on both the Goldman-Fristoe and the SPELT II,are typically considered to be educationally significant. However, the fact that these are not statistically significant should make one cautious aboutinterpreting them as educationally significant because the difference between thescores may be due to sampling fluctuation.

Table 16.10 shows the results of the posttest analysis of covariance between the two groups on the BOI. Again, the home parent training groupdemonstrated at least comparable developmental abilities to the clinic-based group.While no statistically significant difference was found on the total BDI score, thehome parent training group performed statistically significantly better than theclinic-based group on the motor total subscale (p = .06). This difference may bedue to the fact that the home parent training group had a greater opportunity forinterdisciplinary intervention, althoughthe possibility of chance fluctuation should not be dismissed. The most educationally significant difference in generaldevelopment was in the personal-social domain in which the home parent traininggroup score approximately .50 ofa standard deviation better than clinic-based group.75 PITCH725Table 16.10First Posttest Analysis of Covariance Variable4 CovariatestCenter-eased Child Centered Home-Based Parent Centered ANCOVAValueES^ were calculated by dividing the Age equivalent (AE) score reported in tne technical manual for each child's raw scoreby the chronological age at time of testing and are reported here for purposes of interpretation.

These findings do not corroborate with the findingson the individual assessments of speech and language ability.

Results of the third posttest one-way analysis of covarianceon the family functioning measures are also shown in Table 16.13.

Thesefindings are important because they demonstrate the absence of differences betweenthe groups with rEgard to stress and family dynamics which may have influencedscores on measures of child functioning. 7rfb) PITCH 731Results of the parent survey indicated once again that of the 20 parents in thehome training intervention, 60% reported that after three years they felt very positive about their intervention, while 35% felt were mostly positive and 5% (one parent) were mostly negative. In the clinic-based group 80% felt very positive, 10%felt mostlypositive,and10%felt mostly negative abouttheirintervention experience.Nevertheless, as was found in earlier years, the majority of parentsin both groups continued to identify the home parent training intervention as thetreatment of preference.As a part of the parent survey, parents were asked to select from a list of positive and negative words, those words which most depicted their experience (i.e. intimidating, fun,frustrating,easy,confusing,productive,pointless,tense, comfortable,rewarding,natural,stressful,hard work,successful,difficulty, worthwhile, disruptive, and strengthening). The results of the analysis of varianceon the total number of positive associations minus the total number of negative associationsindicatednosignificant differences intheperceptions of theirexperiences associated with their respective interventions (F=.58,p<.45).Parents in both groups reported a majority of positive associations, although thosein the home parent training group did report more work, stress, and disruption associated with that intervention.Parents were also asked to identify some of the changes in their lives whichhad occurred during and afterthetimeoftheirintervention. Noremarkabledifferences between the groups were noted. While it might have been expected thatthe home parent training parents would be more likely to report increased confidencein working with their child's school work, this area was the most commonly reportedarea of change in both treatment groups. The second most common responses, whichsurprisingly, both groups evidenced, was a increased confidence in interacting withtheir child's teacher and an increased sense of control of their child's destiny. 757 PITCH 732Also as a part of the parent survey, parents were asked, in an open-endedquestion, to identify how much they would be willing to pay for their respective intervention, had it not been provided free of charge. Responses from parents in the clinic-based group ranged from $5 to $130 per month with a mean of $44 per month.Responses of parents in the home parent training group ranged from 0 to $200per month with a mean of $55.25 per month. Correlations were computed betweenparents responses on this question and their income. The results indicated no significant correlation (r = .16, p < .31). A correlation analysis was also computedbetween the amount parents would be willing to pay and the gain score (between the pre and third posttest) on the Battelle total score and a gain score on the Goldman- Fristoe. The results of these computations indicated no significant correlations (r . -.034, p < .84 [BOI], r = -.07, p < .66 [Goldman-Fristoe]). It is noteworthy that parents'mean valuesin each group were quite comparable, each reporting beingwilling to pay ,r approximately 20% of the actual program costs per child. Posttest Subgroup AnalysesFirst posttest (summarv). Analyses on the first posttest data were conductedon three subgroups to examine the effects of the two interventions comparing: (1)three-year-olds versus four-year-olds, (2) children whose mothers had a maximum of a high school education versus children whose mothers had attended college, and (3)children in the home parent training group whose mothers had reported working withthem more than three hours per week versus children in the home parent traininggroup whose mothers had reported working less than three hours per week. The results of these analyses are summarized below.Groupby age.The results of this set of analyses indicated a trend favoringthe 3-year-olds in the home parent training program over the 3-year-olds in theclinic-based program in verbal ability and a'general tendency for the 3-year-oldsin the home parent training program to benefit more than all of the others in the 753 PITCH 733 two programs.Specifically, home parent training 3-year-olds scored higher than clinic-based 4-year-olds cn the PLS PLS total OQ [t(15) = 3.25, 2=.01].Additionally, this same group of home parent training 3-year-olds scoredhigherthanthehome parent training 4-year-olds onthePLS Auditory 2 =.05] the PLS total DO [t(18) = 2.75, the PLS Auditory Comprehension clinic-based 4-year-olds [t(18) = 2.75, 2 = .05] and the home parent training 4-year-olds [t(20) = 2.30, 2 = .05].Mothers of the home parent training 3-year-olds, however, were more stressed than the other mothers in the study. These findings,if substantiated with additional research, may suggest that age is an important determinant of the most appropriate type of parent involvement to be used in a child's program and that stress may be a special consideration when working with mothers of 3-year-olds.Level &mother education. While it might be expected that less educated mothers would be less effective with their children, these findings do not support this belief.Contrarily, of the children in the home parent training group, there were no measures on which thechildren of more highly educated mothers performed significantly better than those whose mothers had received only a high school education.In fact,there were several measures on which the children of less educated mothers performed significantly better than the children of mothers with higher education in the home parent training group. This may be due to the fact that the less educated mothers appeered to take the responsibility more seriouslyof working with their child, while the mothers with higher education tended to assume they were able to work with their child without the training and suggestions provided by the therapist. Further, less educated mothers experienced lower stress, again suggesting that they may adapt well to such a role. 759 PITCH 734 While these findings may suggest that we dismiss the notion that less educated mothers are ineffective as therapists to their children, it should be noted that even the lowest levels of education of mothers inthis study (all of whom had completedthe12grade)werenot as extreme asisoften prevalent inother populations.Therefore, additional research should examine the question of the effect of mother's educational levels on their ability to work effectively as therapists for their children.Level ofparent involvement. The first year of this study attempted to examine thecritical variable of parent time and the challenge of measuring parent time spent with the child in education-related activities. One methodological conclusion that can be drawn is that it is vital that parent time measurement be triangulated sothat reliability can be tested in a number of ways. Second, it was concluded that in the absence of an extensive naturalistic study on parent time, estimates of parent time collected by means used in this study were suspect. Given the questionable nature of the time data that was collected, conclusions about the effects of variable time spent working with the child in the home parent training group can be drawn only with caution. While it is possible to distinguish two groups based on the reported number of hours spent each week with the child, in most cases there were no significant differences between the performances of the children in each group. Nevertheless,the \"more than 3-hours-per-week\" group didperform significantly better than the lower time-group on articulation, and the mothers demonstrated lower stress. It appeared,in fact, that the children whose mothers spent less than 3 hours per week working with them performed no better than the children in the center-based group who were provided therapy by the professional therapist Ihour per week. These results suggest that parent time committed toworking withtheir child may be directly associated wit?,childperformance. 7C0 PITCH 735 However, additional research is vital in order to more reliably measure parent time actually spent with the child and its subsequent costs and effects.Second posttest subgroup analysis by cohort. The most meaningful subgroupanalyzed from the second posttest data was a comparison of the effects of the interventions on the one-year cohort versus the two-year cohort. To set the context ofthis analysis itisimportant to note that analysis ofparent reports ofadditional services, for the one-year cohort, indicated no significant differencebetween the two treatment groups; children in the clinic-based, one-year cohortreceived a comparable amount of intervention service during the follow-up year asthe home parent training one-year cohort. These data indicate that according toparent reports, most children in the one-year cohort did not receive speech therapy services during the follow-up year. No statistically significant differences betweengroups or between cohorts were found on the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation atthe second posttest, although effect sizes favored the home parent training group(see Table 16.15). As can be seen, both cohorts of children in the home parenttraining group performed better than the clinic-based group in their respective cohorts.Interestingly, the two home parent training subgroups scored comparably, andindicated that the second year of intervention had remediated the speechdisorders of the continuing children to a sim4lar level as the one-year children.The two clinic-based subgroups, however, were less comparable indicating that thesecond year of clinic-based intervention did not result in a substantial gain.Subgroup analysis by cohort on the TACL-R indicated very comparable performanceof children across all four cohort/intervention subgloups.

As can be seen in Table 16.17, no statistically significant interactions between treatment group and cohort were found on any of the main effects pertaining to speech and language functioning.Table 16.18 summarizes the subgroup analysis by group and by cohort on the Battelle. No statistically significant interactions were found on any of the domains of the Battelle.Thesefindingssuggestthatthetwocombinationsofdurationof intervention and type of intervention produced comparable effects on speech, language and general development. Several statistically significant differences were found by cohort, always in favor of the follow-up cohort. This finding is understandable since the follow-up cohort was older and these analyses were performed on raw scores. Conclusions The findings of this study support the claims made by experts as early as 1948 (see Lillywhite, 1948), that mothers should not be excluded from the speech training of their speech delayed children. The combination of several elements (mothers astherapists, speech pathologists as parent trainers, and intervention in the home environment) appear to have contributed to language development for the subjects in this study.Even after three years, children in the home-parent training group performed at least as well as the children who received therapy directly from the speech pathologist in the clinic, and, in several cases, those trained by their mothers performed slightly better. While parents in each intervention appeared to value their respective interventions comparably (in monetary as well as more abstract terms), most parents in both groups continued to perceive the home parent trainingprogram as the treatment of preference. Therefore, the overall conclusion of this study is that the results of the third year follow-up corroborated with the posttestimmediately following the first 7 months of intervention and the second year follow- up.Mothers were at least as effective, if not more effective than professional 'Roble 16.17ANCOVA's on Speech and Language 6 BDI Total Score DO: 7 BDI Expressive Communication I Developmental Quotients (0110 were calculated by dividing the age equiialent (AE) score reported in the technical manual for each child's raw score by the chronological age at time of testing and arereported here for pu-poses of interpretation.

These findings suggest that involving mothers in this way, especially for those who prefer this approach and who are of a similar socio-economic background as the subjects in this study, isan appropriate programming option (Eiseman, McCoun, & Escobar, 1990).These findings support Wulz, Hall, and Klein's claim that the home environment is critical to generalizable language development, although the extent to which the effects observed here were primarily due to the environment in which the intervention was provided was not isolated. Similarly, these findings provide support to the phenomeoa Newport (1976) labeled \"motherese\" which refers to the tendency mothers havetorespondtotheirchild'sintentratherthantotheform oftheir communication. According to Newport, sensitivity to intent allows mothers to provideoptimal linguistic cues to elicit and nurture the child's communication efforts. However, the extent to which the observed effects were due primarily to mother and therap4stsroles wasnotisolated.Whileisolating mothers from the home environment is not a reasonable possibility, providing speech pathologist-delivered therapy in the home environment is a reasonable way to determine how potent the homeenvironment is in language development and should be addressed in future research.Some educators and parents believe that redefining parents' roles to includeteaching or providing therapy for their children puts undue strain on the parent-child relationships. The argument is, \"It's demanding enough to be parents; don'texpect them to be teachers as well\" (e.g., Clarke-Stewart, 1982).It must beacknowledged that some parents with speech disordered children may not choose orwelcome the opportunity of being trained as a speech paraprofessional for their children.In some cases, the added responsibility may result in excessive stress.In this study, however, statistically significantly higher levels of stress were not found in parents who provided therapy to their children. In fact, when given their PITCH 742 choice,mothersinbothinterventionspreferredthemothers-as-therapists intervention significantly more than the clinic-based approach.The results of the cost analysis indicate that, excluding the value of parent time,there was no meaningful differencein cost between the two approaches. However, when we include the value of parent time as a real cost to the program, thehigh parent involvement program may cost over 20% more than the clinic-based program.From an economic perspective, which alternative is the most cost-effective is not clear.Ingeneral,those who operate programs that rely heavily onparentinvolvement need to understand the opportunity costs to parents. If parents are willing to pay the price (i.e., devote the required time and energy to training andintervention), then a home training program for speech impaired children, based uponthe evidenLe presented here, may work as well or better than a clinic-based programstaffed by a professional speech pathologist, and it may even be the most cost- effective alternative. However,in the present study, most mothers did not workoutside the home, were not single and/or on welfare, and were well educated. In short, they chose to invest tne time to participate. Obviously, this will not always be true.How validly this program's success could be generalized to a disadvantagedpopulationis not known.For parents who already feel stress, a home trainingprogram requiring significant amounts of time and energy may not be as effective asa clinic-based program. Thus,the decision as to which alternative is\"best\"according to economic criteria is dependent upon the context of the intervention andcan only be determined by those ma1/4ingtheindividualprogramming decisions,especially ncluding parents. How.o effectively involve parents in this decisionmaking process is an area for future research.The findings of this study provide a number. of other implications for futureresearch questions: I.What,if any, are the long term benefits to parents who have beentrained to work with their child?

Relatively few studieshaveusedthe experimental methodtotestthenotionthatparental Utah Parent Involvement 1985745 involvement is more effective than no parent involvement, and many of these studies had methodological limitations (see White, Taylor, & Moss, 1989). Even fewer studies have used random assignment of subjects to differing treatment conditions. Lack of random assignment in early intervention research islargely due to the ethical concerns of offering treatment in a random manner. White and Pezzino (1986) have addressed the validity of such concerns and concluded that the infrequent use of randomization has been a serious impediment to the advancement of knowledge about the efficacy of early intervention. They argue that such designs are feasible to implement and,if properly conducted, are neither unethical nor illegal.The use of methodologically well-designed studies which includes random assignment of subjects is one of the best ways of determining whether there are benefits associated with involving parents in early intervention programs.Another problem in assuming that parent involvement is always beneficial is that there are many types of parent involvement programs with probably many variations in consequent effects. Care must be used in generalizing the benefits (or effects) of one type of parent involvement program to other types of parent involvement.The term \"parent involvement\" is perhaps too global a term. More specific terms are needed to identify variations of parent involvement. Furthermore with the varietiesof \"parent involvement\", one study (even if it is methodologically sound) cannot answer the question or the effectiveness of parent involvement.A series of studies are needed to answer this question and build a sound base of information concerning the benefits of parent involvement.This study investigated a typical parent involvement program by investigating theimmediate andlong-term effects of the addition of one type of a parent involvement program to an already exlsting center-based only intervention program for the children. The parent involveirient was primarily designed to improve parent's Utah Parent Involvement 1985746 skills as teachers of their child with handicaps, but it also included an information component and support component for the parents. In addition to assessing the impact of this particular type parent involvement program with child progress measures, this study assessed the possible changcs that such a program had on the family. The work of several investigators has suggested alinkbetween child management skillsand family functioning (e.g.,Koegel, Schreibman, Britten, Burke, Fleishman, 1979; Wahler, Leske, & Rogers, 1979); however, additional research is needed to determine the nature of these effects. Additionally, most previous studies were conducted with disadvantaged children; children with moderate and severe handicaps may presentsufficiently different problems sothattherelationshipbetween behavioral parent instruction and overall family functioning may not be present or at least may be different. Review of Related Research Theinvolvement of parentsintheir children's education haslongbeen considered important. White et al. (1989) identified six rationales frequently used for why parental involvement is necessary: (1) Parents are responsible for the welfare of their children; (2) Involved parents provide better political support and advocacy; (3) Early intervention programs which involve parents are more effective;(4) By involving parents, the same outcome can be achieved at less cost; (5) The benefits of early intervention are maintained better if parents are involved; and (6) Parent involvement provides benefits to parents and family members as well as the child.While these rationales for parent involvement would appear to be logical and sensible, the evidence from the research to date on parent involvement is less than conclusive.Table 17.1 presents the White et al. (1989) analyses of 12 studies that examined the effects of adding a parent involvement component to early intervention Utah Parent Involvement 1985 4 Table 17.1Effects of Adding a Parent Involvement Component toEarly Intervention Studies with Handicapped Children747 ReferenceDescription of the ComparisonPrimary FocusSecondary FocusQualityParental InvolvementParental InvolvementEffect Barnett, Escobar,& Ravsten, 1987Henry,Center and athome ,1983 Miller, 1981 Scherzer, 1976Physical therapy plus parenttraining vs. physical therapyalonefair fair poor poor poorParent as therapist Parent as therapist Parent as therapist Parent as Therapist Parent as therapist Indirect Comparisons of Benefits of Parent Involvement:Bidder et al.,1975 Barnett, Escobar,& Ravsten, 1987 Shelton, 1978 Goodman et al ,1984 Allen et al.,1980 Horion, 1976 Kysela et al..1981Parents as therapists vs. intervention byparents vs. center-based onlyinterventionCenter home-basedinterventions involvement communitydaycare programs aloneParent-child interactionintervention vs. traditionalinterventionHearing aid before 3plus vs.hearing aid aloneExtensive home-based onlyintervention withmoderate parental involvementgoodParent as therapist Parent as therapistfair fair fair poor poor poor poorParent as therapist Parent as therapist Parent as tnerapist Parent/child relations Parent as therapist.

First, various types of program comparisons have been made to address different research questions about parent involvement. For example, ome of the research designs have compared home-based, parent intervention with center-based only intervention, asking which is better--home-based parent or center- based only professional intervention. Others have compared a center-based only intervention with the same center-based only intervention to which has been added aparentinvolvement component, asking whether or not the addition of parent involvement will make a significant contribution to the child's development. It is logical to expect different findings when different comparisons are made. In 1985, when this study was initiated, center-based only programs adding a parent-as- therapist component was a popular and frequently-used intervention program. Since evidence did not exist as to the benefits of this type of parent involvement, andsince it was so frequently used, this type of design was a logical choice to be evaluated.Second, various methodological problems have been found in the research.Table 17.1 addresses the issue of study quality. \"Study quality\" refers to the assessed threat to internal validity for that particular study. (For further information concerning the manner in which these studies were rated, see the final report of the Early Intervention Research Institute, 1987.) None of the studies which used direct comparison were rated any better than \"fair,\" indicating that serious methodological concerns characterize this literature. One good study indirectly compared the benefits of parent involvement. However, indirect comparisons (that is, a comparison in which parent involvement is one of several variables, such as setting or age-at-start, which are experimentally manipulated) are generally so confounded as to give little information on the effectiveness of parent involvement. Given the weaknessesof the studies and the lack of positive effects shown in Table 17.1, the alleged 7n Utah Parent Involvement 1985 749benefits of parent involvement in early intervention programs have not been well documented.Furthermore, other important questions have not been addressed in the research. One question which needs addressing is the relationship between parental child management skills and family functioning. Several investigators have suggested such alink (e.g., Koegel et al., 1982; Patterson, 1980; Patterson & Fleishman, 1979; Wahler et al., 1979). However, additional research is needed to determine the nature ofthese effects;they might bepositive or negative. Clarke-Stewert (1982) suggested that perhaps parent involvement programs may serve to make the mother mon' anxious or unsure, and failure to measure maternal variables would obscure this result.Second, few studies provide cost-benefit information, despite general claims that parent involvement saves money. Third, none of the stud.es report data from follow-up testing. Since studies involving disadvantaged children have cautiouslysuggested that some benefits due to parent involvement may be long-lasting (Haskins & Adams, 1982), the importance of longitudinal research in this area becomes obvious.Thus, the goal of this research was to determine immediate and delayed impact of adding a structured parent involvement program to an existing center-based only early intervention program that provided minimal parent involvement. Overview of StudyFifty-one children with moderate and severe handicaps were randomly assignedto a center-based early intervention program plus parent involvement or a center-based only intervention alone. Treatment was provided at two early intervention centers located in the greater Salt Lake City, Utah area. All children were involvedin a 3-hour, 5-day-per-week, center-based only preschool program. Mean age of thechildren at the beginning of the intervention was 46.1 months. The children wererandomly assigned to one of two groups, the center-based only group or the center- '7 7 9 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 750 based plus parent involvement group. Although the children were in different groups for the research analyses, they were mixed together in classrooms at the centers. The parents of the \"center-based plus parent involvement group\" attended parent instructional workshops provided one time per week (90 minutes) for 15 weeks during the winter months of 1986, in addition to the regular parent functions at the centers.The ParentsInvolvedin Education(PIE) curriculum was used inthe workshops.The parents in the \"center-based only\" group continued to be includedin the regular parent functions provided by the centers. All children and parents (usually mothers) were tested prior to, immediately after, and one, three, and four years following the implementation of the parenting groups. Results were determined through use of analysis of variance and analysis of covariance, with respectivepretests and mother education as covariates. Method SubjectsFifty-one children with moderate and severe handicaps were included in the studywith the average developmental quotient of 55(BDItotaldevelopmentalage chronological age x 100). In the remainder of this section, the procedures for recruiting subjects and assigning them to groups will be summarized. The demographiccharacteristics of children in each group will be discussed, and the effect ofsubject attrition will be summarized.Recruftmeat.Preschool children, and their families, who were participatingin classes taught at the two centers, were considered for inclusion in this study.The Battelle Developmental Inventory (Newborg et al., 1984) was used to determinechildren's eligibility for services. To be eligible for services, children had toscore at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean in at least two areas, or 3 standard deviations below the mean in one area. Parents of these children were sent 7E0 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 751a letter inviting them to participate in the research, and inclusion in the study was based on parents' willingness to participate without prior knowledge of treatment group assignment. Subject recruitment for this cohort was completed in November 1985.Assignment to groyps. Children who met the criteria for inclusion were randomlyassigned to one of two treatment groups; their parents accordingly were assignedeither to a group in which they received instruction in parent workshops or to agroup in which parents did not attend parent workshops. The group not receiving theadditional parent involvement component continued to receive the same center-based intervention previously available.To increase the probability of having comparable groups, children were assignedto groups randomly after being stratified as follows. Within each of the teachers' classes, subjects were categorized according to chronological age (22-34 months, 3F-47 months,and over 48 months) and level of parent motivation (low or high) asperceived by each child's teachers. Stratifying subjects in this way resulted insubjects falli. into one of six mutually exclusive cells. Within each of the sixcells, subjects were rank ordered from low to high based on their DQ test scoresobtained from a number of assessment instruments previously administered as part ofthe eligibility process for receivin2 services at the centers.After subjects were categorized, they were alternately assigned to one of thetwo conditions. Group determination for the subject with the lowest DQ score, ineach age by motivation cell was accomplished randomly. Additional subjects withinthe same category were then alternately assigned to groups.Demographic characteristics. In this total sample of developmentally delayedpreschoolers there were more boys than girls with 63% of the sample being boys. Theywere, on the average, almost four years old at the start of the study. The children were primarily white and all but one spoke English in the home. Most of them lived Utah Parent Involvement 1985 752 in intact families with parents who were in their early thirties. The average number of siblings of the child in the study was just over two. The mothers had an average of 13 years of education and fathers an average of almost 15 years of education. The average income and occupational level indicates that this was a sample of middle- class families. Few of the mothers worked outside the home at the start of the investigation.At the end of the five-year study, the major demographic change was that more mothers now reported working. The mothers now reported an average of 14 hours per week instead of an average of 5 hours per week. The incomes were higher at Posttest #4, but the increase was probably due in part to inflation.The average increase was approximately $6,000. The number of siblings also increased slightly, but still only averaged between 2 and 3 siblings per family in addition to the child with handicaps.Other than these changes, the characteristics of the sample remained stable over the five years of the study.Between the two randomized groups few significant differences in demographic characteristics were found. Table 17.2 shows the comparison of the center-based only group versus center-based plus parent involvement group on a number of demographic variables at the time of pretest. Children in the center-based only group had a statistically significantly higher number of siblings (p = .02), and their mothers hadastatisticallysignificantlyhigherlevelof education (p=.01)than participants in the center-based plus parent involvement group. Attrition.Two subjects were lost between the pretest and first posttest (one in each group). The subject in the center-based only group was recruited back into the study and participated in Posttests #2, #3, and #4.Nine subjects were not tested at Posttest #2. Six were in the center-based only grcup and three were in the center-based plus parent involvement group. Attrition was due to subjects moving where there were no testers, parent's decision not be included, or subjects moving 7E2 1Utah Parent Involvement 1985 753Table 17.2Comparison of Key Demographic Pretest Variables of the Center-based only andCenter-Based Plus Parent Involvement Groups of the 1985 Parent Involvement StudyCenter-Based Only Child age in months 46.4Percent male' 56Mother per per week a t-test wnere those children or TamillieS possessing tne trait or characteristic were score \"1.\" and those not possessing the trait were scores at O.2Income data was converted from categorical to continuous data by using the midpoint of each interval.Effect size (ES) is defined here as the difference between the groups (Center-based PIE minus Center-Based Only) on the ANCOVA scores, divided by the unadjusted standard deviation of the Center-Based Only group (see Cohen, 1977; Glass, 1976: & Tallmadge, 1977, for a more general discussion of the concept of Effect Size).

Childrelinboth groupsreceived the same center-based intervention services during the program year. All children were enrolled in a 3-hour, 5-day-per-week center-based intervention program Utah Parent Involvement 1985 756 inwhich they received smallgroup andindividue.lized teaching sessions from certified special education teachers and trained paraprofessional aides. Certified therapists provided individual motor and speech/language instruction to the childrenand helped teachers implement appropriate activities in these and other developmental areas.Instructional activities were developed from comprehensive assessments andwere drawn from a number of curricula. Children were grouped into classrooms based onlevelof developmental functioning, and the average number of children per classroom was slightly less than ten. The child:teacher ratio was 3.6 tu 1. During atypicalday,children were instructed indevelopmental areas such as motor,speech/language, self-help, cognitive, and social skills. As part of these basic servicestochildren,parentswereinvolvedinIEPmeetings,andteachersoccasionally talked individually to parents regarding their child's program aschildren were dropped off or picked up at the preschool.Expanded intervention (center-based plus parent involvement). In addition tothe center-based treatment described above, the parent involvement group participated'di parent workshops which used the Parerts Involved in Education (PIE) (Pezzino &Lauritzen, 1984) instructional package. PIE instructional curriculum included the following:(1)introductionandoverview,(2)objective observation ofchildbehavior, (3) defining and measuring behavior, (4) principles of tlhavior management,(5) analy;:ing behavior chains, (6) theories of child development, (7) testing andassessment, (8) criterion-referenced assessment, (9) developing learnIng objectives,(10) P.L. 94-142 IEPs, (11)intervention strategies, (12) success, (13)practice teaching session, (14)determining appropriate interventions,''15) communicating with professionals, (16) stress management, and(17), review, comments, concerns, and questions.The PIE instructional sessions were taught by a social worker and the director of one 01 the centers. The average group size consisted of beiween 8 and 1.2 parents. 7U; Utah Parent Involvement 1985757 Workshops sessions consisted of 15 ninety-minute sessions, once per week excluding holidays, for a period of four months. In association with the lesson material presented, at most of the sessions parents were asked to choose target behaviors of their child (either from IEPs or one of their own choosing).They taught how to plan an intervention program based on behavior management principles and to carry the program out during the week. They were asked to keep track of and report the time spent in these activities. As can be seen in the list of topics above, information was included concerning principles of child development and government concerns with programs for children with handicaps. Finally, at each session, time was allotted for parents to form support networks and discuss challenges associated with parenting a child with a handicap.Treatment verification. Three methods of treatment verification were used.First, parent attendance was kept at the parent instructional sessions.Parent attendance at the parent instructional sessions averaged 78%, an excellent attendance record for a program of this nature. Second, at Posttest #1, a test of knowledge based on the PIE curriculum was given. The test of parent knowledge, given to boththe parent instruction and the center-based only groups at the time of the first posttest, showed a significant difference in favor ot the parent instruction group (p =.01).These findings support the claim that the treatment was received by the parents as it was intended, and that parents gained the knowledge presented in the PIE instructional package.Cost of alternative Werventions. It is important to determine the cost ofadding this type of parent involvement component to an already established center- based program. Should costs be high and relative benefits be low, money used to establish the parent program might be better spent elsewhere. Costs of implementinga parent involvement program like that used in this study were estimated based on a similar program offered the following year at the same center. All aspects of the 7 S 7 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 758 program on which the cost data were based were the same (i.e., number of sessions held,thepeopleconductingthesessions,andtheapproximatenumberof participants). Figures were adjusted for inflation and are in 1990 dollars. See Table 17.6 for a summary of this analysis. In addition, the total costs of programand contributed resources were discounted using discount rates of3% and5%. Discounting adjusts thecostsfortherealrateofreturnthatthe program expenditure may have earned had the money been invested elsewhere. Inflation adjusts for only the nominal changes in money over time.

Whenavalue was placed on parentvolunteer time in attending instructional sessions, the cost for each child in theparent involvement group was approximately $1000 more than for each child in thecenter-based only group. Data CollectionData collection procedures involved the recruitment, training, and monitoringof diagnosticians, and administration of pretests, and posttests. The measures usedto obtain data on the children and their families, and the tests at which they were used,arelistedinTable 17.7.Brief descriptions of these instruments arepresented in Table 17.8.Recruitmenttraining, and monitoring of diagnosticians. Diagnosticians wererecruited from graduate programs in psychology and special education at Utah StateUniversity.All had masters degrees and extensive experience assessing infants andchildren with handicaps. They were trained through a lengthy process which involvedobservation of videotapes, a two-day training seminar, and required certificationafter administering at least three Battelles. Although these diagnosticians wereaware that research was being conducted, they were uninformed as to the specificdetails and hypotheses of the study. They were also unaware of the children'sassignments to groups. Shadow scoring was conducted on 10% of the administrationsto ensure the validity of the testing procedure, and administration of the Battellewas determined to be reliable between testers more than 90% of the time.Pretest.Pretesting took place inlate October and early November, 1985.Parents of each child participating in the study completed an informed consent form 7S;) Utah Parent Involvement 1985760Table 17.7Schedule of Administration and Test Administration for Utah Parent Involvement 1985 Study Instruments PretestPosttest #1Posttest #2Posttest #3Posttest #4 CHILD MEASURESRattelle Developmental Test of Achievement--Revised Scales of Independent BehaviorStanford-Binet Intelligence Test, Form L-M* X Developmental SPECSBayley Scale of Infant Development X Minnesota Child Development Inventory XX Report of Child's HealthSequenced Inventory of Communication Development XX FAMILY MEASURESParent Stress Index XX X X X Family Support Scale X X X X Family Resource Scale X X X X Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes X X Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale X Xxx Child Improvement Questionnaire X Family Environment Scale X Home Screening Questionnaire X Parent/Cnild Interaction X Public School Teacher Evaluation x x 7;'0 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 761Table 17.8Description of Tests Administered for Utah Parent Involvement 1985 Study MEASURES DESCRIPTION..nimmemmolimmg CHILD MEASURESBattelleDevelopmentalInventory (BDI)(Newborg,Stock,Wnek,Guidubaldi,&Svinicki,1984)Woodcock-Johnson TestsofAchievement--Revised(Woodcock & Hill, Inte'ligenceTest Form L-M(Terman & 1990) BayleyScalesofInfantDevelopment(Bayley, 1969)Minnesota Child FAMILY MEASURESParent Stress Index (PSI)(Abidin, Support parent interview.

Assesses adult perceptions (judgment-based assessment) of child capabilities on 20developmental dimensions that encompass Six domains: Communication, Sensorimotor,Physical, Self-Regulation, Cognition, and Self-Social. Assesses infants 2 months to 21/2 years.This well standardized testincludes a Mental Scale, Motor Scale, and Infant Behavior Record. Assesses child development in eight areas: General Development, Gross Motor, FineMotor, Expressive Language, Comprehension-Conceptual, SituationComprehension, Self-Help, and Personal/SocialAssesses child's health for the previous year. Questionnaire designed by EIRIspecifically for this research. Technically,this measure isnotin outcomemeasure, but it allows for the measurement of child's illness which ma.y affect theother child outcome measures.The SequencedIntqntory ofCommunication Development assesses Receptive andExpressive language development of young children ages 4 to 48 months. Assesses parent perceptions of stress on the parent-child system. The two maindomains are child-related factors and parent factors and parent factors.Assesses the availability of sources of support as well as the degree to whichdifferent sources of support provided are perceived as helpful to families rearingyoung children. Assesses the extent to which different types of resources are perceived as adequatein households with young children. Factorsinclude: General Resources, TimeAvailability, Physical Resources, and External Support.

DESCRiPTION FamilyInventoryofLifeEvents and Changes (FILE)(McCubbin,Patterson,&Wilson, Interaction(EIRI, 1986) PublicSchooEvaluation(EIRI, 1988)TeacherAssesses life events and changes experienced by a family unit during the past 12months and prior to the past 12 months. The specific areas of potential straincovered by the scale include: Intra-Family, Martial, Pregnancy and Childbearing,Finance and Business, Work-Family Transitions, and Family \"Care,\" Losses,Transitions \"In and Out,\" and Legal.Provides a general picture of family functioning by assessing the family's levelof adaptability and cohesion. Family cohesion assesses degree of separation orconnection of family members to the family. Adaptability assesses the extent towhich the family system is flexible and able to change in various situations. Thescale also has a perceived as well as ideal form that provides an indication of theextentto which current family functioning isconsistent with thefamily'sexpectations for ideal family functioning.The questionnaire has been adapted from the Child Improvement Locus of Control(CILC).The CILC assesses parental perceptions of factors that affect the progressof their developmentally impaired child. Factors assessed are: chance, efforts byprofessionals, the child's efforts, parent efforts, and divine intervention.Assesses general family functioning in10 areas:Cohesion,Expressiveness,Conflict, Independence, Achievement Orientation, Intellectual-Cultural Orientation,Active Recreation Orientation, Moral-Religious Emphasis, Organization, and Control.Based on the HOME, devised by Caldwell and Bradley, this screening test wasdeveloped as an instrument to identify families that may require further evaluationin order tO assist their children. Observational (videotaped) measure of parent/child interaction fol lowing an outl inedprotocol participation in child's educational program andinformation concerning child's educational placement. and were interviewed using the demographic survey. In the first of two pretesting sessions,children were administered the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI)(Newborg et al., 1984), a measure of the child's developmental level. Since thisstudy was one of the pilot studies, intelligence tests were administered along withthe BDI.Either the Stanford-Binet (Form L-M, 1960) or Bayley Scales of InfantDevelopment (Bayley, 1961) was given depending on the age and developmental levelof the child.The Minnesota Child Development Inventory (Ireton & Thwing, 1974), apar'ent report of child development was filled out by the mother. The MCDIincludes gross and fine motor, expressive language, comprehension, self-help andpersonal-social subscales. The BDIs were adminisLer9d by a trained examiner whowas unaware of the child's group assignment. Testing occurred at the centers. In 7(19 BEST COPY AVAILABLE :y5i Utah Parent Involvement 1985763 a second pretesting session, which usually took place within two weeks of the BDI test session, parents (usually the mother) completed a demographic survey and the Parenting Stress Index (Abidin, 1983) (which measures stress and coping behavior inthe parent-child system). Information pertaining to the reliability and validityof the Battelle and the Parent Stress Index may be found in the first annual report (White and Casto, 1986). Each of these two sessions lasted approximately 11/2 hours.Parents were paid a $20 incentive after both pretesting sessions were completed. Posttest #1.Posttesting occurred at the end of the school year in 1986 duringthe last two weeks of May and the first week of June, or approximately 7.5 monthsafter pretesting occurred. The posttest battery took threetest sessions to administer.Theposttestbattery forthechildconsistedoftheBattelleDevelopmental Inventory and the Minnesota Child Development Inventory, which wascompleted by the mothers. Information regarding the child's IEP (IndividualizedEducational Plan) objectives was also obtained. Posttest measures for the parent consisted of the Parent Stress Index; the Family Support Scale (FSS) (Dunst, Jenkins,& Trivette, 1984) (assesses the availability and helpfulness of different sourcesof support to families); the Family Resource Scale (FRS) (Leet & Dunst, 1985) (measures the extent to which different types of resources are adequate in householdswith young children); a test of parent knowledge concerning the use of behavioralprinciples taught in the PIE instruction; the Family Environment Scale (FES) (Moos,1974) (assesses general family functioning in ten achievement Irientation, Questionnaire (DeVillis, Revicki, & Bristol, 1984)(assesses parental beliefs about the factors contributing to the improvement of theirchild with a handicap); the Family Index of Life Events and Changes (FILE) (McCubbin, Patterson, & Wilson, 1983) (assesses life events and changes experienced by a family 7L 3 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 764 unit); the Impact on Family Scale (measures stress and coping); the Home Screening Questionnaire (Coons, et al., 1981)(a screening instrument designed to describe typesofstimulation inthechild'shomeenvironmentthatfostercognitive development); and, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales (FACES) (Olson et al., 1985) (assesses perceived and ideal levels of family functioning). Posttest #2.A second posttest was conducted on both treatment groups in August, 1987.'9uring the time between the first and second posttests, parents were not monitored for their use of the principles they learned in the parent instruction groups.)Parents were contacted via telephone and appointments were made for bothparents and their child(ren) to complete the core measures. The children wereadministered the BDI while parents filled out the parent survey form, the FamilyResource Scale, the Family Support Scale, the Parent Stress Index, the FamilyAdaptation and Cohesion Scale, the Family Inventory of Life Events, and measures ofchild health and parent satisfaction with services. After the completion of boththe BDI and family measures, parents were compensated $30 for their time.The teacher measures used at Posttest #2 were not sent out until Spring, 1988.Permission was obtained from the parents to contact their children's public schoolteachers, and the questionnaires were mailed to the teachers. These teachers wereasked to complete a questionnaire developed to ascertain teachers' impressions ofparent's knowledge of their child's program and progress in comparison with otherparents. This questionnaire also gathered information on the child's cla,sification,school attendance, classroom placement, tests administered, teacher certificatesheld, and teacher's recommendation for the child's future placement.As an incentive for teachers to participate, posters appropriate for classroomuse were mailed with the questionnaire. This questionnaire had a 100% return rate.(Several children remained in private preschool or home care settings, so data wasonly reported for children who had moved into the public schools.) Utah Parent Involvement 1985 765 Posttest #3.The third posttest occurred during the summer of 1989. Proceduresfor this posttest were similar to that of the second posttest. Parents werecontacted via telephone and appointments made for parents and their children to complete the core measures. Assessments were conducted at a local community collegeand a nearby preschool. The children were administered the BDI while parentscompleted the Parenting Stress Index, Family Support Scale, Family Resource Scale,Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales, a demographic survey, and a measure of child health.Testing sessions lasted approximately two hours and parents were paid $35 for their participation. Posttest #4.The procedures for the testing and most of the measures remained the same for posttest #4. A major portion of the families were tested in April and May, 1990, with a few being tested in June and July. Most of the testing took placeat a special education center in the Salt Lake valley with some (primarily thoseliving out of state) being tested in their homes.The children's development was assessc:u this time with the Woodcock-JohnsonAchievementTest-Revised(WJ-R)(Woodcock&Johnson,1989).TheBattelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) was no longer appropriate because part of the childrenwere now functioning beyond the upper limits of the test. The WJ-R was chosen afterextensive research. The standard battery of the WJ-R consists of nine specifictests, six of which make up an early development total. From these six scales, abroad knowledge total score and a skills total score are computed, with the broadknowledge score including science, social science and humanities scores, and theskills total including letter-word identification, applied problems and dictation scores.The WJ-R is ap)ropriate for ages from two to adulthood. The test was notthe best measure of three of the children in the sample (two from the Center-BasedOnly group and one from Center-Based + PLE group) because their developmental age, as measured by the BDI at Posttest #3, was less than 24 months. These three children r Utah Parent Involvement 1985 766 did not establish basal scores on the WJ-R at Posttest #4.Therefore, their raw scores for the broad knowledge total and skills total were entered as zeros and their age equivalent scores were entered as 24 months.Two of these children were in the Center-Based group and one in the Center-Based plus PIE group. The Woodcock-Johnson Scales of Independent Behavior OIB) (Bruininks, Woodcock, Weatherman & Hill, 1985) was used as a complementary measure to measure development other than cognitive development. The subscales of the SIB, which are completed by the child's mother or father, include a motor cluster, a social and communication cluster,a personal living skills cluster which approximate the personal-social, motor, communication, cognitive, and adaptive behavior subscales of the BDI. In' addition, the SIB has a community living skills cluster.Mothers (or fathers) completed the same core family measures that were used at Posttest #3.In addition, they completed a demographic survey, a child health survey, a survey of their children's current educational program, and the test of parent knowledge concerning the P.I.E. curriculum. (This was the same test they took at Posttest #1.) Videotaping of parent-child interaction was also completed, using the standardized protocol. The testing session lasted approximately 21/2 hours and parents were paid $50 for their participation.Also, with the parents' permission, the current school teachers were contacted and were asked to complete a measure of the child's development and a questionnairedescribing the children's present educational program and evaluating the parents' participation inthe children's education. The measure chosen to cv3luate the children's development was the Developmental SPECS, a System to Plan Early Childhood Services (Bagnato & Neisworth, 1989). The measure includes 19 items (i.e. reeptivelanguage, hearing, health, etc.), each of which was rated by the teacher on a five point Likert-type scale.A score of 5 indicates normal development for that itemas compared to children of the same age and ascore of 1indicates the most76 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 767 maladaptive score. From the 19 items, the scores de computed for six types of development, which include communication, sensorimotor, physical, self-regulation, cognition, and self/social. The teachers were sent posters with the questionnaires to thank them for their participation. All but two of the teachers returned thequestionnaires, providing data for 43 of the children. Results and Discussion The purpose of this research project was to determine if the addition of thisparticular type of parent involvement program to an already existing center-basedearly intervention program would significantly add to the child's development or affect family function. In addressing these questions, the results will be '.4iscussedby first comparing the pretest scores of the children and parents in the parentinvolvement group with those of the children and parents in the center-based only group.Next,the posttest scores measured at the end of that first year ofintervention (Year #1), and Years #2, #3, and #4 will be compared.Specifically stated, the questions which these analyses seek to answer are: 1.What are tilt immediate and long-term effects of adding this type ofparentinvolvementprogramtoanexistingcenter-basedearlyintervention program on the young child with a handicap and on thefamily system? 2.What is the relationship between the effects of these alternative typesof programs and child characteristics, and family characteristics? 3.Is the magnitude of the effect associated with the degree of parentalparticipation, and how does time affect this relationship? Comparability of Groups at PretestTable 17.9 presents results of the comparability of groups on pretest measures.No statistically significant differences were found between the groups at time ofvetest on either of the primary measures of child development, the BattelleDevelopmental Inventory or the Minnesota Child Development Inventory, or on any of 7:J7 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 768 Table 17.9Pretest Comparisons on Child and Family Measures of the Subjects in the Center-based onlyand Parent Involvement Groups for the 1985 Parent Involvement Study Center-based only Center-based + PIE TOTAL(range 101 to 505)258.541.48424263.853.58826.59,18 For ease of interpretation, Battelle scores have been converted from the raw scores tc a ratio Development Quotient(DQ) by dividing the \"age equivalent\" (AE) score reported in the technical manual for each child's raw score bythe child's chronological age at time of testing.On the PSI,lower scores represent less stress and are, therefore, better To assist with interpretation, apercentile score is also reported in the table based on the authors norming sample.

Also,there were no differences on any cf the other child development measures (the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development [SICO; Tobin, 1984], the Stanford-Binet L-M, 1960] or the Bayley Scales of Infant Development).Likewise, no significant differences on the family stress scores ac measured by the Parenting Stress Index were found. The other core family measures(FRS, FSS, FACES, and FILE) were not administered at the pretest. Likewise, the demographiccharacteristics ofthegroupswereverysimilar,withtheonly statistically significant differences being the mother's education and the number of siblings (see Table 17.2). The two groups appeared to be very comparable befcre the parent instruction began. Selection of Covariates Themajority ofanalysespresentedarebasedonanalysisofcovariance procedures completed using SPSS-PC. Treatment group (center-based only or center-based plus parent involvement) was the independent variable and dependent variableswere scores on the posttest instruments. Analysis of covariance procedures areuseful for two purposes: (a)toincrease the statistical power of a study byreducing error variance; and (b) to adjust for any pretreatment differences Aich are present between the groups. In either application, the degree to which analysis of covariance is useful depends on the correlation between the covariate(s) selectedand the outcome variable for which analyses are being done. However, since onedegree of freedom ilost for each covariate used, itis generally best to uselimited number of covariates in any given analysis. All pretest and demographic variables were considered as potential covariates. The final selection of covariatf.!:,depended on a judgment of which variable or set of variables would maximize thecorrelation or multiple correlation with the outcome variable in question ,ind stillinclude those demographic or pretest variables for which there are the largest 7;);) Utah Parent Involvement 1985 770 pretreatment differences. In each analysis, the specific covariates used are indicated in the table. When examining results, the critical pi valo for assuming statistical si: 'ficance was set at 0.05. Due to the statistical difference between groups at the time of pretest, materndl education was used as a covariate throughoutthe analyses, but since number of siblings was found to be unrelated to measures ofchild and family functioning, it was not used as a covariate. Also, the pretestscores of each sqbscale or scale was wied as a covariate in the analysis of that particular scale or subscale.The covariates (the pretest demographic variables and scores) used at posttest4 differed somewhat from those previously used. The mothers in the center-based only group continued to have iignificantly more years of education than did the mochersin the parent involvement group, and there were still significahtly more s;tilingsin the center-based only group than in the parent involvement group. However, the correlation analyses found the number of siblings variable to be v.*. related to ,eoutcome measures ac the mother education variable. Therefore, hJth were used ascovariates In the analyses of the child and family measures. Pretest scores ware used as covariatei when available. The total pretest developmental quotient sccrefrom the BD1 was found to he the best covariate for all the WJ-R and SIB scales. Measures of Child FunctioningPosttest #11 #2, and #3.

Therefore, we conclude that the children in the two groups hadmade comparable developmental progress.Posttest #4.The measures of child teacher's measure, the Developmental SPECS.Table 17.11 provides the child age equivalent scores as measured by these three measures.The age-equivalent scores for the total sample of children in the WJ-Rand SIB range from a low of 54 months for motor development to a high of 65 months for the community livfng skills with a mean of all six scales (listed on Table 17.11)of 62 months, or approximately 5 years. Considering that the child age at posttest #4 averaged 100 months, or almost 81/2 years of age, these chi:dren, as a group, wouldcontinue to be classified as moderately handicapped (Grossman, 1983). The teachersalso see the children's development as delayed or problematic, as measured by theteacher's SPECS. For the SPECS measure, if the children's development is typicalor better than the other children of the same age, the possible scores for thecommunication and cognition scales would each be IC, for the physical scale the scorewould be 15, and for the sensory motor, self-regulation and self/social scales the scores would each be 20. The average scores range from approximately half to three-fourths of the total possible scores.In comparing the two groups of children for all three measLres of development (wJ-R,RIB,andSPECS),thescoresonTable17.11indicatenostatisticallysignificant differences in development between the children who received only th,!center-based intervention program and those whose parents participated in the parentinvolvement component. The analyses of the WJ-R broad knowledge and skills knowledgescores were recomputed leaving out the three subjects who did not establish basal 8C'3 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 774 scores.(See previous discussion on the procedures for Posttest #4 testing.) The ANCOVA F and 2 value scores changed, but remained insignificant; the children in thetwo groups performed very similarly on these measures.In sum, over the five year period of this investigation, the children in both intervention groups developed similarly, as measured by direct evaluation, and parentand teacher appraisals. Measures of Family.FunctioningPosttests #11 #2, CI, and #4 core measures. Families in the two groups appeared to be very comparable in their perception of stress, resources, social support, andfamily functioning when measured by the various scales used. o statistically significant differences were found between the groups at any of the posttests on anyof the subscale or total scale scores with the exception of the adaptability score on the FACES scale at Posttest #2 (see Table 17.12). This one statistical differenceon a family measure out of 37 scores is probably due to chance.Although there are no statistically significant differences between the twogroups, the findings concerning parental stress provide important information about these families. On the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), the tNo groups reported similarstress levels for child related stress, parent related stress, and total stressthroughout the research (see Table 17.12). The additional parent instruction didnot seem to affect the parents' stress scores as measured by the PSI. However,these longitudinal data providt: the information that these parents' stress scores,as indicated by the percentile scores on Table 17.12, are elevated when t:,mpared tothe norming sample. The child related stress scores are particularly high, ranking nearthe90thpercentile across posttests.Thesefindingssupportpreviousconclusions that parents of children with handicaps are more stressed than areparents of children who are not handicapped (Kazak, 1987; Wilton & Renaut, 1986). 804 Utah Parent Involvement 1985775Table 17.12Posttest Comparisons on Family Measures of the Subjects in the Center-based only andParent Involvement Groups for the 1985 Parent Involvement Study variablesCenter-Based Only Center-BasedPIE Covariates$ (SD)Adj.V tile n (SD)Adj.it tile nANCOVApFValueESPOSTTEST # 1 Parent Stress Index* Child Related O.1117.6(24.3)119.78823121.2(26.1)119.08825.04.84.03Range (47 to 235)Other Related O.1132.8(30.8)136.57523136.0(22.2)132.37025.67.42.14Range (54 to 270)Total 0,1250.3(49.9)257.38523257.3(45.5)250.3BO251.00.32.14Range (101 to 505) Family Adaptation Evaluation Scales(FACES)' 1 3.4(1.9)3.5233.9(2.6)3.724.02.90-.05Range (0 to Fall/ Support Family Index 9f Life 111.3(5.5)11.9292311.2(6.0)10.63424.55.46.46Events (FILE) (continued) Covariates:0This same scale taken at pretest; 1Highest completed year of education - Mother: 2 Number of sibs in sample; 3 Total income s Covariance adjusted means were used in computing ANCOVA F, value, and ES.

A score of 0 is best. A negative ES reflects lower (more positive) score for the Center-BasedPIE group. Analyses for the FSS and FRS are based on raw scores indicating number of supports or resources indicated by the family as being available. Higherscores and positive ESs are considered better. No norming sample is reported for these measures. To assist with interpretation, a percentile scoreis reported in the table based on all pretests collected as a part of the Longitudinal Studies (currently, 645 families with children withhandiCapS). Other family measure comparisons at posttest #1. Several other measures offamily or parent functioning were used at Posttest #1 to compare the families in thecenter-based only group with the families in the Center-Based + PIE group. Thesemeasures also reflected the comparability of the two groups. No significant dif-ferences were found between the two groups on the Child Improvement Scale, the HOMEscreening questionnaire, or Family Environment Scale (FES) (see Table 17.13).

With onlytwo significant findings, it is likely that these also are chance fluctuations.Analysis of variance techniques were used to test effects of treatment conditionon posttest data regarding the number and percentage of IEP objectives achieved bychildren.No statistically significant effects of treatment condition on posttestIEP data were found. These measures were not repeated at Posttest #2, #3, or #4. Other AnalysesParent satisfaction measures #1 and #2. Different forms of a parentsatisfaction questionnaire were filled out by parents at both Posttest #1 and #2. Utah Parent Involvement 1985 779 Parents of both groups were satisfied with the services provided for their children at the centers (see Table 17.14). The questionnaire used a scale of 1 to 4 with possible responses ranging from poor to excellent. With all means being above 3.0,apparently the parent satisfaction on various items ranged from good to excellent.

AtPosttest #1 the parents in the parent involvement group did significantly better onthe test (p. = .01), signifying that the parents had learned the information taught in the classes. After four years, at Posttest #4, the parent involvement group still 8( 9 Utah Parent Involvement 1985 780 did better(x = 16.57) than the center-based only group (x=15 39),but the difference was not statistically significant.ParentIchild interaction. At Posttest #4, parent/child interactions were videotaped and rated using the Parental Behavior Rating Scale (Ma' n:f, 1988). This observationalmeasure wasusedatthistimebecause preliminary analyses of parent/child interaction for the Utah Parent Involvement 1986 study indicated thatthe behaviors of the parents who were in the PIE involvement group were somewhat different than those of the parents in the center-based only group. Twelve global parental P'ehavioral styles were each scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale with a score of 5 indicating a greater amount of the behavior (see Table 17.15). Each of the five points are defined in the manual for each b avior.The videotapes were scored by two coders who were trained and supervised by Or. Mahoney.Table 17.15Principal Axis Factor Analysis of Parent Behavior Rating ScaleParental Behavior Factor #1Factor #2Factor #3 Expressiveness .74 .15Sensitivity to Child's Interests .30 .80-.02Responsivity .39 .79-.01Achievement Orientation .01 .09 .72Inventiveness .48 .42 .30Verbal Praise .20 01AFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHILD.

A principle axis procedure (using SPSSPC PA2 procedures) was used with a varimax rotation for extracting the factors.Three factors were identified. Using the behaviors that loaded above .50 in the factoranalysis, three cumulative behaviors were computed (see Table 17.15).The first, the affective relationship with the child includes the parental behaviors entitled expressiveness, enjoyment, warmth, and acceptance. The second, orientation to child's interests includes parental sensitivity, responsivity, and effectiveness. The third, performance orientation includes parental achievement orientation, pace, and directiveness. Parental verbal praise and inventiveness in stimulation did not factor out in any of the three factors.The variables of child age, gender, and developmental level were considered as covariates for the comparison between groups. Gender and developmental status (total BDI score at pretest) emerged as covariates for the variable of parent's performance orientation, but none emerged for the parent's affective relationship with child ororientation to child. No statistically significant differences were found betweenthe parent behaviors in the two groups on any of the three cumulative variables.Parents in the two groups behaved similarly in interaction (see Table 17.16). Public school follow-up. At posttest #4, public school teachers were sentquestionnaires requesting information regarding the children's present educational placement and the parents' participation in their children's education. All but two teachers responded giving us information for 43 subjects. At this time, all of the chi:dren were in public school classrooms ranging from kindergarten to fourth grade.The placement pattern among the grades appear to be similar for both groups (see Table 17.17),but this item was only answered by 36 of the 43 teachers. Itis possible that grade placement is irrelevant in some self-contained special educat'on 811 Utah Parent Involvement 1985782 Table 17.18Comparison of Parental Behaviors in interaction with CHIld for Parents In theCenter-Based and Parent Involvement Groups at Posttest #4 in the 1985 Utah Parent Involvement Study -.29 0 ESCenter-based only PIECenter-based only i Center-based only SO $ Covariates: 0 mg Sex.1. 801 total score at pretest.

Only two children spent any time in resource rooms and five children spent some time in othertypes of classrooms. The time for the rest of the children was divided among thefour types of classrooms, with the typical arrangement for children in both groupsbeing most of the time spent in self-contained classrooms and approximately one- 812BEST COPYAVAILABLE Utah Parent Involvement 1985 783 fourth to one-third of the time in regular classrooms. Although.at Posttest #4 children whose parents had participated in the parent involvement program spent slightly more time in regular classrooms and less time in self-contained classrooms than did children whose parents had not, the class placement of the two groups is very comparable (see Table 17.17).In the questionnaire, teachers were also asked a number of questions about the parents' participation in the child's education program. On each item the teachers rated the parents from one .o three, representing a range of participation from less than other parents to more than other parents. Two of these were summed in a parent attendance category, six were summed into a knowledge category, and seven into a support category. The range of possible scores was from 1 to 6, 6 to 18, and 7 to 21, respectively, for parent attendance, knowledge and support of their child's education program. The mean scores (Table 17.18) indicate above average attendanceat parent functions, knowledge and support of their child's education for both groups.The parent involvement group had slightly higher scores in knowledge andsupport categories, but the differences are not statistically significant.Table 17.18Results of Teacher Questionnaires for 1985 Parent Involvement Study at Posttest #4 Center-Based Only Center-Based + PIE services Percent of 72.8(36.5)72.8:2 only 4 Tne sign of tne ES only indicates direction of difference, no value Judgment is intended.

Utah Parent Involvement 1985 784Conclusions The primary purpose of this investigation was to ascertain the immediate andlong-term effects on the child with handicaps and the family system of the addition ofaparticulartypeofparentinvolvementprogramtoacerter-basedearlyintervention program. The data gathered from the four posttests indicate that theaddition of this type of parent involvement component to a center-based interventionfor children with handicaps had little effect on either the children's developmentor the family system. Child development was measured by the Battelle DevelopmentalInventory (BDI), (at Pretest and Posttests Achievement-Revised Independent Behavior (SIB), and the DevelopmentalSPECS (all at Posttest#4). The child development scores across all four posttests(and as measured by all five measures)indicate that the two groups developedsimilarly and that the addition of this type of parent involvement component did notgive their children an advantage over the children whose parents did not receive theinstruction.Neither was the family system affected, as indicated by the measures of parent stress,family support, family resources, and family functioning. Itcanbehypothesized that attendance at the parent instruction classes might lessen parentstress and increase the parent feeling of social support. Again, neither the datagathered immediately following the alternative intervention or later showed that theparents in the parent involvement group felt less stress or perceived more social support.It is important to note that from the pretest through four posttests thatthe child related stress remained high, with the average stress across posttests being,for both groups combined, at the 88th percentile. There were also nodifferences between the two groups on their perception of resources, or familyfunctioning. Utah Parent Involvement 1985 785Finally, the addition of the parent instruction did not seem to affect thec.old's subsequent school experience,as measured at Posttest #4.The school placement was not signi4icantly ditferent, nor was the teacher's perception of parents' attendance, support, and knowledge.These findings arb important in that this type of parent involvement has beenone of the most frequent ways in which early intervention programs have involved parents (see White, et. al. 1989). The findings do not support the claims that this type of parental involvement program increases the effectiveness of the interventionprogram or enhance the longitudinal benefits of early intervention.However, the results of this study should not necessarily be generlized to other types of parentinvolvement programs.It is useful to interpret the results of this study in conjunction with theDes Moines and the Utah 1986 studies which are replications of this study. Together,they provide relevant findings regarding the efficacy of the addition to a center-based early intervention program of a parent involvement component which Primarily focused on teaching the parent to assist in delivering developmental therapy to their child.The research design and methodology for these stuuies have been sound.Jointly, they demonstrate that questions about parent involvaent can be addressedwith methodologically sound experimental studies and have advanced the search )rthe types of parental involvement that \"work.\" This information isneeded tofacilitate the 1 5 III:TABULAR SUMMARIESOF EACH OF THE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES The design,implementation,and results of these Longitudinal Studies aresufficiently complex that it is difficult to synthesize the key information from each study in a way that facilitates cross study comparisons. To assist in makingsuch comparisons, this section presents the most critical information about thedesign of each study and summarizes in graphic form the results for child and family outcomes.These tabular and graphic representatives are best interpreted inconjunction with the more complete written reports in Part II and should not beviewed as an adequate substitute for those reports.Two pages of information are presented for each study. The first containsinformation about the alternative forms of intervention which were being examined.The second page contains a graphic summary of the outcomes for the various measuresof child and family functioning. The graphis interpreted as follows: outcomemeasures are listed down the left side of the page. Each graph has a vertical line down the center of the remainder of the page. Numbers opposite each outcome measure indicate whether it is the first (represented by 11111), second (represented by 11211), etc.posttest.Thelocation ofthe number with respect to the vertical lineindicates the results for that test. If the number is to the left of the line, thegroup on the left side of the line did better. The distance from the vertical linerepresents the size of the effect in standard deviation units. If a number has asquare around it, the result was statistically significant at p < .05. A circlearound a number indicates statistical significance at .05 < p < .10.To illustrate for the Jordan Intensity Study: two groups (3 days a week vs.5 day a week) of child functioning (two of which had subscales). The result for theBattelle Developmental Inventory's cognitive subtest was about .28 standard deviationunits in favor of the 5 day per week group at the first posttest (statistically 787 significantatp<.10)and.08 standard deviation units(not statisticallysignificant) in favor of the 3 day per week group at Posttest #2. Larger numbersindicate the average effect for either child or family measures for a particular posttest.Such graphic representations provide an excellent summary of the magnitude,direction, and statistical significance of a large number of measures which areuseful in interpreting the overall effect of the intervention. 817 Jordan Intensity Study JORDAN INTENSITY STUDYDesign 53 mildly to severely handicapped preschool-aged children randomly assigned to 2intervention groups.

Activities in each of those areas are described below. DISSEMINATION The institute outlined an ambijous dissemina' )n plan in its original proposal. This plan included 12 major activities. Table 1the following page presents the activities proposed, along with a brief description.During the five years of the project, the institute received approximately 700 inwliries per year regarding working papers and publications of the institute. The institute also sponsored three conferences: (1) a conference on assessment issues;(2) a conference on parent involvement; and (3) a national conference in Washington,D.C., which featured the research findings from research institutes located at utahState University, University of North Carolina, and the University of Pittsburgh,as well as leading professionals in the field.Over 600 persons attended this conference.Brief articles describing the institute and its ongoing research were printed in a wide variety of newsletters and professional pellications over the five- year period.It should also be noted that institute staff provided free consultation to amultitude of agencies: Staff provided information regarding research des.gns, statisticalmethods,teachingpractices,therapy,parentinvolvement,childassessment, economic analysis, and review of the research to practitioners, other researchers,and public leaders. These have included the state departments nf educationinSouth Carolina, Florida,Texas,Mississippi,Ohio,RhodeIsland,Virginia, Massachusetts, Utah, Connecticut, Minnesota, Illinois, California, New \":\":ft 823Table 1Summary of Dissemination Plan ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION 1.Capability of Utah as amember of the nationwidenetworkofUniversityAffiliated information displays. 5.Summerconferencesandworkshops at Utah StateUnivereityUtah State University is a member of a network of 47 University Affil:atedFacilities (UAFs) throughout the United States. One of the primary missions ofUAFs is the dissemination of information about providing effective services tohandicapped people. Consequently, UAF staff were heavily involved in numerousorganizationsandactivitieswhichcontributed tothedissemination ofinformation from EIE1. For example, DCHP staff have regular contact and/orserve on councils for the Developmentally Disabled in Utah. Idaho, and Wyoming;the DCHP sponsored and provided support services to two satellite UAFs inMontana and on the Navajo reservation in Arizona; the OCHP board of directorsincludedrepresentation fromtheUtahDivisionofHealth,localschooldistricts, related university departments, and parents; the DCHP advisory boardincluded people from a five-state area who were associated with the provisionof services to handicapped individuals; and copies of the DCHP annual reportwere distributed each year to over 200 people throughout the United States. Inall of these contacts, information about EIEI, its findings, and products, weredisseminated without any cost to the institute. A second primary thrust of UAF programs was the training of people responsiblefor providing services to handicapped individuals. These training activitiesincluded both preservice and inservice in a wide variety of areas. EaCh yearDCHP staff provided 1,832 student student credit hours of university courseworkand practica, and 29 workshops involving a total of 901.5 person contact hours.Virtually all of these training activities also served a dissemination function,many of which were directly relevant to the provision of services to younghandicappedchildren.Findingsandproductsfromtheinstituteweredisseminated through these training activities with no cost to the institute.Findings and information about products developed by the Utah Institute weredisseminated through a variety of professional outlets. The research generatedarticles submitted to professional refereed journals; all applicable products,technical reports, and research summaries were filed with ERIC. Informationabout the institute and its findings were released to various professional andparent newsletters. Two of these newsletters were published by the DCHP: theExceptional News (a newsletter for proviuers with a circulation of 2,200) andthe Parent Newsletter (a newsletter for parents of handicapped children with acirculation of 700) regularly carried information about the activities of EIEI.Other outlets such as the National Association for Retarded Citizens, theTechnical Assistance Development System (TADS) Newsletter.INTERACT,theNational Center for Clinical Infant Programs, and other state newslettersrepresented dissemination outlets.Findings and information about products were disseminated regularly throughprofessional conferences and meetings. During the first year, no formal paperswere presented at such national meetings because of deadlines for submissions.However,theDCHPregularlydisplaysproductsandinformationatsuchconventions.During 1986-87, the institute did two such exhibits, one at CEC'sannual meeting and the second at the TASH annual meeting. Displays distributedinformation about the mission, activities, and findings of the institute. Insubsequent years of the institute, numerous professional presentations weremade.The institute funded travel and per diem for four people to conventionseach year, but many more presentations were made with travel costs being coveredby other funds.Each year for the past 10 years, Utah State University's Department of SpecialEducation,in conjunction with the DCHP, has sponsored a Special EducationIntervention Conference which is attended by approximately 100 people throughoutthe Western United States. The Head of the Department of Special Educationagreed to have at least one session of this Intervention Conference sponsoredby. EIEI each year. In addition, Utah State University's Lifespan learningCenter, a division of Continuing Education, sponsors numerous workshops eachsummer on a variety of topics. Once such workshop is the Infancy and EarlyChildhood Conference, a week-long workshop co-sponsored by the institute. 824Table 1 (continued)Summary of Dissemination Plan ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION 6.Special net Early Child-hood Bulletin Board 7.Newspaper and televisioncoverage. at meetings 11.Holding advisory commit-te0 meetings as part of anat., dl conventionA member of the institute staff has coordinated the information disseminationactivities of this bulletin board. This made it very easy to routinely includeinformation about the institute on this network. This information reachededucators in every state in the nation. Regionalnewspaperandtelevisionstationsroutinelycoversignificantactivities of the Utah UAF. Staff from the institute worked with USU publicinformation specialists to actively seek out this type of information coverage,as well as to work with Public Broadcasting stations. Some of the most effective and long-term dissemination of institute findings andproducts occured through the placement of graduate students and researchassistants trained by the institute.The UAP has already established anexcellent track record in this area. A number of students who have participatedin the interdisciplinary training program uf the two programs are working inareas directly related to the provision of services to preschool children withhandicaps.Emphasis on the person's interest in working with preschool childrenwas used in recruiting graduate and research assistants. Asa part ofitsdissemination efforts, theinstitute developed a briefexecutive summary of its activities and accomplishments for each year, includinga listing of publications, products, and technical reports which be dissemlnatedfree of charge to a broad audience of people and organizations interested inearly intervention with handicapped children (approximately 200 people).Thisdistribution list was compiled by identifying one person in each state (eithereducation, social services, or health) who was in a key position relative to theprovision of early intervention services in that state, and asking each (.1nominate one other person in their state who ought to be included. HCEEPproject directors and former project directors and university-based researcherswith demonstrated interest in the area were also included.Two or more people from the institute attended the semi-annual institutemeetings in Washington, D.C., and participated fully in its proceedings.During year 1, one advisory committee meeting was held in conjunction with theDivision of Early Childhood annual convention. This advisory committee meetingswas structured so that the institute receives input from the advisory committeeand so that the advisory committee could serve a dissemination function toconference participants. York, Arizona, Washington, and Nebraska; the offices of Senators Orrin Hatch, Lowell Weicker, Edward Kennedy, Chris Dodd, Tom Harkins, and Congressman Wayne Owens; theUtah State Legislature; the National Council of State Governments; and researchers in such diverse locations as England, Denmark, Germany, China, Ecuador, Norway, and New Zealand, Russia, as well as throughout the United States.The institute, as noted in the dissemination plan, co-sponsored five summerworkshops focusing on early childhood research issues. Approximately 400 earlyintervention professionals from around the United States attended these workshops.Presenters included the following nationally Acontains acompletelisting of and presentations. '4 5 826TRAINING GRADUATE STUDENTS/RESEARCH ASSISTANTS Criteria for Graduate/Research AssistantsAn integral part of the institute's activities was to provide advanced research training for research and graduate assistants from several disciplines. The majorityof graduate assistants came from six disciplines: Special Education, Psychology,Communicative Disorders, Economics, Social Work, and Family and Human Development.Research assistants, as a term employed in this report, refers to both staff researchpositions and graduate students. Staff researchers were professional personnel, usually at the junior level, with a Bachelors or Masters Degree. Graduate students were part-time personnel who attended classes and received a stipend for work up to 50% FTE on a project. We projected that at least 10 graduate/research assistantsper year would be involved in the institute's activities. In actual fact, a total of 77 graduate students received a substantial amount of training over the five-yearcontract period. Training of Graduate/Research AssistantsTwo modes of training were employed to provide graduate assistants with relevantresearch skills and experience. These modes are described below.DCHP interdiscigLijacy_traintag. Utah State University (USU) is a part of anationwide network of University Affiliated Facilities (UAFs) which receive coresupport funding from the Administration on Developmental Disabilities. A majorthrust of all UAF programs is to provide interdisciplinary training to persons whoare or will be providing services to persons with developmental disabilities. Someof the training offered to graJuate/research assistants at USU occurred at no costto the institute because of student's participation in existing interdisciplinarytraining programs at the DCHP. Interdisciplinary training is a primary missioh ofthe Utah UAF; therefore, all students who work on research projects were enrolledfor 9 credits of interdisciplinary course work. All graduate students met with toward achieving the goals listedin theirITPs.A compilationof objectives.Two finalevaluationactivities theinstitute.First, arecord ofprofessional657 828 publications and presentations in which the graduate student participated.Finally, a follow-up on the professional placement of institute assistants assessed the usefulness of skillslearned during theproject.As willbenotedinthe dissemination section, graduate students were very productive.In addition, as part of the institutionalized personnel evaluation procedures at Utah State University, all graduate students received a written evaluation at the mid point of each year by their direct supervisor. This process was expanded fur graduatestudents working ontheinstitutetoallow themanopportunityto anonymously complete a brief written evaluation of the institute vis-a-vis their training experience. Results were used to make necessary adjustments to make their experience more profitable.Table 2 lists each graduate student by name, disciplines, and prior degrees. In addition, a brief description of their individual experiences is given as noted earlier.All graduate students have also completed the interdisciplinary training offeredbytheDevelopmentalCenterforHandicappedpersons,whichentails progressing through 12 modules on special education and attending optional lectures on topics such as \"-sing Economic Analyses ni Research\" or \"Expert Systems in Special Education.\"Also, EIRI staff have conducted training for many of the graduate studentsin administration and scoring of test batteries, data analyses for thelongitudinal studies, data monitoring, and computer skills.

Two of these members were unable to serve and were replaced.We added a ninth member, Or. Steve Warren, who was a member of theDivision of Early Childhood Research Committee. Our advisory committee members,together with their areas of expertise, are depicted in Table 3 on the following page.Five advisory committee meetings were held. Two were held during the first yearof the project, one was held during Year 2, a third during Year 3, and a fourth atthe end of Year 5 when we were moving into the follow-up phase of the research. Toincrease the probability of receiving useful input from the advisorycommittee, the following strategies were utilized. 1.An agenda for the meetings was established 30 days in advance afterconsultation with SEP. The agenda was circulated to committee membersfor comment and revision as well as to assist in members' preparation. 2.Specific assignments with due dates and a contact persons were givento members prior to, during, and in between meetings. The contactpersons was responsible for follow-up. 3.A closed session was held at the conclusion of each advisory committeemeeting for members to evaluate and provide feedback to the staff aboutaccomplishments, plans, and products of the institute, and the contentof a particular meeting. 4.A written report was distributed within 30 days of each advisorycommittee meeting summarizing the recommendations made and the proposedor completed action. Similar records were kept of advice given inbetween meetings. This compilation served as the first item on thenext meeting agenda. Asnoted earlier,two meetings of the national advisory committee of thelongitudinal studies were held during the first nine months of the contract. As perthe original proposal, the first meeting was held in conjunction with the NationalEarly Childhood Conference on Children with Special Needs, sponsored by the Councilfor Exceptional Children and the Division of Early Childhood. Holding the meetingin conjunction with such a national meeting occurred in order to provide an 864 835Table 3Membership of Early intervention Effectiveness institute Advisory Committee Name Position Qualification Craig Ramey, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology, Directorof Research at the Frank PorterGraham Child Development Center,University of North CarolinaSince 1975, Dr. Ramey haS directed theCarolina Abecedarian Project and ProjectCARE--two projects assessing the longitudinaleffeCt of early intervention with \"high risk\"and developmentally delayed children.

During this dinner, the goals andobjectives of the longitudinal studies were described, the acting director of theOffice of Special Education Programs commented briefly on the federal government'sperspective aL.out the longitudinal studies, a membc:I. of the advisory committeeaddressed the topic, \"The Contribution of Research to Policy and Practice in EarlyChildhood Special Education,\" and there was a time for comment and discussion bythose attending. Approximately 15 people, in addition to staff and advisorycommittee members, attended at least part of the advisory committee meetings thefollowing day. 837 Based on ourexperience was our conclusion, with theadvisorycommittee, that the strategyof soliciting isgiven below. thefirst advisorycommitteemeeting, it was emphasized that Option 1 Aould focus on comparisons ofintensity oftreatmentrather than\"treatment vs. notreatment\"comparisons.This in the typesof studiesdescribed earlier in this report. AdvisoryCommittee members also emphasized that UtahState University needed to retainresponsibility for randomlyassigoingsubjects to groups. The importance of the need theactivities ofinstitute staff in both theinstrumentation area committee867 838shaped EIRI activities will be obvious as one reviews the minutes of the advisorycommittee meeting which may be found in Appendix B.The second advisory committee meeting was similarly successful. Examples ofthe areas emphasized at this meeting included the need to develop explicitcriteria for how sites were selected and for ensuring that sites provided high-quality services. The decision to use an independent onsite evaluator each yearin assisting with the verification of treatment implementation was one way inwhich EIRI staff implemented this suggestion. The advisory committee againemphasized the need to raise additional money which could be used to hire a 1/4time onsite coordinator for each of the studies to assist with verifying treatmentimplementation. They complimeoted the institute staff on the thoroughness of theplan for verifying treatment implementation, but questioned whether the plan couldbe fully implemented without additional resources.Other advisory committee meetings provided feedback which was also useful.Questions were raised regarding further explication of our theoretical conceptualframework which caused the staff to do further writing in this area.Also, usefulsuggestions were given regarding the dissemination of research results, sitemanagement activities, and onsite evaluations.In sum, we continue to support the notion that advisory committees areessential to large-scale research efforts and that they provide a cost-effectivemeans of receiving input from various constituent groups. 839REFERENCES Abbott, J., & Sabatino, D.
