This choice symbolized the centrality of utopian - ism to her life, thought, and educa - tional practice . In three books, each in their own way groundbreaking, a fourth book co-authored by one of us, and in important articles, her work falls into four primary areas: political theory, feminism, environmentalism, and intentional communities, with much of her work intersecting two, three, or even all four . And in all her work, she brings the lens of utopi - anism to bear on the subject and, in doing so, illuminates both utopia - nism and the subject at hand . The volume honors Sargisson's contribu - tions to the field of utopian studies, with contributions by Ibtisam Ahmed, Raffaella Baccolini, David M . Lucy Sargis - son, Simon Spiegel, Maria Varsam, and Laura Winter .

Articles collected here focus on the increasing dynamism and fluidity of dependencies between literature, visual arts, digital media, or internet artistic projects . They an - alyse the abrupt evolutions of the me - dia through which art is made availa - ble to the public, as well as describe the changing status of audiences and viewers within the new communica - tive paradigms . Verging on the non- human, computer-generated, or vir - tual reality, texts and projects ana - lysed here provide case studies for a better understanding of the contemporary cultural reality whose most significant feature is the fact that it is an inherent part of our everyday experience .

This book claims that Enright advocates for this cause by giving voice, in her literature, to those she considers the most repressed in the society she reports to . By telling stories of pregnancy, mothers, daugh - ters and grandmothers, she empow - ers women, opens up possibilities for the future and give expression to opin - ions long buried . ANNE Aesthetics: Writing, Mothering, Spiraling retraces Enright's prose and it comes up with an original account of her aesthetics: Enright writes in a spiral, her works reveals a spiral - ing aesthetics in which the spiral is feminine and it lifts women's rep - utation up . In this aesthetical process, the author uses narrative strat - egies to guide the reader in a circular-upward progression towards so - cial self-awareness . In reading Enright's literary texts, the individual is led to perceive a self-reflection by exploring the inner self and the body of her characters . Then, carried by the spiral, the narrative promotes an elevation of the reader towards self-awareness of his or her materiality immersed in a great realm of human relations . 2 Biography, Literature & Literary Studies author demonstrates how utopian visions written from particular po - litical perspectives transcend narrowly partisan concerns to stoke our collective desire for another world and a more adequate human future, teaching us how to become the citizens and subjects that a utopian so - ciety demands .

The study addresses beauty as a mode of being rather than a mere adornment of human existence . Tracing Plato's legacy in the two authors, it espouses the proximity of truth and beauty, and argues for beauty's restorative capac - ity discerned in the repetitive patterns of the universe . Showing the poetics of Gadamer and Woolf as mutually in - terpenetrating, it encourages to see the beauty of the poetic word as a gate - way to Being . This meditation on beauty and Being contests the prevail - ing ways of thinking about the (in)dependent fields of literature and philosophy . Tomasz Fisiak She-(d)evils?

This book attempts to prove that despotic women in Gothic fiction are more than mere female equivalents of male ty - rants or negatives to angelic damsels in distress . Rather, they are multidi - mensional characters who are pun - ished for their independence, power and the free expression of their erotic needs . The book explains how their portrayal has evolved, embracing a se - lection of texts written between 1764 and 2003, as well as a few cinematic adaptations of the analyzed works . The study views Gothic anti-hero - ines in their historical, social, class and cultural contexts, paying par - ticular attention to the notion of desire and its fulfillment . The analy - sis, accompanied by the relevant theoretical framework, aims to help the eponymous \"she-devils\" reclaim their space and voice .

These wide-ranging essays trace the constant reconsideration of the utopian project itself over the past four decades, from its mid-twentieth century period of decline to its revival in counter-cul - tural science fiction of the 1960s and '70s, its second decline with the \u00abdys - topian turn\u00bb in film, and the rise of feminist pessimism in the 1980s . These pages reveal what popular utopian, dystopian, and science-fiction narra - tives tell us about today's most pressing political issues, including gen - der equity, education reform, technological change, capitalist excess, state-sanctioned violence, and the challenges of effecting lasting polit - ical change . Through analyses of various popular genres and media, the 3 Biography, Literature & Literary Studies (Dinah Roe, Reader in Nineteenth Century Literature, Oxford Brookes University) William Michael Rossetti's s\u00e9ance diary is a remarkable doc - ument in both the history of Pre-Raphaelitism and nineteenth-century spiritualism . In this previously unpublished manuscript, Rossetti me - ticulously recorded twenty s\u00e9ances between 1865 and 1868 . The origi - nal motive was the death, in 1862, of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's wife, Eliz - abeth Siddal . He felt a profound sense of guilt about her and began these s\u00e9ances to reassure himself that she was happy in the afterlife . Mes - sages came from many spirits within the Pre-Raphaelite circle and pro - vide an unprecedented record of spiritualist activity in the late nine - teenth century . Questions and answers fill the pages of the diary, many of them communicating uncannily accurate information or details that could be known only to the participants . This book also includes an - other unpublished document showing spiritualism in action . It com - prises a long letter to Dante Gabriel Rossetti written in 1856 from the artist and spiritualist medium Anna Mary Howitt recounting her in - teractions with the spirit world and her (sometimes violent) experi - ences as she became aware of the extent of her psychic powers . Both sections of this book provide an original insight into the cult of spirit - ualism and throw considerable light on the interactions between mem - bers of the Pre-Raphaelite circle and beyond .

The book offers systematic insight into multiple transformations and trans - positions of the narrative variants, and invariants, of the genre of hagi - ography that once determined the dis - semination of culture .

Behind the present volume lies a search for a view from which the frame of the Brit - ish context as well as the dichotomy between British and Irish literature can be dismantled and disrupted in a most creative sense . It addresses the question of Irish literature's intrinsic openness by first focusing on the Brit - ish context that affected Irish literary production through three centuries and then looking beyond it towards the European or global context that lay behind Irish modernism . The book further extends its research to modern Irish poetry and discusses three prominent poets after W .B . Yeats whose works are in and beyond the British context in each different way . Providing unique and new per - spectives that have been evolved mostly from an international confer - ence held in Kyoto, Japan, this collection attempts to reassess and ex - plore the values of Irish literature in a global context .

The first of nine chapters discusses the origin, na - ture, and meaning of modern American proverbs based on about 1500 texts . The next large chapter contains a general overview of their for - ward-looking message that includes the American spirit of mobility with its emphasis toward a successful and exciting future . The third chapter treats proverbial emotions about modern life, with the fourth chapter considering the modern wisdom about age and aging . The next two chapters cover somatic aspects of these proverbs and also the pre - occupation with time . This is followed by a discussion about pecuniary proverbs that reflect the attitudes of a capitalistic society . The next chap - ter shows that modern proverbs continue to include references to ani - mals as has been the case with older proverbs . Finally, there is the ninth chapter about sexuality and scatology in modern proverbs, indicating that these topics play a considerable role in this modern wisdom . Such proverbs were often excluded form proverb collections . With the much greater openness about love, sex, and various taboos, proverbs have be - come much more open literally or figuratively about these matters that are an obsession of sorts throughout the society . Altogether these nine chapters with their many modern American proverbs present a fasci - nating metaphorical picture of a general of composite American world - view . Tessa Roynon Marc C.

It exam - ines how and why this avowedly \u00abAmer - ican\u00bb author read literature and schol - arship from across the world and has in turn been widely read outside the borders of the USA . How did Ellison's encounters with the \u00abinternational\u00bb Henry James, the Cambridge Ritual - ists, the Roman poet Ovid and with Dostoevsky shape both the aesthetics and the politics of his own work? And what is the relationship between In- visible Man and the complex and al - ways evolving political and cultural contexts of South Africa, the USSR and Russia, Germany and Japan since World War II? Contributors from seven different countries - based in Asia, Africa, Europe and the USA - deploy significant archival research both in Ellison's personal library and in the translation and reception histories of his iconic first novel .

After all, folk - lorists and cultural historians were primarily interested in traditional ma - terials with some consideration also being given to their innovative adap - tations . While this interplay of tradi - tion and innovation informed many studies that exemplified a certain con - stancy in change, little attention was paid to new or modern folklore items . But there has been a revolutionary change during the past few decades in that scholars have looked at the crea - tion of new folklore . This change of emphasis has also influenced pare - miographers (proverb collectors) and paremiologists (proverb schol - ars) . In fact, the Dictionary of Modern Proverbs (2012) edited by Charles Clay Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder, and Fred R . Shapiro has become solid proof that there is such a phenomenon as modern proverbs .

In their lively pieces they explore the myriad ways in which physical activities in particular environmental contexts have directly and radically impacted their composing processes as well as their lives as writers . Drawing from techniques in creative nonfic - tion as well as rhetoric and writing studies, each author draws the reader into her/his adventures and experiences in illuminating ways, further - ing the argument that physical activities are not disconnected from our writing . Rather, they are inextricably linked to our writing practices . And oftentimes we are in fact composing in the very act of engaging in such physical activities .

Clearly demonstrating the creative potential of critical writing, these essays are a fitting tribute to the creativity, origi - nality and subtlety of Timothy Mathews's scholarly accomplishment and his contribution to our under - standing of art and of the aesthetic re - lation .\u00bb (Dr Ian James, University of Cambridge) \u00abThis book in honour of Timothy Mathews is much more than a Festschrift . It is a collection of thought-provoking, daring insights into the crucial place of literature and the arts in our world and in our being human . It is an exhilarating multifarious demonstration of how creativity can undo, without for a moment losing intellectual rigour, the disciplinary and academic structures that constrain our thinking . Driven by curiosity and by care - love, even - the many contributions to the volume show, in their different ways, how criticism can be at its most effective by being at its most imaginative and its least predicta - ble .\u00bb (Professor Lucia Boldrini, Goldsmiths, University of London) This book is an offering . It contains eighteen essays in honour of Timothy Mathews, written by leading scholars in the fields of French, Compara - tive Literature, Visual Culture and Creative Critical Writing . These es - says examine the power of serendipitous encounter between artists, thinkers and artistic media as well as the importance of creative inter - jection in the arts and humanities . They advance fresh interpretations of some important figures in twentieth-century European culture - Apollinaire, Beckett, Benjamin, Calvino, Dal\u00ed, Genet, Nooteboom, Rou - baud - using modes of reading that are both intellectually brave and open to fragility, intimate as well as critical, at once playful and ear - nest . They bring texts and artworks into relation in order to amply dem - onstrate that relation itself is a form of thinking . 8 Cultural Studies such assorted fields as literature, linguistics, anthropology, sociology and ethnology, whose interests and areas of enquiry apparently con - verged and partly overlapped . A selection of primary sources from lead - ing figures such as Matthew Arnold, Bronisaw Malinowski, Ruth Ben - edict, T . S . Eliot, Ezra Pound and Aldous Huxley provide an overview of the crucial issues raised on a wide array of topics: civilization, race, na - tion, progress, evolution, education, art, science, literature and politics . The primary sources are accompanied by critical essays that offer new insights into these classic texts . This reader will be of use to undergrad - uate and postgraduate students as well as to scholars exploring the cross-disciplinary or transatlantic nature of the study of culture .

And how can they fight back? Historically these fields have suffered from a lack of prestige due to the util - itarian perspective of the \u00abdeveloped\u00bb world . While such utilitarian views have not been entirely fair on this branch of knowledge, the humanities themselves are partly to blame for this crisis, often not keeping pace with an increasingly changing society . It is therefore imperative that the human - ities once and for all prove themselves relevant, leaving behind \u00abdepartmen - talized\u00bb approaches to academic knowl - edge and embracing the social mis - sion that once epitomized humanistic study . Guided by such principles, this book features fourteen interdisciplinary studies that explore ex - citing intersections between different areas of academic research . These studies centre around three broad topics, which function as this vol - ume's structural axes: identity, gender, and space and mobility (whether voluntary, as in tourism, or imposed, as in the case of migrations and persecutions) . Altogether, the volume demonstrates that the humani - ties, far from being artificially detached from society, can actually study the enormously complex context that is contemporary Europe and cru - cially point the way to a better, more equitable world .

With the help of Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner's conceptual integration the - ory, which shares a surprising num - ber of correspondences with Wolfgang Iser's The Act of Reading , it is possible to flesh out the latter's model of nar - rative meaning-making . In turn, this allows for a consistent reader-response approach to the medium of comics and auto/biography as one of its dom - inant genres . The fragmentation of comics narratives, but also of human lives and identities, requires such a theory that can explain how different perspectives and experiences can be blended into an experiential whole . 10 Gender Studies: Women & Girls Clare Gorman (eds.)

This book ex - plores the underestimated legacy of women's fiction and (semi-)autobio - graphical works about pregnancy and childbirth in Great Britain and North America during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, highlighting the symbiosis between the processes of childbearing and writing, problema - tizing female subjugation to the patri - archal institution of motherhood, and compensating for the silence around the experience of becoming a mother in literature . Drawing on the an - thropological concept of liminality, controversies about maternity within women's liberation movements, and milestones in French fem - inist theory, this book discusses pregnancy and childbirth as trans - formative events that can engender both women's imaginative responses to procreation and re-creations of memories about their prenatal/na - tal episodes, as well as therapeutic narratives of self-discovery and re - covery from pain . Examining the works of authors such as Mary Shel - ley, Emily Bront\u00eb, Jean Rhys, Ana\u00efs Nin, Margaret Drabble, and Toni Mor - rison, this book posits a literary corpus of procreativity, written by women with an empowering white ink to defend their (un)maternal freedom and (life-)writings . 11 Grammar, Syntax & Morphology Historical & Comparative Linguistics Yoshiyuki Asahi (eds.)

This book is a collection of papers pre - sented at Methods XVI in Tachikawa, Japan, in 2017 . It was the first time Methods took place in Asia . In this vol - ume, the emphasis is on diverse meth - ods and diverse research questions . Many of the papers focus on language innovation, language change, corpus studies and linguistic atlas from dif - ferent perspectives . At the same time, methodological innovation is very much in focus . Its emphasis meant that several papers showcased cutting- edge quantitative techniques that allow dialectologists to address ques - tions that had been thought impossible to answer only a few years ago . s/w Abb ., 1 .95 / \u20acA 60 .- / \u20ac 57 .10 / \u00a3 47 .- / US-$ 68 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -82186-2 CHF 75 .- / \u20acD 63 .- / \u20acA 66 .- / \u20ac 60 .- / \u00a3 49 .- / US-$ 72 Xaver Hauf Verbs of Speaking and the Linguistic Expression of Communication in the History of English Berlin, 2021 . 324 pp ., 52 fig . .95 / \u20acA 71 .90 / \u20ac 65 .40 / \u00a3 54 .- / US-$ 78 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -85464-8 CHF 81 .- / \u20acD 69 .95 / \u20acA 71 .90 / \u20ac 65 .40 / \u00a3 54 .- / US-$ 78 .95 English verbs of speaking have been affected by profound and intriguing changes, in particular between Old and Middle English . These changes crucially involve the loss of the verb cwe\u00fean and its replacement by say, which remains the most common verb of speaking to this day . The present study provides an exhaustive corpus- based, cross-period, and multi-dimen - sional appraisal of verbs of speaking used as part of the linguistic expres - sion of communication in the history of English situated within a frame-se - mantic and constructionist frame - work . Moreover, it elucidates the fas - cinating changes affecting the verbs used to talk about communication between Old and Middle English . Also, this study sheds light on the functions of medially placed reporting clauses emerging in the Middle English period . 12 Historical & Comparative Linguistics History of the Americas Ilias Ben Mna Echoes of Reaganism in Hollywood Blockbuster Movies from the 1980s to the 2010s Berlin, 2021 . 378 pp ., 16 89 .- .95 / \u20acA 79 .10 / \u20ac 72 .- / \u00a3 59 .- / US-$ 86 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -84349-9 This book examines the reverbera - tions of key components of Ronald Reagan's ideology in selected Holly - wood blockbuster movies . The aim of this analysis is to provide a clearer un - derstanding of the intertwinement of cinematic spectacles with neoliberal - ism and neoconservatism . The analy - sis comprises a dissection of Reagan's presidential rhetoric and the exami - nation of four seminal Hollywood blockbuster movies . The time range for analysis stretches from the 1980s until the 2010s . Among the key foci are filmic content as well as produc - tion and distribution contexts . It is concluded that Reagan's political metaphors and the corporatization of film studios in the 1970s and 1980s continue to shape much of Holly - wood blockbuster filmmaking .

This phenomenon is referred to as \"the Empire writes back to the centre\"\u2014a trend that asserted itself in late twentieth-century postcolonial criticism . The aim of such acts of writ - ing back is to read colonialist texts in a Barthesian way inside-out or \u00e0 l'envers , to deconstruct the Oriental - ist and colonialist dogmas, and even - tually create a dialogue where there was only a monologue . Turning the colonial text inside-out and rereading it through the lens of a later code al - lows the postcolonial text to unlock the closures of its colonial precur - sor and change it from the inside . Under this critical scholarship, Jo - seph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899) has been a particularly influen - tial text for Chinua Achebe and V . S . Naipaul . Their novels Things Fall Apart (1958) and A Bend in the River (1979) can be seen as a rewriting of Conrad's novella . However, before examining their different rewriting strategies, it would be fruitful to locate them within the postcolonial tradition of rewriting . While Achebe clearly stands as the leading fig - ure of the movement, the Trinidadian novelist is, in fact, difficult to pi - geonhole . Does Naipaul write back to, that is criticize, or does he re - write, and in a way adopt and justify, imperial ideology? Since not all rewriting involves writing back in terms of anti-colonial critique, Nai - paul's position continues to be explored as the enigmatic in-between - ness and double-edgedness of an \"insider\" turned \"outsider .\" Taking cognizance of these different critical perceptions can become a way to effectively highlight Achebe's \"(mis)-reading\" and Naipaul's \"(mis)-ap - propriation\" of Conrad, a way to set the framework for the simulated conversation this book seeks to create between the three novelists . 14 Language & Linguistics Catherine Nealy Judd Travel Narratives of the Irish Famine Politics, Tourism, and Scandal, 1845-1853 Oxford, 2020 . 62 .- / \u20acD 51 .95 / \u20acA 51 .90 / \u20ac 49 .40 / \u00a3 40 .- / US-$ 60 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-1 -80079-085-8 CHF 62 .- / \u20acD 51 .95 / \u20acA 51 .90 / \u20ac 49 .40 / \u00a3 40 .- / US-$ 60 .95 Ireland's Great Famine generated West - ern Europe's most devastating social crisis of the nineteenth century, a cri - sis that created enormous and trans - formational upheaval . In Travel Nar - ratives of the Irish Famine: Politics, Tour - ism, and Scandal, 1845-1853 , author Catherine Nealy Judd proposes that a new literary genre emerged from the crucible of the Great Famine, that is, the Irish Famine travelogue . In her keenly argued and thoroughly re - searched book, Judd contends that pre - vious scrutiny of Famine travel nar - ratives has been overly broad, periph - eral, or has tended to group Famine travelogues into an undi erentiated whole . Judd invites us to consider Famine-era travel narratives as comprising a unique subgenre within the larger discursive - eld of travel literature . Here Judd argues that the immensity of the Famine exerted great pressure on the form, topics, themes, and goals of Famine-era travelogues, and for this reason, Fam - ine travel narratives deserve detailed and organized consideration, as well as critical recognition of their status as an unprecedented subgenre . Drawing on an extensive array of underutilized sources, Travel Narra - tives of the Irish Famine adumbrates the Irish Famine travelogue canon . latorial issues such as the impact of Latin 'quis' on the Middle English interrogative 'who of', the problems that may arise when translating Beowulf into Galician, a reinterpretation of Chaucer's Knight's Tale, and a discussion of the structure of medieval manuscripts containing mis - cellanea .

The book ex - plains how writing and language that exist in \"writing systems\" can indi - rectly (though powerfully) affect peo - ple and environments in sometimes distant contexts . In so doing, the book takes on a question central to rheto - ric and writing throughout its long history but perhaps even more press - ing today: how do we recognize and measure the e?ects of writing when those effects are so tangled up with our complex material and discursive environments? The surprisingly powerful effects explored here suggest new ways of thinking about and teaching writing and the applications, lessons, and examples in the text precisely model what this thinking and teaching might look like . This book is primed to serve as an important addition to reading lists of scholars and graduate students in Writing Studies and Rhetoric and should appear on many syllabi in courses on writing and writing in - struction and on rhetoric, both introductory and advanced . As well, the book's advocacy for the unrecognized potential impact of writing in - struction makes it appealing for writing program directors and any po - tential university faculty, administrators, and non-academics inter - ested in the importance and the efficacy of writing instruction . This book is also a useful resource for scholars and graduate students spe - cializing in Writing Across the Curriculum, as the text provides a use - ful way to shift the conversation and communicate about writing across disciplines . 15 Language & Linguistics A.Nejat T\u00f6ng\u00fcr Yldray \u00c7evik (eds.)

By taking into account the English and Scottish cul - tural contexts, as well as other tradi - tions of writing, the book shows how the ideas on human well-being were disseminated and adjusted to meet cultural changes . In this, the book contributes to a discussion on what constitutes \"mindful\" or \"virtuous\" living, a discussion that is as relevant today as it was in the Middle Ages . 16 Language & Linguistics Language Teaching Theory & .95 / \u20acA 71 .90 / \u20ac 65 .40 / \u00a3 54 .- / US-$ 78 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -81531 -1 CHF 81 .- / \u20acD 68 .67 / \u20acA 71 .94 / \u20ac 65 .40 / \u00a3 54 .- / US-$ am Main ausgezeichnet .

Indeed, an overview of re - cent Bront\u00eb scholarship indicates that two important critical shifts have lately cropped up: an increasing sociologi - cal attention to cultural studies on the one hand and an emphasis on inter - disciplinarity . The present book is an unprecedented and groundbreaking study on Wuthering Heights. It detaches itself from the current productive vogue for sociological approaches to narrative texts which has contributed to obscure the focus on anomalous intertextual relations, and prior - itizes the literary context over any other biographical, historical, or cul - tural context . Determining Wuthering Heights postulates a determinate intertextual meaning of Emily Bront\u00eb's novel , enriching its heteroge - neity by examining its dialogic relation with previous, contemporary and subsequent texts in order to confirm that Emily Bront\u00eb's novel is not sui generis . The target audience of the book would be members of the academic community interested in Victorian literature in general (researchers, scholars...) and in Wuthering Heights in particular . How - ever, since Wuthering Heights has become a classic novel which is today read and discussed in universities around the world, the subject may also appeal to students who have to take a course on Victorian Litera - ture and/or on the Bront\u00ebs . 17 Language Theory .95 / \u20acA 51 .40 / \u20ac 46 .70 / \u00a3 38 .- / US-$ 56 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -84510-3 CHF 58 .- / \u20acD 49 .95 / \u20acA 51 .40 / \u20ac 46 .70 / \u00a3 38 .- / US-$ 56 Inklusion stellt nature of L2 proficiency as it develops over time and in relation to L2 instruction and provides a framework that can be used in future endeavours to design and validate tests of L2 proficiency devel - opment .

His works go against the foundations of Western thought, which has been tra - ditionally focused on success, clarity, learning and ability, while Beckett chose to focus on failure, confusion, decay and impotence . This study pur - ports to show the central importance of the three categories chosen for the general understanding of the writer's work . It constitutes an attempt to pro - vide a gendered interpretation of Beck - ett's protagonists, who are increas - ingly unable to reason, talk or move properly, extremely old and do not fit hegemonic models of masculin - ity . Beckett, who denies his own ability as an author to understand and explain a chaotic world, chooses these disabled, old men as the ultimate representatives of the human condition and the best models to trans - mit his worldview . This is a book combining different perspectives and getting to conclusions regarding power structures which are particu - larly interesting for researchers or students taking courses on the dia - lectics of alterity, masculinities studies or new readings of Samuel Beck - ett's works . The author's research is based on the main arguments of feminist thought, masculinities studies, disability studies, ageing stud - ies and recent work on Beckett . The ultimate goal of such interdiscipli - nary approach is to show how different systems of oppression work in similar ways and to draw the political implications of Beckett's literary choices, in terms of visibility and solidarity .

This book evaluates the relationship be - tween vocabulary knowledge and lis - tening comprehension in English as a foreign language (EFL), which has not been sufficiently investigated em - pirically . In particular, it has an added focus on the use of aural vocab - ulary knowledge tests in detecting the role of vocabulary knowledge in listening comprehension . It highlights the role of vocabulary knowl - edge in determining listening success . Specifically, it draws scholars' attention to the contributions of aural vocabulary knowledge to listen - ing comprehension .

In this intrigu - ing book some leading Irish, English and American literary scholars of his poetry come together with others who approach him and his work through biography, history, art, music, trans - lation, religion and philosophy . Their essays are intended for whoever has enjoyed O'Siadhail's life-loving, in - tense yet accessible poems . An over - all account is given of his life, his work and the reception of his poetry so far . There are close readings of some poems, analyses of his artistry in matching diverse content with both classical and innovative forms, and studies of recurrent themes such as love, death, language, music and the shifts of modern life . His rich intellectual and imaginative world of meaning is explored, and special attention is paid to early collections, to his tour de force on the Holocaust, and to Globe's meditations on his - tory and vision in a time of rapid change . O'Siadhail's stature as an Irish and European poet is assessed, and a range of affinities with other po - ets - Donne, Rilke, Dante, Kavanagh - are traced . Yet the attempt to cat - egorize O'Siadhail comes up against the real possibility that, according to one critic, 'it may be that he has done something rare, that he has cre - ated his own tradition' . 20 Language: History & General Works Language: Reference & General Ellen C.

Moreover, in the current world order where the rise of China has played a significant role and triggered different specula - tions on various fronts, this book takes readers on a long, exciting journey back to the very beginning of how Westerners perceive China and Chi - nese people in the thirteenth century and across the centuries to the current era\u2014a journey that enables the traveler to feel the pulse of historical moments that have come to in - fluence Sino-Western relations and China's image in the Western mind . Bringing an interesting, original corpus of Anglophone texts (some largely forgotten) into conversation around the vocabularies they de - ploy to deal with relationships between Chinese and non-Chinese char - acters, this book helps readers to rethink current issues of migration, identity, sexuality, hybridity, and diaspora that have taken the present shape under the residual effects of the racial and sexual discourses of the past and that are instrumental to our historical position and trajec - tory . Therefore, this book is about the past and the present, the East and the West, the Self and the Other, the center and the periphery; but it is more about the temporary, the fluid, the liminal, the in-between . 21 Language: Reference & General Alberto Castelli A Letter to China The Age of Postmodernity and Its Heritance New 84 .95 / \u20acA 87 .10 / \u20ac 79 .20 / \u00a3 64 .- / US-$ 94 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-1 -4331 -7638-8 CHF 98 .- / \u20acD 84 .95 / \u20acA 95 .- / \u20ac 79 .20 / \u00a3 64 .- / US-$ 94 .95 This edited collection brings together a range of essays that examine the maze of Chinese postmodernity .

The author examines temporal, situational, and verbal anomalies in Hamlet and other plays using hermeneutic-dialec - tic methodology, and finds a consist - ent pattern of interpretation that is compatible with the history of astron - omy and with the development of mod - ern cosmology . He also demonstrates how Shakespeare takes into account beliefs about the nature of the heav - ens from the time of Pythagoras up to and including discoveries and theories in the first decade of the seventeenth century . The book makes the case that, as in many other fields, Shakespeare's celestial knowledge is far beyond what was commonly known at the time . Students and teachers interested in Shakespeare's alleged indifference towards, or ignorance of, the celestial sciences will find this book illuminating, as will historians of science and scholars whose work focuses on episte - mology and its relationship to the canon, and on how Shakespeare ac - quired the data that his plays deliver .

Schultz donated to the University of Cincinnati her set of composition ma - terials gathered from fifteen libraries and collections around the country . With 350 entries ranging from 1785 to 1916, the collection includes picture books for early primary schools, gram - mar textbooks, student writing, and advanced rhetoric textbooks for un - dergraduates . The documents afford a thrilling glimpse into nineteenth- century ways of thinking and teach - ing, highlighting practices we would today identify as prewriting, collabo - rative invention, freewriting, and ob - ject-oriented pedagogy . Composing Legacies relates these pedagogies to expressions of social class, nationalism, and public engagement that run throughout the Victorian era and the Gilded Age . Early chapters show how writing and grammar handbooks aimed to reproduce social hierarchies; later ones show how textbook authors aimed to mitigate lecture-style pedagogy with attention to student backgrounds, personal interests, economic aspirations, and presumed audiences . Often, those authors demonstrated a pronounced interest in national unity, but not without exception . Little-known Confederate textbooks took the ide - ology of unity to be a form of Northern aggression, promoting the main - tenance of state and local traditions through their classroom exercises and sample passages . Composition scholars who see the nineteenth- century as a period of skills-and-drills teaching, devoid of explicit po - litical concern, will find surprises in the archival texts' testimonies about national crises and civic participation . Those scholars will also find that the \"social turn\" in writing and rhetoric, however recent as a historical framework, has been underway for more than two hundred years . 22 Language: Reference & General Linguistics Jos\u00e9 Luis Oncins Mart\u00ednez (eds.)

Irish Lesbian Writing Across Time is an attestation of a his - torical presence of lesbians in Irish lit - erature, as it analyses the progression of Irish lesbian narrative over the past two centuries, while verifying key characteristics of time periods that correspond with the model of devel - opment . It also investigates Irish les - bian activist literature, writing from diaspora, and fiction published around the time of the decriminalisation of homosexual acts and later the in - clusion of same-sex marriage in Irish and Northern Irish laws . The book examines authors such as Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Grand, George Egerton, Elizabeth Bowen, Kate O'Brien, Edna O'Brien, Emma Donoghue, Mary Dorcey, Anna Livia, Shani Mootoo, and Hilary McCollum, whose inclu - sion of lesbian desire to the Irish literary canon proves an invaluable contribution .

This \"pre - sent-ness\" of racial passing, the fact that it has not really become \" pass\u00e9 ,\" is noticeable in the great number of testimonies which have been pub - lished in the 2000s and 2010s by de - scendants of individuals who passed for white in the English-speaking world . The sheer number of publications sug - gest a continuing interest in the kind of relation to the personal and national other, fabricating dandy authorial performances that are simultane - ously unapologetically feminine and queer . In showing how these au - thors redefined the interplay between dandyism and authorship, this book makes an important contribution to rethinking modernist liter - ary culture .

How writers understand and use history can play an equally important role in how they navigate a novel . This book explores the nature of the author's re - lationship with history and fiction - often using writers' own words - as well as the role history plays in fiction . Focusing on genre fiction, this study considers key issues in the relation - ship between history and fiction, such as how writers contextualise the his - tory they use in their fiction and how they incorporate historical research . The book also addresses the re - lated topic of world building using history, discussing the connections between the science fiction writers' notion of world building and the scholarly understanding of story space and explaining the mechanics of constructing the world of the novel .

Moreover, this study deals with how and why Kurt Vonnegut's fiction represents the past which is at stake in the long-delayed revelation of cases of racial passing . This interest in family memoirs or in fictional works re-trac - ing the erasure of some relative's racial identity is by no means limited to the United States: for instance, Zo\u00eb Wicomb in South Africa or Zadie Smith in the UK both use the passing novel to unravel the complex sit - uation of mixed-race subjects in relation to their family past and to a national past marked by a history of racial inequality . Yet, the vast ma - jority of critical approaches to racial passing have so far remained largely focused on the United States and its specific history of race relations . The objective of this volume is twofold: it aims at shedding light on the way texts or films show the work of individual memory and collective recollection as they grapple with a racially divided past, struggling with its legacy or playing with its stereotypes . Our second objective has been to explore the great variety in the forms taken by racial passing depend - ing on the context, which in turn leads to differences in the ways it is remembered . Focusing on how a previously erased racial identity may resurface in the present has enabled us to extend the scope of our study to other countries than the United States, so that this volume hopes to propose some new, transnational directions in the study of racial passing .

There was early critical hostility to the stance adopted by Kipling's characters, that of a superior knowledge acquired by friendship with a small male circle . This book engages with a long-stand - ing critical tradition which treats the jokes as acts of vicarious revenge or symptoms of supposed defects in Ki - pling's personality, instead setting his use of the practical joke in the wider social context of his time . In this book Kipling's writing is examined for what it reveals about a complex, self- conscious but powerful range of values rather than what it is supposed to disguise or conceal . Although he endorsed British colonial rule, Ki - pling was frank about the slackness, endemic rule-breaking and sec - ond-rate nature of British rule in India . He also criticised some of the widespread cultural, religious and moral phenomena of his time, which he thought harmful . Many of his short stories contain an implied but serious criticism of Victorian beliefs, from attitudes to death-beds, and schoolboys to Positivism . 26 Literary Studies: 2018 - Parabel der Moderne / Parable of the Modern Age .

This is ex - plained by the fact that the years 1778, 1801 and 1802 do not entirely cohere with the numerous relative time ref - erences in the novel if, as scholarship contends, the years 1801 and 1802 re - fer to Ellen Dean's narration of the story . By means of mathematically precise calculations and a grammati - cal analysis of the text, this critical new approach argues that the time frame of Wuthering Heights is sound if the years 1801 and 1802 date the writ - ing of Mr . Lockwood's diary . The cru - cial differentiation between the recording of Mr . Lockwood's diary and the narration of Ellen Dean's story leads to a deeper understanding of the intentions of the two narrators and the behaviour of the protagonists .

Focusing on two very different authors, David Malouf and the Indigenous poet Sam - uel Wagan Watson, this book high - lights their similarities rather than their differences . It is the first book- length study dedicated specifically to each author's poetic oeuvre . Compre - hensive readings reveal that an ironic dialectic underpins how each poet writes from within a disjunct of cul - ture and environment following col - onisation, finding hope in dialogue and a productive process of negative assertion . The theoretical fram - ing of Romanticism developed here effectively rehabilitates Romanti - cism as a productive paradigm in contemporary Australian poetry .

They used their grit and willingness to stand up for their principles, took small steps, worked collaboratively, hospitably inviting people to literacy .

The authors clarify the back - ground of depression by paying atten - tion to its representation through these narratives and revalue them as a means of acquiring knowledge in an interdis - ciplinary way . This pioneering initia - tive fills the knowledge gap that still exists concerning the nature of depression from a multidisciplinary perspective that takes into account some cross-cutting narratives . The authors give voice to the forgotten manifestations of depression found in literature, philosophy, theology, and even early medical works . The Faces of Depression in Literature is for graduates and researchers on depression from a cultural and social point of view, including philosophers, historians, cultural theorists, lit - erature and art experts and enthusiasts, as well as artists and writers themselves, specialists in mental health and cognitive psychology, and anyone interested in a better understanding of the human condition .

Thus, the limits that separate theatre and life are highly permeable and the re - lations between both are bidirectional: the performativity of gender and iden - tity is an idea that the theatre takes from and transfers to society . This con - cept is applied to a wide timeframe creating a dialogue between different historical times and cultural back - grounds . Furthermore, the authors explore sexualities as written and performed by both men and women, offering a wider scope to deter - mine whether and to what extent normative gender roles are being questioned, contested or reinforced .

Challeng - ing this long-standing assumption, The Crimean War in Victorian Poetry consid - ers the evolution of the figure of the homefront poet and explores the daunt - ing task of representing war from a ci - vilian perspective . By virtue of the me - dium of modern reportage, the Crimean War (1854-1856) witnessed the inaugu - ration of the civilian spectatorship of distant suffering, provoking a heated debate over the concept of the war poet and the function of war poetry during moments of national crisis . Confronted with news of soldiers' hard - ships and of the distress caused by the government's mismanagement of war, the so-called armchair poet sought ways of addressing the problem of pain and adversity from a distance and of engaging with the politics of war by composing lines of verse at home . This is the first book-length study to examine the predicaments and achievements of mid-Victorian war po - ets . It provides historically nuanced readings of how a diverse group of British poets - ranging from the Poet Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson to the highly acclaimed female poet Louisa Stuart Costello - fought a literary war as they reworked the established traditions of war poetry and exper - imented with poetic forms in response to news of distant combat .

It introduces a model that facilitates the analysis of the construc - tion of consciousness, instances of col - lective thought, and the dynamics of group formation in late-Victorian drama . It can be placed within the framework of cognitive studies be - cause cognitive studies are interested in examining the mental state and the relationship between minds involved in cognitive interaction in narratives . For a long time narrative studies have neglected drama as a genre and, even after the long overdue acceptance of plays in the family of narratives, most critics were eager to focus on performance rather than on play - scripts . This book introduces a model through which the analysis of playscripts will be rewarding and worthwhile . 34 Literary Theory gettable portraits of figures in works ranging from Bellow, Dickens, Fon - tane, Goethe, Moliere, Schiller, Grass, and Raabe to Tolstoy or Trollope, it is equally apparent that primary forms of self-realization show a high correlation of recurring patterns .

The journey to self- discovery can be represented in many different forms, from novels of devel - opment to social criticism and to his - torical plays . It can provide the core of a basic literary form, such as a fair - ytale and the decision on crossroads of life . The self as a primary literary element can be identified as an axis of symmetry, similar to a central sec - tion of a wheel, which connects to all related themes . The description of space, setting, time, historical mo - ment, and heritage shape all documen - tation of self-orientation . Thematic developments highlight specific ap - propriate locations for the unfolding story . By comparing works from different periods and examining manifestations of the theme in Amer - ican, French, English, and German literature, this study traces the theme of self-realization in the coming-of-age constellation, the acceptance and the criticism of existing social conditions, the attempts to compre - hend the past and the current historical conditions, and in utopian vi - sions of the future .

This book focuses espe - cially on important works by Arthur Conan Doyle, Theodor Storm, Frances Hodgson Burnett, and Agatha Chris - tie, while also discussing works by other important European authors . In each of these literary masterpieces the landowner or heir is emotionally and physically endangered and his or her house and estate imperiled by one or more individuals from within his or her own family or from within the sphere of influence of the family . In these works by Arthur Conan Doyle, Theodor Storm, Frances Hodgson Burnett, and Agatha Christie there is a valiant attempt by such individ - uals as Sherlock Holmes, Dr . Watson, Mary Lennox, Hercule Poirot, and others to save the landowners and heirs who are endangered and the estates which are threatened by thoroughly investigating their situa - tions and by searching meticulously for the truth . These protagonists share and exemplify the \"passion for getting at the truth\" which Her - cule Poirot in Agatha Christie's Murder in Three Acts declares is the pri - mary motivating force and inspiration for his criminal investigations .

The volume traces how literary authors and social theorists have answered these questions in different social and historical contexts from the nine - teenth century to the present day .

Among numerous exami - nations within the field of drinking studies, the province of literary criticism offers interesting insights .

By \u00abdialogic\u00bb the author means the sharing of common preoc - cupations, the recursiveness of mo - tifs, themes and patterns, the emer - gence of constants, a network of ex - plicit or hidden confrontations .

Based on real-life characters (Mary Jo Kopechne, Marilyn Monroe, JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey), these works blend fact and fiction, historical and poetic truth, and create a new way to recount facts that allow the writer to give a new voice to people who cannot speak for themselves anymore . The present book addresses the stories behind the novels, their genre and stylistic fea - tures, but is also an exploration of sev - eral aspects of American culture and society and their issues connected to reliable commodity . The facts, objects, texts of fiction and non-fiction, art and other visual sources presented in this volume may seem to share nothing other than their concerns with water and women in nineteenth- century Britain . Yet, by juxtaposing the figures of Ophelia and the Mer - maid, scenes of shipwrecks, accounts of hydrotherapy cures, acts of Par - liament on sanitation, and other material, the author argues that these various and apparently unrelated texts converge towards a central mythical figure, the \u00abwater woman\u00bb .

Designs of Blackness provides less a narrative literary history than, pre - cisely, a series of mappings\u2014each lit - erary-critical and comparative while at the same time offering cultural and historical context . This carefully re- edited version of the 1998 publication opens with an estimation of earliest African American voice in the names of Phillis Wheatley and her contem - poraries . It then takes up the huge span of autobiography from Frederick Dou - glass through to Maya Angelou . \"Har - lem on My Mind,\" which follows, sets out the literary contours of Amer - ica's premier black city . Womanism, Alice Walker's presiding term, is given full due in an analysis of fiction from Harriet E . Wilson to Toni Morrison . Richard Wright is approached not as some regulation \"real - ist\" but as a more inward, at times near-surreal, author . Decadology has its risks but the 1940s has rarely been approached as a unique era of war and peace and especially in African American texts . Beat Generation work usually adheres to Ginsberg and Kerouac, but black Beat writing invites its own chapter in the names of Amiri Baraka, Ted Joans and Bob Kaufman . The 1960s has long become a mythic change-decade, and in few greater respects than as a black theatre both of the stage and poli - tics . In Leon Forrest African America had a figure of the postmodern turn: his work is explored in its own right and for how it takes its place in the context of other reflexive black fiction . \"African American Fic - tions of Passing\" unpacks the whole deceptive trope of \"race\" in writ - ing from Williams Wells Brown through to Charles Johnson .

For many of these groups, the only way to fight back was through writing, which they used to voice resistance and contest traditional power structures .

Using a multidisciplinary perspective to explore a range of material artefacts, from postcards and diary entries to pam - phlets and book inscriptions, it aims to unearth voices that have been silent throughout history, transmitting new narratives on such impor - tant issues as suffragism, Irish nationalism, the working-class move - ment and pauper insanity .

In Eastern mythology, which he read and loved, Byron approached his own utopia and dystopia without distancing himself from current world affairs . He heard the voice of mythology in various forms: in Nature and its animate and inanimate elements, in nightingales, eagles, roses, trees, bushes, mountains, plains, oceans, stones, and rocks, and in ancient relics, among others . Nature and the ruins of the past spoke to him more truth about God, Man, and Nature than religion and his - tory books . His immediate impressions while being on-the-spot, his mobility, his standing on the borderlines of fact and fiction, and his ex - tensive references to Eastern mythology in his works, created a Byronic myth and enhanced the mythical quality of his works, especially Don Juan , Childe Harold's Pilgrimage , Cantos I and II, and Tales\u2014 The , The Bride of Abydos , The Corsair , and The Siege of Corinth . Lord Byron became an archetype of a legendary celebrity, and his works and some of his characters, especially his Byronic Heroes and Heroines, became universal mythical characters . Among several questions, the book answers two major ones: First, how does Byron use Eastern my - thology, including Greek, Persian, and Arabian in the above-mentioned works to render his own poetry mythological? And second, how do his personal affairs and mythological works contribute to the generation of the still living Byronic myth? consumerism, the cult of beauty and celebrity, and how they affect American women's lives and power relations with men .

Long af - ter his death in 1764, William Hogarth is still our contemporary . Far from leading a secluded existence in muse - ums and academies, his legacy of vi - brant images and provocative ideas remains a powerful source of inven - tiveness and inspiration for the art - ists of today, as once for those of yes - terday, be it on page, stage, canvas or digital formats . After approaching the artist by way of his challenging aes - thetic philosophy and his resistance to normative categories, this two-book set considers Hogarth's pioneering sense of performativity, which has long made him the treasured interlocutor of actors and playwrights, from David Garrick to Bertolt Brecht or Nick Dear . His work has perme - ated film, television, the graphic novel, art and narrative, which all bear witness to his versatile and powerful use of images and its resonance in the modern and contemporary age . Brimming as it is with energy, plenty, affliction, entropy and empathy, Hogarth's contradictory uni - verse of chaos and beauty is in tune with ours and resonates vividly with contemporary passions and struggles . The twenty-eight essays in this collection chart the teeming legacies of William Hogarth and ex - plore the ways in which his works and ideas were and are revisited and appropriated in the UK and across Europe . For the eighteenth-century artist lives on as an unforgotten presence, whose invigorating and chal - lenging memory energizes multiple expressive forms, including drama, visual arts, literature, film, graphic novels and TV serials . 42 Literature: History & Criticism Psycholinguistics Christiane Bongartz Jacopo Torregrossa (eds.)

Elements of the gro - tesque appear in political dramas of all three playwrights . While Beckett does not shy away from absurdity in his plays, some of the early dramas of Pinter and Stoppard present a general existential condition of man, even though their strictly political plays are basically realistic in respect to form, yet satirical in their content . Most of the political plays discussed portray the absurdity of totalitarian coun - tries, stemming from the tragicomic discrepancy between what the au - thorities are saying they are doing and their actual actions . 43 Psycholinguistics Theatre Studies Susan Bradley Smith A Splendid Adventure Australian Suffrage Theatre on the World Stage Oxford, 2020 .

Chosen because of their expatriate involve - ment in the women's movement, their international profile as enfran - chised Australian women, and their exceptional contribution to both the development of Australian drama and international feminist the - atre, these women embody the energies and passions of Australian suf - frage playwrights .

Nichols Medieval Interventions publishes innovative studies on medieval culture broadly con - ceived . By \u00abinnovative\u00bb, we envisage works espousing, for example, new research proto - cols especially those involving digitized resources, revisionist approaches to codicology and paleography, reflections on medieval ideologies, fresh pedagogical practices, digital humanities, advances in gender studies, as well as fresh thinking on animal, environmen - tal, geospatial, and nature studies . In short, the series will seek to set rather than follow agendas in the study of medieval culture . Since medieval intellectual and artistic prac - tices were naturally interdisciplinary, the series welcomes studies from across the human - ities and social sciences . Recognizing also the vigor that marks the field worldwide, the series endeavors to publish work in translation from non-Anglophone medievalists .

G\u00f3mez-Lara and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mora This series attempts to illustrate the richness and diversity of Restoration drama, a thriv - ing theatrical production which has been long overshadowed by the brilliance of the Age of Shakespeare . The aim of the collection is to bring to light dramatic texts that have not attracted much critical attention but display the most popular generic formulas of the time and introduce a wide array of suggestive topics . The series consists of modern spell - ing, fully annotated editions, complete with textual commentary, glosses, as well as his - torical, cultural and literary references . Each of the volumes includes a critical introduc - tion which places the text in context, discussing aspects such as authorship, the play's re - sponse to the historical circumstances of the time, its use of theatrical conventions and stage history .

It aims to explore the key concepts regarding Romantic texts and aesthet - ics, such as the relationship between the writer and the natural world; context and his - tory; sensibility and the sublime; gender roles; language and the power of the imagina - tion; studies of genre; slavery and abolition; migration literature, consumer literature; social transformation; critical reception; and transnational relations . The series welcomes studies on major as well as less well-known authors and literary genres, and on historical and cultural contexts of the period . Within this framework, vol - umes included in this series will not only expand the canon beyond traditional authors and genres, but also provide opportunities for exploring texts and contexts from new per - spectives, including those of gender, cultural and translation studies . The series includes monographs, collection of essays, conference proceedings, critical editions and translations, and aims to address an international community .

In Cynara's Shadow Collected Essays on Ernest DowsonWriting and Culture in the Long Nineteenth Century Edited by J. B. Bullen and Charlotte Ribeyrol The long nineteenth century, extending from the Napoleonic Wars to the First World War, was a time of enormous change and experimentation . This series aims to publish the work of scholars and critics alert to these changes in a variety of spheres, including literature, art, the sciences, philosophy, and economics . The editors have a special interest in work that addresses questions of aesthetics, poetics, and form at the intersection between the written word, the visual and decorative arts, architecture, and music . Many scholars are now working on the cultural matrix out of which these forms emerge and recent critical thinking has shown how important was the prevailing economic, political, scientific, and philosophical climate in creating the appropriate conditions for artistic production . Some volumes in the series focus on specific writers and texts, while others consider the con - nection between writing, art, philosophy, and science and the broader cultural horizon . All contribute significantly to the widening sphere of nineteenth-century literary studies .
