The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) paid for expensive studies into acupuncture, distant prayer, massage and aromatherapy. In one study, $374,000 was spent on looking at the effects on wounds of inhaling lemon and lavender scents. Sharp criticism: $12.4bn of taxpayers' cash has been spent by the NCCAM on research into alternative therapies, including acupuncture (file picture) In another project, $666,000 was squandered on research into whether prayers help people suffering from AIDS. Other research included the effect of coffee on people with pancreatic cancer and if massage made cancer sufferers feel better. The spending was uncovered among hundreds of government papers that the Chicago Tribune claims to have examined. They include NCCAM grants, scientific papers and advisory council meeting minutes. The vast sums have attracted criticism from academics at a string of leading universities. Dr. Wallace Sampson, clinical professor emeritus of medicine at Stanford University said some of the treatments were 'made up out of people's imaginations.' 'We don't take public money and invest it in projects that are just made up out of people's imaginations,' she told the Tribune. Dr. David Gorski, a breast cancer researcher at Wayne State University said that many promising scientists are 'going unfunded'. He added: 'How can we justify wasting money on something like this when there are so many other things that are much more plausible and much more likely to result in real benefit?' HOW SOME OF THE CASH WAS SPENT $36.5 million - effect on Alzheimer's and dementia of a dietary supplement $33 million - pain research $1.25 million -Whether massage makes people with advanced cancer feel better $666,000 - Ability of distant prayer to heal aids $406,00 - effect on pancreatic cancer of squirting coffee into intestines $374,000 - effect of inhaling lemon and lavender scents on healing wounds $104,000 - effects of energy healing The NCCAM was established 12 years ago and between 2008-2011 alone it funded more than $140 million in grants involving mind and body therapies, including $33 million for pain research in fiscal 2011. The group's latest strategic plan looks at supplements and other natural products along with the effect of therapies such as yoga, massage and acupuncture on pain and other symptoms. Many of the therapies involve a 'universal energy or life force' which critics say is a metaphysical concept unproved by science. Despite many of the therapies being disproven in the studies, the group is continuing its research into areas such as acupuncture. Supporters of pharmaceutical medicine say that any benefits are down to the same placebo effect of a sugar pill. NCCAM Director Dr. Josephine Briggs defended the research. He said that the centre's $128 million budget amounts to less than half a percent of the total given to the National Institute of Health (NIH). '[The therapies] deserve scientific attention,' she said. Ms Briggs said the centre's new strategic plan reflected 'real change or an evolution in our mission'. However she admitted that studies of energy healing and distant prayer would be unlikely to receive funding. The spending comes as competition increases for public research money, with funding for the NIH expected to plateau in coming years. Critics also point to the role of Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa, in overseeing the NIH budget in his role as a member of the powerful Senate subcommittee. Mr Harkin has publicly expressed his support for complementary medicine after seeing acupuncture and acupressure ease the pain of his brother who suffered thyroid cancer. 'These are things I have seen with my own eyes,' Harkin said in a speech in 1998. 'When I see things like this I ask, ''Why? Why aren't these things being researched?'''
