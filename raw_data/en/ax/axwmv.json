Your adrenals & immunity. Gut Healing & Digestive Well Being Whole Food Nutrition tailored for you I LOVE all things HEALTH, always have. Since a teenager I was interested in fitness and diets and we are talking the 80's with aerobics and leotards. I grew up with Vogel's bread salad sandwiches in my lunchbox and sesame bars my treat food. And, after living life to the full in my 20's, I discovered Naturopathy and the beginnings of Nourish & Breathe. As a mother of 4 children I have a real time appreciation of the challenges of family life in all its entirety. I am able to bring this dimension and understanding to my professional practice. The body is quite simply amazing! With our health NOTHING should be looked at in isolation. Our emotional, neurological, immunological and physical bodies and systems are all interrelated and which is why I love and feel incredibly fortunate to be a practitioner of Naturopathic Medicine. As a naturopath we are given the tools to take a holistic approach to your health and treat at all levels. To you and your families health and happiness I look forward to our own personal health relationship and journey and hope that you will join us in this 14 day cleanse as I know it will make a difference to you and your family. Who is this program for and why join? Women of any age and feeling... washed out? anxious about looking after yourself during lockdown? It has been a crazy couple of years with an incredible amount of stress, which is why I started this program. A supported, short program is realistic to achieve, and together we can get through it and make some lasting positive changes in your life. This cleanse program has been designed by a qualified health professional, and provides education on food, gut health and detoxification. I will personally provide guided support throughout the 2 weeks. Change up the way you shop, cook and eat with simple, easy to follow, whole food recipes which make you feel amazing! TESTIMONIALS - Rachel S, Canberra Renae has been my Naturopath for several years and has made a huge difference for me in my health journey. She is always thorough and extremely knowledgable and now that the Clinic and Apothecary is open in Dairy Road it's even nicer to come and see her in the beautiful new space. I would recommend Renae to any woman wanting a down to earth and experienced naturopath to trust in their wellness and health journey. - I can sleep! Sarah, ACT I did a one:one 14 day cleanse with Renae earlier this year and I was nervous but Renae was really supportive and encouraging and took the time to make sure the cleanse suited me personally. I'm so thrilled that I persevered because, amongst other benefits, I can now fall asleep more easily and wake up feeling clearer and alive again! Thanks Renae - A valuable process. Annie P I enjoyed the cleanse I did with Nourish and Breathe last year. It was surprisingly fun, I wasn't hungry and the recipes were perfect to adapt for my whole family. I don't stick as closely to the meal plans now but 14 days was enough for me to understand my body better and what foods affect my health. I have my energy back now and when I stray too much from the principals I know exactly how to get back on track. A really valuable process. - How the N&B Cleanse Works Sign up and book in for your pre-program 15 min consult to determine your unique health picture and requirements.

Environmental toxins are found in everyone and everywhere on the planet; in our soils, food, air, water and homes. More than 140000 toxic chemicals are used commercially, with more than 3000 in high volume with 1500 new chemicals released each year. They are absorbed into our body and our detoxification systems; the liver, kidneys and skin which work 24/7 to eliminate these toxins to keep us safe, well and functioning. When our detoxification and elimination systems become overburdened with the toxic load our health is affected to the extent that our endocrine (hormone) system is disrupted with far reaching systemic affects and we start to notice symptoms like lethargy, anxiety, digestive issues, hormonal issues etc. These toxins have been clinically demonstrated to be responsible for many conditions including chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune conditions and neurological problems. A professional cleanse program supports our own detoxification systems. Essential nutrients are provided to maximise our natural detoxification pathways. There are different levels of cleanse programs that depend on your unique health picture. At the end of your cleanse program you will be guaranteed to feel a lot brighter and lighter in energy and life. Often, cleanse programs are the key initial step that allows true healing to begin. Join me and take that first step to taking care of yourself. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - Will I be hungry? We kickstart healing with a 2 day cleanse which might be an adjustment if you eat a lot of processed food. The focus is on easily digested foods and removing foods that are common allergens - gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, and corn. This allows both the gut and immune system to calm down, symptoms to subside, healing to begin, and support organ function. There is no restriction on quantities, however it is important to slow down. Don't rush anywhere, don't hurry your meals, be present with everything you do. - I always sign up for these things but can never stick with it... That's why I have made this a short and supported program. Sometimes it is difficult to make changes when we are already feeling unmotivated or tired. However, I will support you through the program, we have a meeting prior to start of program to discuss what is going on for you and one in the second week to check in. I will also email you every day with new tips and tricks to stay on track. If there is interest I can also start a private Facebook Group for those who join to provide support and encouragement for each other in realtime too! Maybe ask a good friend to join and support you, they will also get so much out of it. - I find it impossible to cook for me and a seperate meal for the family. As a mother of 4 teenagers, I understand! I have designed the recipes so that there are family friendly, scalable options and vegetarian/flexitarian options for lunches and dinners. So you will only need to cook one meal! The menu plan is also flexible so you can change it up depending on who you are cooking for. All the recipes are simple and some can be prepared in advance with the ingredients you have on hand. There aren't any ingredients you need a llama and a day pack to find. - Is this a Quick fix? This program is not a quick fix. It is a solid start to longer term change. Once you start to feel better you will feel more motivated to continue and we can continue to support you if you would like. There are different levels of cleanse programs that depend on your unique health picture. At the end of your cleanse program you will be guaranteed to feel a lot brighter and lighter in energy and life. Often, cleanse programs are the key initial step that allows true healing to begin. - Why is this program different to the other programs out there? A supported, short program is realistic to achieve than many of the subscription style programs available, and together we can get through it and make some lasting positive changes in your life. This cleanse program has been designed by a qualified health professional, and provides education on food, gut health and detoxification - it is a wholistic program which will attend to your overall health while many popular programs are only focussed on weight loss. This will only be a small group and you will benefit from my unique women's health experience specialising in Woman's Reproductive and Hormonal Health for: Healthy Menstrual Cycles Natural Contraception & Conscious Conception & Beyond Menopause Metabolic Health - blood sugar, cardiovascular health, weight & liver Stress, Depletion & Fatigue. Your adrenals & immunity. Gut Healing & Digestive Well Being Whole Food Nutrition tailored for you - How Does a cleanse work? We are exposed to an alarming array of environmental toxins in the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. A cleanse eases the load and exposure to all the chemicals and toxins with the good food during the program as well as the function of our organs of elimination (liver, kidney and skin) being supported by taking nutritional and herbal supplements throughout the program. Food intolerances are a major cause for digestive symptoms and this cleanse removes main food triggers, and the cleanse is the start of an elimination diet. If you are feeling digestive relief at the end of the program, you can continue with naturopathic support through an elimination diet and this can be discussed at your check in appointment. Detoxification is a natural metabolic process whereby the environmental and dietary toxins we are exposed to are changed into less harmful substances, and subsequently excreted from the body. Supporting detoxification is a cornerstone of natural medicine practice. The Nourish Detoxification program aims to address dietary and lifestyle factors to reduce the burden placed on your detoxification system, whilst simultaneously supporting the capacity of your key detox organs.
