Truant, RN, MSN,1Antony J. Porcino, Carla T. Hilario, RN, MSN1 Complementary Medicine Education and Outcomes (CAMEO) Research Program,1University of British Columbia School of Nursing, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;2British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada This systematic review synthesizes knowledge about the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among advanced cancer patients. EBSCO and Ovid databases were searched using core concepts, including advanced cancer, CAM, integrativemedicine, and decision-making. Articles included in the nal review were analyzed using narrative synthesis methods, includingthematic analysis, concept mapping, and critical reflection on the synthesis process. Results demonstrate that advanced cancerpatients who are younger, female, more educated, have longer duration of disease, and have previously used CAM are morelikely to use CAM during this stage of illness. Key themes identied include patterns of and reasons for use; and barriers andfacilitators to informed CAM decision-making. Knowledge regarding the use of CAM in advanced cancer remains in its nascentstages. Findings suggest a need for more research on understanding the dynamic process of CAM decision-making in theadvanced cancer population from the patients' perspective. Up to 93.1% of people report using some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) during their cancer experience.1-33Although the use of CAM in the general cancer population has been well docu-mented over the past two decades, 8,13,21,34-51a comprehensive review regarding the use ofCAM in the advanced cancer population has not been published. The diagnosis of advanced can-cer represents a shift in the focus of treatmentand care from cure to palliation. 52Advanced- cancer patients have reported increased levels of distress and symptom burden with poorer qual-ity of life compared to those with curative orearly stage disease. 53,54A growing body of re- search has identied increased prevalence ofCAM use in the advanced-cancer population toaddress these issues and achieve other personalaims. 11,12,15,18,21,23,24,27,28,32-34,45,46,55-58Despite advanced stage disease being identied as one ofthe most common factors predicting CAMuse, 11,13,15,21,28,45,49,56-58few studies have exam- ined the unique needs and specic behaviors re-lated to CAM use in this population. Given thecomplexity in caring for people with advanced cancerand a goal to provide evidence-informed CAM de-cision support, understanding the unique CAM-related needs of this population will be valuable tooncology health care providers (HCPs). In this re-view, we seek to describe the factors, reasons, anddecision-making process used by advanced-cancerpatients to use CAM. CAM is dened as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered part of conven-tional medicine. 59CAM therapies are grouped into 5 categories: body based (eg, chiropractic,Manuscript received October 23, 2012; accepted April 8, 2013.

Methods The basic relevant denitions, search terms and strategy, the screening process including inclusion and exclusion criteria,and analysis approach were established a priori, based on the research question, and iteratively rened by consensus toaddress issues that arose as the articles were reviewed. Ad- vanced cancer was dened as beginning at the point in the cancer trajectory when treatment and care shifts from cura-tive to palliative intent and extends for the remainder of one'slife. 52CAM was dened as above.59 EBM Reviews, and were searchedfor relevant English language research articles with adultpopulations published from January 1990 to February2013. Search terms were based on review of the MedicalSubject Headings (MeSH). 61Two broad categories of search terms and combined: /c143advanced cancer: neoplasm, cancer, metastatic, incurable,palliative care, terminal care, and advanced; /c143CAM: complementary medicine, complementary ther-apy, alternative therapy, and integrative medicine. Retrieved citations were tabulated in database les docu-menting the selection process, including the specic rea-sons for article exclusions. Selection of the literature Only original empirical and qualitative research studies, second- ary analysis of empirical data, and systematic reviews of CAMuse by advanced cancer patients were included. Studies exam-ining outcomes of specic CAM treatments (eg, clinical trials,case studies, treatment center programs) were excluded. Greyliterature also was excluded, as it has not been shown to yieldsignicant literature for systematic reviews in the palliativepopulation. 62Studies combining individuals with noncurative and cu- rative disease as well as advanced or locally advanced cancerswere excluded if the results did not distinguish between the2 groups. Studies addressing locally advanced cancers wereincluded if all of those study participants were identied ashomogeneously noncurable. 63Studies conducted in coun- tries where CAM is potentially an integral part of health carewere excluded because making comparisons of CAM useacross these and Western-medicine countries may be ineq-uitable and difcult to interpret. Therefore, only articlesfrom North America, Europe (including Turkey and Is-rael) 64and Australia were included. Two authors independently reviewed all abstracts for possible inclusion. Potentially relevant articles were re-trieved and reviewed through full-text screening to deter-mine relevance and concurrence with the inclusion criteriaand denitions. Additional relevant articles were identi-ed from the citations within the selected studies. Appraisal and data extraction Methodological quality appraisal of the included studies used the scoring system for mixed studies reviews developedby Pluye et al. 60For appraisal of systematic reviews, the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-views and Meta-Analyses) 2009 27-point checklist was usedto assess review thoroughness. 65All authors appraised each article; all scores were then reviewed by one author anddiscussed with the group to achieve consensus. While noarticles were excluded based on the quality score, the qualityissues were considered when reviewing the results. Methods of synthesis The narrative synthesis described in this approach includes preliminary analysis; exploration of relationships; assessmentof the robustness of the synthesis; and, where appropriate,theory development. 66Due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, theory development was not undertaken. Synthesisbegan with a review of the data in a table of descriptivecharacteristics and key ndings available online (Table S1;http://tinyurl.com/monlanl ). Two authors conducted the the- matic analysis using general qualitative processes; the derivedmain themes were discussed and validated with the group. Results Identication and selection of the literatureThe identication and selection process of the bibliographic search are summarized in the Figure, using a PRISMA flow diagram. 65Screening of the 393 unique identied articles left 47 articles included in this review. Extracted descriptivecharacteristics of those 47 studies (including the sample;methodology; method of data collection and analysis; andquality appraisal scores) and the key ndings are availableonline (Table S1; http://tinyurl.com/monlanl).Review 106 THE JOURNAL OF SUPPORTIVE ONCOLOGY /H18546September 2013 www.SupportiveOncology.netThematic analysis Three main themes were extracted from the selected literature, including patterns of CAM use; reasons forCAM use; and barriers and facilitators of informedCAM decision-making in the advanced cancer popu-lation (Table). Patterns of CAM use. Within patterns of CAM use, 3 subthemes were extracted from the data: prevalence;sociodemographic and disease factors; and psycholog-ical factors. Prevalence. Researchers documented a wide range of CAM use prevalence in the advanced cancer population,from 15% 17to 100%.2Use of biologic CAM therapies, particularly vitamins and herbal remedies, were the mostfrequently reported. 4-6,9,10,14,18-20,27,28,30-32,45,46,67Often nonbiologic therapies like spiritual practices, exercise, anddiet changes were excluded from measures of CAM prev-alence, making comparisons across studies difcult. In-gested biologic CAM therapies were frequently used con-currently with conventional cancer treatment, even duringphase I clinical trails. This raised concerns about potentialinteractions and the impact on clinical trial research out- comes. 6,10,18,32The use of multiple concurrent CAM therapies was common.3,4,9,14,18,26,27,32 Socio-demographic and disease factors. Advanced stage and longer duration of disease,3,15,27,28,32,45,68female gender,3,16,18,43younger age,3,9,10,19,27,45,56,68higher education,3,9,26,45,56,68and previous CAM use23,29,45 showed positive associations with current CAM use inmany studies, although these ndings were inconsis-tent. For example, 2 studies reported that participantswith early stage cancer compared to advanced stagewere equally 69or more43inclined to use CAM. No signicant association between types of CAM use and gender was identied.6,19As disease progressed, CAM users with higher education chose more biologicand \"radical CAM therapies\" (eg, coffee enemas, magnettherapy, high dose vitamin C). 11,45Some geographical trends in CAM use were noted, related to accessibility (eg, high use of naturopathy by people living near anaturopathic college 15,16) and possible cultural traditions (eg, high use of stinging nettle across Turkey2,12,28,56,70).Records after duplicates removed n = 393 Records screened n = 393 Full-text articles assessed for eligibility n = 117 Studies included in qualitative synthesis (review) n = 47Records excluded n = 276 Excluded: articles not available. n = 3Excluded: specific CAM treatment evaluations n = 22Excluded: non-western clinical setting. n = 2 Excluded: not empirical research (editorials, non-systematic literature reviews). n = 17Excluded: does not address advanced cancer patients, or CAM. n = 26Records identified through other resources n = 44Records identified through database searching n = 462 FIGURE PRISMA flowchart.Truant and Porcino et al Volume 11/Number 3 September 2013 /H18546THE JOURNAL OF SUPPORTIVE ONCOLOGY 107Cost and ease of use were identied as important factors associated with CAM use. Two studies indi- cated that cost was an important factor in the decisionto use a particular CAM therapy. 7,19The cost of CAMwas judged relative to the outcomes achieved.7How- ever, when CAM costs were high, people used CAM less frequently.7,19 Therapies that required little effort, with minimal side effects, available locally and covered by health insurance,(eg, in Washington state: chiropractic, naturopathy,massage therapy, and acupuncture) were used fre-quently. 15,16,18,45Two studies showed that as disease pro- gressed and physical function declined, decreased use ofCAM was reported, possibly due to the required effortnecessary to use or access the CAM. 16,23 Psychological factors. Psychological factors associated with CAM use in the advanced cancer population in-cluded higher anxiety and depression, 1,4,10,26decreased subjective well-being,4decreased emotional and social well-being and quality of life,10,11and being more aware of their prognosis or impending death.10 Reasons for CAM use. The reasons for using CAM identied by patients with advanced cancer were notconsistently reported or explored. 2,13,21,22,28,34,56When reported, reasons varied, having been influenced bybeliefs about the causes of and/or curability of one'scancer, 20,30,38,67,71perceived effectiveness of and satis- faction with conventional cancer treatment,4,27,38per- ceived value and goals for CAM use,4,5,30and unmet physical and/or psychological needs.4,5,7,20,26,32,33,69 Improving chances for a cure. Numerous studies iden- tied improving chance for a cure, either directly or indi- rectly, as a reason for using CAM. In 9 studies, patientsbelieved that CAM use might increase chance of survivalbydirectly ghting the disease or shrinking the tu- mor. 5,7,18,19,26,29,31,45,69Indirect means included facilitat- ing/synergizing conventional treatment outcomes,45and boosting immunity and/or detoxifying one's body that has been depleted from the cancer and/or conventionaltreatments. 5,18,31-33Two studies offered insight into how CAM use for the purpose of cure shifted across the cancertrajectory from early to advanced stages. 14,45However, they did not explore the underlying beliefs or other factorsunderpinning these dynamic decisions to use CAM spe-cically for a cure. Benets other than cure. A wide range of noncurative benets were identied specic to advanced cancerpatients, including well-being and feelhealthier, 7,33,45,72promote relaxation and reduce stress,18,26,29,33 boost energy and improve quality of life,4,5,7,18,19,26,33,69 and symptom and treatment side-effect manage-ment. 4,5,7,18,19,26,29,31,33,69Some patients reported using CAM to address unmet emotional, psychological andspiritual needs; 1,4,5,7,21,29,30,33,45,73to believe they had done everything possible to ght their cancer;5,18,46and to improve a sense of control over their illness.32,67,71TABLE Main themes of CAM use in advanced cancer Themes of CAM Use Patterns of CAM use a.Prevalence: CAM use and numbers of CAM therapies used, particularly biological products (eg, natural health products, herbs), increases in the advanced cancerpopulation. b.Sociodemographic and disease factors i. Previous CAM use, longer duration of disease, younger age, female gender, and higher educationare positively associated with CAM use. ii. As disease progresses, non-evidence based CAM use increases. iii. Accessibility (insured services; available locally; ease of use) influences CAM use. c.Psychological factors i. Symptom distress, anxiety and depression, decreased emotional or social well being, decreased quality oflife, desire for control and better awareness ofprognosis are positively associated with CAM use. Reasons for CAM use a. Cure (ie, ght disease/shrink tumor, enhance immune response, synergize conventional treatment, or detoxifybody) b. Non-curative benets (ie, improve and quality of life; increase control; reduce stress; boostenergy; address unmet emotional, psychological orspiritual needs) c. Beliefs about causes of cancer, curability of cancer, and spiritual faith are related to advanced cancer patient'sreasons for CAM use. i. Those holding positive illusory beliefs about the curability of their cancer may use CAM as a positivecoping mechanism for life-limiting illness ii. Those who believe their cancer is incurable may use CAM as a pragmatic problem-solving approach. iii. Spiritual faith may be associated with either a positive coping style, or an indicator of distress. d. Satisfaction with conventional treatment, care, or relationship with health care providers may be inverselyassociated with CAM use. Barriers and facilitators to informed CAM decision-making a. Sources of CAM information include family and friends, social networks, media (including internet), health foodstore staff and CAM practitioners. b. Conventional health care providers were consulted infrequently for information and decision support;ingested CAM therapies most commonly discussed. c.

A number of studies explored how beliefs about the causes of and/or curability of cancer influenced decisions to use CAM.Yates et al 30found that beliefs about alternative causes of cancer were positively correlated with CAM use and wereat variance from those held by conventional practitioners.Four studies 4,27,67,71investigated the relationship be- tween belief in the curability of one's disease to CAM use,providing insight into 2 different groups of CAM users.The rst group held beliefs that their cancer was curable(despite conventional medical opinion to the contrary)and continued to be committed users of CAM to copewith life-limiting illness. 67,71The second group of pa- tients believed their cancer was incurable (congruent withconventional medical opinion) yet continued to use CAMfor the purpose of cure. 4For these patients, using CAM was more about a pragmatic approach to active problemsolving, coping, and \"trying something else\" in the face ofadversity. 46,74 Role of spirituality. Spiritual well-being (existential well-being and faith) was identied in one study as sig-nicantly associated with CAM use for the purpose ofcure. 29In this study, the majority of CAM users sought a cure from their CAM use; reported increased spiritualfaith; decreased existential well-being; 29and may have had higher unmet spiritual needs. For this reason, CAMuse was a potential marker for increased distress. 29Con- versely, another study27found that CAM users showed a more active coping style through religion and seekingpersonal meaning in the illness; in addition, the userswere not more distressed than those uninterested inCAM. It is unclear, however, whether or not the CAMusers were seeking a cure or to address noncurative aims. Satisfaction with conventional medicine. People who reported lower levels of satisfaction with conventionalmedicine were more likely to use CAM 5,19,27,75or to decline conventional treatment.4Without adequate sup- port or advice from HCPs\u2014or effective conventionaltreatment\u2014advanced cancer patients may use CAM inresponse to the inability of conventional medicine to treatthe disease and/or offer satisfactory supportive care. 5,27 Barriers and facilitators to informed CAM decision-making. Although well described in studies with early stage and mixed (early/advanced) cancerpopulations, 35,55,76-78none of the studies in this review ex- plored or described the dynamic CAM decision-makingprocess of advanced cancer patients. However, 2 key sub- themes related to CAM decision-making in the advanced cancer population were identied, including sources ofCAM information and communicating with conventionalHCPs.Source of CAM information. Across studies, patients reported using multiple sources of information to learn about CAM. Friends and family, particularly those withcancer experience, were the most frequent sourcecited. 7,18,21,26,28,31-33,56In order of decreasing frequency, other sources of CAM information included social groups(eg, church, support groups), 18media (eg, internet, tele- vision, and self-help literature),18,19,26,28,56health food CAM practitioners.18,19Conventional HCPs were consulted infrequently (0-16% across studies)for CAM information. 10,18,19,26,31The reasons why ad- vanced cancer patients used their social and lay networksmore frequently than HCPs as sources of CAM informa-tion were not explored in these studies. Communication with conventional health care providers. Previous research with early stage and mixed (early/ad- vanced) cancer populations has shown that informedCAM decision-making requires open and respectful com-munication; and shared decision-making between pa-tients and HCPs. 77,79-87In this review, while some HCPs did communicate with patients about CAM, most studiesreported communication gaps. Patients using ingestedtherapies and patients with prostate cancer discussed theirCAM use with physicians; however, noningested thera-pies were not discussed. 18,26,45,56Many studies reported that the HCPs never asked about the use of CAM.When discussion did take place, it is unclear as towhether the patient or HCP opened the dialogue orwhether a shared decision-making process was usedthat was inclusive of patients' beliefs, values, and goalsfor CAM use. 18,26,32,33,45,56,88Poor communication encounters with HCPs in one study influenced ad-vanced cancer patients' decisions to use CAM. 20Only 2 studies reported conventional HCPs making recom-mendations to advanced cancer patients about the useof CAM. 32,45 Patients in phase I clinical trials represented a unique subgroup within this review.6,10,18Up to 23% of these patients did not fully disclose their CAM use to physi-cians, 18commonly reporting that the topic of CAM was never introduced despite a preference for shared decision-making about CAM. 10,18No additional studies could be located that specically explored advanced cancer patients'unmet needs or perspectives on CAM decision-making. Limitations The comparability of study results within this review is limited by the varying denitions of CAM and differ-ences across health care systems (eg, socialized vs privatemedicine) where studies were conducted. Study sampleswere heavily weighted with women with breast cancersince they are among the highest users of CAM. 8,41,48Truant and Porcino et al Volume 11/Number 3 September 2013 /H18546THE JOURNAL OF SUPPORTIVE ONCOLOGY 109Recruitment across studies was largely from conventional care settings, potentially biasing the sample to under re-port CAM use and by not including perspectives of thosenot actively participating in conventional care. Compari-sons across and between countries or health care systemsalso was not possible due to the limited number andheterogeneity of studies specically focusing on advancedcancer and CAM. Many excellent studies were excluded from this review because of the inability to clearly differentiate ndingsspecically about advanced cancer. Further, few qualita-tive studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, suchas those highlighting the patients' perspectives, limitingunderstanding of the CAM decision-making process ofadvanced cancer patients. Finally, although the challenges in conducting a narrative synthesis integrating qualitativeand quantitative data necessarily limits the depth of re-sults presented, it does offer opportunities to suggestclinical implications and new paths for research. Discussion This review supports evidence of increased CAM use in the advanced stages of cancer; 11,12,15,18,21,23,24,27,28,32-34,38,45,46,56-58 providing insight into the associated socio-demographic,physical, and psychosocial factors; reasons for use; and per-sonal beliefs that may affect CAM decision-making. How-ever, literature identifying CAM decision-support needs andthe dynamic process of CAM decision-making from theperspective of people living with advanced cancer is in itsnascent stages. Previous research with early stage and/ormixed (early/advanced) cancer populations 35,38,76-78suggest that CAM decision-making can be an anxiety-laden expe-rience for patients that shifts as the individual and socialcontext changes. 77In the advanced cancer population\u2014 where anxiety and distress may be high, physical declineprominent, and one's social network potentially shifting 53,54\u2014 it can be postulated that the process of CAM decision-making by advanced cancer patients may have uniqueaspects to be considered when designing CAM decision-support interventions. The differing perspectives between HCPs and some advanced cancer patients regarding the curability of can-cer within this review highlighted the phenomenon ofmaintaining uncertainty and promoting hope in the faceof life-limiting illness. Beadle et al's (2004) 71concept of illusions in advanced cancer, where patients facing life- limiting illness positively appraised their situation despitebiomedical opinion to the contrary, can be considered anadaptive process and a feature of normal psychologicalbehavior. 89 For many advanced cancer patients, being realistic while maintaining hope in the face of life-limiting illnesscan be irreconcilable if they cannot maintain some ambi- guity about the future.54,90CAM use can psycho-spiritual well-being, and quality oflife. 54,91It can be viewed as a positive coping strategy in the advanced cancer population, a nding also validatedin other disease stages. 27,42,74,92 Advanced cancer is frequently accompanied by distress and unmet physical, psychological, social, spiritual, andcommunication needs that often cannot be adequatelyaddressed within the conventional health care system. 53 CAM use for symptom management or to improve phys-ical and/or spiritual well-being and quality of life mayreflect a pragmatic approach to managing distress or un-met needs. Whether CAM use signals distress, empow-erment, or a strategy to maintain hope merits further investigation in the advanced cancer population to ensurethe phenomenon is understood and appropriately sup-ported by HCPs. 93 Preferences for lay information sources to inform CAM decisions may be another strategy to manage the tensionbetween the reality of one's situation and maintaining hope.Information from conventional HCPs that does not balanceavailable evidence with patients' beliefs, goals, and prefer-ences for CAM use may dash hope and be counterproduc-tive to making evidence-informed decisions. 82Future explo- ration of preferences for lay information sources\u2014and itsrelationship to helpful and unhelpful communication byHCPs about CAM\u2014may offer an alternative perspective toinform how best to support CAM decision-making in ad-vanced cancer patients. 79-87 The nondisclosure of CAM use by patients in phase I trials encapsulates many of these issues, signaling possiblelack of trust in their HCP, a strategy to maintain hope in theface of adversity, potential distress, fear of abandonment bytheir HCP, or other unknown reasons. Nondisclosure mustbe explored further from the patient's perspective to under-stand the support needed to address the individual's uniqueCAM information and decision-support needs and goalswhile maintaining the integrity of the trials results. Directions for future research Several gaps exist in the content and methodology asso- ciated with current knowledge about CAM use in theadvanced cancer population. A common denition ofCAM must be agreed upon and used consistently acrossstudies for comparisons to be made. Studies that specif-ically target the advanced cancer population, includingqualitative methodologies that are inclusive of the pa- tient and family perspectives, will add depth and rich-ness to the current knowledge. Mixed-methods studieswill be important to conduct in order to examine therelationship and directionality of concepts related toReview 110 THE JOURNAL OF SUPPORTIVE ONCOLOGY /H18546September 2013 www.SupportiveOncology.netadvanced cancer and CAM, such as quality of life, con- trol, knowledge of poor prognosis, spiritual faith, distress,empowerment, and coping. Finally, longitudinal studiesthat capture the dynamic nature of CAM decision-making and the interplay of factors (eg, beliefs, unmetneeds, communication style and preferences, role ofHCPs) that influence CAM use across the trajectorybetween curative and noncurative disease will add signif-icant understanding to this area. Clinical implications Advanced cancer patients commonly use CAM. Yet most do not discuss their CAM use with their conventionalHCPs, raising concerns about safety and potential missedbenets of evidence-based CAM. It is essential for HCPsto discuss CAM use with all patients, assessing individ-uals' beliefs and values and goals for CAM use, includingconventional treatment and care. 77,79-87,94Understanding patterns of CAM use in the advanced cancer populationand specically identifying those who are more likely touse CAM (ie, female, younger age, with higher education,psychological or physical symptoms, dissatisfaction withconventional care, longer disease duration, and previousCAM use) is important to understand and assess. Phase Iclinical trials patients merit special consideration and sup-port to discuss their CAM use and to consider usingnonbiological CAM therapies that will achieve theirCAM-related goals. Assessments should also include psy-chosocial factors that may coincide with CAM use (eg,distress, need for control, spirituality) as well as CAM useas a positive coping strategy to manage the tension be-tween a realistic appraisal of one's situation and the pres-ervation of hope. The popularity of herbal/biological-therapy use by the advanced cancer population identied in this review re-inforces the need for HCPs to initiate open and unbiasedcommunication specically about these ingested products.Although new evidence emerges daily, safety and efcacydata on many herbal/biological products remains limitedand manufacturing processes in many countries are vari-ably regulated. 95,96HCPs must actively communicate with patients about the use of herbal/biological products and other CAM therapies in a way that promotes safetywhile continuing to preserve hope and acknowledging thepatients' beliefs, values, and goals. 82,85,86 Conclusion Patients living with advanced cancer in Western countries frequently use CAM, particularly biologic therapies, afterlearning about accessible CAM therapies through theirsupport networks and media. Greater CAM use is asso-ciated with longer duration of disease, female gender,higher education, spiritual belief, younger age, psychoso- cial or physical symptoms, and dissatisfaction with con-ventional cancer care. Patients frequently do not disclosetheir CAM use to HCPs even in the context of phase Iclinical trials, raising concerns about patient safety andclinical trial outcomes. HCPs have an opportunity toexplore with patients whether use of CAM signals distressor a sign of hope and empowerment. HCPs may alsofacilitate shared decision-making that is compatible withthe patient's values and goals regardless of stage of illness.
