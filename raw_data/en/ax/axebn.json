Types of laxatives There are 4 main types of laxatives. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure which one to use. Bulk-forming laxatives Bulk-forming laxatives increase the \"bulk\" or weight of poo which stimulates your bowel. They take 2 or 3 days to work. Bulk-forming laxatives include: - Fybogel (also known as ispaghula husk) - methylcellulose Osmotic laxatives Osmotic laxatives draw water from the body into your bowel to soften poo and make it easier to pass. They take 2 or 3 days to work. They include: - lactulose (also known as Duphalac or Laxose) - macrogol Stimulant laxatives These stimulate the muscles that line your gut helping to move poo along to your bottom. They take 6 to 12 hours to work. They include: - bisacodyl (also called by the brand name Dulcolax) - senna (also called by the brand name Senokot) - sodium picosulfate Poo-softener laxatives This type of laxative works by letting water into poo to soften it and make it easier to pass. They include: - arachis oil - docusate sodium Check if you can take laxatives Laxatives are not suitable for everyone. Emergency action required: Do not use laxatives if you have: - a perforated bowel - an allergy - phenylketonuria - an obstruction in your digestive system Check with your GP or pharmacist before taking laxatives if you: - have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis - have a colostomy or ileostomy - a history of liver or kidney disease - are pregnant, trying for a baby, or breastfeeding - have diabetes (some laxatives can increase blood sugar) - have difficulty swallowing - are lactose intolerant (some laxatives contain lactose) Before using a laxative read the information leaflet to make sure it's safe for you to take. Children Always check with your GP or pharmacist before giving your baby or child a laxative. Laxatives are not recommended for babies who have not been weaned. If your unweaned baby is constipated, try giving extra water in between feeds. Gently massaging their tummy and moving their legs in a cycling motion may also help. Children who eat solid foods may be able to use laxatives, but first make sure they drink plenty of water or diluted fruit juice, and increase the amount of fibre in their diet. If they're still constipated, your GP or pharmacist may recommend a laxative. How and when to take laxatives How you take a laxative depends on the form it comes in. Ask a pharmacist if you're not sure how to take your laxative. They're commonly available as: - tablets or capsules you swallow - sachets of powder you mix with water and drink - a capsule you place inside your bottom where it dissolves (suppositories) - liquids or gels you place directly into your bottom Some laxatives have to be taken at certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning or last thing at night. If you're taking bulk-forming or osmotic laxatives, drink plenty of fluids. These laxatives can cause dehydration. Some laxatives can be taken long-term while some are only suitable for short-term use. Never take laxatives for longer than the recommended time. Never take more than the recommended dose of laxatives as this can be harmful and cause side effects. If your constipation has not improved after taking laxatives for a week, speak to your GP. Side effects of laxatives Laxatives can cause side effects. They're usually mild and should pass once you stop taking the laxative. Talk to your GP or pharmacist if side effects bother you or don't go away. Get emergency help if you have signs of a serious allergic reaction.
