We spend trillions of dollars on healthcare, yet our country ranks 37th in health outcomes. We are living in an era in which behaviors are the #1 killer of Americans. Overweight and obesity will soon pass tobacco as the leading cause of pre-ventive death in the US, and the World Health Organiza-tion has recently declared physical inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. The Centers for Disease Control predicts that one out of three people in the US will have diabetes by 2050. One of two Americans has a chronic illness and one in four have multiple chronic conditions. Further, one out of four people has a mental health problem, yet less than 25% receive any treatment. Stress, anxiety, and depres-sion are pervasive problems in faculty, staff, students, and the members of our community. Despite these alarming sta-tistics, opportunities abound for our university, college, and nursing profession to posi-tively impact healthcare and the health of our university, community, state, and globe. However, we must have a clear vision of how we will improve these conditions and act now with a sense of urgency\u2014because we are living in an era in which it is predicted that our children will have a shorter lifespan than we do. In this edition of Trans- formations, you will read about how a rapid response to a request for applications this summer led to a $1.5 million Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grant to help launch our very first nurse practitioner-led clinic that will provide comprehen-sive and integrated mental and physical healthcare ser - vices to the people of East Co-lumbus. At this health center, we will deliver high value, low cost care through an inter - professional team comprising pharmacists, physicians, social workers, mental health coun-selors, nurses, and dieticians. Y ou also will read about the rapid acceleration in NIH-grant funding that we have had this year with research that is addressing some of our most pressing and costly morbidities. Finally, you will learn about the extraordinary initiatives of our fantastic interprofessional team to cre-ate the healthiest university on the globe, as well as the outstanding achievements of our college's faculty, staff, students, and alums, of whom I am so proud. My first year as a Buck- eye was filled with exciting challenges and phenomenal opportunities. By traveling with President Gee across the state this summer to promote health and wellness, I learned first-hand about the love that the people across this state have for our university. Further, in my travels across the country and globe, I met hundreds of our alums and learned what it really means to be a Buckeye. I have been at several universities through-out my career, but none of them can touch the Ohio State spirit and passion. As the New Y ear ap-proaches, I encourage you to make a resolution to Make Just 1 Change for your and your family's health. T ogether, we can create the healthiest university, community, and alumni base on the globe. The upcoming holidays are a spe-cial time of the year, especially to share gratitude for our many blessings and inspire hope for a New Y ear with ful-filled dreams. I can honestly say that I am truly blessed to be a Buckeye and to have all of you in my life. Stay tuned for the exciting opportunities and our accomplishments to come in 2013! Fond regards, Bernadette Mazurek Melnyk, PhD, RN, CPNP/PMH-NP, FNAP, FAANAssociate Vice President for Health Promotion University Chief Wellness Officer Dean and Professor, College of Nursing Professor of Nursing & Pediatrics, College of Medicine Bern Melnyk \"I have gone from 250 to 215 pounds by managing my energy through eating, rests, and laser focus.

The new healthcare environment will emphasize wellness and prevention, with an increased need for nurse practitioners and other primary care providers. Fu-eled by a new $1.5-million grant, the College of Nursing is expanding its clinical services and its student base to meet this growing need. With the award of a $1.5 million, three-year grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administra-tion (HRSA), the College of Nursing has launched Ohio State's first-ever nurse practitioner-led intercollaborative practice and a new T otal Health & Wellness center at Ohio State's University Hospital East. T o expand clinical experience for its students while serving community needs, the college also has developed several other clinical partnerships. \"As this is our college's very first health center, the HRSA funding is so terrific for us and for the people who reside in the East community,\" says Bernadette Melnyk, PhD, RN, CPNP/PMH-NP , FNAP , FAAN, dean of the College of Nursing, who also serves as associate vice president for health promotion and chief wellness officer of the university. \"We have a very strong nurse practitioner advanced practice program,\" Melnyk adds. \"I believe that we need to provide op-portunities for students to be engaged with faculty in practice, so that is a key strategic direction that we're taking for the college.\" Ohio State T otal Health and Wellness is expected to open its doors to patients in December. In addition to support from HRSA, it is among several programs at the university funded by a one-year renewable Medicaid T echnical Assistance and Policy Program (MEDTAPP) Healthcare Access Initiative (HCA) offered through the Office of Medical Assistance (Ohio Medicaid). The MEDTAPP HCA funding supports education and retention activities for medical students, resi-dents, fellows, and practitioners committed to serving the underserved using innovative health care delivery models and evidence-based practices. 6 The Ohio State University College of Nursing Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 7fIRsT nuRse PRa CTITIOneR-LeD InTeRPROfessIOnaL PRImaR y CaRe CLInIC Is LaunCheDOhio State Total Health & Wellness at University Hospital East Health center will offer primary care to the underserved, while allowing College of Nursing clinical education and services to expand By kathy Baird Kristie Flamm, Margaret Graham, and Bernadette Melnyk at University Hospital East, site of the new Ohio State Total Health & Wellness8 The Ohio State University College of Nursing Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 9 \"By opening a nurse practitioner-led health center we are role modeling high- quality care for our students,\" explains Margaret Clark Graham, PhD, RN, FNP , PNP , FAAN, associate dean for advanced practice and community engagement and associate professor of nursing. \"We hope this center will be the prototype and that we can grow more opportunities like that in other areas.\" \"The purpose for the health center is to educate students on how to care for the medically underserved,\" explains Graham. The new center will serve the entire community with all health insur - ance coverage, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as payment arrange-ments for the uninsured. The practice will serve several major goals: Establish the first nurse practitioner- led clinic for the College of Nursing Establish an intercollaborative practice for interdisciplinary professional education Increase access to primary care for the neighborhood of University Hospital East Help reduce unnecessary emer - gency room visits, while also providing any needed follow-up care to emergency room patients Offer integrated treatment to ad- dress both medical needs and mental health needs at a single location The health center's integration of primary care and mental health care is an important move. While one in four Americans face some form of mental illness, overall access to mental health services is limited and most of those af-fected do not receive treatment. Under - served patients with limited insurance coverage may face even greater obstacles. Studies have shown that combining medical and mental health services im-proves access while reducing stigma and cost, for positive results. Many patients who do not have a regular primary care provider turn to emergency rooms for routine care. The emergency room at University Hospital East treats a high volume of such patients each year. The new health center should help to alleviate this patient load by serv-ing patients' routine care needs so that emergency room services can focus on more critical needs. \"We are quite pleased that the College of Nursing has chosen to establish Ohio State T otal Health & Wellness at Univer - sity Hospital East,\" said Elizabeth Seely, executive director of University Hospital East at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. \"Access to primary care continues to be a challenge for many individuals. We anticipate that this health center will provide another opportunity for continuity of care in an appropriate setting through convenient and same-day appointments,\" Seely says. \"The future of healthcare will demand models such as this one; this is another great of example of Ohio State leading the way.\" Initially, the new 3,400-square-foot T otal Health & Wellness will operate four and one-half days a week, Monday through Friday. The facility includes four patient exam rooms, two counseling rooms, two staff office areas, a lab, and a lobby and reception area. At first, it will accommodate 125 to 140 patients a week, with future expansion possible as staffing resources grow. Kristie Flamm, MSN, RN, FNP , ACNP , a nurse practitioner, has been named director of the center. (See sidebar.) Flamm also will provide direct patient care. Other staff will include a full-time LPN, a part-time psychiatric nurse practitioner, and a receptionist. Graham will lead a faculty practice on-site one-half day each week. Beginning in January 2013, nursing students will rotate through the center to gain clinical experience. The health center also will create interdisciplinary faculty practice oppor - tunities for a pharmacist, a social worker, psychiatric nurse practitioners, a mental health counselor, and a dietitian, with a physician available for collaboration. Each professional will mentor students in their field who rotate through the health center for clinical experiences. Students from these varied disciplines will work together, learning to combine their strengths for patients' benefit. \"We want it to be a nurse practitioner- led, intercollaborative practice,\" Graham emphasizes. \"In 2011, there was a push through the American Association of Col-leges of Nursing and their counterparts in medicine and pharmacy to put together the goals of intercollaborative practice,\" Graham says. Those goals are outlined in two for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice,\" and \"T eam-Based for Education and Clinical Practice\" \u2014which were released in 2011 by six national health professions associations and three private foundations.\"We would like to use that as our model,\" Graham notes. \"The idea is to put our students together and have them learn together in a clinical setting, teaching our students in the clinical area to work as a team. It's something that we haven't done very well across the country. Right now, our education is, in large part, siloed.\" Several special programs will be offered through this practice to address specific health concerns: The Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE) Healthy Lifestyles TEEN program for overweight adolescents and for depressed teens The US Department of Health and Human Services Million Hearts initiative, designed to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes nationwide over five years A US Preventive Services Task Force depression screening program Another evidence-based collabora- tive program to improve management of chronic disease such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease While grants will cover initial operat- ing costs, the long-term expectation is that Ohio State T otal Health & Wellness will be financially self-sustaining. Other college clinics The College of Nursing also is working to expand its existing clinical collaborations. Two faculty members for the pediatric nurse practitioner program currently provide after-hours care at a Westerville clinic run by Nationwide Children's Hos-pital, and college leaders hope to expand that collaboration to other similar clinics. Other wellness programs Beyond clinical services, \"we hope to do a lot of health promotion and wellness activities,\" Graham said. Nursing students are instrumental in a pilot new-employee onboarding program to promote wellness at Ohio State. (See sidebar next page.) Plans call for community health nursing students to be based at the new health center to conduct other communi-ty wellness programs, possibly including some on-site partnerships with Columbus Public Schools. Evidence-based practice \"In my role as chief wellness officer, I am really passionate that all the initiatives we are undertaking across the univer - sity in health and wellness have to be evidence-based,\" emphasizes Melnyk, who recently completed a four-year term on the United States Preventive Services Task Force which sets evidence-based practice recommendations for primary care providers. \"We know through studies Flamm to direct new health center practitioner Kristie Flamm, MSN, RN, FNP , ACNP , an emergency room practitioner at Ohio State since 2009, has been named director of Ohio State T o-tal Health & Wellness at University Hospital East. Flamm, who is working toward her doctorate in nursing practice, has 25 years of varied nursing experience that includes work in acute care and primary care settings as well as teaching and administrative positions. \"The patient-centered approach is impor - tant to me,\" Flamm says. In the new center, \"We're going to be seeing a population that is especially at risk, that hasn't been receiving primary care. We need to be sure we're look-ing at all of their health needs and addressing patients' goals. Listening to patients makes a big difference.\" Services which address both medical and mental health needs also should benefit patients. \"Depression and anxiety are very prevalent and that's often a big barrier to treating patients,\" she says. If emotional needs are not addressed, it is hard to move beyond those needs to help patients understand the importance of other necessary treatments, she explains. As an emergency room practitioner, Flamm saw first-hand the need for a clinic of this kind. \"I see so many patients without access to care. If we can improve access to care and get them continuity of care, we can really help with the outcomes. With continuity of care, we are able to impact patients' lives long-term\u2014see them back, and work through problems and issues,\" she says. Student involvement is also important. \"The ability to have the students here is a great advantage because they can be spending more time with patients, helping to figure out what their needs are so that we can address those,\" Flamm says. While students and providers both benefit from this collaboration, \"That's a big advantage to the patient as well\u2014more personalized care they are likely not even to get in another clinic setting,\" she notes. Flamm says her hope is that \"we end up feeling like not just a medical home but a true home for these patients. If we can make ourselves accessible and equi-table no matter what their circumstances, that's a big key.\" Kristie Flamm, director of Ohio State Total Health & WellnessA patient examination room at the new Ohio StateTotal Health & Wellness that evidence-based healthcare improves outcomes by at least 30 percent and it reduces costs,\" she says. \"Everything we do in our practice is going to be steeped in delivering evidence-based healthcare. We prepare our students to go out and practice that way.\" Recently, \"some very distressing find- ings\" were uncovered about the imple-mentation of evidence-based practice, Melnyk says, when she and collaborators published a study surveying the experi-ences of 1,000 nurses across the US. \"One of the biggest barriers to nurses being able to implement evidence-based healthcare is the resistance of their leaders and man-agers as well as their nurse and physician colleagues,\" Melnyk recounted, as much of healthcare practice is still steeped in tradition, relying on the methods origi-nally learned. \"We still have a major prob-lem translating findings from research into clinical practice to improve care and patient outcomes,\" she says. Educating 10 The Ohio State University College of Nursing Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 11new practitioners in evidence-based care should help to lead the way. Expanding care capacity Another upcoming change is an expand-ed need for primary care. \"With new healthcare reform going into implemen-tation in 2014, we're going to have 33 million more people in America who are eligible to receive covered healthcare, and we have such a shortage of primary care providers,\" Melnyk says. \"So we also are expanding these opportunities to meet the healthcare needs in the community,\" she notes, through expanded clinical education and services. \"Nursing is go-ing to play a very key role, not only in primary care but also in the management of chronic illness, in transition care from hospital back out to the community.\" Graham agrees. \"Graduate-prepared nurse practitioners are going to be key in providing primary care services,\" she says. T o meet this demand, the college is increasing enrollments in its master's degree nursing programs, as well as its RN to BSN program. For the current 2012-2013 academic year, there are 58 students enrolled in the DNP program, compared to 24 students three years ago; 230 students enrolled in the master's degree nursing program, up from 133 students three years ago; and 213 students in the RN to BSN option, compared to 109 students three years ago. A key limitation to growth in stu- dent class size is the number of clinical sites, so an expanded base of clinical sites will be helpful. \"The more clinical sites we have, the greater number of nurse practitioner students we can educate,\" Graham says. \"Because there is a need for primary care providers, we feel we can match that need by providing primary care through the College of Nursing, plus providing clinical sites,\" Graham says. \"And we hope those clinical sites will be intercollaborative,\" she adds. \"We see all of that as a win for us.\" Under the past healthcare system, \"We focused on illness care,\" Graham said. Health promotion and disease prevention will play a more prominent role in the new healthcare marketplace. \"There is this gigantic shift to look at how we keep people from getting these chronic diseases.\" \"We do see our focus in this inte- grated care model as being one looking at health promotion, prevention, providing for primary care needs\u2014which would include managing chronic disease\u2014and then the mental health component,\" Gra-ham says. An expanded clinical presence will help the college do all of that, while educating practitioners for the future.

In line with Ohio State's goal to become the healthiest campus and employer, \"We want staff to be at their optimal health and practice preventative care,\" says Kate Gawlik, MS, RN, adult nurse practitioner and College of Nursing clinical liaison for the program. \"The program is really about getting people con-nected with resources, depending on what their personal wellness goals and needs are.\" New employees of the Wexner Medical Center are randomly selected to participate in the cur - rent pilot project, and plans call for all new employees of the university and medical center eventually to participate in this wellness screening program. As part of the hiring process, a blood sample is obtained and several biometrics are recorded. New employees then meet with a wellness nurse, who counsels them on what their screening results mean. With an emphasis on \"know your numbers,\" they learn their cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure \"numbers,\" their body mass index, and their waist circumference\u2014all important health indicators. New employees are then linked with helpful resources around campus, such as referrals to an Ohio State primary care provider, health coaching, dietitians, fitness resources, pharmacist medical management, and other services as desired. If any serious findings are discovered during their initial screening, new employees are referred for immedi-ate care in the clinic or the emergency room if appropriate, while follow-up on less serious issues is referred to their primary care provider. College of Nursing students serve as health guides, helping new employees navigate this screening process. The nursing students are educated to understand biometrics and to assist with the finger stick blood glucose tests and the blood draws for cholesterol tests. This education also prepares students for their role in future health screenings around campus, as part of the effort to help promote a campus-wide culture of wellness. \"The project should help catch disease early,\" Gawlik notes. Several new employees have already been diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure, and at least one learned he had a potentially serious heart condition. As of press time, the onboarding program had served 556 new employees. Eventually it will roll out to serve the 3,000-plus new employees who join Ohio State each year. Kate Gawlik Richard H. Carmona, MD, MPH, FACS Dean's Distinguished Professor of Health Promotion and Entrepreneurship Dr. Richard Carmona will share his expertise in public health, health literacy, and health innovation with students and faculty, as well as the greater community, through key-note presentations and lectures, outreach projects, and na-tional advocacy of College of Nursing strategies. Carmona's responsibilities with the College of Nursing include helping students learn to think innovatively and entrepreneurially about the delivery of healthcare. \"The healthcare environment is challenging and ever-changing,\" said Carmona. \"Nursing graduates can make valuable contributions to all aspects of health promotion and healthcare delivery when they are prepared to lead change that helps improve healthcare quality and con-trol costs.\" In 2002, Carmona became the 17th Surgeon General of the United New faculty appointments bring strength and innovation to the College of Nursing By kathryn k elleyA US Surgeon General with a distinguished career.

In her currently funded work on high-risk pregnancy, she tests intervention approaches to decrease stress and promote healthier lifestyles in women and infants. This program of research examines ethnic disparities in relationship to birth outcomes and she continues to publish and disseminate this work widely. She is also a woman's health nurse practitioner, serving high-risk obstetrical patients. Ruiz was recently selected for induction into the American Academy of Nursing (AAN) for her research contributions. She received her doctor - ate from the University of T exas Health Science Center at San Antonio, T exas, in 1999. In joining the College of Nursing, Ruiz said, \"I was intrigued by the in-novative, progressive movement of the college, the outstanding leadership, the focus for a center on women and chil-dren's research, and the many outstand-ing national researchers that focus on preterm birth.\" Ruiz is currently collaborating with Rita Pickler, PhD, RN, PNP-BC, FAAN, nurse scientist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and research professor at the Ohio State College of Nursing, on research with a perinatal focus. She has also worked with Associate Profes-sor Thelma Patrick, PhD, RN, on a National Institute of Nursing Research conference on health disparities in birth outcomes. Ruiz is an avid reader of mystery novels: \"I like the mystery novels as they are kind of like my research, putting pieces of a puzzle together for the final picture.\" Ruiz has two grown daughters and three granddaughters ranging in age from newborn to six years, and one granddaughter on the way. Her older daughter Lori has her master's degree and teaches first graders in Houston and her younger daughter Pam teaches mathematics at T exas A&M and Del Mar junior college in Corpus Christi.

Ready? Get healthy. Organizations strive to improve healthcare and wellness programs, but statistics seem to be working against them. While a statewide obe- sity rate of over 20 per - cent was unheard-of as recently as 1995, today 39 states have an obesity rate of 25 percent or more, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And, with 29.6 percent, Ohio ranks an unlucky 13th. Mental health problems are on the rise as well; in 2010, the American Psycho-logical Association found that 22 percent of respondents reported extreme stress. Too often, the pairing of stress and ex- cess weight results in chronic illness in one out of two adults in the US, according to the CDC. Diseases such as diabetes have become shockingly prevalent, affecting al-most 26 million Americans, 90-95 percent of whom have Type 2 diabetes, which is often the result of an unhealthy lifestyle. \"Chronic conditions account for 75 percent of total US healthcare costs,\" remarks Bernadette Melnyk, PhD, RN, CPNP/PMH-NP , FNAP , FAAN, chief wellness officer and dean of The Ohio State University College of Nurs-ing. \"Even Ohio State has experienced a 36 percent increase in total healthcare costs since 2006.\" Melnyk and others at Ohio State are determined to reverse these trends by spearheading a groundbreaking initiative towards health and wellness at the College of Nursing, the university, the state, and beyond. As the first individual to be ap- pointed chief wellness officer at a major US university, and as associate vice president for health promotion, she has made it her personal mission to turn the tide against stress and obesity. \"Our goal is to be the Bernadette Melnyk delivers the inaugural State of Health & Wellness in Buckeye Nation address at the Ohio Union Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 15 14 The Ohio State University College of Nursing16 The Ohio State University College of Nursing Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 17 healthiest university on the globe.\" Named Buckeye Wellness, the initia- tive encompasses a myriad of programs and efforts for one the largest universities in the country. \"Ohio State is a complex organization,\" observes Megan Amaya, PhD, CHES, AFAA, who was tapped as director of health promotion & wellness at the College of Nursing. \"It has many different health and wellness initiatives, so some of our programs will take longer to implement than others.\" As the former wellness coordinator for the city of Dub-lin, Ohio and facilitator of the Healthy Dublin initiative, and with a background in exercise science and health promo-tion, she is uniquely suited to the task. A certified fitness instructor and personal trainer, Amaya has also taught classes in health and wellness at Ohio State, Capital University, and other central Ohio colleges. Whittling down a plus-sized effort In shaping a culture of wellness, Melnyk, Amaya, and others are looking at more than just the obvious fixes. \"Building cognitive-behavioral skills is an impor - tant component of change,\" observes Melnyk. It is one thing to follow an eating and exercise regimen, and quite another to internalize it. Without cognitive-be-havioral integration there's no long-term sustainable improvement. With this in mind, Melynk has ex- panded her program called COPE (Creat-ing Opportunities for Personal Empower - ment), an intervention program based on building cognitive behavioral skills that has been implemented in several loca-tions across the country. The program is designed to improve the mental and be-havioral health outcomes of at-risk teens and their parents. A version repurposed for college- age students was rolled out this fall with freshmen and first-year students at the College of Nursing and College of Social Work; the School of Health and Rehabili-tation Sciences as well as at Ohio State's Mansfield campus. The seven-week pro-gram uses online modules, videos, and homework assignments to improve the mental and emotional health of the par - ticipant. \"Sessions focus on self-esteem, stress management, and helping students regulate and manage their emotions,\" explains Amaya. \"Students need to learn that how they think is directly related to how they behave,\" adds Melnyk, noting that many times when dealing with stress, young people turn to unhealthy behaviors such as eating, drinking, and smoking. \"Not only should it help them improve academic performance and retention, but they will learn how to handle anxiety and depression\" and in the long run, experi-ence fewer health problems. Plans are to integrate COPE throughout the univer - sity and the Wexner Medical Center and at area schools. Making sure that Buckeye Wellness is coordinated university wide is another challenge. In 2011, the One University Health and Wellness Council was formed and includes leaders from the College of Nursing, Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center, Office of Human Resources, the Ohio State Health Plan, Office of Student Life, Office of Commercialization and T echnology, and the College of Educa-tion and Human Ecology. \"Through active engagement of all stakeholders, we work towards creating and implement-ing evidence-based health and wellness initiatives and programs,\" states Melnyk, who co-chairs the council with Kathleen McCutcheon, chief human resources officer, and Larry Lewellen, vice president for care coordination & health promo-tion at Wexner Medical Center. Along with monitoring outcomes of health and wellness implementation strategies, the council also collaborates with commu-nity partners. Buckeye Wellness Packs and \"just one change\" Outreach is a major ingredient in Buckeye Wellness. This summer, Ohio State President E. Gordon Gee, Melnyk, Amaya, and others visited dozens of Ohio communities. Along with empha-sizing how \"just one change\" can lead to a healthier lifestyle, and with Brutus Buckeye cheering them on, Melnyk and Amaya distributed Buckeye Wellness Packs to Ohioans. The packs are filled with a pedometer, low-fat trail mix, a water bottle, an informational diabetes DVD, and many other evidence-based wellness items. The response was over - whelmingly positive. \"I think people are somewhat unclear about disease preven-tion and wellness priorities,\" observes Amaya. \"It was gratifying to see them so receptive and enthusiastic.\" A line of Buckeye Wellness snacks consisting of healthy ingredients as well as gluten- and nut-free options may be available at vari-ous outlets in the near future. The national Million Hearts Initia- tive to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes over the next five years, is also being brought to the table. The key components are clinical and com-munity prevention through screenings and education on the ABCSS\u2014aspirin therapy, blood pressure control, choles-terol reduction, smoking prevention\u2014\"and a local twist to our campaign, stress management,\" says Melnyk. Past and future events include appearances at the Ohio State Fair and the Farm Science Review, and at Ohio State's Rally for Wellness at the Recreational and Physical Activity Center (RPAC); participation in the Global Diabetes Summit at the Ohio Union; and again in 2013, Valentine's Day screenings throughout campus. \"The potential to reach hundreds of thousands of people and save lives through Million Hearts is enormous,\" adds Amaya. Other aspects served up on campus include Buckeye Wellness Tips, monthly evidence-based informational sugges-tions provided to faculty and staff in OSUToday, the daily electronic headline service, and OneSource, the Wexner Medical Center intranet; Wellness Wednesdays, a weekly activity that pro-motes a healthy lifestyle for the university population; and Wellness Innovators. As Wellness Innovators, \"faculty and staff will be not only responsible for pro-moting university health and wellness initiatives but also implementing well-ness programs, activities, and bringing in guest speakers,\" continues Amaya. Many of the concepts inherent in Buckeye Wellness work in lock-step with Human Resources. Developed with the primary purpose of driving the health and wellness agenda forward for fac-ulty, staff, and their families, Y our Plan for Health (YP4H) has launched a new member portal to improve accessibility and enhance engagement. Also starting in January, faculty and staff needing to see their primary care provider can do so with zero out-of-pocket cost for that office visit. \"It's important for Buckeye Wellness and Y our Plan for Health to have a comprehensive, integrated ap-proach to health and wellness,\" observes Gretchen Feldmann, former strategy and engagement manager within the Hu-man Resources-Benefits team. \"We're fortunate to have the One University Health and Wellness Council because it illustrates the close collaboration that exists.\" Other university-wide efforts include developing a nutritional strategy and providing educational and exercise programs as well as a robust employee assistance program. And over the past three years, Pelotonia, the grassroots bike tour with routes of up to 180 miles, not only challenged over 8,300 riders from 38 states but raised $25.4 million for cancer research at the Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute. The College of Nursing acts as a test market for endeavors such as the Health Athlete/Nurse Athlete programs. De-veloped in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson and based on the Human Performance Institute's Corporate Ath-lete curriculum, the two-day boot camp for the busy offers complete mental and physical assessment encompassing energy management, nutritional guidelines, and movement coaching, along with exercise/workout sessions. An action plan with an eye to optimal performance and stress management \"will help align the work-life-energy balance,\" says Melnyk, who is expanding the program throughout Ohio State, the Medical Center, and beyond. \"We are trying to blend health and well-ness efforts to develop solutions that move beyond the ivory tower and into the classroom and the boardroom.\" The college itself is also shaping up to be a model of wellness. Along with the addition of facing treadmill workstations for walking meetings, exercise ball chairs in offices to improve posture, and healthy food at meetings and events, a 24/7 fitness center recently opened for faculty, staff, and doctoral students. Not only does it feature an elliptical machine, a tread-mill, a recumbent bike, free weights, and other equipment, but also a binder full of exercise programs, stretching regimes and heart rate information. Its location in the basement of Newton Hall \"makes it Megan Amaya is director of health promotion & wellness in the College of Nursing.

Nursing Impact 2009 18Creating healthy workplaces US Healthiest HealthLead national forum held on campus This summer, the College of Nursing hosted high-level representatives from public, business, and academic sectors who embraced the importance of healthy workplaces for a healthier nation. Forum participants shared worksite health management and well-being best practices as a sustainable business strategy on The Ohio State University campus. The Col- lege of Nursing teamed with US Healthiest on the forum to shed more light on nursing's crucial initiatives in corporate and academic well-ness programs. \"There is a strong need for aggressive health promo-tion efforts by employers and that role can be fulfilled by nurses promoting health and wellness in the workplace,\" stated Bernadette Melnyk, PhD, RN, CPNP/PMH-NP , FNAP , FAAN, university chief wellness officer, associate vice president for health promotion, and dean of the College of Nursing. \"The success of Ohio State's health and wellness program can be easily replicated by business and academic communities nationwide with nursing's direct involvement in a multidimensional healthcare team.\" Richard H. Carmona, MD, MPH, FACS, 17th surgeon general of the United States, president of Canyon Ranch Insti-tute and dean's distinguished professor of health promotion and entrepreneurship at Ohio State's College of Nursing spoke at the event on \"Worksite health management/well-being as a business sustainability strategy.\" Howard K. Koh, MD, MPH, assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, discussed \"Healthy workplaces for a healthy nation.\" Through the HealthLead accreditation process, US Healthiest not only recognizes organizations that demonstrate best practices in employee health management and well-being, but also helps them better align these practices with business sustainability, health, produc-tivity, and finan-cial outcomes. The Ohio State University was the first aca-demic institution to take part in the HealthLead assessment, re-ceiving a bronze rating for its wellness initia-tives across cam-pus, including the Y our Plan for Health program, One University Health and Well-ness leadership group, extended P4 personalized health outreach, and hiring the nation's first university chief wellness officer. An agreement between Ohio State and the Alliance for US Healthiest is underway to collaborate in the development of one or more survey instruments to assess health and wellness within institutions of higher education, creating an academic HealthLead assessment. A consortium and summit\u2014Building Healthy Academic Communities\u2014are in the works. The date for the summit has been set for April 22-23, 2013. More infor - mation is available at www.healthyacademics.org .

Organizations represented include The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, Target Corporation, ING DIRECT, Shape Corp., DTE Energy, HealthPartners, and Columbus-based OhioHealth, Worthington Industries, and The Ohio State University. The College of Nursing has provided healthy alternatives in the workplace, such as standing desks (above, with Dr. Mary Beth Happ), ball chairs, and walkstations.convenient to go for a quick workout during lunch or between classes,\" comments Amaya. Along with a personal trainer who comes to the college twice a week, on any given day Melnyk or Amaya may host spontaneous 15-minute \"wellness walks\" for faculty and staff. The changes have been well-received. \"Focusing on wellness and stress reduction results in higher productivity and satisfaction,\" remarks Melnyk. \"Our society is way too sedentary and wellness activities need to be easy and a regular part of our day.\" Health \"leading\" the way The health and wellness initiative has expanded to the clinical side as well. This December, the new nurse practitioner-led T otal Health & Wellness at University Hospital East will be opened for both the university and local community. Planned programs include Million Hearts, COPE, and various healthy lifestyle regimens for conditions ranging from diabetes to depression. While patients will meet with a nurse practitioner and physician to discuss medical concerns, added empha-sis will be on prevention, screening, and education. In 2011, Ohio State was one of thir - teen organizations of various sizes and types tapped for the development and pilot testing of the US Healthiest (USH) HealthLead Workplace Accreditation as-sessment (see opposite page). A nonprofit, public-private collaboration co-founded by CDC and state and local public health organizations, USH addresses health reform across a number of platforms. \"Using the science, databases, and credibility of governmental public health, we partner with the public-private sector to provide health innovations for the na-tion, workers, and organizations,\" states chief executive officer Nick Baird, MD. Baird worked closely with the College of Nursing, Office of Human Resources, and others at Ohio State during the evalua-tion phase. \"The initial self-assessment tool was very robust and when USH went onsite to follow up several months later, we upgraded Ohio State from where they had scored themselves.\" Not only did the experience provide a validation to both Ohio State and USH, it provided a roadmap as to how to further refine the assessment. Based on research and best practices, the three-step accreditation process has been in place since 2011 and consists of an online assessment, an audit by USH, and an accreditation confirmation accompanied by a blueprint for action which provides a continuous quality im-provement model. Although it has been adopted by several organizations, Ohio State was the first academic institution to receive accreditation, and in June 2012 was also the site of the inaugural Health-Lead US Healthiest Workplace Forum. Along with bringing together recipients who had received accreditation as well as those who might be interested in the program, the day-long session \"served as an incubator for the exchange of new ideas and information,\" says Baird. Adding to the bottom line Prevention pays big dividends. Accord-ing to Melnyk, every dollar invested in wellness can bring a return of $4 through lowered healthcare expenses and absen-teeism. Based on the initial program's success, Ohio State is now working with USH to develop similar metrics for higher education. Along with providing a data warehouse for these accreditations, the university will put its considerable research weight towards developing the assessment tool, along with recommend-ing other institutions for alpha and beta testing. \"Ohio State is raising the bar for standards of health and well-being in the academic community,\" says Baird. T o this end, on April 22-23, 2013, Ohio State will be hosting the first National Summit on Building Healthy Academic Communities for universities, colleges, and academic medical centers across the US. \"Along with stimulating solutions and sharing best practices, we plan to launch a national consortium for building healthy academic communities,\" comments Melnyk. The focus will be on student, faculty and staff wellness, aca-demic medical center health and wellness research, and wellness innovation, includ-ing events where people submit wellness ideas and bring them to fruition during the conference. \"Universities are in a unique posi- tion to set the national agenda for health and wellness,\" observes Amaya. Along with being incubators for new ideas and trends, they have the built-in advantage of having access to students, whose taste for learning can develop into lifelong good habits. \"We want to create an ecosystem of healthy lifestyle behaviors,\" sums up Melnyk.\"They need to be part of the DNA of every single person.\" Sandra Gurvis is is a Columbus-based writer and author who writes frequently about Ohio State.20 The Ohio State University College of Nursing Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 21 Two new major five-year grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and one from the US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administra-tion (HRSA) top the list of new research funding received by the College of Nursing, as it moves to climb in the national rankings and attract an increased volume of re-search dollars. A range of other new faculty and student research support is also in place. \"Navigation from community to clinic to promote colorectal screen-ing in underserved populations\" is the topic of a new five-year study, funded with a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. The study will establish a public education program within com-munity-based clinics to encourage colon cancer testing in underserved populations. Usha Menon, PhD, RN, FAAN, vice dean and professor of nursing, is a co-principal investiga-tor on the study with a professor at Arizona State University. Another five-year, $2.2 million study funded by NIH examines \"Muscle function and depression-like behavior in a mouse model of cancer fatigue.\" The study is designed \"to bet- ter understand the concept of fatigue, which is the most frequent and dis-tressing symptom reported by cancer patients,\" explains Donna McCarthy, PhD, RN, FAAN, associate dean for research and Mildred E. Newton Pro-fessor of Nursing. McCarthy serves as principal researcher on the inter - disciplinary study, conducted with co-investigators from other colleges at Ohio State. A $1.5 million, three-year federal grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administra-tion (HRSA) will fund the opening of the College of Nursing and the university's first nurse practitioner-led intercollaborative practice at the Ohio State T otal Health & Wellness at University Hospital East.

This rise reflects both the recruitment of new, well-funded faculty as well as an added volume of effort de-voted to generating new grant proposals. Colorectal cancer screening for the underserved Menon's colorectal cancer screening study will be conducted in Arizona with co-principal investigator Linda Larkey, PhD, professor at Arizona State Univer - sity, and co-investigator Laura Szalacha, EdD, research associate professor at the Ohio State College of Nursing. The project will use a previously- tested approach to encourage colorectal cancer screening among low-income, multi-cultural patients aged 50 or over, many of whom do not have a regular primary care home. Because this group currently is less likely to undergo such screening, and colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US, the potential impact is large. There are two phases to the ap- proach. First, community-to-clinic navigators will hold classes for small groups in multiple community centers. These classes will stress the importance of colorectal cancer screening for those over 50, and address some common misconceptions, as well as the benefits of screening and early detection. The navigators will work with pa- tients one-on-one to encourage partici-pation in screening, then make screening arrangements. \"What we've discovered over the years is it's not one-size-fits-all,\" Menon noted. \"Everyone is going to get a navigation program tailored to their personal barriers, beliefs and cultural values.\" For instance, some patients may need help making arrangements for the day of preparation prior to the screen-ing. Others may need help with trans-portation or childcare on the day of the appointment, or arranging for a support person to be present. \"If you're poor and everybody in the family is under hard-ship, these are not easy things to get around,\" Menon notes. The navigator helps patients work through these bar - riers. Navigators also may help patients overcome fears, address language barri-ers, or help uninsured and underinsured patients find clinics where they can be served at low cost or no cost. The study will track the success rates for moving patients into the clinic and for completion of screenings and will determine cost-effectiveness. Based on the outcome, the study eventually could be replicated in other locations across the country. Insight into cancer fatigue The other major new study, also led by McCarthy, will examine whether the fatigue associated with cancer is due to depression or to loss of muscle mass. Co-investigators include Jonathan Godbout, associate professor of neuroscience in the College of Medicine, who studies the biology of depression behavior with illness from a neuroscience perspective, and Peter Reiser, PhD, professor of oral biology in the College of Dentistry and professor of physiology and cell biol-ogy in the College of Medicine, expert in muscle cell biology and function as related to fatigue. The researchers are exploring two different concepts in mice with cancer tumors\u2014fatigue as related to motivation and enjoyment, and physical tolerance as related to musculoskeletal strength or motor function. \"There are all kinds of things we can model with mice and rats to get at the underlying biology of something we're interested in with people,\" Mc-Carthy says. With further clinical studies, findings could one day help better tailor patient treatments. \"If the complaint of fatigue has more to do with mood and affect, then that speaks to cognitive be-havioral therapy,\" McCarthy notes. \"If it has more to do with loss of muscle mass, then exercise\u2014and particularly resistance exercise\u2014would be important.\" Mice are known to enjoy wheel run- ning. Y et, the behavior study of mice with tumors shows that as the tumor grows, the mice rest more and run in shorter bursts, indicating fatigue. T o separate out whether this fatigue is due to loss of muscle mass or to loss of motivation and ability to run, several physical tests and drug studies of mice with tumors are used. A test of preference in drinking water gauges depression. Healthy mice prefer sugar water, while depressed mice show no preference between sugar water and plain water. Other tests explore physical toler - ance and motor function. Grip strength is gauged through ability to hang onto a mesh grid. Muscle function tests exam-ine whether restricted access to wheel running leads to faster deterioration than unlimited access to wheel running. Based on these indicators of mood and strength, \"We administer different drugs that break down whether we're dealing with mood or with muscle changes,\" McCarthy notes. Four drugs are used in the study to test if they improve wheel-running activity; two of these drugs should have an effect on mood and two should have an effect on factors that affect muscle function. While the study is still in its early stages, in the long-term it could offer a better understanding of the value or risks of exercise and the role of depres-sion in cancer fatigue. This could provide valuable information on how to treat patients with slowly-progressing cancers to preserve their quality of life and their functional ability. Helping kids breathe easier Asthma health disparities within the La-tino population of children with asthma is the basis for a study being conducted by Associate Professor Kimberly Arcoleo, PhD, MPH. Puerto Rican children exhib-it the highest rates of asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality among all eth-nic groups, according to Arcoleo, while Mexican children exhibit one of the lowest. Of critical importance, she says, but previously not extensively researched, is the role that culture, acculturation and illness representations\u2014the way the par - ent interprets health and illness which in-fluences how he/she manages the child's asthma\u2014may play in parents' asthma management and treatment decisions. \"Parents and healthcare providers tend to hold different view of the disease and goals for treatment. Many parents view asthma as episodic, acute, and not readily controllable and want their child to be medication-free. However, asthma is a chronic illness and the disease is pres-ent even when symptoms are controlled and currently not apparent. Health-care providers strive to have the child become symptom-free. As management of chronic illnesses has incorporated more self-management strategies, it's important to understand how parents perceive their child's asthma and their beliefs about controller medication use so that effective communication regard-ing treatment expectations and symptom resolution can occur. The National Center of Comple- mentary and Alternative Medicine (NC-CAM), a center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), awarded a $2.5 million grant for research of asthma disparities among Latino children to Arcoleo in 2008 while she was at Arizona State Uni-versity. Of that, $1.5 million transferred to the College of Nursing when Arcoleo came here in 2011. The project, titled \"Asthma disparities in Latino children: Acculturation, illness representation & contemporary alternative medicine\" (CAM) is being conducted in Phoenix, AZ and Bronx, NY, and is housed within the Center for Promoting Health in Infants, Children, Adolescents & Women at the College of Nursing, where Arcoleo serves as director. The findings from this study will contribute to knowledge of the similari-ties and differences that exist between Mexican and Puerto Rican families regarding asthma illness beliefs and man-agement strategies, and how accultura-tion influences these factors. \"The pro-posed interdisciplinary multilevel study will address gaps in the evidence base and expand the framework for assessing disparities in asthma health outcomes among Latino children\" , says Arcoleo. Arcoleo states, \"Healthcare provid-ers, regardless of their practice setting, can best treat children with asthma if they understand what beliefs parents hold about what causes asthma, the nature of asthma symptoms, its course of action (chronic versus episodic), medica-tions and alternative therapies used in treatment, and expectations for symptom resolution. If parents' beliefs are discor - dant with the healthcare provider's be-liefs and are not addressed when devising the management plan, there is increased risk for non-adherence.\" Other new funding for faculty In other new research funding for faculty, Jodi McDaniel, PhD, RN, assistant professor of nursing, received a two-year grant award of $419,375 from NIH for the study, \"T esting fish oil derivatives in healing of chronic venous leg ulcers.\" McDaniel serves as principal investigator, with a co-investigator from the College of Medicine who has expertise in wound biology. This study will test whether the fish oil derivatives EPA+DHA, given as dietary supplements, can improve the healing of chronic venous leg ulcers that often do not respond well to topical treatments. Patients' response to the dietary supplements will be tested at both 28- and 56-day increments, and will be compared to outcomes for a control The use of fish oil derivatives in the healing of chronic venous leg ulcers is the work of Assistant Professor Jodi McDaniel.Associate Professor Kimberly Arcoleo (left) is studying disparities of school-age Latino children with asthma; shown here with her research nurse (at right), and a participant.Assistant Professor Tim Landers' research will develop a protocol for improving hand hygiene among hospitalized patients.

But The Ohio State University Col- lege of Nursing's new Transformational Learning Academy in Nursing & Health (TLA) has taken continuing education to new levels. \"Along with streamlining processes and making them as conve-nient as possible, our goal is to provide a substantive learning experience,\" ob-serves Jacqueline Loversidge, PhD, RNC, TLA director and clinical instructor at the college. \"We are looking at our target audience and programs to make them compelling and relevant\" to nurses and healthcare workers in the 21st century. Programming to the max Like many educational institutions, the College of Nursing had a continuing education program in place when Berna-dette Melnyk, PhD, RN, CPNP/PMH-NP , FNAP , board as dean in September 2011. \"She looked at the exist-ing program and re-envisioned it with an eye to transforming the way people prac-tice,\" says Loversidge, who was asked by Melnyk to serve as director. Loversidge's extensive background in education and nursing regulation included a stint at the Capital University School of Nursing where she was the first director of the accelerated program for second-degree BSN students. Along with being associate executive director and nursing educa-tion consultant for the Ohio Board of Nursing, she also served on the National Council of State Boards Nursing Com-mittee on Special Projects to computerize paper-and-pencil licensure examinations. Additionally she worked in a variety of positions at OhioHealth and in 2012 received her PhD in higher education policy and leadership from Ohio State, where she has taught since 2009. And those are just the \"CliffsNotes\" of her credentials. \"Jackie brings a whole host of experiences to the table that make organizing a CE course easier for every-one,\" observes Lynn Gallagher-Ford, PhD, RN, director of the College of Nursing's Center for Transdisciplinary Evidence-based Practice (CTEP). Recently Galla-gher-Ford and others put on a five-day workshop on evidence-based practice (EBP), which included about 40 hours of teaching. \"Her attention to detail and extensive knowledge allowed me to focus on content,\" rather than the administra-tive tasks related to obtaining continuing education contact hours that are required from the TLA as an approved provider unit of the Ohio Nurses Association. Loversidge \"knows all the rules and what can and cannot be done, providing us with parameters to efficiently create the best programming possible.\" A challenge to educators and learners In only a few short months, the TLA has organized an array of programs that The college's new Transformational Learning Academy in Nursing & Health is putting a stake in the ground to become the leader in lifelong learningTLA: A new way for continuing education By sandra gurvis TLA Director Jacqueline LoversidgeHere are few of the speakers featured in the College of Nursing's upcoming podcast series: J. Nick Baird, MD, is CEO of the nonprofit Alliance to Make US Healthiest (US Healthiest), a collaboration of national, state and local public health, business, nongovernmental organiza-tions and consumers committed to making the US the healthiest nation in a healthier world. Prior to joining US Healthiest, Baird served as director of the Ohio Department of Health. During his eight-year tenure, he led the state's efforts in bioterrorism and pandemic influenza planning, increased health coverage for low-income mothers and children, spearheaded efforts for minimum requirements for nursing homes, expanded newborn screening, and implemented Healthy Ohioans, a program focused on reducing the burden of chronic disease by reducing tobacco use, improving eating habits and increasing exercise. In 2008, Baird was appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the CDC Director's Advi-sory Council. Dr. Baird received a presidential appointment to serve on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 2002. Prior to joining ODH in 1999, Baird served for 13 years with OhioHealth, most recently as senior vice presi-dent and chief medical officer. He was a private practice physician in obstetrics and gynecology for 27 years and is an associate clinical professor in the Department of Obstet-rics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. He is a diplomate of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology. William D.

C aRmOna When I started my term as Surgeon General of the United States, the news media seemed to enjoy proclaiming my experience as a trauma surgeon, a professor, and the CEO of a health system. What I challenged them to notice was that for the first time in US history, a health profes-sional with nursing experience was serving as the US Surgeon General. Having had the unique opportunity to be a nurse made me a much better physician and a much better Surgeon General. Nursing provided me with a great deal of not only education but insight into how to best care for patients. I started my health ser - vices career in US Army Special Forces, serving in Vietnam as a medic and weapons special-ist. After returning home as a combat-decorated veteran I knew that I wanted to pursue a life in medicine. I became a registered nurse and worked in emergency, trauma, and critical-care departments. I then pursued a medical degree, graduating at the top of my class from the University of California, San Francisco in 1979. I see the irreplace-able value of nursing. Nurses approach patients from a different perspective than physicians. Nursing's holistic approach integrates all of the resources around the patient, yet both professionals comple-ment each other and are inte-gral to providing good care. The culture is still with me; the training and patient approach. Once you train as a nurse, you're not really ever a \"former\" nurse. Y ou are still a nurse and build on that profession, although you may hold different titles through-out your life. Whenever peo-ple describe me as a \"former\" nurse, I tend to correct them, because the truth is \"Once a nurse, always a nurse!\" In 2002, President George W. Bush nominated me to serve a four-year term as US Surgeon General. I was unani-mously confirmed by the US Senate. The US Surgeon Gen-eral advises the president and Congress on health policy, is sworn to protect and improve citizens' health, and admin-isters the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, a team of uniformed-service health professionals who respond to the nation's im-mediate and long-term health needs, including disaster preparedness and response. I focused my time as Surgeon General on preven-tion, preparedness, health disparities, health literacy, and global health\u2014to include health diplomacy. Nurses are critical in all of those areas. At every juncture where we have nursing, whether it is pediatrics or oncology, clinic nursing or inpatient, nurses have so many teaching mo-ments every single day as they interact with their patients. I challenge every nurs- ing professional to seize these opportunities to advance patients' health literacy about prevention and what they can do to stay healthy, such as exercising, eating healthy foods in healthy portions, and avoiding risky behaviors. In truth, these patient contacts also help to alleviate health disparities. Low-income people and people of color like my Hispanic family typi-cally have less access to care and poorer outcomes. Nurses must tailor their messages to the person, be sensitive to cul-tural differences, and advocate for those who cannot do so for themselves. Some of the health dis- parity issues can be addressed by improving health literacy and by empowering patients. At Canyon Ranch Institute, the non-profit organization that I lead as president of the Board of Directors, we use the Calgary Charter on Health Literacy's definition of health Nurses: Leading the way The 17th US Surgeon General and current college faculty member shares his viewpoint about how nurses are leading the way in transforming health, transforming lives 17th US Surgeon General Richard Carmona, MD, MPH, FACS, and some friendsshould intrigue any RN, as well as other health professionals. \"We wanted to be creative with the curriculum,\" observes Loversidge. Recent offerings include: Success in Simulation (March 2012) Symphony of Simulation (Planned May, 2013) Along with promoting best practices in the use of human-patient simulation, this daylong workshop hosted by College of Nursing faculty and staff and involving simulation industry representatives fo-cused on everything from getting started to competency assessment to advanced moulage techniques, in which mock inju-ries are applied to the patient. \"Program faculty used the college's T echnology Learning Complex (TLC) to provide hands-on experience,\" adds Loversidge. Lisa Rohrig, director of the TLC, was the program planner for this event. Nuts and bolts of designing, conducting, analyzing, and funding intervention studies (May 2012; Planned May 29-31, 2013)This three-day research-intensive workshop (RIW) \"not only sold out, but is planned again for 2013, with spaces added,\" comments workshop planner Kimberly Arcoleo, PhD, MPH, associ-ate professor at the college. Intervention study design and measurement, internal and external validity, and grants and cost effectiveness were among the many aspects discussed. A copy of the just-published Intervention Research: Design-ing, Conducting, Analyzing, and Funding (A Practical Guide For Success) by Melnyk and be provided to every participant. \"Even though it was our first time, ev-erything went incredibly smoothly,\" adds Arcoleo. See www.nursing.osu.edu/riw Leadership development for nurses and The art and practice of nursing and healthcare leadership (August, 2012; multiple dates planned for 2013). Hosted by the college's Leadership Academy for Peak Performance (LAPP), the four-day program teaches leadership skills to aspiring nurse managers and healthcare leaders, including trust build-ing, facilitating peak performance in oth-ers, emotional and social intelligence, and balancing energy and skills, to mention a few. Participants also meet with nurse and healthcare managers to share ideas and develop best practices and receive coaching support in the twelve months following the workshop. LAPP is directed by T. Scott Graham, PhD, USAF Lt. Col. (ret.). See www.nursing.osu.edu/lapp Evidence-based practice: Making it a reality in your organization (September & December 2012; multiple dates planned for 2013). Coordinated by the Center for Trans-disciplinary Evidence-based geared only to nurses but all healthcare professionals, including edu-cators, physicians, administrators, and physical, respiratory, and occupational therapists; as well as others,\" explains Gallagher-Ford. Leveraging EBP and clinical inquiry, effective research and evaluation, and integration into the spec-trum of healthcare settings are among the many topics covered. \"At the end of the workshop, participants will have an action plan for implementing EBP as well as techniques to ignite and sustain the shift to EBP in their organizations.\" See www.nursing.osu.edu/ctep A good start...and then some While some might be content with TLA 's running start, Loversidge is continu-ally on the lookout for new courses and innovations. For example, she is integrat-ing the mandatory one-hour Category A CE on Ohio nursing law and rules into various offerings. \"It's much more convenient than having to take a separate course,\" she observes. And since Ohio Board of Nursing rules are changing to authorize advanced practice nurses to prescribe Schedule II drugs, precipitating the need for an additional course, \"we are considering several alternatives, including online and workshop formats.\" The new TLA website will provide one-stop shopping. \"Participants will be able to do everything online, including registering, paying for the course, com-pleting the evaluation and even retriev-ing and printing out their certificates,\" she continues. She is also considering developing a line of educational materials from existing courses and workshops and is working towards setting up a system so participants can maintain a relationship with their instructors and receive ongo-ing coaching. \"The expertise, enthusiasm, and support of the College of Nursing IT department is essential as we move forward.\" Additionally the TLA is looking to refine its target audience. \"While we want to appeal to all RNs and healthcare providers, we're also focusing on, among others, alumni, advanced practice nurses, and preceptors (experienced nurses who volunteer their services by work-ing closely with students and faculty in a clinical setting). If preceptors sharpen their skills, they will be more effective,\" says Loversidge. \"People can choose continuing education from a variety of sources,\" observes Loversidge. So along with pro-viding the highest quality offerings, \"we want to inspire and motivate participants from the inside out to make changes for the better.\" Then not only will continuing education be a joy rather than an obliga-tion, but everyone will benefit, from providers to patients. Sandra Gurvis is is a Columbus-based writer and author who writes frequently about Ohio State.Transformations in Nursing & Health Autumn 2012 31 30 The Ohio State University College of Nursingliteracy as allowing \"the public and personnel working in all health-related contexts to find, understand, evaluate, commu-nicate, and use information.\" The Calgary Charter suggests that health literacy applies to both individuals and to health systems, explaining that a system is health literate when it provides equal, easy to use, and shame-free access to and delivery of health care and health information. As health professionals, health literacy is translating what we know to the pa-tients we serve in a culturally competent manner to effect behavioral change. Science it-self is a tough sell. When we're speaking with our patients, we have to convert our scientific knowledge into information and experiences that resonate, are relevant, and result in positive behavior changes. Low health literacy is a problem throughout our nation and the world. As a trauma surgeon, there were times when I felt that my impact was minimal. My col-leagues and I would save a life, which was a wonderful out-come, but our patient would not necessarily continue to be healthy or safe because they lacked health literacy. At the hospital, we would use the best science to treat problems that were largely preventable. This included the patients who harmed them-selves by never exercising, by eating an unhealthy diet, by smoking, or by engaging in risky or violent activities. But when those patients awoke after life-saving surgery, there was often no education about how to avoid a return trip to the emergency room or the surgeon's table. I started teach-ing interns, residents, and my medical students at the University of Arizona about the importance of following up with patients to teach them how to stop repeating the unhealthy behaviors that even-tually led them to the door of an emergency room. T oday's nursing cur - riculum can do so much to improve health literacy. Health literacy can be further integrated into scholarly practice, communication in nursing, and professionalism. In the area of prepared- ness, I contacted nursing organizations soon after ac-cepting the position of Surgeon General, in order to involve nurses in disaster planning. During my four-year statutory term, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunc-tion with the American Nurs-es Association, established Na-tional Nurse Response teams as an operational component of the National Disaster Medi-cal System. While these teams of first responders receive special training, all nurses should know the signs and symp-toms of conditions associated with potential terror threats. Nurses are pivotal in our pre-paredness activities. If you are surprised to be reading about prevention, health literacy, health dispari-ties, and disaster preparedness side-by-side in this publica-tion, you are probably not alone. I am writing about all of these topics because I am a strong proponent of nurses reaching out and expanding their sphere of influence, cre-ating even more opportunities for the profession to improve the health of all people. We need more young people to choose a career in nursing. We need more nurses to develop a broad portfolio of knowledge and inquiry. That multi-sectorial, inter-professional approach leads to innovation. T oday, I am thrilled to continue my collaboration with my friend Dean Ber - nadette Melnyk, who is the university chief wellness of- ficer. I am pleased to join Bern as she helps transform health, healthcare, and lives through outstand-ing col-laborations across The Ohio State University and beyond. In fact, The Ohio State University College of Nursing and Canyon Ranch Institute are already partnering to ad-vance health literacy, improve prevention, honor cultural diversity, apply integrative health, and eliminate health disparities. With my colleagues Jennifer Cabe and Andrew Pleasant, who are both expert in working with health pro-fessionals and the public to advance health literacy and improve prevention around the world, we are starting in-novative new programs and planning new curricula in research, practice, and policy within the College of Nurs-ing and in collaboration with other partners across Ohio, the nation, and in other nations. One of my responsibilities with the College of Nursing is to help students learn to think innovatively and entrepre-neurially about the delivery of healthcare. The healthcare environment is challenging and ever-changing. The reality is that the challenges we face all have multi-disciplinary solutions. Nursing graduates can lead innovation by col-laborating across disciplines to improve healthcare quality and control costs. For my fellow faculty members, I have a few special comments: Y ou hold the future of health in your hands. We must teach our students to take technical knowledge and translate it into language that people can understand, with practical applications they can explain to patients in ways that make good health achievable. We must train our students to move between the realms of science and the everyday reality of patient care. More than any other aspect of life, health impacts everything in our lives, from how children learn, to how productive business can be, to how we maintain our well-being and independence into our senior years. As academic medical leaders, you are help-ing people to achieve and maintain health. During my years as a nurse, a professor, and as Surgeon General of the United States, I had the op-portunity to work with many of you. T oday, I am constantly seeing the results of your dedication. Thank you, and keep up the good work. Richard H. Carmona is dean's distinguished professor of health promotion and entrepreneurship.CenTennIaL The Ohio State Uni-versity College of Nursing looks forward to celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2014! Plans are underway for a year filled with celebrations to honor our students, alumni, faculty, and staff. The Centennial Planning Committee comprises volun-teer alumni, faculty, and staff, who share a passion to honor the college's first 100 years and all of its transformations. Alumni Carol Kennedy-Jones, '67, '70 MS, '79 PhD, and Kitty Kisker, '66, '67 MS, honor - ary co-chairs, originated a framework of ideas in 2010 for the centennial celebration and shared their blueprint with then-Dean Elizabeth Lenz. Lenz asked clinical instructor Diane Sheets to lead the plan-ning for the college. Following Bernadette Melnyk's arrival as dean, Sheets requested a co-chair, with Laurel Van Dromme volunteering. We have organized ourselves with a steering committee and sub-committees focused on events, history, marketing/communications, honoring notable alumni, organizing memorabilia, and volunteers and creating a legacy for future celebrations. Kisker says, \"I was a sophomore student in nursing at the time of the then-School of Nursing's 50th anniversary. I remember the pride I felt in being part of a program that had reached this milestone and had produced so many dedicated nurses who were leaders in the profession! The Centennial provides us a won-derful opportunity to renew friendships with our alumni, to recognize the contributions they have made improving the quality of healthcare, and to look to the many ways our current students will transform healthcare in the future.\" Adds Kennedy-Jones, \"'Time and change' truly cap-tures the essence of Ohio State Nursing's Centennial celebra-tion. Over the past 100 years, Ohio State's nursing program has provided leadership in innovative teaching strategies, research initiatives that have informed the discipline, and service to enhance the com-munity and profession.

Anelise was one of 28 students from 23 different high schools who was selected to attend based on submitted essays, tran-scripts, and teacher recom-mendations. The average GPA of students admitted to the competitive program was 3.6. The majority of students was low-income and received full scholarships from the College of Nursing. \"SIDN is designed to en- hance participant knowledge of nursing career options, heighten student readiness and accessibility to higher education, and increase the prospect of each participant to explore a nursing career,\" explains Jen Robb, coordina- tor for diversity recruitment and retention. During SIDN, participants receive lectures from faculty, staff, students, and nursing professionals, participate in skills labs in the T echnology Learning Complex (TLC), engage in wellness activities, learn about the body donor program, and tour the Wexner Medical Center and The James Cancer Hospital. In addition, the participants re-ceive an overview of university admissions and financial aid, ACT prepara- tion, and tour the Ohio State campus. \"We launched a three- day pilot program in 2009.

Meeting Miss Newton By Bonnie Garvin In the early 1960s, I had just begun a three-year, hospital-based nursing program at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. At that time, the American Nurses Association had adopted a resolution that by 1985 a four-year degree would be required for licensure. So early on, I decided that I must pursue my bachelor's degree in nursing. I arrived in Colum-bus from a small town, Piqua, Ohio, with my meager savings and began prerequisites of anatomy, physiology, microbiol-ogy and the proficiency tests for the nursing program. The School of Nursing\u2014which wouldn't become a col- lege until 1984\u2014held classes at that time in Starling Loving Hall and Hamilton Hall. The setting was crowded and one of my nursing classes was in a hallway connecting two buildings where the seats were on an incline. A new nursing building was planned to open in 1967. Other students and I often sat on the grass outside Hamilton Hall between classes in our white uniforms. We were glad to be outside because the hospital, now Doan Hall, was steaming in the summer before air conditioning was installed. As a nursing stu-dent I tried to be involved in all that the university had to offer. I enjoyed Eng-lish Lit courses and worked very hard in chemistry. I joined Alpha Tau Delta and was inducted into Sigma Theta Tau. I enjoyed breakfast at Freddies' , a restaurant on the corner of 12th Avenue and Neil, where you could pass through at about 7:55 am, get break fast, and still make it to an 8 o'clock lecture in Hamilton Hall. I was eager to graduate and begin my career with my BSN degree. As I was completing my final nursing course with Fran Pease, she asked if I would like to be enrolled in a nurse traineeship program to attend graduate school. Tuition would be paid and I would receive a monthly stipend. This was an offer too good to be refused! I enrolled for fall quarter along with a group of class- mates, many of whom became lifelong friends and col-leagues. Dr. Frieda Shirk was my advisor (who told me I wrote in hieroglyphics!). I conducted a thesis on pain man-agement. Dr. Shirk thought I should have a meeting to get to know the director of the School of Nursing, Miss Mildred Newton. (Even though Miss Newton had a PhD, she insisted on being called \"Miss Newton.\") So I made an appointment several weeks away to meet with her. I was mortified to later learn that I completely had forgotten my appointment with her. How could I reschedule an appointment without look-ing like a fool? Nevertheless, I did, and had that meeting and Miss Newton could not have been kinder or more profes-sional. She asked about my plans to continue my nursing ca-reer by teaching and talked about the future of nursing. This meeting happened about the time that the school moved into...Newton Hall. I was glad that I had the opportunity to talk with this visionary woman\u2014and first director\u2014for whom our brand-new, state-of-the-art building was named. Neither of us knew then that my tenure in Newton Hall on the faculty would span over the next 36 years. Bonnie Garvin is professor emeritus of the College of Nursing.

The But for Ohio State campaign is a $2.5 billion fundrais-ing endeavor of The Ohio State University focused on sustaining and advancing an institution that changes lives. It is scheduled to conclude in June 2016. The College of Nurs- ing has recruited a commit-tee of volunteers to meet a $7,000,000 goal in support of the overall campaign. Gifts towards the campaign have been counted since January 1, 2009, and to date, the College of Nursing has raised more than $4,000,000. Thank you to our donors and for all you have done to help the College advance us towards meeting our goal! Through the campaign, Ohio State will fund five pri-ority areas: Placing students first\u2014The campaign prom-ises a more robust academic program, better places for students to live and learn, and vibrant study abroad oppor - tunities. The College of Nurs-ing will raise money to fund research and evidence-based practice fellowships along with need-based scholarships. Elevating faculty and academic enterprise\u2014At Ohio State, researchers work together to solve the world's most pressing problems. In the process, they patent their discoveries, launching new companies that bring jobs to Ohio. The College of Nurs-ing's goal is to fund new professorships in clinical/translational research and evidence-based practice and identify funding for our cen-ters of excellence. Creating modern learn- ing environments\u2014Through But for Ohio State, the univer - sity will become the national model for innovative campus design to offer buildings conducive for teamwork and productivity. Faculty and staff numbers continue to grow at the college and Dean Melnyk is working with university leadership to determine how the College of Nursing can continue to grow over the coming years and what type of space is needed for the col-lege to flourish. Emboldening our research agenda\u2014Ohio State researchers work across disciplines and team up with industry to solve problems around the globe. But for Ohio State will allow for a wider range of opportunity\u2014which means more major problems solved. Faculty working with private foundations to fund their research and scholarship will help the College of Nurs-ing reach its goal. Driving high-impact innovation\u2014New ideas at Ohio State have big repercus-sions. But for Ohio State sup - ports the university's boldest ipants share Anelise's excite-ment about nursing and Ohio State. All participants either agreed or strongly agreed that the program provided them a better understanding of nurs-ing, increased their knowledge of different educational levels and ways to become a nurse, and strengthened their desire to become a nurse. Y et, participants who yearn to be Buckeye nursing students need more than just a desire to pursue the profes-sion, as high school GPA, class rank, and ACT or SAT scores are factors determining admission to the university. Since students apply to the nursing major during their freshman year, their college coursework GPA and prereq-uisite GPA and essay are also critical factors. The College of Nursing, therefore, provides reunions and mentorship, offering application and financial aid information as students begin applying to college. Since the average overall and prerequisite GPA of students accepted to the BSN program is 3.7, Robb meets with SIDN students regularly during their fresh-man year to ensure that they have the resources to be competitive applicants to the program. SIDN is one of many pro- grams in the College of Nurs-ing that aim to build a diverse pipeline. For students who are unable to attend SIDN, the college provides a shortened one-day program in August, called Future Nurse. In addi-tion, the college collaborates with non-profit organizations, academic units, and OSU's Office of Diversity and Inclu-sion to regularly host diverse groups of elementary and high school students through-out the academic year. During each program, participants interact with nursing ambas-sadors to learn about college and clinical experiences and gain skills in the TLC. Lisa Rohrig, director of the TLC, explains, \"We ensure that prospective students get to jump into nursing through multiple hands-on activi-ties such as listening to heart sounds with a stethoscope, donning sterile gloving, navi-gating through a wheelchair obstacle course and riding the hover mat. These immer - sion activities allow future nurses to experience the tools of nursing and help to ignite their interest in the profes-sion.\" The College of Nursing doesn't just provide one-time experiences to ignite students' interest in nursing as it hosts several groups throughout the year. In 2009, The College of Nursing initiated a partner - ship with academic units and Exploring Learning for Life, a nonprofit organization that enables young adults to gain career skills. Through this col-laboration, 20 to 25 student participants from area high schools interact with faculty, staff, and students within the colleges of Nursing, Optom-etry, Dentistry, Public Health, Medicine, and the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. Participants meet monthly to gain hands-on ex-perience, learn about cutting-edge research within the profession, and acquire ways to prepare for a future career in the healthcare industry. Ashley Thomas, work- force development execu-tive for Exploring Learning for Life, says, \"What sets Ohio State's Health Sciences Exploring Post apart from the rest of our partnerships is the increased quality of re-sources and staff. High school students are eager to return on a monthly basis to gain exposure to a wide variety of medical programs. This post is unique in providing real-world career experiences for students and equipping them with the skills needed to excel personally and professionally in the future.\" Internships are another opportunity for diverse groups of students to engage with the college throughout the year. In 2011, the college collabo-rated with Metro High School, a local STEM-focused (science, technology, engi-neering, mathematics) high school to provide nine students 60 hours of activities for their internships. Interns assisted with research, participated in sophomore level courses, observed labs, viewed videos about nursing and health care inequities, and worked in the TLC. Andrew Bogart's inter - est in nursing peaked as an intern; he consequently participated in SIDN, and emphasized the value of both programs. \"The Metro Intern-ship and Summer Institute for Diversity in Nursing pushed me over the edge in deciding that nursing school was for me. Before these opportuni-ties, all I knew was that I liked biological science and helping people. But I was provided access to the panels of nursing experts, skills lab tutorials, hospital tours, and healthcare discussions necessary to con-vince me to apply for nursing school. T oday was my first day of nursing classes at The Ohio State University, and I can't wait to embark on this three-year journey to earn my BSN and find the nursing specialty right for me.\" Anelise's dream to be- come a part of the College of Nursing was fulfilled when she received her acceptance letter last spring. She was one of three SIDN participants ac-cepted to the college this year. Now, looking back on the program, she identifies how crucial it was to her career path. \"My experience in the Summer Institute for Diver - sity in Nursing was life chang-ing as I decided that nursing was the healthcare profession for my future.\" Jennifer Robb is coordinator for diversity recruitment and retention for the College of Nursing. Explorer Program students from The Ohio State University Health Sciences Post learn about health science careers through interactions with faculty, staff, and students from the colleges of Nursing, Medicine, Dentistry, Optometry, Public Health, and The School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.

The weekend was filled with activities for alumni of all ages. We want to thank all of you who attended and encourage those who didn't to come back to campus for next year's even bigger festivities! Here's a look at some of the weekend's highlights: The class of 1962 cel- ebrated 50 years with a Friday lunch in the Ohio Union, where alumni reconnected with each other and were pre-sented with special medallions by Dean Bernadette Melnyk to mark the occasion. All alumni classes joined the re-union celebrations on Friday afternoon with a tour of the newly renovated Newton Hall lobby, as well as an overview of the T echnology Learning Complex. Our alumni enjoyed learning about the computer-controlled patient simula-tors students use to practice skills in safe environments. Megan Amaya, PhD, direc-tor of health promotion and wellness, presented a continu-ing education class for those interested in incorporating wellness into their work envi-ronment. The class provided an opportunity to learn how to build movement into their work and personal life, eat nutritiously for energy, and manage stress in healthy ways. Friday afternoon pro- gressed with Dean Melnyk giving a State of the College address to alumni and donors, highlighting major accom-plishments of the college in the past year. She also shared her vision for the future, including the development From top left: Class of '62 alumna Dorothy Ayers Stitzlein models her old nursing uniform to her fellow classmates at the class luncheon; Jeri Dechatelet Hancox, '70 and Steve Hancox; tailgate participants on the Newton Hall front lawn enjoy food, drink, camaraderie, and some cheers from The Ohio State University cheerleaders. Through annual support of scholarships, fellowships, profes- sorships and more, we can ensure that nursing students will be poised to deliver excellence in education and research, evidence-based practice and healthcare innovation. Alhagie Jobarteh, a member of the International Dean's List Society, plans to graduate in May 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. Alhagie is a recipient of the College of Nursing Minority Scholarship for the 2012-2013 academic year. After graduation, he plans to work as a bedside nurse and gain experience for a couple years. His goal is to specialize in public health and work with developing nations on public health issues. How has this scholarship made an impact in your life? This scholarship has enabled the continuation of my educa- tion at OSU. Equally as important is the fact I don't have to worry about a lot of miscellaneous items outside of the class-room. The scholarship has lessened the burden of having to struggle to provide for myself which has been compounded by being an international student. In a nutshell, this scholar - ship provides a lifeline for me. What is the best college experience you have had so far? There is no college experience better than enjoying football games at \"the Shoe\"! Additionally, spending time with my friends is always memorable. This past spring, my clini-cal group organized a dinner that will forever linger. These people are my new-found family. What is your advice to students interested in studying nursing at Ohio State? The College of Nursing offers the best quality of nursing education and instills in its students a sense of hard work, commitment, dedication, respect, independence, and profes-sionalism. The faculty at the college are dedicated to their students; striving to prepare them to be the best nurses there are and to become positive contributors of society. T o me, coming to Ohio State is a home away from home.

When asked why she chose to get her degree in nursing, Ulrich stated, \"A nursing degree is a great lifelong career investment with immeasurable and endless return of gratification. Becoming a nurse is one of the best decisions I made in my life and Ohio State has helped me reached this goal.\" Some of Ulrich's early experiences in nursing include be- ing a registered nurse patient care coordinator, a public health nurse specialist, and public health program manager with the Ohio Department of Health and the Franklin County Board of Health. Ulrich developed and managed the Pandemic Influenza Plan for Franklin County at that time. In 2009, Ulrich also served as a consultant for the College of Nursing and developed an elective community-based nursing preparedness for disaster course for senior and graduate nursing students. In July 2009, she was commissioned in the US Public Health Service (USPHS) and Ulrich is now a lieutenant com-mander in the USPHS and is the international health security program analyst in the International Assistance and Response Policy Branch of the Division of International Health Security. She is responsible for developing policy on the operational framework for the deployment of medical personnel and public health subject matter experts and maintaining relevant research and evaluation findings in addition to legislative developments related to her assigned areas. Lastly, Lt. Ulrich provides clinical service and coordinates clinical sustainment at the National Naval Medical Center. Lt. Ulrich said, \"I am proud to be a Buckeye nurse serving the public as a commissioned nurse officer in the United States Public Health Service\" and that she \"hopes to be a great leader and mentor who can perform extraordinary work and inspire others to make an even greater impact.\" With more than 12,000 College of Nursing living alumni, there are many graduates who are deserving of recognition.

We want to con-tinue to bring our alumni together, raise money for scholar -ships, and assist the college students professionally and socially. We provide nutritious snacks at various times of the school year and bring small groups of students together to talk about what it's like in the real world of nursing. I am sure we can all recall the rigors of schoolwork and how great it was to have mentors to show us the way.

New carpet, furniture, and ceiling \"clouds\" of lighting added to the reshaping of the lobby, which is a very popular area for a variety of student, faculty, and staff functions. the renovations were completed in time for Reunion-Homecoming, much to the delight of alumni and students visiting the building that weekend. Newton Hall's third floor also underwent renovation this year, with new walls and carpeting in-stalled. New interior signs for the building will be installed before the end of the year. While the academic quarters-to-semesters conversion has been successfully implemented, the change has taken students, staff, and faculty a bit of time to adjust. t o ease that transition, the college's Office of student Affairs hosted an end-of Quarter Frolic on November 5, recognizing the ten week date when the old quarter would have ended. the lobby of Newton Hall was loud and busy all day with food and PopNoggins\u2014a chance to be video recorded against a green screen with their own faces digi-tally superimposed onto animated bodies performing popular songs.Nursing students from higher education institutions throughout Ohio converged at the College of Nursing in October for the Ohio Nursing students Association Annual Convention. \"Ohio Nursing students shooting for the stars,\" attracted more than 150 active nursing students to Newton Hall. \"the ONsA Board of Direc- tors is very excited to have our annual convention at Ohio state this year,\" said Brandon Pachs, 2011-2012 ONsA President and a junior at Case Western Reserve university Frances Payne Bolton school of Nursing. \"Having the convention in central Ohio provides a convenient location for nursing students throughout the state.\" students participated in a Jeopardy-style \"brain bowl\" competition, learned about profes-sional organizations to join, in-stalled a new statewide board, and participated in American Red Cross blood and bone marrow drives. speakers included Vice Dean usha Menon, PhD, RN, FAAN, and Mary Foley, PhD, RN, and past president of the American Nurses Association and associate direc-tor, Center for Nursing Research and innovation, university of California, san Francisco.

In September, Timothy Landers, PhD, RN, assistant professor of nursing, was one of only 12 nursing educators across the country this year to be named a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Nurse Faculty Scholar. This three-year $350,000 award is designed to promote his academic career by provid-ing mentorship, leadership training, and salary and research support. His research will develop and test an evidence-based protocol for improving hand hygiene among hospitalized patients. His study will determine when and how patients should clean their hands to reduce the presence of the five most common bacteria that cause healthcare-associated infections. The Nurse Faculty Scholars program is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and administered through the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. \"RWJF grants allow us to take these very promising junior faculty and give them release time to really focus on devel-oping themselves as researchers,\" Menon says. \"They're learning about what is hap-pening on the national front. Their finger is on the pulse of some of the innovation that is happening around RWJF.\" Ulti-mately, the college also benefits. Student research funding In newly funded student research, doc-toral and acute-care pediatric nurse prac-titioner student Kristin Greathouse has received NIH support beginning this fall semester for her doctoral work toward her dissertation. Greathouse, who also is a pediatric nurse with intensive care unit experience, will focus her dissertation study on \"Innate immune suppression following acute injury.\" Because children who undergo acute trauma become very susceptible to hospital borne infection such as urinary tract infections, she will work to understand how to improve im-mune function and reduce this suscepti-bility. Using an animal model to observe a population of cells important in resist-ing hospital borne infections, she will study innate immune function following surgical trauma, then test an interven-tion to promote immune function and resistance to infection. NIH funding provides tuition and a monthly stipend to support doctoral stu-dents' commitment to full-time research as they complete their dissertation. \"It's the government's way of funding the next generation of scientists,\" McCar - thy explains. \"We're really pleased to pass through that rigorous peer review process in terms of our doctoral student training, and for the students to receive these awards.\" Greathouse joins three other doc- toral students who already hold similar funding: Rika T anda, Yvonne Clark and Sharon Hill.

Energy sparks research growth These newly funded projects signal a college-wide effort to actively build its research program and grow its national profile. \"We're building, we're pushing, we're growing,\" McCarthy says. Recently recruited faculty attract attention on the national front, as do prominent publica-tions and presentations. In a spiraling climb, a rising profile attracts additional funding, which allows the college to grow as a unit and to fund additional predoc-toral and postdoctoral fellowships. This in turn attracts high-caliber students to train for the future. With a look to the future, Menon says, \"The changing face of healthcare re-quires us as nurse researchers to be agile and nimble and change with the times. It will call for creativity and innovation on our part.\" In her first six months at Ohio State, \"I have seen some real energy around being able to think collaborative-ly and think innovatively about the kind of research that we could do,\" Menon says. \"It's very energizing to see that kind of collaboration and excitement in the college.\" Kathy Baird is a freelance writer based in Columbus.Research Continued from page previous page 50 The Ohio State University College of Nursing1585 Neil Avenue Columbus OH 43210-1216 Address service requestedwww.nursing.osu.eduNON-PROFIT ORG.
