Vaccinations save lives. COVID-19 Vaccines -Key Questions 5Has Operation Warp Speed & the accelerated timeline sacrificed safety? Why should I trust vaccine approval process? Are the new genetic vaccine technologies the same as gene therapy? How do we know the vaccines work? Who was included in the trials? How do we know the vaccines are safe? What side effects should we expect?COVID-19 Vaccines - Info for Clinicians 6Context Science of vaccines Vaccine development & approval process Likely initial vaccines Vaccine distribution planning Vaccine hesitancy & patient conversations Vaccine storage, handling & administration Reporting & tracking adverse eventsCOVID-19 Vaccines: Context 7Overarching goal: interrupting virus transmission First cases recognized early Jan 2020 Global pandemic declared by WHO: 3/11/2020 Genome sequenced by late January 2020 Vaccine work began immediately Current surge: Dec 1, Warp Speed (OWS) goals: deliver 300M doses vaccine, with first doses by Jan 2021Science of Vaccines 8Vaccine immunology basics: Macrophage response Bcell response to virus proteins triggers Ab response Tcell responseVaccine Development Process 9 Vaccine Development Process 10 Accelerated Development Process 11 12 International Vaccine Development https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus vaccinetracker.html13 FDA Approval ProcessFDA Vaccine Approval Process 14FDA Emergency Use Application (EUA) vs Biologics License Application (BLA) Roles of oversight groups: FDA, ACIP https://www.fda.gov/vaccines bloodbiologics/development approval processcber/vaccine development 101Major COVID Vaccines 15Weakened or inactive virus vaccines (NonCOVID) viral vector vaccines Nucleic acid (mRNA, DNA) vaccines Protein based vaccines ASA UpdateonCOVID19VaccineDevelopmentNucleic Acid Vaccines 16 (Pfizer, Moderna)Viral Vector Vaccines 17 (AstraZeneca/Oxford, J&J)Protein-Based Vaccines 20Pfizer/BioNTech -mRNA vaccine, vaccine, single dose -Can be stored in 28C (routine refrigeration) -Rpt'd 70% efficacy What You Need to Know -W A PostPfizer/BioNTech Clinical Trials 21Phase 2/3 Clinical Trials -Started July 27, 2020 in 150 sites in U.S. (39 states) and 5 other countries ->43,000 enrolled, 12yrs & older; 50% saline placebo matched -Enrollees include 42% minorities, ages 5685yo 95% effective against COVID19 after 2nddose 170 COVID infections: 162 in placebo group vs. 8 vaccine group 10 severe COVID cases : 9 in placebo, 1 in vaccinated group -Efficacy consistent across age, gender, R/E demographics -For adults >65 yrs, efficacy >94% -Safety data: from >37,500 enrolled & followed for 2mos, vaccine well tolerated across populations: No serious safety concerns observed Grade 3 adverse events: fatigue (3.8%), HA (2.0%) (Grade 3 = prevents daily activity) Older adults had fewer adverse events22 Pfizer Clinical Trial: Effectiveness \"FDA Review Confirms Safety & Efficacy COVID Vaccine\" -WA Post Dec 202023 Pfizer Clinical Trial: Adverse Reactions \"FDA Review Confirms Safety & Efficacy COVID Vaccine\" -WA Post Dec 2020Moderna Clinical Trials 24Phase 3 Clinical Trials -Started July 27, 2020 ->30,000 enrolled, 50% placebo matched to vaccinees -Enrollees include 37% analysis: 94.5% effective against COVID19 at 28 days after first dose 95 COVID infections: 90 in placebo group vs. 5 vaccine group 11 severe COVID cases : all in placebo group -Efficacy consistent across age, gender, R/E demographics -Efficacy in adults over 65 years of age >94% -Safety data: vaccine well tolerated across all populations with >43,000 enrolled: No serious safety concerns observed Grade 3 adverse events: inj site pain (2.7%), COVID19 Vaccine Plan Priority groups Vaccinator strategy Steps to participate as vaccinator Operational & technical issues Perceived urgency vs. likely vaccine supply26 COVID Vaccine - Phased DistributionCOVID Vaccine - Phased Distribution 27 ACIP COVID19 Vaccines Workgrp - Phased Allocation -D e c 2020 Mtg Slides 28 COVID Vaccine - Phase 1a Groups29Additional Consideration for Phase 1a Limited initial supply means subprioritization needed First supplies to be prioritized within Phase 1a to staff teams in highestrisk units -i . e . -ICUs/ Critical Care Units -EDs -COVID units Implementation of vaccinating clinical staff will need to anticipate / accommodate likely vaccine reaction sx -e.g. may need to vaccinate in staff 'waves' Ongoing safety monitoring critical30COVID Vaccine - Initial Distribution Maine CDC anticipates initial receipt of 12,675 doses of Pfizer vaccine by midDec Vaccine to be prepositioned at key locations around state, pending anticipated FDA EUA approval Initial allocation to sites w/ ultralow temp freezers (975 doses each): -Central Maine Medical Center Lewiston -Maine Medical Center Portland -Northern Light A.
