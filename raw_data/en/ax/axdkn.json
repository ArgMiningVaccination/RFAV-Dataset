One of the latest vaccines to receive emergency use authorization is the Novavax vaccine. While the vaccine has shown promising results in clinical trials, it's important to be aware of the potential side effects before getting vaccinated. What is the Novavax Vaccine? The Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine that uses a small piece of the COVID-19 virus to trigger an immune response. Unlike mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna, the Novavax vaccine does not require ultra-cold storage and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures. What are the Side Effects of the Novavax Vaccine? Like all vaccines, the Novavax vaccine can cause side effects. The most common side effects reported in clinical trials include: - Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site - Fatigue - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Fever These side effects are usually mild to moderate and go away on their own within a few days.
