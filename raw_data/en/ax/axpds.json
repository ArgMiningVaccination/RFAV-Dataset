Nothing's worse than getting unexpectedly sick when you're relaxing on vacation. We know it can be especially scary to travel with COVID-19 still spreading around the world, but that doesn't mean you have to stress out about catching a virus on your trip. You can actually prevent most viruses you'd get from traveling as long as you're careful and hygienic. It may take you a little bit to get used to some new safety precautions, but you'll be able to enjoy your trip a lot more if you stay healthy! Steps Assessing Your Health and Safety - 1Check for any known viral risks at your destination before you leave. As of August 2021, there's still a high risk of COVID-19 throughout the world, but there may be other viruses specific to where you're traveling. Find the location where you're going on the CDC website and read through the current travel health notices so you know what to expect. [[1]](#_note-1)X Research source - You can find a list of countries and known health concerns by area here: [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) - You can find a list of countries and known health concerns by area here: - 2See a doctor 4-6 weeks before you plan on leaving. When you make an appointment with your doctor, let them know where you plan on going so they can give you some health advice. Your doctor will discuss the health risks in the area and give you general guidelines to follow. They may also prescribe a preventative medication depending on what illnesses you could possibly get. [[2]](#_note-2)X Research source - For example, your doctor may start you on an anti-malaria medication a few weeks before your trip so you don't contract it later on. - 3Get vaccinations if they're required for your destination. You've likely gotten some of the vaccinations before, but you may need a booster shot if it's been a while. Some common illnesses you may get vaccines for include tetanus, measles, polio, and the flu. You may also need to get vaccines for hepatitis A and B, meningococcal, and typhoid. [[3]](#_note-3)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine [Go to source](#) - We know that getting a shot might be scary for you, but do your best to relax. It will keep you healthier in the long run. - You may need specific vaccines to even get into a country. For example, you'll need a yellow fever vaccine to enter many South American and African countries. You can find all the vaccines you need for a country here: [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list). - The CDC doesn't recommend traveling until you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. As of August 2021, many countries may not allow you to enter unless you are vaccinated or have recently tested negative for COVID.

If you haven't already gotten the COVID-19 vaccine, try to get it before your trip. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - 4Reconsider traveling if you're older or have underlying medical conditions. While it's exciting to travel, it's much more important that you stay safe and healthy. As you get older, your immune system gets weaker and may not prevent sickness as well as it used to. You may also be more at risk of catching a virus if you have serious heart conditions or are immunocompromised. When you see your doctor, ask them if they think it's safe for you to travel and listen to their advice. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source Advertisement - Since COVID-19 is currently a worldwide concern and highly contagious, you should try to avoid traveling unless you absolutely need to. If possible, wait on traveling until you are fully vaccinated. [[7]](#_note-7)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - If you do choose to travel without being vaccinated for COVID-19, be sure to get tested before you travel. Wear an N93 mask and avoid large crowds so you're less likely to get sick. Always be on the lookout for signs of COVID so you can get medical help when you start feeling sick. - Since COVID-19 is currently a worldwide concern and highly contagious, you should try to avoid traveling unless you absolutely need to. If possible, wait on traveling until you are fully vaccinated. Staying Safe in Transit - 1Book a seat by the window instead of near the aisle. Some studies have shown that you'll be exposed to more germs when you sit in an aisle seat on a plane. Look for a ticket early so you're more likely to find a window seat. While it might be a little inconvenient, you won't have to deal with multiple people walking past you. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source - 2Wear a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Since coronavirus can spread even when people are just talking, you'll want to cover your nose and mouth so you're less likely to catch it. [[9]](#_note-9)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#)Find a mask that's double-layered and fits tightly over your face. Whenever you're in public and around other people, put on your mask. [[10]](#_note-10)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - You should still try to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from other people even when you wear a mask. - Don't touch your mask while you're wearing it since you may contaminate it. - Wearing a mask also helps protect other people if you're feeling sick. - 3Bring hand sanitizer with you to stay disinfected. You're exposed to a lot of germs at airports and train stations, so it's important to keep your hands clean. Since you won't always have access to wash your hands, keep a bottle of hand sanitizer in a carry-on bag. Rub the sanitizer on your hands until it dries completely.

During the time of COVID-19, you may encounter social distancing measures when you're traveling. Pay attention to markings on the ground that tell you where to stand so you stay about 6 feet (1.8 m) away from other people. Look for any additional signage to make sure that you stay safe.

While airline or transit employees probably sanitized them, it's better to be safe than sorry. When you get to your seat, use some disinfecting wipes to clean around your seat. Wipe any flat surfaces that are commonly touched. Make sure you use some hand sanitizer when you're finished to get rid of any bacteria on your hands. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source Advertisement - You can bring any amount of disinfecting wipes in a carry-on bag.

Keeping Healthy on Your Trip - 1Wash your hands frequently. We touch so many things throughout the day that our hands can get covered in bacteria and viruses even if you can't see them. Whenever you leave a public place, use the bathroom, or are about to eat, take time to wash your hands. [[17]](#_note-17)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#)Rinse your hands under running water and scrub them with hand soap for at least 20 seconds. Make sure to work the soap between your fingers and on the backs of your hands as well. [[18]](#_note-18)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - You can use hot or cold water when you wash your hands. - If you have trouble remembering how long to wash your hands, sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice in a row. - 2Use hand sanitizer or wipes if you aren't able to wash your hands. You may run into a few times where you can't access clean water, so carry hand sanitizer or cleaning wipes made with at least 60% alcohol. Rub your hands together until the sanitizer evaporates completely, which should only take around 20 seconds. [[19]](#_note-19)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Hand sanitizer won't work well if your hands are visibly dirty or greasy. - 3Avoid touching your face. As we mentioned, your hands have a lot of contaminants on them that can easily get into your body. Do your best to limit how much you touch your face, especially around your eyes, nose, and mouth. If you really need to, wash your hands before and after so you're less likely to contract a virus. [[20]](#_note-20)X Research source - 4Use saline spray to moisturize your nasal passages. Keeping your mucous membranes moist can help reduce your risk of sinus infections. [[21]](#_note-21)X Research source [Purchase saline nose drops or nasal spray from your pharmacy to bring on the trip, and use it daily according to the instructions on the package.](#) - You can also moisturize the outside of your nostrils with petroleum jelly, but be cautious about putting it in your nose. In rare cases, it can end up in your lungs and cause dangerous inflammation. [[22]](#_note-22)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - If you make your own saline solution, only use boiled or distilled water to ensure there are no bacteria. - You can also moisturize the outside of your nostrils with petroleum jelly, but be cautious about putting it in your nose. In rare cases, it can end up in your lungs and cause dangerous inflammation. - 5Limit close contact with other people. Viruses can spread quickly between people and in cases like COVID-19, you may catch it even if the person isn't showing symptoms. Try to stay by yourself or only with the people you traveled with throughout most of your trip. When you do go out into public, leave about 6 feet (1.8 m) between you and other groups of people. Unless you have to, try to avoid enclosed spaces with a lot of people, like public transportation. [[23]](#_note-23)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Do your best to avoid large crowds, especially if you haven't been vaccinated yet. - 6Get a good amount of sleep so your body has time to rest. You get stressed out when you don't sleep, and that could make your immune system weaker. Plan your activities accordingly so you get at least 6-8 hours of sleep every day so your body has time to recover and heal after a long day. If you need to, take a few short naps throughout the day when you feel exhausted so you can recoup. [[24]](#_note-24)X Research source Advertisement - A week before you take your trip, try shifting the times when you go to sleep and wake up so you're used to the time difference at your destination. [[25]](#_note-25)X Research source - A week before you take your trip, try shifting the times when you go to sleep and wake up so you're used to the time difference at your destination. Enjoying Food and Drinks Safely - 1Eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked. While it's tempting to try all the new dishes at your destination, foodborne illnesses are really common if they aren't prepared properly. Avoid meat, vegetables, and dairy products that are raw or undercooked since you could easily catch a bug from them. If you want to enjoy raw fruits or vegetables, make sure they're washed with clean water and peeled. [[26]](#_note-26)X Research source - For example, it's okay to eat a raw banana since you're not eating the outer peel. However, you may want to avoid salads, grapes, and berries unless you know everything was washed. [[27]](#_note-27)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Even dairy products like ice cream can be dangerous if the milk wasn't pasteurized beforehand. - For example, it's okay to eat a raw banana since you're not eating the outer peel. However, you may want to avoid salads, grapes, and berries unless you know everything was washed. - 2Avoid food from street vendors or buffets. Foods from street vendors can smell really delicious, but they usually aren't the safest to eat. Many vendors and buffets let their food sit at room temperature, so it's possible that they have viruses or bacteria that could make you sick. Only enjoy food that's fresh and still hot when it's served. [[28]](#_note-28)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - 3Stay hydrated with bottled water throughout your entire trip. Fresh water flushes a lot of undesirable things out of your body, so make sure you drink a lot of water while you're traveling. The amount of water you'll need depends on a lot of things, like your age, sex, and the climate where you're staying, but have some water whenever you're feeling thirsty. [[29]](#_note-29)X Research source - You'll need more water if you're doing more physical activities or staying in a hotter climate. - 4Avoid drinking unfiltered water if there are known water-borne illnesses. In some countries, tap water might still contain harmful viruses or bacteria. Never have water from a tap unless it's been purified first. You can also still safely enjoy canned or bottled drinks as long as their seals aren't broken beforehand. When you're in the shower, keep your mouth closed so you don't accidentally swallow any water. [[30]](#_note-30)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Ask for drinks without ice cubes since they're commonly made with tap water and you may get sick from them. - Use bottled water when you brush your teeth. - 5Boil water before you drink it if it's not safe from the tap. Some developing countries don't have safe water directly from the tap. Before you drink tap water, put it in a pot and heat it to a boil first. Let the water boil for at least 3 minutes to kill any harmful viruses. When you're finished, let the water cool before using it. [[31]](#_note-31)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) Advertisement - Alcoholic beverages won't kill viruses in contaminated water or ice. Protecting Yourself from Mosquitoes - 1Wear loose-fitting clothing that covers your skin. Mosquitoes bite any skin you leave exposed, so try to cover as much as you can with your clothing. Pick clothes that are a little baggier than what you normally wear since mosquitoes will have a harder time reaching your skin that way. [[32]](#_note-32)X Research source - Common illnesses that mosquitoes carry include malaria, Zika virus, yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya virus. - 2Avoid wearing perfume. Even if you want to smell your best, the sweet scent might attract more mosquitoes to you. If you're traveling to an area where mosquito-borne illnesses are really common, you may want to leave your perfume at home or back where you're staying. [[33]](#_note-33)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine [Go to source](#) - 3Spray insect repellent to deter pests. Look for an insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus since they're the most effective. Spray the repellent on your clothes and any exposed skin to keep mosquitoes away from you. Follow the directions on the bottle and make sure you put more repellent on after a few hours or if you notice mosquitoes biting you.

[[37]](#_note-37)X Research source - Avoid putting repellent near your eyes, mouth, or any open wounds. - 4Stay in an area that has mosquito nets or screens. While it's easy for you to avoid mosquitoes when you're awake, you become really vulnerable when you're sleeping. Make sure the place where you're staying has a mosquito net over your bed and windows have screens so you don't let any pests inside. [[38]](#_note-38)X Research source Advertisement - Run air conditioning if you can since it will keep mosquitoes outside.
