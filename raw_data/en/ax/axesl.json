It is administered through the intravenous route at a dosage of 25-75 grams. It is a form of targeted treatment that has been proven to eliminate cancerous cells for all cancer patients. Studies have shown that cancerous cells differ from normal cells for the following reasons: - Unable to use oxygen to convert glucose into energy. - Lack catalase enzyme and therefore cannot change hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water and oxygen. High-dosage Vitamin C (Megadose) will result in hydrogen peroxide as free radicals which are toxic to cancerous cells. Therefore, Megadose can destroy these cells without harming normal cells that contain catalase enzyme. It also strengthens the immune system of the body by increasing the lymphocyte white blood cell production. It reduces the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, killing the cancer-causing virus by accelerating the activity of white blood cells to feed on these cancer-causing parasites in the body. High dose vitamin C is also known as Megadose. It is administered through the intravenous route at a dosage of 25-75 grams. It is a form of targeted treatment that has been proven to eliminate cancerous cells for all cancer patients. Benefits - High-dosage Vitamin C prevented metastasis and the growth of cancerous cells for prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, brain cancer and other types of cancer. - The use of high-dosage Vitamin C in conjunction with certain types of chemotherapy and radiotherapy yielded greater efficacy than using chemotherapy alone to eliminate cancerous cells for ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and brain cancer. - Helping to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy - Helping to increase the survival rates for cancer patients and improve their quality of life - Reduces the levels of copper and iron minerals in the body. (Copper is a stimulus to create blood vessels to feed cancer cells and iron stimulates the process of inflammation which supports cancer cells. - Acts as a pro-oxidant to induce free radicals that has a negative effect on cancer cells. Side effects, risks and advice The use of high-dosage Vitamin C has very few side-effects according to clinical studies. However, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD Deficiency), are advised to avoid high-dosage Vitamin C as this may cause the red blood cells to rupture. In addition, patients with kidney disease or kidney failure should also avoid this therapy as it may cause kidney stone disease. Apart from that, patients are normally advised to have approximately 1.5 - 2 liters of water each day during and after the Megadose therapy. "}
