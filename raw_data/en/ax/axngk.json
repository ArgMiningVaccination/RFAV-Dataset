The following are some of the therapies for which limited data suggest some benefit exists. Mind and body practices (Yoga, tai chi, qi gong, breathing exercises) Yoga can improve quality of life in patients with asthma and COPD. In those with COPD, there is research to suggest that it may increase a person's lung function and exercise capacity. How long these benefits can last is unknown. Tai chi and qi gong in patients with COPD can also improve exercise capacity and quality of life just as is seen with other types of exercise. Breathing exercises appear to be safe for people with COPD. Yoga breathing, pursed lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing have been shown to improve the distance walked in six minutes by an average of 35 to 50 meters in research studies. Effects of breathing exercises on shortness of breath and well-being vary from person to person. They do not add much benefit to a person who is already taking part in a regular exercise program. Mindfulness (paying attention, on purpose to the present moment) and Meditation People with asthma who practice mindfulness may have improvement in quality of life and reduction in stress. Mind-body interventions (mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, and relaxation) can reduce anxiety and depression and can improve fatigue in those with COPD, cancer, and anxiety. Acupressure/Acupoint-TENS/Acupuncture These treatments from Chinese medicine involve pressure (acupressure) or electrical stimulation (Acupoint-TENS) or needles that puncture the skin (acupuncture) Integrative and Complementary Medicine for the Lungs Am J Respir Crit Care Med Vol. 195, P21-22, 2017 Online version updated Novem ber 2021 ATS Patient Education Series \u00a9 201 7 American Thoracic SocietyThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health defines integrative medicine as bringing together conventional (usual or mainstream care or \"Western\" medicine) with complementary traditional/ancient medical treatments in a coordinated way. In the United States, an estimated 38 percent of adults (about 4 in 10) and 12 percent of children (about 1 in 9) are using some form of complementary medicine. Sixty percent of people with cancer take two or more dietary supplements daily.Mindfulness and Meditation Breathing Exercises Movement Yoga Tai Chi Supplements Herbs VitaminsDiet and Nutrition 'food PATIENT EDUCATION | INFORMATION SERIES www.thoracic.orgapplied at energy channels of the body, called meridians. Acupressure and Acupoint-TENS can help relieve shortness of breath in some people with COPD or cancer. Acupressure can improve lung function, some markers of inflammation and/or symptom control in people with asthma. How long the benefit lasts is not known. When acupuncture needles are inserted too deeply into a person's chest, there is a risk of pneumothorax (lung collapse). If you are on blood thinner medications, please discuss the risks and benefits of acupuncture treatment with your healthcare provider due to the risk of bleeding from needle sites. Acupuncture can improve quality of life and lessen shortness of breath in those with COPD. Natural Supplements Limited data exists on the be nefits of natural products for those with lung disease or lung problems. Probiotic use has been found to have several potential benefits in lung-related condi tions. Probiotics have been associate d with fewer cases of pneumonia while on a mechanical ventilator. Probiotics may help reduce lung infections in healthy and hospitalized children, as well as shorten the length of time a person suffers from the common cold. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fish intake can be associated with a lower risk of death from COPD. Some herbs reduce inflammation and are used to help with cough (such as ginger, curcumin, peppercorns, turmeric). The spices are added with honey, basil, and/ or almonds in lukewarm water . Before taking any natural supplements or herbs, please consult with your pri mary care provider, lung specialist, or integrative medi cine clinician to ensure that these supplements are appropriate for you to take. Other mind body practices such as osteopathic and chiropractic manipulation lack strong data to support their regular use among those with lung disease. For therapies lacking strong research evidence, it's important to weigh any risks and costs with the expected benefits to decide if it is worth using. For instance, those on blood thinners may have adverse reactions with some natural supplements and acupuncture. Natural products may contain similar active ingredients as medicines prescribed by your doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Therefore, it is important to discuss complementary therapies with your primary care provider. Having providers of both complementary and conventional approaches communicate with you and who can work together on putting together a personalized, safe, and eff ective approach for you is important. Health insurance plans are beginning to cover some complementary therapies so it is important to find out whether something you are considering is covered. Always consult with your primary care provider first before adding or starting complementary therapies into your care plan, and consider consulting with an integrative medicine physician to ensure that a safe and effective personalized integrative health program can be developed for you.
