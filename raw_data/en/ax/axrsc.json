The Greater Los Angeles/Orange County Chapter of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America would like to put the spotlight on patients, family members, and others, who wish to share their inspiring stories about their challenges and successes dealing with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, their volunteer Work for CCFA, or the importance of their participation in CCFA events. In this issue, CCFA is putting the spotlight on Sadie Hersh, and Brenna Lutzky. If you'd like to share your story, please complete the Spotlight On... [form](http://online.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/site/R?i=HZTyvt74XrpsJwk7q2rl-BrV7gkqgfRBewHOemLAMXpdyy4PD_y9Tw). Sadie Hersh My name is Sadie Hersh, and I'm 13-years old, (Sadie is on the left in the picture with her twin sister Molly, and their parents.) Last summer, I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. On October 30, 2010, I celebrated my b'not mitzvah with my twin sister Molly, and in memory of our grandfather, Jack Cooper, who also had Crohn's Disease, we chose to support the CCFA and the Pediatric IBD Center at Cedars-Sinai as our mitzvah project. We will continue to support the CCFA and Cedars-Sinai in an ongoing effort to help find a cure for Crohn's and colitis, as it is a cause that is very close to my heart. Brenna Lutzky My name is Jennifer Lutzky, and my younger daughter [Brenna](http://online.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/site/R?i=HGfuF_EV6AE2_PfoU1eZrIEu4tvPw4Ga9QcJnMlZpKlXWsJjJH6UGA) was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in March 2010, at seven years old. Her disease was aggressive and resistant to medication, and she needed surgery to remove her colon in June 2010. Last July, while poking around on the CCFA website, I saw the Team Challenge page. I never realized you didn't have to RUN a half-marathon -- you could WALK! This would be a great way to get in shape while also raising money for a cause which was suddenly very important to me and my family. I was late joining the team, and I had already missed a few training sessions and all of the info meetings, fundraising clinics, etc. But I showed up for training the next Sunday morning. Despite my late start, the training provided by Team Challenge was all I needed to prepare. My first half-marathon was a complete success! My initial goal was just to finish, but I was able to complete the race in much less time than I had expected. And I raised enough money for CCFA to make National Fundraising VIP! I had so much fun training and walking the race, and met so many wonderful people along the way, that I am thrilled to be able to join Team Challenge again for this summer's season. I was touched to have my daughter selected as an Honored Teammate -- I hope you will find her as inspirational as I do! Women of Distinction Luncheon CCFA Greater Los Angeles/ Orange County Education Programs 2011 We started the year off with a fun bowling trip for kids and teens with Crohn's and UC.

On January 23, 2011 we held our second OC Youth Club at Anaheim Ice. 14 children and their families came out to enjoy the support of one another, it was amazing to see children who had not been feeling well get on the ice and learn how to ice skate! On January 18th we held our first parent support group in Orange County, this group meets in Rancho Santa Margarita the third Monday of every month. This group is an excellent opportunity for parents to get together and share thoughts and ideas. For more information about either of these groups contact Joslynn at [jsielaff@ccfa.org](mailto:jsielaff@ccfa.org). This past year has been full of growth for CCFA in Orange County.

New Fact Sheet: Pill Swallowing Techniques for Youth Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are long-term diseases. This means that people with these conditions may need to take medication for the rest of their lives. While not every person with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis will be on medication all of the time, most people will require therapy most of the time. Sometimes kids, teens and adults have a hard time swallowing pills. We wrote this fact sheet to teach you some ways to help you swallow those pills. [Download the "}
