Still, fewer people know that the benefits of chiropractic care go far beyond neck and back pain relief. Regular chiropractic care will restore joint function and range of motion, encourage spinal health, support your nervous system, and offer more benefits such as stress relief. However, in addition to supporting the nervous system, chiropractic care has been shown to boost the immune system as well. Previously, we have discussed more in-depth the various benefits of chiropractic care. Here at Atlas Total Health Chiropractic, we not only specialize in treating accident victims but also believe in benefiting overall wellbeing, including strengthening the immune systems of our patients so they may remain in optimal health. We use all-natural treatments such as spinal adjustments and correction, massage therapy, and decompression to promote overall health. Below we will discuss how chiropractic care will help your immune system and keep you in optimal health. The immune system's primary role is to protect the body and fight against infectious organisms. Your immune system keeps your body healthy and functioning at its maximum potential by preventing illness. If the immune system is compromised, we tend to get sick or have trouble fighting off illnesses and infections. The immune system is made out of organs, white blood cells, tissues, and proteins that work together to keep you healthy. The immune system prevents disease and infections and helps you recover from illness or injury. If the immune system is compromised, you may commonly experience conditions such as seasonal colds, the flu, asthma, allergies, autoimmune issues, and other illnesses. Regular chiropractic treatment can boost your immune system to ensure that you remain in optimal health and recover quickly from any potential illnesses or injuries. The immune system and nervous system work together to allow the body to function at its best. Both bodily systems work together by releasing hormones and messengers to communicate with each other and other internal bodily organs. The nervous system sends information from the brain to the body and can directly influence immune system receptors. The brain can use nerve cells to directly communicate with the immune system and trigger an immune response. Conversely, the immune system can send signals to the brain informing it if there are any foreign invaders in the body so the brain can direct the nervous system on how to react. Moreover, the central nervous system is linked to both the thymus and bone marrow, the regions in which immune system cells are produced. The central nervous system is also linked to the lymph nodes and spleen where immune system cells are stored. Medical research has found that an immune response is related to increase brain cell activity, and when antibodies are at their highest, the brain is more active. After receiving chiropractic treatment, studies have shown increased levels of antibodies in the immune system of patients after only one adjustment. In addition, many patients have reported symptom relief from sore throats, congestion, colds, and other viruses after receiving an adjustment from a chiropractor. This is because when vertebrae become misaligned, interference to nerve impulses occur which reduce the functioning of the nervous system. Chiropractors may help you improve your immune system by providing chiropractic adjustments that indirectly boost a patient's immune system. Several studies have linked the immune system, endocrine system, and nervous system. These systems share messenger molecules that communicate throughout the body. Information gathered from one bodily system is shared with other bodily systems to create optimal bodily responses for healing and adaptation. When one system is not functioning properly, other systems will be impaired. For example, a misaligned spine may impair the nervous system's functionality, impairing the immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illnesses. Chiropractic care is founded on the premise that proper nerve function is essential to regulating optimal body function. By releasing stress on the nervous system, the immune system is able to function more effectively from chiropractic care. This has been supported by numerous studies, such as: Atlas Total Health Chiropractic has over 20 years of experience helping patients recover from injuries and accidents.
