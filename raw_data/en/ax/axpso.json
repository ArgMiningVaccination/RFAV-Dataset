When these forces are in balance, the body is healthy. Energy, called \"qi\" (pronounced \"chee\") flows along specific pathways, called meridians, throughout the body. This constant flow of energy keeps the yin and yang forces balanced. However, if the flow of energy gets blocked, like water getting stuck behind a dam, the disruption can lead to pain, lack of function, or illness. Acupuncture therapy can release blocked qi in the body and stimulate function, evoking the body's natural healing response through various physiological systems. Modern research has demonstrated acupuncture's effects on the nervous system, endocrine and immune systems, cardiovascular system, and digestive system. By stimulating the body's various systems, acupuncture can help to resolve pain, improve sleep, balance hormones, benefit digestion, and create a sense of well-being. Acupuncture improves the body's functions and promotes the natural self-healing process by stimulating specific acupoints. The most common method used to stimulate acupoints is the insertion of fine, sterile needles into the skin. Pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation may further enhance the effects. TCM therapy may also include: soft-tissue release techniques, moxibustion or heat therapy, cupping, and the application of topical herbal medicines and liniments.

Cupping Cupping is an accessory technique, to acupuncture, that uses small glass cups as suction devices. They are placed on the skin to break up stagnation by drawing congested blood, or other toxins to the surface. Once suctioned, the cups are left in place for 15 minutes while the patient rests. Sliding Cupping Slide cupping is a variation of cupping that produces a stronger sensation. Before placing the cups, we apply oil to the skin, which allows us to glide them over the targeted area. This is typically recommended for those with chronic back pain, and for athletes who have regular muscle tension. Gua sha Gua sha is an accessory technique, to acupuncture, that involves scraping the skin with a porcelain spoon to reduce muscle tension and pain. It may cause a light \"bruising,\" like that of cupping. This is not a bruise, however, but rather \"sha\" which is an indication that the treatment is effective. Gua sha is best for pain in smaller areas of the body, such as the neck and elbows. This treatment is beneficial for those with carpal tunnel syndrome, or those who sit for long periods of time during the day. Herbal medicine Herbal formulas are used in conjunction with acupuncture to compound the results, and to restore your body to health. Chinese herbal formulas contain mostly plants. Some of them you are probably familiar with like ginger, mint, mulberry and ginseng. Although Chinese herbs are safe for most, we always consider herb-drug interactions when recommending formulas to patients. Moxibustion Moxibustion, or moxa, is a warming therapy that uses a Chinese herb to increase circulation and decrease water retention. The moxa is light like an incense and placed near the surface of the skin. Moxa is often used to soothe menstrual cramps and reduce bruising or inflammation from trauma. This is performed in addition to acupuncture, for patients who are applicable. E-stim Electric stimulation applies a pulsating electrical current through the acupuncture needles to generate blood flow to certain areas of the body. By stimulating blood flow to injured tissues, we can increase the rate of healing. Electric stimulation is most effective on acute injuries, such as pulled muscles, strains, and sprains. How To Prepare for your Acupuncture Appointment Eat within 4 hours of your treatment; make sure you are adequately hydrated, as well. Refrain from caffeine and alcohol before your treatment. Wear loose fitting clothing to the treatment. You can also bring clothes to change into. Provide a copy of any recent lab results that pertain to your condition, or general health. Also, provide a list of any medications you are currently taking. Traditional Chinese Medicine is a great compliment to allopathic medicine, but it is still important for us to be up to date on any pharmaceuticals, and supplements, that you are taking. "}
