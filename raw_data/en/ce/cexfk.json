A small business economic impact statement has been prepared under ch apter 19.85 RCW. Small Business Economic Impact Statement SUMMARY OF PROPOSED RULES : The department of social and health services' children's administration (CA) is proposing amendments to chapters 388-145, 388-147, and 388-148 WAC, licensing requirement for group care facili - ties, child placing agencies an d adoption serv ices, and child foster homes. DLR licensing requirements were amended on January 11, 2015. Since the release[,] foster parents, DSHS agency staff, group care facilities, an d child placing agencies have requested additional changes. The intent of the proposed WAC revisions are to provide foster parents, department staff, group care facilities, an d child placing agencies addi - tional clarification on the licen sing process and requirements. The proposed amendments to this chapter include, but are not limited to: The definition of \"child,\" \"c hildren,\" or \"youth\" will be revised to no longer include up to twenty-one years of age and pursuing a high school or equivalency course of study (GED/HSEC), or vocational program. An exception to the group car e and child placing agency staff qualifications is being implemented. New requirement for reporting incidents involving chil - dren. Additional clarification regarding bedroom sharing requirements. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children contact number has been added for foster parents and agencies to call when there is a child missing from care. This change is due to the new federal legislation require - ment; Public Law 113-183 The Preventing Sex Traffick - ing and Strengthening Families Act that goes into effect on September 29, 2016. New requirements for infa nt safe sleep procedures. Home schooling is being prohibited in licensed foster homes. Additional clarification on weapon storage in foster homes. Other language or housekeeping edits have been made. SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT (SBEIS)\u2014DETERMINATION OF NEED : Chapter 19.85 RCW, the Regulatory Fairness Act, requires that the economic impact of proposed regulations be analyzed in relation to small businesses. The statute defines small businesses as those business entities that employ fifty or fewer people and are independently owned and operated. These proposed rules impact child placing agencies and adoption services and group car e facilities. These businesses fall under the child group foster homes designation by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes (#623990). Preparation of an SBEIS is required when a proposed rule has the potential of placing a disproportionate economic impact on small businesses. The statute outlines information that must be included in an SBEIS. CA has analyzed the proposed rule amendments and has determined that small businesses will not be disproportion - ately impacted by these changes. There are no additional costs to child placing agencies or group care facilities with the implementation of the WAC revisions noted above. INDUSTRY ANALYSIS : DLR, CA, is responsible for the development and regulatory oversight of all licensing requirements for child placing agencies and group residential facilities per chapter 74.15 RCW. As part of their monitoring, DLR keeps a current internal da ta base that identifies all affected small businesses. Most of the child placing agen cies and facilities with whom CA contracts are considered to be small businesses employing fewer than fifty staff. These proposed rules impact the licensing of child placing agencies and adoption services and group care facilities. INVOLVEMENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES : DLR involved child placing agencies licensing staff, tribes, and group resi - dential care stakeholders. An e- mail survey was sent out to the two hundred thirty-one child placing agencies or group care facilities licensed by DLR statewide. These small busi - nesses were asked whether or not the implementation of the proposed WAC revision would cause additional costs to either the child placi ng agency or group care facility. All of the agencies that responded indi cated that there would not be additional costs. COST OF COMPLIANCE : Under RCW 19.85.020, CA has considered annual costs to sm all businesses that are fifty dol - lars or more per child served annually. General Costs : DLR's analysis rev ealed that there are no costs imposed by the prop osed amendments. An e-mail survey was sent out to the two hundred thirty-one child plac - ing agencies or group care facilities that DLR licenses state - wide. Out of two hundred thirty-one e-mails sent, twenty-three responses were received and one hundred percent reported that the implementa tion of the proposed WAC revi - sion would not cause any additional cost to the group care facilities. Benefits for Proposed Rules : The proposed WAC revi - sions for chapters 388-145, 388-147, and 388-148 WAC will provide foster parents, DSHS staff, child placing agency staff, and group care staff furt her clarification on the licens - ing process and the minimum licensing requirements. It will also create some new additional requirements for the safety and well-being of children. JOBS CREATED OR LOST : We do not anticipate that jobs will be lost or created as a result of these rules. CONCLUSION : DLR, CA has given careful consideration to the impact proposed rules in chapters 388-145, 388-147, and 388-148 WAC would have on small businesses. To com - ply with the Regulatory Fair ness Act, chapter 19.85 RCW, DLR has analyzed impacts on small businesses and there is no cost to child placing agenci es or group care facilities with the proposed WAC amendments.

Purpose of the Proposal a nd Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The 2015-2017 biennium budgets provided funding to develop eight commu - nity respite beds for adults with developmental disabilities for the provision of short-term community-based planned respite services across the state as an alternative to using respite services in an institutional setting. Additionally, the budget funded eight enhanced re spite beds across the state for children for the purpose of providing families and caregivers a break and an opportunity for behavioral stabilization for children.

The stumpage values in subsection (2) of this rule for the designated stumpage value areas are adjusted for various logging and harvest conditions, subject to the following: (a) No harvest adjustment is allowed for special forest product s, chipwood, or small logs. (b) Conifer and hardwood stumpage value rates cannot be adju sted below one dollar per MBF. (c) Except for the timber yarded by helicopter, a single log ging condition adjustment applies to the entire harvest unit. The taxpayer must use the logging condition adjustment class that applies to a major ity (more than 50%) of the acre - age in that harvest unit. If the harvest unit is reported over more than one quarter, all quar ter ly returns for that harvest unit must report the same logging condition adjustment. The helicopter adjustment applies only to the timber volume from the harvest unit that is yarded from stump to landing by heli - copter. (d) The volume per acre adjustment is a single adjust - ment class for all quarterly returns reporting a harvest unit. A harvest unit is established by th e harvester prior to harvest - ing. The volume per acre is determined by taking the volume log ged from the unit excluding the volume reported as chip - wood or small logs and dividing by the total acres logged. To tal acres logged does not include leave tree areas (RMZ, UMZ, forested wetlands, etc.,) over 2 acres in size.(e) A domestic market adjustment applies to timber which meet the following criteria: (i) P ublic timber - Harvest of timber not sold by a com - petitive bidding process that is prohibited under the authority of stat e or federal law from fo reign export may be eligible for the domestic market adjustment.

April 25, 2016 Kevin Dixon Rules Coordinator AMENDATORY (Amending WSR 10-10-030, filed 4/26/10, effective 5/27/10) WAC 458-20-190 Sales to and by the United States and certain entities create d by the United States \u2014Doing business on federal reservations\u2014Sales to foreign gov - ernments. (1) Introduction. Federal law prohibits (( Wash - ington )) states from directly imposing taxes (( upon )) on the United States. Persons doing bus iness with the United States , however, are (( nonetheless )) subject to the taxes imposed by the state of Washington, unless sp ecifically exempt. This rule explains the tax reporting responsibilities of persons making sales to the United States and to foreign governments. The rule also explains the tax reporting responsibilities of persons engaging in business activities within federal reservations and cleaning up radioactive wast e and other by-products of weapons production for the United States. ((Persons engaged in construction, installation, or improvement to real property of or for the United States should also refer to )) (a) Other rules that may be relevant. (i) WAC 458-20-17001 (( ())Government contracting(( , etc.). Persons building, repairin g, or improving streets, roads, and other transportation facilities, which are owned by the United States should also refer to ))\u2014Construction, installa - tions, or improvements to government real property. (ii) WAC 458-20-171 (( ())Building, repairing or improv - ing streets, roads, etc.(( ). Persons selling cigarettes to the United States or any other federal entity should also refer to)), which are owned by a municipal corporation or political subdivision of the state or by th e United States and which are used primarily for foot or vehicular traffic. (iii) WAC 458-20-178 Use tax and the use of tangible personal property. (iv) WAC 458-20-186 (( ())Tax on cigarettes(( ))). (b) Examples. This rule provides examples that identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These exam - ples should be used only as a general guide. The tax results of other situations must be determined after a review of all the facts and circumstances . (2) \"United States\" defined. (a) For the purposes of this rule, the term \"United States\" means the federal government, including the executive, legis - lative, and judicial branches, its departments, and federal entities exempt from state or local taxation by (( reason of )) specific federal statutory exemption. The mere fact that an entity is a federal entity, such as an instrumentality or a federal corporation, does not mean that the entity is immune from tax. The taxability of a federal entity and whether (( or not )) the entity is required to collect and remit retail sales/use ta x depends on the benefits and immunities conferred (( upon )) on it by Congress. Thus, to determine the current taxable st atus of federal entities, the relevant portion of the federal law should be examined. (b) \"United States\" does not include entities associated with but not a part of the Unit ed States, such as the National Guard (an instrumentality of the state of Washington). Nor does it include enti ties contracting with the United States government to administer its programs. (3) Prohibition against taxi ng the United States. The state of Washington is prohibited from imposing taxes directly (( upon )) on the United States. (a) This prohibition applies to taxes imposed for the priv - ilege of engaging in business such as (( the)) business and occupation (B&O) (chapter 82.04 RCW) and (( the)) public utility (chapter 82.16 RCW) taxes. It also applies to taxes imposed on a buyer or user of goods or services(( ,)) including, but not limited to, the: (i) State and local retail sale s and car rental taxes (chap - ters 82.08 and 82.14 RCW); (ii) State and local use tax (chapters 82.12 and 82.14 RCW); (iii) Solid waste collection tax (chapter 82.18 RCW); and (iv) Local government taxes such as the special hotel/motel (chapter 67.28 RCW) and convention and trade center (chapter 67.40 RCW) taxes. (b) The state is also prohibited from requiring the United States to collect taxes imposed on the buyer (e.g., the retail sales tax) as an agent for the state. However, buyers must pay use tax on retail purchases fro m the United States, unless spe - cifically exempt by law. (c) In addition, federal law exempts certain nongovern - mental entities from state taxes (for which Congress has given specific federal statutory tax exemptions). These spe - cific federal statutory exemptions (( given by Congress )) may not be absolute and may be limited to specific activities of an entity. (d) The American Red Cross is an instrumentality of the United States. As a federal corporation providing aid and relief, it is exempt from retail sales, use, and (( business and Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-023 [ 23 ] law. RCW 82.08.0258, 82.12.0259, and 82.04.380. The Red Cross provides some victims of natural disas - ters assistance by check, vouche r, and/or direct deposits to the individuals' personal bank accounts. Assistance may also be provided with \"client assistan ce cards\" that may be used by the recipients at locations where bankcards are accepted or at automated teller machines (ATM). The retail sales tax treatment of purchases made using these payment methods is: (i) Electronic funds transf ers and checks. Purchases made by an individual using funds that have been transferred into the individual's bank account or received in the form of a check are subject to retail sale s tax in the same manner as any other purchase made by that individual, unless specifically exempt by law. (ii) Vouchers. A voucher is a certificate issued by the Red Cross to an individual that may be exchanged for a spe - cific good or service. As the goods and services will be paid for directly by the Red Cross, the sales are not subject to retail sales tax. A vendor who accepts a voucher will send it and/or other proof of sale to the Red Cross, which will then send a check to the vendor to pay for the purchase. (iii) Client assistance cards. Sales to individuals who use client assistance cards issued by the Red Cross, or who pay with cash withdrawn from an ATM using the card, are sub - ject to retail sales tax, unless otherwise exempt from tax. These sales are not direct sales to the federal government or one of its instrumentalities. (e) The Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) is an agency of the federal government. As a federal corporation providing aid and reli ef, it is exempt from retail sales, use, and B&O taxes under state law. RCW 82.08.0258, 82.12.0259, and 82.04.380. FEMA provides some victims of natural disasters assis - tance by check, voucher, and/or direct deposits to the individ - uals' personal bank accounts. Assistance may also be pro - vided with emergency debit cards that can be used by the recipients at locations where bankcards are accepted or at ATMs. The retail sales tax treatme nt of purchases made using these payment methods is: (i) Electronic funds transfer and checks. Sales are subject to retail sales tax as described in (d)(i) of this subsection. (ii) Vouchers. Sales are not subject to retail sales tax. As with the Red Cross, the goods a nd services will be paid for directly by FEMA. See (d)(ii) of this subsection. (iii) Emergency debit cards. As with the Red Cross, \"cli - ent assistance cards\" purchases made with these cards, or with cash withdrawn from an ATM using these cards, are subject to retail sales tax. See (d)(iii) of this subsection. (4) Persons doing business wi th the United States. Persons selling goods or services to the United States are sub - ject to taxes imposed on the seller, such as the (( business and occupation ( ))B&O(( ))) and public utility taxes, unless a spe - cific tax exemption applies. Persons receiving income from contracting with the United Stat es government to administer its programs, either in whole or in part, are also subject to tax, unless a specific tax exemption applies. (a) Certain invoiced amounts not included in gross income. Persons who contract with the United States may, for federal accounting purposes, be contractually required to invoice goods or services provided to the United States by third parties. The purpose of the invoices is to match the expenditures with the appropri ate category of congressional funding. (( These )) Amounts received under such invoices should be excluded from the person's gross income when reporting on the (( combined )) excise tax return if all of the following conditions (( exist )) are met with respect to the goods or services: (i) The third party directly invoices the United States; (ii) The United States direc tly pays the third party; and (iii) The person has no liabilit y, either primarily or sec - ondarily, for making payment to the third party or for remit - ting payment to the third party. (b) Tax obligation with respect to the use of tangible personal property. Persons performing services for the United States are also subject to the retail sales or use tax on property they use or consume when performing services for the United States, unle ss specifically exempt. (i) Manufacturing articles for commercial or indus - trial use. In the case of products manufactured or produced by the person using the products as a consumer, the measure of the use tax is generally the value of the products as explained in WAC 458-20-112 (( (Value of products). How - ever, )). If the articles manufactured or produced by the user are used in the manufacture or production of products sold or to be sold to the department of defense of the United States, the value of articles used is the value of the ingredients of such articles. The manufacturing B&O tax also applies to the value of articles manufactured for commercial or industrial use. (ii) Use of government provided property. When arti - cles or goods used are acquire d by bailment, the measure of the use tax to the bailee is the r easonable rental with the value to be determined as nearly as possible acco rding to the rental price at the place of use of simila r products of like quality and character.

For information on the sales and use tax exemp - tions s ee WAC 458-20-13601 (( (Manufacturers and proces - sor for hire\u2014Sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment) )). (5) Documenting exempt sales to the United States. Only (( those )) sales made directly to the United States are exempt from retail sales tax or other tax imposed on the WSR 16-10-023 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 24 ]buyer. To be entitled to the exemption, the purchase must be paid for using a qualified U.S. government credit card, a check from the United States pa yable to the seller, a United States voucher, or with cash accompanied by the federal SF (Standard Form) 1165. Sales to employees or repr esentatives of the United States are subject to tax, even though the United States may reimburse the employee or represen tative for all or a part of the expense. Purchases by any other person, whether with federal funds or through a re imbursement arrangement, are subject to tax unless specifically exempt by law. (a) Documenting tax-exempt sales. Sellers must docu - ment the tax-exempt nature of sales made to the United States by keeping a copy of the Unite d States credit card receipt, a copy of the check from the Un ited States, a copy of the fed - eral government voucher, or a signed copy of federal SF 1165. To determine whether purchases made with a U.S. Government credit card are exempt from retail sales tax, the department will look at the prefix of the card, which consists of the first four digits and the sixth digit. As amended in 2009, RCW 19.200.010 now prohib its sellers from retaining credit and debit card receipts containing more than the last five digits of the card number. Se llers, in addition to a receipt, should retain the remaining credit card numbers by other means, such as on a log, for ex ample, that contains the fol - lowing information: (i) The first four digits and the sixth digit of the eligible card; (ii) Federal employee's name; (iii) Federal government agency's name; (iv) Type of agency card (e.g ., purchase card, fleet card, travel card, integrated card); (v) Expiration date of credit card; and (vi) Name of the credit card company. (b) Payment (( occurring via )) made by government contracted credit card. Various United States government contracted credit cards are used to make payment for pur - chases of goods and services by or for the United States gov - ernment. Sole responsibility for payment of these purchases may rest with the United States government or with the employee. The United States government's system of issuing government contracted credit card s is subject to change. For specific information about dete rmining when payment is the direct responsibility of the United States government or the employee, contact the departme nt's taxpayer services divi - sion at: ((Department of Revenue )) Taxpayer Services Department of Revenue P.O. Box 47478 Olympia, WA 98504-7478 or call the department's telephone information center at 1- 800-647-7706 or visit the web site at (( http:// dor.wa.gov )) dor.wa.gov . (6) Doing business on federal reservations. The state of Washington has jurisdiction and authority to levy and col - lect taxes (( upon )) from persons residing within, or with respect to business tr ansactions conducted (( upon )) on, The term \"federal res -ervation,\" as used in this rule, means any land or premises within the exterior boundaries of the state of Washington that are held or acquired by and for the use of the United States, its departments, institutions or entities. This means that a concessionaire operating within a federal reservation under a grant or permit issued by the United States or by a department or entity of the United States is taxable to the same extent as any private operator engaging in a similar business outside a federal reservation and without specific authority from the United States. (a) Sales tax collection requirements. Persons making retail sales to members of the armed forces or others residing within or conducting business (( upon )) on federal reserva - tions are required to collect and remit retail sales tax from the buyer. (b) Cigarette tax stamps. Washington cigarette tax stamps must generally be affixed to all cigarettes sold to per - sons residing within or conducting business (( upon )) on fed- eral reservations. However, such stamps need not be affixed to cigarettes sold to the United States or any of its entities including voluntary organizations of military personnel authorized by the Secretary of De fense or the Secretary of the Navy or by the United States or any of its entities to autho - rized purchasers, for use on such reservation. For additional information on cigarette st amps, rates, and refunds s ee WAC 458-20-186 (( (Tax on cigarettes) )). (7) Sales made to authorized purchasers of the United States. As explained in subsection (3)(b) of this rule, while sales by the United States are exempt of retail sales tax the purchaser is generally responsible for remitting use tax directly to the department (( of revenue )). Federal law prohib - its the imposition of use tax on tangible personal property sold to authorized purchasers by the United States, its enti - ties, or voluntary unincorporated organization of armed forces personnel. 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(a). (a) Who is an \"autho rized purchaser\"? A person is an \"authorized purchaser\" only with respect to purchases he or she is permitted to make from commissaries, ships' stores, or voluntary unincorporated organi zations of personnel of any branch of the armed forces of the United States, under regu - lations promulgated by the departmental secretary having jurisdiction over such branch. 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(b). (b) What is a \"voluntary unincorporated organiza - tion\"? \"Voluntary unincorporated organizations\" are those organizations comprised of armed forces personnel operated under regulations promulgated by the departmental secretary having jurisdiction over such branch. Examples of voluntary unincorporated organi zations are post flying clubs, officers or noncommissioned officers open messes, and recreation associations. (8) Purchases by persons using federal funds. Retail sales or use tax (( is applicable )) applies to retail purchases made by any buyer, other than the United States, including the state of Washington and all of its political subdivisions, irrespective of whether or not th e buyer uses or is reimbursed with federal funds , unless the purchase is specifically exempt by law . (9) Cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-prod - ucts of weapons production and nuclear research and development. RCW 82.04.263 provides a preferential tax Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-023 [ 25 ] Proposedrate for the gross income derived from cleaning up for the United States, or its instrument alities, radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development. This tax rate applies whether the person performing these activities is a general contractor or subcontractor. (a) What activities are entitl ed to the preferential tax rate? Only those activities that meet the definition of \"clean - ing up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development\" are enti - tled to the preferential tax rate . The statute defines \"cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons pro - duction and nuclear research and development\" to mean: (i) The handling, storing, treating, immobilizing, stabi - lizing, or disposing of radio active waste, radioactive tank waste and capsules, nonradioactive hazardous solid and liq - uid wastes, or sp ent nuclear fuel; (ii) Conditioning of spent nuclear fuel; (iii) Removing contamination in soils and groundwater; (iv) Decontaminating and deco mmissioning of facilities; and (v) Services supporting the performance of cleanup. A service supports the perf ormance of cleanup if it: (A) Is within the scope of wo rk under a clean-up contract with the United Stated Department of Energy; or (B) Assists in the accomplishm ent of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States Department of Energy under a subcontract entered into with the prime contractor or another subcontract or in furtherance of a clean- up contract between the United States Department of Energy and a prime contractor. (b) When does a service not assist in the accomplish - ment of a requirement of a clean-up project? Subject to specific exceptions provided by law, a service does not assist in the accomplishment of a clean-up project when the same services are routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities. The following exceptions are always deemed to contrib - ute to the accomplis hment of a requirem ent of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States Department of Energy: Information technology and computer support services; Services rendered in resp ect to infrastructure; and Security, safety, and health services. (c) Guideline examples. The following examples are to be used as a guideline when de termining whether a service is \"routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities.\" (i) Accounting services. The classification does not apply to general accounting services but does apply to perfor - mance audits performed for persons cleaning up radioactive waste. (ii) Legal services. The classification does not apply to general legal services but does apply to those legal services that assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean- up project undertaken by the United States Department of Energy. Thus, legal services pr ovided to contest any local, state, or federal tax liability or to defend a company against worker's compensation claim arising from a worksite injury do not qualify for the classification. However, legal services related to the resolution of contractual dispute between the parties to a clean-up contract between the United States Department of Energy and a prime contractor do qualify. (iii) General office janitorial. General office janitorial services do not qualify for th e radioactive waste clean-up classification, but the specia lized cleaning of equipment exposed to radioactiv e waste does qualify. (d) Clean-up examples. ((The examples in this subsec - tion identify a number of fact s and then state a conclusion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Sim - ilar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all fact s and circumstances. )) (i) Company C is a land excavation contractor (( who)) that contracts with Prime Contractor to dig trenches where waste will be reburied after processing. Company C's con - tract for digging trenches qualifies for the preferential tax rate under RCW 82.04.263 because the activity of digging trenches is one of the p hysical acts of cleaning up. (ii) Company D contracts wi th Company C from the pre - vious example to provide payr oll and accounting services. Company D's activity does not qua lify for the preferential tax rate under RCW 82.04.263 becau se the activity of general accounting is not an activity involving the physical act of cleaning up, nor is it a service supporting the performance of cleanup as defined in (a)(v) of this subsection. (iii) Company E is an environmental engineering com - pany (( which )) that contracts with Prime Contractor to develop a plan on how best to decontaminate the soil at a tank farm and will monitor the clean up/decontamination as it pro - gresses. Company E's activities qualify for the preferential tax rate under RCW 82.04.263 because the activities are ser - vices supporting the performance of cleanup. (iv) Company F is a security company that c ontracts with Prime Contractor to provide ov erall security to the federal reservation, including providing security at clean-up sites. Security services at clean-up sites are services that support the performance of cleanup. (e) Taxability of tangible p ersonal property used or consumed in cleaning up ra dioactive waste and other by- products of weapons production and nuclear research and development. Persons cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development for th e United States, or its instru - mentalities, are consumers of any property they use or con - sume when performing thes e services. RCW 82.04.190. Therefore, tangible personal pr operty used or consumed in the cleanup is subject to retail sales or use tax. If the seller does not collect retail sales ta x on a retail sale, the buyer is required to pay the retail sales tax (commonly referred to as \"deferred sales tax\") or use ta x directly to the department, unless specifically exempt by law. The \"(( combined )) excise tax return\" does not have a separate line for reporting deferred sales tax. Consequently , deferred sales tax liability should be reported on the use tax line of the buyer's (( com- bined )) excise tax return. (( Refer to )) For detailed informa - tion on the use tax, see WAC 458-20-178 (( for detailed infor - mation regarding use tax )). (10) Sales to foreign governments or foreign diplo - mats.

Purpose of the Proposal a nd Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act amended Sec - tion 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 to create a new federal exemption for offerings of securities in crowdfunding cam - paigns. On October 30, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules that will implement this new exemption. See Regulation Crowdfunding, Release Nos. 33- 9974; 34-76324, available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ 2015/33-9974.pdf. The JOBS Act further amended Securities Act Section 18 (b)(4) to preempt the ability of states to require registration of crow dfunding offerings conducted pursuant to federal law. However, states retain the authority to require notice filings of crowdfunding offerings if a state is the principal place of business of the issuer or if a state is home to purchasers of fifty percent or more of the aggregate value of the securities offered in the crowdfunding campaign. The securities division is now proposing rules to require the filing of a notice filin g form, a consent to service of process, and the fees that would otherw ise be required in connection with the registration of these securities offerings but for pre - emption by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proposed notice filing form is available on the division's web site at http://www.dfi.wa.gov/rulemaking/notice-filing- requirements-connection-federal-crowdfunding-rules.

(d) For purposes of determinin g a plan's actuarial value, an issuer must classify as hab ilitative services the range of medically necessary health care services and health care devices designed to assist a person to keep, learn or improve skills and functioning for daily living. Examples include ser - vices for a child who isn't walkin g or talking at the expected age, or services to assist with keeping or learning skills and functioning within an individual's environment, or to com - pensate for a person's progress ive physical, cognitive, and emotional illness. These servic es may include physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and other services for people with disabilities in a variety of inpatient or outpatient settings. (i) As a minimum level of coverage, an issuer must establish limitations on habilitative services on parity with those for rehabilitative services.

For purposes of this subsection, an issuer must establish limitations on the number of visits and cover - age of the rehabilitation therapy consistent with its medical necessity and utilization review guidelines for medical/surgi - cal benefits. Examples of these are, but are not limited to, breast cancer rehabilitation therap y, respiratory therapy, and cardiac rehabilitation therapy. Such services may be classi - fied to the ambulatory patient or hospitalization services cat - egories for purposes of determining actuarial value. (8) A health plan must cover \"laboratory services\" in a manner substantially equal to the base-benchmark plan.

If an issu er includes this benefit in a health plan, the issuer may not include this benefit in estab - lishing the health pl an's actuarial value. (9) A health plan must co ver \"preventive and wellness services, including chronic dis ease management\" in a manner substantially equal to the base-benchmark plan. For purposes of determining a plan's actuarial value, an issuer must classify as preventive and wellness services, including chronic dis - ease management, the services th at identify or prevent the onset or worsening of disease or disease conditions, illness or injury, often asymptomatic; services that assist in the multi - disciplinary management and tr eatment of chronic diseases; and services of particular prev entative or early identification of disease or illness of value to specific populations, such as women, children and seniors.WSR 16-10-050 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 44 ](a) If a plan does not have in its network a provider who can perform the particular servi ce, then the plan must cover the item or service when pe rformed by an out-of-network provider and must not impose cost-sharing with respect to the item or service. In addition, a health plan must not limit sex- specific recommended preventive services based on an indi - vidual's sex assigned at birth, gender identity or recorded gender. If a provider determines that a sex-specific recom - mended preventive service is medically appropriate for an individual, and the individual otherwise satisfies the cover - age requirements, the plan must provide coverage without cost-sharing. (b) A health benefit plan must include the following ser - vices as preventive and well ness services, including chronic disease management: (i) Immunizations recommended by the Centers for Dis - ease Control's Advisory Comm ittee on Immunization Prac - tices; (ii)(A) Screening and tests for which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for Preven tion and Chronic Care have issued A and B recommendations on or before the applicable plan year. (B) To the extent not specifi ed in a recommendation or guideline, a plan may rely on the relevant evidence base and reasonable medical management techniques, based on neces - sity or appropriateness, to determine the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of a recommended pre - ventive health service; (iii) Services, tests and screening contained in the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (\"HRSA\") Bright Futures guidelines as set forth by the American Acad - emy of Pediatricians; and (iv) Services, tests, screen ing and supplies recommended in the HRSA women's preventive and wellness services guidelines: (A) If the plan covers childr en under the age of nineteen, or covers dependent children age nineteen or over who are on the plan pursuant to RCW 48.44.200, 48.44.210, or 48.46.- 320, the plan must provide the child with the full range of rec - ommended preventive servi ces suggested under HRSA guidelines for the child's age group without cost-sharing. Ser - vices provided in this regard may be combined in one visit as medically appropriate or may be spread over more than one visit, without incurring cost-s haring, as medically appropri - ate; and (B) A plan may use reasonable medical management techniques to determine the frequency, method, treatment or setting for a recommended preventive service, including pro - viding multiple prevention and sc reening services at a single visit or across multiple visits. (v) Chronic disease management services, which typi - cally include, but are not limited to, a treatment plan with reg - ular monitoring, coordination of care between multiple pro - viders and settings, medication management, evidence-based care, measuring care quality and outcomes, and support for patient self-management through education or tools; and (vi) Wellness services. (c) The base-benchmark plan (( does not specifically exclude any services that could reasonably be classified to this category )) establishes specific limitations on services classified to the preventive se rvices category that conflict with state or federal law as of January 1, 2017, and should not be included in essential health benefit plans. Specifically, the base-benchmark plan excludes cover - age for obesity or weight cont rol other than covered nutri - tional counseling. Health plan s must cover certain obesity- related services that are listed as A or B recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Ta sk Force, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13 (a)(1) and 45 C.F.R. 147.130 (a)(1)(i) . (d) The base-benchmark plan does not establish visit limitations on services in this category. In accordance with Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and its implementing regulations relating to coverage of preven - tive services, the base-benchma rk plan does not impose cost- sharing requirements with respect to the preventive services listed under (b)(i) through (iv) of this subsection that are pro - vided in-network. (e) State benefit requirements classified in this category are: (i) Colorectal cancer screen ing as set forth in RCW 48.43.043; (ii) Mammogram services, both diagnostic and screening (RCW 48.21.225, 48.44.325 , and 48.46.275); and (RCW 48.20.392, 48.21.- 227, 48.44.327, and 48.46.277). (10) Some state benefit requirements are limited to those receiving pediatric services, but are classified to other catego - ries for purposes of de termining actuarial value. (a) These benefits include: (i) Neurodevelopmental therap y, consisting of physical, occupational and speech therapy and maintenance to restore or improve function based on developmental delay, which cannot be combined with rehabilitative services for the same condition (RCW 48.44.450, 48.4 6.520, and 48.21.310). This state benefit requirement may be classified to ambulatory patient services or mental h ealth and substance abuse disor - der including behavioral health categories; and (ii) Treatment of congenital anomalies in newborn and dependent children (RCW 48.20.430, 48.21.155, 48.44.212, and 48.46.250). This state benefit requirement may be classi - fied to hospitalization, ambulatory patient services or mater - nity and newborn categories. (b) The base-benchmark plan contains limitations or scope restrictions that conflict wi th state or federal law as of January 1, 2017. Specifically, the plan covers outpatient neu - rodevelopmental therapy servi ces only for persons age six and under. Health plans must cover medically necessary neu - rodevelopmental therapy for any DSM diagnosis without blanket exclusions. (11) Issuers must know and apply relevant guidance, clarifications and expectations issued by federal governmen - tal agencies regarding essential health benefits. Such clarifi - cations may include, but are not limited to, Affordable Care Act implementation and frequently asked questions jointly issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser - vices, the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

(8) After the certificate is issued, the department may conduct an additional review as it determines is necessary to ensure compliance with current regulatory standards. In con - ducting its review, the departme nt will complete its evalua - tion in accordance with criteria sp ecified in this section. The department may request such additional information as it considers necessary to conduct its review and the certificate holder shall provide the information as requested. (9)(a) A certificate holder wh o no longer manufactures or initially transfers any of th e sealed sources or devices cov - ered by a particular certificat e issued by the department or NRC shall request inactivation of the registration certificate from the issuing regulatory authority. Such a request must be made to the department, or (a s appropriate) to NRC's office of nuclear material safety and safeguards, ATTN: SSDR by an appropriate method listed in 10 C.F.R. 30.6(a) and must normally be made no later than two years after initial distri - bution of all of the sources or devices covered by the certifi - cate has ceased. However if th e certificate holder determines that an initial transfer was in f act the last initial transfer more than two years after that transf er, the certificate holder shall request inactivation of the certif icate within ninety days of this determination and briefly describe the circumstances of the delay. (b) If a distribution license is to be terminated in accor - dance with chapters 246-232, 246-233, and 246-235 WAC, the licensee shall request inactiv ation of its registration certif - icates associated with that distribution license before the department will terminate th e license. Such a request for inactivation of certificates must indicate that the license is being terminated and include th e associated specific license number. (c) A specific license to manuf acture or initially transfer a source or device covered only by an inactivated certificate no longer authorizes the licens ee to initially transfer such sources or devices for use. Servicing of devices must be in accordance with any condi tions in the certifi cate, including in the case of an inactive certificate.

As used in this section, the term \"by-product material\" means the tailings or wastes pro - duced by the extraction or concentration of uranium or tho - rium from any ore processed primarily for its source material content.WSR 16-10-086 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 104 ]As required by WAC 246-235-1 10(6), each applicant for a license to possess and use so urce material in conjunction with uranium or thorium milling, or by-product material at sites formerly associated with such milling, is required to include in a license applicati on proposed specifications relat - ing to the milling operation and the disposition of tailings or waste resulting from such milling activities. This section establishes criteria relating to the siting, operation, decontam - ination, decommissioning, and reclamation of mills and tail - ings or waste systems and sites at which such mills and sys - tems are located and site and by-product material ownership. Applications must clearly de monstrate how these criteria have been addressed. The spec ifications shall be developed considering the expected full ca pacity of tailings or waste systems and the lifetime of mi ll operations. Where later expansions of systems or operations may be likely, the amenability of the disposal sy stem to accommodate increased capacities without degradation in long-term stability and other performance factor s shall be evaluated. Licensees or applicants may propose alternatives to the specific requirements in these criteria. The alternative pro - posals may take into account local or regional conditions, including geology, topography, hydrology, and meteorology. The department may find that th e proposed alternatives meet the department's requirements if the alternatives will achieve a level of stabilization and containment of the sites con - cerned, and a level of protection for public health, safety, and the environment from radiolog ical and nonradiological haz - ards associated with the sites, which is equivalent to, to the extent practicable, or more stringent than the level which would be achieved by the requirements of the standards pro - mulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 40 C.F.R. 192, Subparts D and E. (1) Criterion 1 - In selecti ng among alternative tailings disposal sites or judging the adequacy of existing tailings sites, the following site features which would contribute to meeting the broad objective of permanent isolation of the tailings and associated contam inants from man and the envi - ronment for one thousand years to the extent reasonably achievable, and in any case, for at least two hundred years without ongoing active maintenance shall be considered: (a) Remoteness from populated areas; (b) Hydrogeologic and other environmental conditions conducive to continued immobilization and isolation of con - taminants from groundwater sources; and (c) Potential for minimizing erosion, disturbance, and dispersion by natural forces over the long term. The site selection process must be an optimization to the maximum extent reasonably achie vable in terms of these fea - tures. In the selection of disposal sites, primary emphasis shall be given to isolation of tailings or wastes, a matter having long-term impacts, as opposed to consideration only of short-term convenience or benefits, such as minimization of trans - portation or land acquisition costs. While isolation of tailings will be a function of both site characteristics and engineering design, overriding consideration shall be given to siting fea - tures given the long-term nature of the tailings hazards.Tailings shall be disposed in a manner such that no active maintenance is required to preserve the condition of the site. (2) Criterion 2 - To avoid proliferation of small waste disposal sites, by-product material from in-situ extraction operations, such as residues from solution evaporation or contaminated control proces ses, and wastes from small remote above ground extraction operations shall be disposed at existing large mill tailings disposal sites; unless, consider - ing the nature of the wastes, su ch as their volume and specific activity and the costs and envi ronmental impacts of transport - ing the wastes to a large disposal site, such off-site disposal is demonstrated to be impracticable or the advantage of on-site burial clearly outweighs the be nefits of reducing the perpet - ual surveillance obligations. (3) Criterion 3 - The \"prime option\" for disposal of tail - ings is placement below grade, either in mines or specially excavated pits (that is, where the need for any specially con - structed retention stru cture is eliminated). The evaluation of alternative sites and disposal methods performed by mill operators in support of their proposed tail - ings disposal program (provided in applicants' environmental reports) shall reflect serious co nsideration of this disposal mode. In some instances, belo w grade disposal may not be the most environmentally sound approach, such as might be the case if a groundwater format ion is relatively close to the surface or not very well isolat ed by overlying soils and rock. Also, geologic and topographic conditions might make full, below grade burial impracticab le; for example, near-surface bedrock could create prominent excavation costs while more suitable alternate sites may be available. Where full below grade burial is not practicable, the size of the retention struc - tures, and the size and steepn ess of slopes of associated exposed embankments, shall be minimized by excavation to the maximum extent reasonably achievable or appropriate, given the geologic and hydrogeologic conditions at a site. In these cases, it must be demonstr ated that an above-grade dis - posal program will provide reasonably equivalent isolation of the tailings from natural erosional forces. (4) Criterion 4 - The following site and design criteria shall be adhered to whether tailings or wastes are disposed of above or below grade: (a) Upstream rainfall catch ment areas must be mini - mized to decrease erosion poten tial and the size of the proba - ble maximum flood which could erode or wash out sections of the tailings disposal area. (b) Topographic features shall provide good wind pro - tection. (c) Embankment and cover slopes shall be relatively flat after final stabilization to minimize erosion potential and to provide conservative factors of safety assuring long-term sta - bility. The broad objective should be to contour final slopes to grades which are as close as possible to those which would be provided if tailings were di sposed of below grade; this could, for example, lead to sl opes of about ten horizontal to one vertical (10h:1v) or less steep. In general, slopes should not be steeper than about 5h:1v. Where steeper slopes are proposed, reasons why a slope less steep than 5h:1v would be impracticable should be provided, and compensating factors Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-086 [ 105 ] Proposedand conditions which make such slopes acceptable should be identified. (d) A fully self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be established or rock cover employed to reduce wind and water erosion to negligible levels. Where a full vegetative cover is not likely to be self-sus - taining due to climatic conditions, such as in semi-arid and arid regions, rock cover shall be employed on slopes of the impoundment system. The NRC will consider relaxing this requirement for extremely gentle slopes such as those which may exist on the top of the pile. The following factors shall be considered in establishing the final rock cover design to avoid displacement of rock par - ticles by human and animal tra ffic or by natural processes, and to preclude undercutting and piping: (i) Shape, size, com position, gradation of rock particles (excepting bedding material, aver age particle size shall be at least cobble size or greater); (ii) Rock cover thickness and zoning of particles by size; and (iii) Steepness of underlying slopes. (e) Individual rock fragments (( shall )) must be dense, sound, and resistant to abrasion, and free from defects that would tend to unduly increase their destruction by water and frost actions. Weak, friable, or laminated aggregate (( shall )) may not be used. Shale, rock laminated with shale, and cherts ((shall )) may not be used. Rock covering of slopes may (( not be required )) be unnecessary where top covers are very thick ( on the order of ten meters or greater ); impoundment slopes are very gentle (on the order of 10h:1v or less ); bulk cover materials have inherently favorable erosion re sistance characteristics; and there is negligible drainage catchment area upstream of the pile, and (( there is )) good wind protection as described in (a) and (b) of this subsection (Criterion 4) . (f) Impoundment surfaces sha ll be contoured to avoid areas of concentrated surfa ce runoff or abrupt or sharp changes in slope gradient. In addition to rock cover on slopes, areas toward which surface runoff might be directed shall be well protected with substantia l rock cover (riprap). In addi - tion to providing for stability of the impoundment systems itself, the overall stability, erosion potential, and geomor - phology of surrounding terrain shall be evaluated to assure that there are no processes, such as gully erosion, which would lead to impoundment instability. (g) The impoundment (( shall )) may not be located near a capable fault that could caus e a maximum credible earth - quake larger than that whic h the impoundment could reason - ably be expected to withstand. As used in this criterion, the term \"capable fault\" has the sa me meaning as defined in Sec - tion III (g) of Appendix A of 10 C.F.R. Part 100. The term \"maximum credible earthquake\" means that earthquake which would cause the maximum vibratory ground motion based upon an evaluation of earthquake potential considering the regional and local geology and seismology and specific characteristics of local subsurface material. (h) The impoundment, where feasible, should be designed to incorporate features which will promote deposi - tion of suspended particles. For example, design features which promote deposition of sediment suspended in any run -off which flows into the impoundment area might be utilized; the object of such a design feature would be to enhance the thickness of cover over time. (5) Criterion 5 - Criteria 5(a) through 5(g) and new Cri - terion 13 incorporate the ba sic groundwater protection stan - dards imposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 40 C.F.R. Part 192, Subparts D and E (48 FR 45926; October 7, 1983) which apply during operations and prior to the end of closure. Groundwater monitoring to com - ply with these standards is required by Criterion 7. (a) The primary groundwater protection standard is a design standard for surface impoundments used to manage uranium and thorium by-produ ct material. Surface impound - ments (except for an existing por tion) must have a liner that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migra - tion of wastes out of the im poundment to the adjacent subsur - face soil, groundwater, or su rface water at any time during the active life (including the closure period) of the impound - ment. The liner may be constructed of materials that may allow wastes to migrate into the liner (but not into the adja - cent subsurface soil, groundwater, or surface water) during the active life of the facility, provided that impoundment clo - sure includes removal or decontamination of all waste resi - dues, contaminated co ntainment system co mponents (liners), contaminated subsoils, and st ructures and equipment contam - inated with waste and leachate. For impoundments that will be closed with the liner material left in place, the liner must be constructed of materials that can prevent wastes from migrating into the liner during the active life of the facility. (b) The liner required by (a) of this subsection must be: (i) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chem - ical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to pre - vent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic condi - tions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily opera - tion; (ii) Placed upon a fo undation or base capable of provid - ing support to the liner and re sistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prev ent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression, or uplift; and (iii) Installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the wastes or leachate. (c) The applicant or licensee will be exempted from the requirements of (a) of this subs ection if the department finds, based on a demonstration by th e applicant or licensee, that alternate design and operating practices, including the clo - sure plan, together with site characteristics will prevent the migration of any hazardous cons tituents into groundwater or surface water at any future time . In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the department will consider: (i) The nature and quantity of the wastes; (ii) The proposed alternate design and operation; (iii) The hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuation capacity and thic kness of the liners and soils present between the impoundment and groundwater or sur - face water; and (iv) All other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to groundwater or surface water.WSR 16-10-086 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 106 ](d) A surface impoundment must be designed, con - structed, maintained, and operated to prevent overtopping resulting from normal or abnormal operations; overfilling; wind and wave actions; rainfall; run-on; from malfunctions of level controllers, alarms, and other equipment; and human error. (e) When dikes are used to form the surface impound - ment, the dikes must be designed, constructed, and main - tained with sufficient structural integrity to prevent massive failure of the dikes. In ensuring structural integrity, it must not be presumed that the liner system will function without leakage during the active life of the impoundment. (f) Uranium and thorium by-pr oduct materials must be managed to conform to the fo llowing secondary groundwater protection standard: Hazardous constituents entering the groundwater from a licensed site must not exceed the speci - fied concentration limits in the uppermost aquifer beyond the point of compliance during the compliance period. Hazard - ous constituents are those constituents identified by the department pursuant to (g) of this subsection. Specified con - centration limits are those limits established by the depart - ment as indicated in (j) of this subsection. The department will also establish the point of compliance and compliance period on a site specific basis through license conditions and orders. The objective in selec ting the point of compliance is to provide the earliest practicable warning that the impound - ment is releasing hazardous co nstituents to the groundwater. The point of compliance must be selected to provide prompt indication of groundwater contamination on the hydraulically downgradient edge of the disposal area. The department must identify hazardous constituents , establish concentration lim - its, set the compliance period, an d adjust the point of compli - ance, if needed, when the detection monitoring established under criterion 7 indi cates leakage of ha zardous constituents from the disposal area. (g) A constituent becomes a hazardous constituent sub - ject to (j) of this subsection when the constituent: (i) Is reasonably expected to be in or derived from the by-product material in the disposal area; (ii) Has been detected in the groundwater in the upper - most aquifer; and (iii) Is listed in WAC 246-252-050 Appendix A. (h) The department may excl ude a detected constituent from the set of hazardous consti tuents on a site specific basis if it finds that the constituent is not capable of posing a sub - stantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. In deciding whethe r to exclude constituents, the department will consider the following: (i) Potential adverse effect on groundwater quality, con - sidering: (A) The physical and chemi cal characteristics of the waste in the licensed site, in cluding its potential for migra - tion; (B) The hydrogeological char acteristics of the facility and surrounding land; (C) The quantity of groundwater and the direction of groundwater flow; (D) The proximity and withdrawal rates of groundwater users;(E) The current and future uses of groundwater in the area; (F) The existing quality of groundwater, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the groundwater quality; (G) The potential for health risks caused by human expo - sure to waste constituents; (H) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constitu - ents; (I) The persistence and pe rmanence of the potential adverse effects. (ii) Potential adverse effect s on hydraulically connected surface water quality, considering: (A) The volume and physical and chemical characteris - tics of the waste in the licensed site; (B) The hydrogeological char acteristics of the facility and surrounding land; (C) The quantity and quality of groundwater, and the direction of groundwater flow; (D) The patterns of rainfall in the region; (E) The proximity of the licen sed site to surface waters; (F) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality standards established for those surface waters; (G) The existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and th e cumulative impact on sur - face water quality; (H) The potential for health risks caused by human expo - sure to waste constituents; (I) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constitu - ents; and (J) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects. (i) In making any determinations under (h) and (k) of this subsection about the use of groundwater in the area around the facility, the department will consider any identification of underground sources of drinking water and exempted aqui - fers made by the United Stat es Environmental Protection Agency. (j) At the point of complian ce, the concentration of a hazardous constituent must not exceed: (i) The department approved background concentration of that constituent in the groundwater; (ii) The respective value give n in the table in subsection (5)(l) of this section if the constituent is listed in the table and if the background level of the constituent is below the value listed; or (iii) An alternate concentration limit established by the department. (k) Conceptually, background concentrations pose no incremental hazards an d the drinking water lim its in (j)(i) of this subsection state acceptable hazards but these two options may not be practically achievabl e at a specific site. Alternate concentration limits that pres ent no significant hazard may be proposed by licensees for depar tment consideration. Licens - ees must provide the basis for any proposed limits including consideration of practicable co rrective actions, that limits are Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-086 [ 107 ] Proposedas low as reasonably achievabl e, and information on the fac - tors the department must consider. The department will establis h a s ite specific alternate concentration limit for a hazardou s constituent as provided in (j) of this subsection if it finds that the constituent will not pose a substantial present or po tential hazard to human health or the environment as long as the alternate concentration limit is not exceeded. In estab lishing alternate concentration limits, the department will ap ply its as low as reasonably achievable criterion in this chap ter. The department will also consider the following factors: (i) Potential adverse effects on groundwater quality, con - sidering: (A) The physical and chemical charac teristics of the waste in the licensed site including its potential for migration; (B) The hydrogeological char acteristics of the facility and surrou nding land; (C) The quantity of groundwater and the direction of ground water flow; (D) The proximity and withdrawal rates of groundwater users; (E) The current and future us es of groundwater in the area; (F) The existing quality of groundwater, including other sources of cont amination and th eir cumulative impact on the groundwater quality; (G) The potential fo r health risks caused by human expo - sure to waste constituents; (H) The potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and phys ical structures caused by exposure to waste constitu - ents; (I) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects. (ii) Potential adverse effect s on hydraulically connected surface water quality, considering: (A) The volume and physical and chemical characteris - tics of the waste in the licensed site; (B) The hydrogeological char acteristics of the facility and surrou nding land; (C) The quantity and quality of groundwater, and the directio n of groundwater flow; (D) The patterns of rainfall in the region; (E) The proximity of the licensed site to surface waters; (F) The current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality sta ndards established for those surface waters; (G) The existing quality of surface water including other sources of co ntamination and the cumulative impact on sur - face water quality; (H) The potential fo r health risks caused by human expo - sure to waste constituents; (I) The potential damage to wi ldlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constitu - ents; and (J) The persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects.(l) MAXIMUM VALUES FOR GROUNDWATER PROTECTION: Constituent or - particle activity (excluding radon and uranium when producing uranium by-product material or If the groundwater protection standards established under (f) of this subsection ar e exceeded at a licensed site, a corrective action program must be put into operation as soon as is practicable, and in no ev ent later than eighteen months after the department finds th at the standards have been exceeded. The licensee shall submit the proposed corrective action program and supporting rationale for department approval prior to putting the program into operation, unless otherwise directed by the department. The objective of the program is to return hazardous constituen t concentration lev - els in groundwater to the concentration limits se t as stan - dards. The licensee's proposed p rogram must address remov - ing the hazardous cons tituents that have entered the ground - water at the point of compliance or treating them in place. The program must also addres s removing or tr eating in place any hazardous constituents that exceed concentration limits in groundwater between the point of compliance and the downgradient facility property boundary. The licensee shall continue corrective ac tion measures to the extent necessary to achieve and maintain compliance with the groundwater pro - tection standard. The department will determine when the lice nsee may terminate corrective action measures based on data from the groundwater monitoring program and other WSR 16-10-086 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 108 ]information that provide reasonable assurance that the groundwater protection standa rd will not be exceeded. (n) In developing and conducting groundwater protec - tion programs, applicants and li censees shall also consider the following: (i) Installation of bottom liners (where synthetic liners are used, a leakage detection sy stem must be installed imme - diately below the liner to ensure major failures are detected if they occur. This is in addition to the groundwater monitoring program conducted as provided in Criterion 7. Where clay liners are proposed or relatively thin, in-situ clay soils are to be relied upon for seepage control, tests must be conducted with representative tailings so lutions and clay materials to confirm that no significant dete rioration of permeability or stability properties will occur with continuous exposure of clay to tailings solutions. Tests must be run for a sufficient period of time to reveal any eff ects if they are going to occur (in some cases deterioration has been observed to occur rather rapidly after about nine months of exposure)). (ii) Mill process designs which provide the maximum practicable recycle of solutions and conservation of water to reduce the net input of liquid to the tailings impoundment. (iii) Dewatering of tailings by process devices or in-situ drainage systems (at new sites, tailings must be dewatered by a drainage system installed at the bottom of the impoundment to lower the phreatic surface and reduce the driving head of seepage, unless tests show tailings are not amenable to such a system. Where in-situ dewatering is to be conducted, the impoundment bottom must be graded to assure that the drains are at a low point. The drains must be protected by suitable filter materials to assure that drains remain free running. The drainage system must also be adequately sized to assure good drainage). (iv) Neutralization to prom ote immobilization of hazard - ous constituents. (o) Where groundwater impacts are occurring at an exist - ing site due to seepage, action must be taken to alleviate con - ditions that lead to excessive seepage impacts and restore groundwater quality. The specific seepage control and groundwater protection method, or combination of methods, to be used must be worked out on a site-specific basis. Tech - nical specifications must be prep ared to control installation of seepage control systems. A quality assurance, testing, and inspection program, which includes supervision by a quali - fied engineer or scientist, must be established to assure the specifications are met. (p) In support of a tailings disposal system proposal, the applicant/operator shall supply information concerning the following: (i) The chemical and radioac tive characteristics of the waste solutions. (ii) The characteristics of the underlying soil and geo - logic formations particularly as they will control transport of contaminants and solutions. This includes detailed informa - tion concerning extent, thicknes s, uniformity, shape, and ori - entation of underlying strata. Hydraulic gradients and con - ductivities of the various formations must be determined. This information must be gathered from borings and field survey methods taken within the proposed impoundment area and in surrounding areas wher e contaminants might migrate to groundwater. The information gathered on boreholes must include both geologic and geophysical logs in sufficient num - ber and degree of sophistication to allow determining signif - icant discontinuities, fractures , and channeled deposits of high hydraulic conductivity. If field survey methods are used, they should be in addition to and calibrated with borehole logging. Hydrologic parameters such as permeability may not be determined on the basis of laboratory analysis of sam - ples alone; a sufficie nt amount of field testing (e.g., pump tests) must be conducted to assure actual field properties are adequately understood. Testing must be conducted to allow estimating chemi-sorp tion attenuation properties of underly - ing soil and rock. (iii) Location, extent, quality , capacity and current uses of any groundwater at and near the site. (q) Steps must be taken during stockpiling of ore to min - imize penetration of radionuclides into underlying soils; suit - able methods include lining or compaction of ore storage areas. (6) Criterion 6 - (a) In disposing of waste by-product material, licensees shall place an earthen cover (or approved alternative) over tailings or wastes at the end of milling oper - ations and shall close the waste disposal area in accordance with a design1 which provides reasona ble assurance of con - trol of radiological hazards to: (i) Be effective for 1,000 year s, to the extent reasonably achievable, and, in any case, for at least 200 years; and (ii) Limit releases of Radon-222 from uranium by-prod - uct materials, and Radon-220 from thorium by-product mate - rials, to the atmosphere so as not to exceed an average2 release rate of 20 picocuries per square meter per second (pCi/m2s) to the extent practicable throughout the effective design life determined pursuant to (a)(i) of this subsection (this criterion). In computing required tailings cover thick - nesses, moisture in soils in excess of amounts found normally in similar soils in similar circumstances may not be consid - ered. Direct gamma exposure fr om the tailings or wastes should be reduced to background levels. The effects of any thin synthetic layer may not be taken into account in deter - mining the calculated radon exhalation level. If nonsoil mate - rials are proposed as cover materi als, it must be demonstrated that these materials will not cr ack or degrade by differential settlement, weathering, or othe r mechanism, over long-term intervals. (b) As soon as reasonably achievable after emplacement of the final cover to limit releases of Radon-222 from ura - nium by-product material and prior to placement of erosion protection barriers or other fe atures necessary for long-term control of the tailings, the licensees shall verify through appropriate testing and analysis that the design and construc - tion of the final radon barrier is effective in limiting releases of Radon-222 to a level not exceeding 20 pCi/m2s averaged over the entire pile or impoundment using the procedures described in 40 C.F.R. part 61, appendix B, Method 115, or another method of verification approved by NRC as being at least as effective in demonstr ating the effectiveness of the final radon barrier. (c) When phased emplacement of the final radon barrier is included in the applicable reclamation plan, the verification of Radon-222 release rates requir ed in (b) of this subsection Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-086 [ 109 ] Proposed(this criterion) must be conducted for each portion of the pile or impoundment as the final radon barrier for that portion is emplaced. (d) Within ninety days of the completion of all testing and anal ysis relevant to the required verification in (b) and (c) of this subsection (this criterion), the uranium mill licensee shall report to the department the results detailing the actions taken to verify that levels of release of Radon-222 do not exceed 20 pCi/m 2s when averaged over the entire pile or impoundment. The licensee shall maintain records until ter - mination of the license documenting the source of input p arameters including the resu lts of all measurements on which they are based, the calcu lations or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used to determine compliance. Th ese records shall be kept in a form suitable for transfer to the custodial agency at the time of transfer of the site to DOE or a state for long-term care if requested. (e) Near surface cover materials (i.e., within the top three meters) may not include waste or rock that contains elevated levels of radium; soils used fo r near surface cover must be essentially the same, as far as radioactivity is concerned, as that of surrounding surface soils. This is to ensure that sur - face radon exhalation is not si gnifica ntly above background because of the cover material itself. (f) The design requirements in this criterion for longevity an d control of radon releases apply to any portion of a licensed or disposal site unless such portion contains a con - centration of radium in land, averaged over areas of 100 square meters, which, as a result of by-product material, does not exceed the background level by more than: (i) 5 picocuries per gram (pCi/g) of radium-226, or, in th e case of thorium by-produ ct material, radium-228, aver - aged over the first 15 centimeters (cm) below the surface; and (ii) 15 pCi/g of radium-226, or, in the case of thorium by- pr oduct material, radium-228, averaged over 15-cm thick layers more than 15 cm below the surface. (g) By-product material containing concentrations of radi onuclides other than radium in soil, and surface activity on remaining structures, must not result in a total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) exceedi ng the dose from cleanup of radium contaminated soil to the standard (benchmark dose) contained in (f) of this subsection, and must be at levels which are as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). If more than one residual radionuclide is present in the same 100 square meter area, the sum of the ratios for each radionu - clide of concentration present to the concentration limit will not exceed \"1\" (unity). A calculation of the potential peak annual TEDE within 1000 years to the average member of the critical group that would resu lt from applying the radium standard, not including radon, on the site must be submitted for approval. The use of decommissioning plans with bench - mark doses which exceed 100 mrem /yr, before application of ALARA, requires the approval of the department. This requirement for dose criteria doe s not apply to sites that have decommissioning plans for soil and structures approved before June 11, 1999. (h) The licensee shall also address the nonradiological ha zards associated with the wastes in planning and imple - menting closure. The licens ee shall ensure that disposal areas are closed in a manner that minimizes the need for further maintenance. To the extent n ecessary to prevent threats to human health and the environmen t, the licensee shall control, minimize, or eliminate post-closure escape of nonradiologi - cal hazardous constituents, leachat e, con taminated rainwater, or waste decomposition products to the ground or surface waters or to the atmosphere. 1In the case of thorium by-product materials, the standard applies only to design. Monitoring for radon emissions from thorium by-product mate - rials after installation of an appropri ately desig ned cover is not required. 2This average applies to the entire surface of each disposal area over a period of at least one year, but a pe riod short compared to 100 years. Radon will come from bo th by-product material s and from covering materials. Radon emissions from covering materials should be esti - mated as part of developing a clos ur e plan for each s ite. The standard, however, applies only to emissions from by-pr oduct materials to the atmosphere. Criterion 6A - (a) For impoundments containing ura - nium by-product materials, the final radon barrier must be completed as expeditiou sly as practicable considering tech - nological feasibility after th e p ile or impoundment ceases operation in accordance with a written, department-approved reclamation plan. (The term as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasib ility as specifically defined in WAC 246-252-010 includes factors beyond the control of the licensee.) Deadlines for comp letion of the final radon bar - rier and, if applicable, the following interim milestones must be established as a condition of the individual license: Wind - blown tailings retrieval and placement on the pile and interim st abilization (including dewatering or the removal of free - standing liquids and recontou ring). The placement of erosion protection barriers or other fe atures necessary for long-term control of the tailings must also be completed in a timely manner in accordance with a written, approved reclamation plan. (b) The department may approve a licensee's request to extend th e time for performan ce of milestones related to emplacement of the final radon ba rrier if, after providing an opportunity for public participation, the department finds that the licensee has adequately demonstrated in the manner required in subsection (6)(b) of this section (Criterion 6) that releases of Radon-222 do not exceed an average of 20 pCi/m 2s. If the delay is approved on the basis that the radon releases do not exceed 20 pCi/m2s, a verification of radon levels, as required by subsectio n (6)(b) of this section (Crite - rion 6), must be made annually during the period of delay. In add ition, once the department has established the date in the reclamation plan for the milest one for completion of the final radon barrier, the department may extend that date based on cost if, after providing an opportunity for public participa - tion, the department finds that th e licensee is making good faith efforts to emplace the final radon barrier, the delay is consistent with the definition s of available technology, and the radon releases caused by the delay will not result in a sig - nificant incremental risk to the public health. (c) The department may authorize by license amend - ment, upon licensee request, a portion of the impoundment to accept uranium by-product material or such materials that are similar in physical, chemical, and radiological characteristics to the uranium mill tailings and associated wastes already in the pile or impoundment from other sources, during the clo -WSR 16-10-086 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 110 ]sure process. No such authorization will be made if it results in a delay or impediment to emplacement of the final radon barrier over the remainder of the impoundment in a manner that will achieve levels of Ra don-222 releases not exceeding 20 pCi/m2s averaged over the entire impoundment. The veri - fication required in subsecti on (6)(b) of this section (Crite - rion 6) may be completed with a portion of the impoundment being used for further disposal if the department makes a final finding that the impoundment will continue to achieve a level of Radon-222 releas es not exceeding 20 pCi/m2s aver - aged over the entire impoundment. In this case, after the final radon barrier is complete except for the continuing disposal area: (i) Only by-product material will be authorized for dis - posal; (ii) The disposal will be limited to the specified existing disposal area; and (iii) This authorization will only be made after providing opportunity for public participation. Reclamation of the disposal ar ea, as appropriate, must be completed in a timely manner after disposal operations cease in accordance with subsection (6)(a) of this section (Criterion 6); however, these actions are not required to be complete as part of meeting the deadline for final radon barrier construc - tion. (7) Criterion 7 - At least one full year prior to any major site construction, a preoperational monitoring program must be conducted to provide complete baseline data on a milling site and its environs. Throughout the construction and operat - ing phases of the mill, an operational monitoring program must be conducted to complete the following: (a) To measure or evaluate compliance with applicable standards and regulations; (b) To evaluate performance of control systems and pro - cedures; (c) To evaluate environmenta l impacts of operation; and (d) To detect potenti al long-term effects. The licensee shall establish a detection monitoring pro - gram needed for the department to set the site-specific groundwater protection standard s in Criterion 5 of this sec - tion. For all monitoring under this paragraph, the licensee or applicant will propose for department approval as license conditions, which constituents are to be monitored on a site- specific basis. A detection monitoring program has two pur - poses. The initial purpose of the program is to detect leakage of hazardous constituents from th e disposal area so that the need to set groundwater protection standards is monitored. If leakage is detected, the second purpose of the program is to generate data and information needed for the department to establish the standards under Criterion 5. The data and infor - mation must provide a sufficient basis to identify those haz - ardous constituents which require concentration limit stan - dards and to enable the department to set the limits for those constituents and the compliance period. They may also need to provide the basis for adjustments to the point of compli - ance. For licenses in effect Se ptember 30, 1983, the detection monitoring programs must have been in place by October 1, 1984. For licenses issued after September 30, 1983, the detection monitoring programs must be in place when speci - fied by the department in orders or license conditions. Once groundwater protection standards have been established pur - suant to Criterion 5, the lice nsee shall establish and imple - ment a compliance monitoring program. The purpose of the compliance monitoring program is to determine that the haz - ardous constituent concentrations in groundwater continue to comply with the standards set by the department. In conjunc - tion with a corrective actio n program, the licensee shall establish and implement a co rrective action monitoring pro - gram. The purpose of the corr ective action monitoring pro - gram is to demonstrate the ef fectiveness of the corrective actions. Any monitoring program required by this paragraph may be based on existing monitoring programs to the extent the existing programs can meet the stated objective for the program. (8) Criterion 8 - Milling operations shall be conducted so that all airborne effluent releas es are reduced to as low as is reasonably achievable. The primary means of accomplishing this shall be by means of emission controls. Institutional con - trols, such as extending the site boundary and exclusion area, may be employed to ensure that off-site exposure limits are met, but only after all practicable measures have been taken to control emissions at the source. Notwithstanding the exis - tence of individual dose standards, strict control of emissions is necessary to assure that population exposures are reduced to the maximum extent reason ably achievable and to avoid site contamination. The greatest potential sources of off-site radiation exposure (aside from radon exposure) are dusting from dry surfaces of the tailings disposal area not covered by tailings solution and emissions from yellowcake drying and packaging operations. During operations and prior to closure, radiation doses from radon emissions from surface impound - ments shall be kept as low as is reasonably achievable. Checks shall be made and logged hourly of all parameters (e.g., differential pressure and scrubber water flow rate) which determine the efficiency of yellowcake stack emission control equipment oper ation. It shall be determined whether or not conditions are within a ra nge prescribed to ensure that the equipment is operating consis tently near peak efficiency; corrective action shall be taken when performance is outside of prescribed ranges. Effluent control devices shall be opera - tive at all times during drying and packaging operations and whenever air is exhausting from the yellowcake stack. Drying and packaging operat ions shall terminate when controls are inoperative. When checks indicate the equipment is not operating within the range prescribed for peak effi - ciency, actions shall be taken to restore parameters to the pre - scribed range. When this cannot be done without shutdown and repairs, drying and packag ing operations shall cease as soon as practicable. Operations may not be rest arted after cessation due to off-normal performance until n eeded corrective actions have been identified and implemente d. All such cessations, correc - tive actions, and restarts shall be reported to the department in writing, within ten days of the subsequent restart. To control dusting from tailings, that portion not covered by standing liquids shall be wetted or chemically stabilized to prevent or minimize blowing and dusting to the maximum extent reasonably achievable . This requirement may be relaxed if tailings are effectivel y sheltered from wind, such as may be the case where they are disposed of below grade and Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-086 [ 111 ] Proposedthe tailings surface is not expos ed to wind. Consideration shall be given in planning tailings disposal programs to meth - ods which would allow phased covering and reclamation of tailings impoundments since this will help in controlling par - ticulate and radon emissions during operation. To control dustings from diffuse sources, such as tailings and ore pads where automatic controls do not apply, operators shall develop written operating procedures specifying the methods of control which will be utilized. Milling operations producing or involving thorium by- product material shall be conduc ted in such a manner as to provide reasonable assurance th at the annual dose equivalent does not exceed twenty-five millirems to the whole body, seventy-five millirems to the thyroid, and twenty-five milli - rems to any other organ of a ny member of the public as a result of exposures to the pl anned discharge of radioactive materials, Radon-220 and its daughters excepted, to the gen - eral environment. Uranium and thorium by-product materials shall be man - aged so as to conform to the applicable provisions of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 440, Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category: Effluent Limitations Guide - lines and New Source Performance Standards, Subpart C, Uranium, Radium, and Vanadium Ores Subcategory, as cod - ified on January 1, 1983. The licensee shall establish a detection monitoring pro - gram needed to establish the groundwater protection stan - dards in subsection (5)(f) of th is section. A detection moni - toring program has two purposes. The initial purpose of the program is to detect leakage of hazardous cons tituents from the disposal area so that the need to set groundwater protec - tion standards is monitored. If leakage is detected, the second purpose of the program is to generate data and information needed for the department to establish the standards under subsection (5)(f) of this sect ion. The data and information must provide a sufficient basi s to identify those hazardous constituents which require concentration limit standards and to enable the department to set the limits for those constitu - ents and the compliance period. They may also need to pro - vide the basis for adjustments to the point of compliance. For licenses in effect September 30 , 1983, the detection monitor - ing programs must have been in place by October 1, 1984. For licenses issued after Sept ember 30, 1983, the detection monitoring programs must be in place when specified by the department in orders or license conditions. Once groundwa - ter protection standards have been established pursuant to subsection (5)(f) of this section, the licensee shall establish and implement a compliance monitoring program. The pur - pose of the compliance monitoring program is to determine that the hazardous constituent co ncentrations in groundwater continue to comply with the standards set by the department. In conjunction with a corrective action pr ogram, the licensee shall establish and implement a corrective action monitoring program. The purpose of the corrective action monitoring program is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective actions. Any monitoring program required by this paragraph may be based on existing monitoring programs to the extent the existing programs can meet the stated objective for the program.Daily inspections of tailings or waste retention systems must be conducted by a qualif ied engineer or scientist and documented. The department must be immediately notified of any failure in a tailings or waste retention system (( which )) that results in a release of tailings or waste into unrestricted areas, or of any unusual conditions (conditions not contem - plated in the design of the retention system) which if not cor - rected could indicate the potential or lead to failure of the sys - tem and result in a release of tailings or waste into unre - stricted areas. (9) Criterion 9 - (a) Pursuant to chapter 70.121 RCW, and except as otherwise provid ed, financial surety arrange - ments must be established by each mill operator before the commencement of operations to assure that sufficient funds will be available to carry out the decontamination and decommissioning of the mill and site and for the reclamation of any tailings or waste dispos al areas. The am ount of funds to be ensured by such surety arrangements must be based on department-approved cost estimates in a department- approved plan, or a proposed revision to the plan submitted to the department for approval, if the proposed revision contains a higher cost estimate for: (i) Decontamination and decommissioning of mill build - ings and the milling site to levels which allow unrestricted use of these areas upon decommissioning; and (ii) The reclamation of taili ngs or waste areas in accor - dance with technical criteria delineated in this section. (b) Each cost estimate must contain: (i) A detailed cost estimate for decontamination, decom - missioning, and reclamation, in an amount reflecting: (A) The cost of an independent contractor to perform the decontamination, decommissioning, and reclamation activi - ties; and (B) An adequate contingency factor. (ii) An estimate of the amo unt of radioactive contamina - tion in on-site subsurface material; (iii) Identification of and justification for using the key assumptions contained in the decommissioning cost estimate; and (iv) A description of the me thod of assuring funds for decontamination, decommis sioning, and reclamation. (c) The licensee shall submit this plan in conjunction with an environmental report that addresses the expected environmental impacts of the milling operation, decommis - sioning and tailings reclamatio n, and evaluates alternatives for mitigating these impacts. Th e plan must include a signed original of the financial instrument obtained to satisfy the surety arrangement requirements of this criterion (unless a previously submitted and appr oved financial instrument con - tinues to cover the cost es timate for decommissioning). The surety arrangement must also co ver the cost estimate and the payment of the charge for long -term surveillance and control required by subsection (10) of this section. (d) To avoid unnecessary duplication and expense, the department may accept financial sureties that have been con - solidated with financial or surety arrangements established to meet requirements of other fede ral or state agencies or local governing bodies for decommissioning, decontamination, reclamation, and long-term site surveillance and control, pro - vided such arrangements are cons idered adequate to satisfy WSR 16-10-086 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 112 ]these requirements and that th e portion of the surety which covers the decommissioning and reclamation of the mill, mill tailings site and a ssociated areas, and the long-term funding charge is clearly identified and committed fo r use in accom - plishing these activities. (e) The licensee's surety mechanism will be reviewed annually by the department to assure, that sufficient funds would be available for completi on of the reclamation plan if the work had to be performed by an independent contractor. (f) The amount of surety liability should be adjusted to recognize any increases or decreases resulting from: (i) Inflation; (ii) Changes in engineering plans; (iii) Activities performed; (iv) Spills, leakage or migra tion of radioactive material producing additional contamin ation in on-site subsurface material that must be remediat ed to meet applicable remedia - tion criteria; (v) Waste inventory increasing above the amount previ - ously estimated; (vi) Waste disposal costs increasing above the amount previously estimated; (vii) Facility modifications; (viii) Changes in authorized possession limits; (ix) Actual remediation cost s that exceed the previous cost estimate; (x) On-site disposal; and (xi) Any other conditions affecting costs. (g) Regardless of whether reclamation is phased through the life of the operation or takes place at the end of opera - tions, an appropriat e portion of surety liability must be retained until final compliance with the reclamation plan is determined. (h) The appropriate portion of surety liability retained until final compliance with the reclamation plan is deter - mined will be at least sufficient at all times to cover the costs of decommissioning and reclam ation of the areas that are expected to be disturbed before the next license renewal. The term of the surety mechanism must be open ended, unless it can be demonstrated that another arrangement would provide an equivalent level of assura nce. This assurance would be provided with a surety instrument which is written for a spec - ified time (for example five years) and which must be auto - matically renewed unless the su rety notifies the department and the licensee with reasonable time (for example ninety days) before the renewal date of their intention not to renew. In such a situation the surety requirement still exists and the licensee would be required to submit an acceptable replace - ment surety within a brief time to allow at least sixty days for the department to collect. (i) Proof of forfeiture must no t be necessary to collect the surety. In the event that the licensee cannot provide an acceptable replacement surety with in the required time, the surety shall be automatically collected before its expiration. The surety instrument must provide for collection of the full face amount immediately on de mand without reduction for any reason, except for trustee f ees and expenses provided for in a trust agreement, and that the surety will not refuse to make full payment. The conditions described previously would have to be clearly stat ed on any surety instrument which is not open-ended, and must be agreed to by all parties. Financial surety arrangements generally acceptable to the department are: (i) Trust funds; (ii) Surety bonds; (iii) Irrevocable letters of credit; and (iv) Combinations of the financial surety arrangements or other types of arrangements as may be approved by the department. If a trust is not used, then a standby trust must be set up to receive funds in the event the department exercises its right to collect the surety. The surety arrangement and the surety or trustee, as applicab le, must be acceptable to the department. Self-insurance, or any arrangement which essen - tially constitutes self-insurance (for example, a contract with a state or federal agency), will not satisfy the surety require - ment because this provides no ad ditional assurance other than that which already exists through license requirements. (10) Criterion 10 - (a) A minimum charge of two hun - dred fifty thousand dollars (1978 United States dollars) accrued as specified in WAC 246-235-086(4) to cover the costs of long-term surveillance shall be paid by each mill operator to the agency prior to the termination of a uranium or thorium mill license. If site surveillance or control require - ments at a particular site are determined, on the basis of a site-specific evaluation, to be significantly greater than those specified in (a) of this subsection (e.g., if fencing is deter - mined to be necessary), variance in funding requirements may be specified by the department. The total charge to cover the costs of long -term surveillance shall be such that, with an assumed one percent annual real interest rate, the collected funds will yield interest in an amount sufficient to cover the annual costs of site surveillance. The charge will be adjusted annually prior to actual paymen ts to recognize inflation. The inflation rate to be used is that indicated by the change in the consumer price index published by the United States Depart - ment of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Contributions by a licensee to the long-term care tr ust fund pursuant to chapter 70.121 RCW shall be transferred to cover the costs assessed under this criterion. (11) Criterion 11 - These criteria relating to ownership of tailings and their disposal si tes become effective on Novem - ber 8, 1981, and apply to all licenses terminated, issued, or renewed after that date. Any uranium or thorium milling license or tailings license shall contain such term s and conditions as NRC deter - mines necessary to assure that prior to termination of the license, the licensee will co mply with ownership require - ments of this criterion for sites used for tailings disposal. Title to the by-product material licensed pursuant to WAC 246-252-030 and land, including any interests therein (other than land owned by the Unit ed States or by the state of Washington) which is used for the disposal of any such by-product material, or is essential to ensure the long-term sta - bility of such disposal site, shall be transferred to the United States or the state of Washingto n. In view of the fact that physical isolation must be the primary means of long-term control, and government land ownership is a desirable sup - plementary measure, ownership of certain severable subsur - face interests (for example, mineral rights) may be deter - mined to be unnecessary to protect the public health and Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-086 [ 113 ] Proposedsafety and the environment. In any case, the applicant/opera - tor must demonstrate a serious effort to obtain such subsur - face rights, and must, in the event that certain rights cannot be obtained, provide notification in local public land records of the fact that the land is being used for the disposal of radioac - tive material and is subject to either a NRC general or spe - cific license prohibiting the disruption and disturbance of the tailings. In some rare cases, such as may occur with deep burial where no ongoing site surveillance will be required, surface land ownership transfer requirements may be waived. For licenses issued before November 8, 1981, NRC may take into account the status of the ownership of such land, and interests therein, and the ability of a licensee to transfer title and custody thereof to the United States or the state. If NRC, subsequent to title transfer, de termines that use of the surface or subsurface estates, or both, of the land transferred to the United States or to a state wi ll not endanger the public health, safety, welfare or environment, NRC may permit the use of the surface or subsurface estates, or both, of such land in a manner consistent with the provisions provided in these crite - ria. If NRC permits such use of such land, it will provide the person who transferred such land with the right of first refusal with respect to such use of such land. Material and land transferred to the United States or a state in accordance with this criterion must be transferred without cost to the United States or a state other than admin - istrative and legal costs incurred in carrying out such transfer. The provisions of this part, respecting transfer of title and custody to land and tailings and wastes, do not apply in the case of lands held in trust by the United States for any Indian tribe, or lands owned by such Indian tribe subject to a restriction against alienation im posed by the United States. In the case of such lands which are used for the disposal of by- product material, as defined in this section, the licensee shall enter into arrangements with NRC as may be appropriate to assure the long-term surveillance of such lands by the United States. (12) Criterion 12 - The final disposition of tailings or wastes at milling sites should be such that ongoing active maintenance is not necessary to preserve isolation. As a min - imum, annual site inspections must be conducted by the gov - ernment agency retain ing ultimate custody of the site where tailings or wastes ar e stored, to confirm the integrity of the stabilized tailings or waste systems, and to determine the need, if any, for maintenance or monitoring. Results of the inspection must be reported to NRC within sixty days follow - ing each inspection. NRC may require more frequent site inspections if, on the basis of a site-specific evaluation, such a need appears necessary, due to the features of a particular tailings or waste disposal system. (13) Criterion 13 - Secondary groundwater protection standards required by Criterion 5 of this section are concen - tration limits for individual ha zardous constituents. The list of constituents found in Appendix A of this chapter, chapter 246-252 WAC, identifies th e constituents for which stan - dards must be set and complied with if the specific constitu - ent is reasonably expected to be in or derived from the by- product material and has been detected in groundwater. For purposes of this criterion, the property of gross alpha activity will be treated as if it is a hazardous constitue nt. Thus, when setting standards under subsection (5)(j) of this section, the department will also set a limit for gross alpha activity.

Part 73 in the access authorization program under WAC 246- 237-021 through 246-237-033. NEW SECTION WAC 246-237-023 Access authorization program requirements. (1) Granting unescort ed access authorization. (a) Licensees shall implement the requirements of this chapter for granting initial or reinstated unescorted access authorization. (b) Individuals who have been determined to be trust - worthy and reliable shall also complete the security training required by WAC 246-237-043(3) before being allowed une - scorted access to Category 1 or Category 2 quantities of radioactive material. (2) Reviewing officials. Revi ewing official s are the only individuals who may make trustworthiness and reliability determinations that allow individuals to have unescorted access to Category 1 or Category 2 quantities of radioactive materials possessed by the licensee. (a) Each licensee shall name one or more individuals to be reviewing officials. After completing the background investigation on the reviewing of ficial, the licensee shall pro - vide, under oath or affirmat ion, a certification that the reviewing official is deemed trustworthy and reliable by the licensee. The fingerprints of the named reviewing official must be taken by a law enfor cement agency, federal or state agencies that provide fingerprinting services to the public, or commercial fingerprinting services authorized by a state to take fingerprints. The licensee shall recertify that the review - ing official is deemed trustworthy and reliable every ten years in accordance with WAC 246-237-025(2). (b) Reviewing officials must be permitted to have unes - corted access to Category 1 or Ca tegory 2 quantities of radio - active materials or access to sa feguards information or safe -guards information-modified handling, if the licensee pos - sesses safeguards information or safeguards information- modified handling. (c) Reviewing officials cannot approve other individuals to act as reviewing officials. (d) A reviewing official does not need to undergo a new background investigation before being named by the licensee as the reviewing official if: (i) The individual has undergone a background investi - gation that included fingerprinting and an FBI criminal his - tory records check and has been determined to be trustworthy and reliable by the licensee; or (ii) The individual is subject to a category listed in WAC 246-237-029(1). (3) Informed consent. (a) Licensees may not initiate a background investiga - tion without the informed and signed consent of the subject individual. This consent must include authorization to share personal information with other individuals or organizations as necessary to complete the background investigation. Before a final adverse determination, the licensee shall pro - vide the individual with an opportunity to correct any inaccu - rate or incomplete information that is developed during the background investigation. Licen sees do not need to obtain signed consent from those individuals who meet the require - ments of WAC 246-237-025(2). A signed consent must be obtained prior to any reinvestigation. (b) The subject individual ma y withdraw their consent at any time. Licensees shall in form the individual that: (i) If an individual withdraw s their consent, the licensee may not initiate any elements of the background investigation that were not in progress at the time the individual withdrew their consent; and (ii) The withdrawal of consent for the background inves - tigation is sufficient cause for denial or termination of unes - corted access authorization. (4) Personal history disclosure. Any individual who is applying for unescorted access authorization shall disclose the personal history information that is required by the licensee's access authorization program for the reviewing official to make a determination of the individual's trustwor - thiness and reliability. Refusal to provide, or the falsification of, any personal history information required by this chapter is sufficient cause for denial or termination of unescorted access. (5) Determination basis. (a) The reviewing official shall determine whether to permit, deny, unfavorably terminate, maintain, or administra - tively withdraw an individu al's unescorted access authoriza - tion based on an evaluation of a ll of the information collected to meet the requiremen ts of this chapter. (b) The reviewing official may not permit any individual to have unescorted access until the reviewing official has evaluated all of the information collected to meet the require - ments of this chapter and determined that the individual is trustworthy and reliable. The reviewing official may deny unescorted access to any indi vidual based on information obtained at any time during the background investigation.Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-086 [ 117 ] Proposed(c) The licensee shall document the basis for concluding whether or not there is reasona ble assurance that an individ - ual is trustworthy and reliable. (d) The reviewing official may terminate or administra - tively withdraw an individual's unescorted access authoriza - tion based on information obtained after the background investigation has been completed and the individual granted unescorted access authorization. (e) Licensees shall maintain a list of persons currently approved for unescorted acc ess authorization. When a licensee determines that a pe rson no longer requires unes - corted access or meets the acces s authorization requirement, the licensee shall remove the person from the approved list as soon as possible, but no later than seven working days, and take prompt measures to ensure that the individual is unable to have unescorted access to the material. (6) Procedures. Licensees shal l develop, implement, and maintain written procedures for implementing the access authorization program. The procedures must include provi - sions for the notification of individuals who are denied unes - corted access. The procedures must include provisions for the review, at the request of the affected individual, of a denial or termination of unescorted acces s authorization. The proce - dures must contain a provision to ensure that the individual is informed of the grounds for the denial or termination of une - scorted access authorization an d allow the individual an opportunity to provide additional relevant information. (7) Right to correct and complete information. (a) Prior to any final advers e determination, licensees shall provide each individual subject to this chapter with the right to complete, correct, an d explain information obtained as a result of the licensee's background investigation. Confir - mation of receipt by the individual of this notification must be maintained by the licensee for a period of one year from the date of the notification.

I. If multiple sources of the same radionuclide or multi - ple radionuclides are aggregated at a location, the sum of the ratios of the total activity of each of the radionuclides must be determined to verify whether the activity at the location is less than the Category 1 or Category 2 thresholds of Table 1, as appropriate. If the calculated sum of the ratios, using the equation below, is greater than or equal to 1.0, then the appli - cable requirements of this chapter apply. II. First determine the total activity for each radionuclide from Table 1. This is done by adding the activity of each indi - vidual source, material in any device, and any loose or bulk material that contains the radi onuclide. Then use the equation below to calculate the sum of the ratios by inserting the total activity of the applicable radi onuclides from Table 1 in the numerator of the equation and the corresponding threshold activity from Table 1 in the denominator of the equation.

Title of Rule and Other Identifying Information: Chapter 1 6-752 WAC, Noxious weed seed and plant quarantine, the agency is clarifying language and proposing to add additional species to the noxious weed s eed and plant quarantine. These species include: Butterfly bush ( Buddleja davidii), except for accepted Hearing Location(s): Washington State Department of Agricult ure (WSDA), Natural Resources Building, 1111 Washington Street S.E., Conference Room 205, Olympia, WA 98504-2560, on June 9, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. Date of Intended Adoption: June 23, 2016.

Assistance for Persons with Disabilities: Contact Deanna Painter by June 2, 2016, TTY (800) 833-6388 or 711. Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects , Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: This proposal adds butterfly bush ( Buddleja davidii), except for accepted sterile ( Marsilea mutica) to the noxious weed seed and plant quarantine, prohibiting their sale and distribution in Wash - ington state. Regulated status also applies to all synonyms of th ese botanical names and interspecies hybrids if both parents are regulated species. Adding these species to the quarantine to ensure these plants are not being sold through the nursery trade may be critical to th eir exclusion or control. In addition to adding species, WSDA is adding language cla rifying the fees charged for compliance agreements and defining what are \"regulated articles.\" Reasons Supporting Proposal: The purpose of the nox - ious weed seed and plant quarantine is to prevent the estab - lishment or spread of noxious weeds within the state by pro - hibiting their sale and movement. The noxious weed quaran - tine prohibits the sale of certain plant species that are determined to be invasive, nonnative, and harmful to our local ecosystems or disrupt agricultural production. Many of the quarantined species were introduced as ornamentals through the horticulture trade. Most of the listed species in the quarantine are also listed in chapter 16-750 WAC, the state noxious weed list, as a Cl ass A or Class B noxious weed, requiring mandatory control by county weed boards. How - ever, designation as a noxious weed on the state noxious weed li st doesn't prohibit its sale, allowing consumers to buy a plant species that's prohibite d by their county weed board. Prohibiting the sale of plants designated under the state nox - ious weed list for mandatory control will support the efforts of co unty weed boards to control noxious weeds. Statutory Authority for RCW 17.10.074, 17.24.011, and 17.24.041. Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision.

No small business economic im pact statement has been prepared under chapter 19.85 RCW. Regarding butterfly bush, yellow archangel, le sser celandine and nonnative hawkweeds, analysis of the economic effects of the proposed rule amendments demonstrates that the changes will not be more than a minor cost to small business in the regulated industry because alternative noninvasive species are readily available and, therefore, a small business economic impact Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-100 [ 129 ] Proposedstatement is not required. However, failure to adopt these changes has potential to have a large negative economic impact on the state due to the cost of eliminating these spe - cies if they were to become established. WSDA consulted department of ecology experts, and nursery industry experts that serve on the nursery advi sory committee to determine that Gymnocoronis spilanthoides and Marsilea mutica are not commonly sold in the nursery trade and therefore their listing has no economic impact on small business. A cost-benefit analysis i s not required under RCW 34.05.328. WSDA is not a listed agency under RCW 34.05.-328 (5)(a)(i). May 4, 2016 Brad White Assistant Director (Amending WSR 14-07-040, filed 3/12/14, effective 4/12/14) WAC 16-752-600 Establishing the noxious weed seed and plant quarantine. Washington agriculture, environmen - tal quality and natural resour ces, includi ng waters and wet- lands, are threatened by nonnati ve, aggressive species of nox - ious weeds. A number of thes e noxious weeds are transported and sold within the state of Washington both as nursery plants and as seeds in packets of flower seeds or \"wildflower mixes.\" Subsequent \"escape\" of these ornamentals has been a documented source of a number of infestations and has resulted in large public and private expenditures by landown- ers and land managers, weed bo ards, and weed districts and the department of agriculture to achieve the control mandated in chapter 17.10 RCW. The director of agriculture, pursuant to the powers provided in chapters 17.10 and 17.24 RCW, finds that regulation of the sa le of these seed packets and plants as \"regulated articles\" is necessary to protect Washing - ton agriculture and natural resources and to prevent public and private costs of control.

A small business economic imp act statement has been prepared under chapter 19.85 RCW. Small Business Economic Impact Statement SECTION 1: Describe the proposed rule, including a brief history of the issue; an explanation of why the pro - posed rule is needed; and a brief description of the prob - able compliance requirements and the kinds of profes - sional services that a small business is likely to need in order to comply with the proposed rule. The board is proposing a new section, WAC 246-933- 350, that would require veterinarians to provide clients a written prescription on request. Alternatively, if requested, the veterinarian would be required to call, fax, or electroni - cally send the prescription to a licensed pharmacy in Wash - ington state. Honoring a client's request for a prescription in lieu of dispensing is a provision of the AVMA Principals of Veteri - nary Medical Ethics. More than thirty states have adopted rules to require veterinarians to release prescriptions to cli - ents upon request. The proposed rules would provide pet owners flexibility and cost savings opportunitie s when obtaining medications for their pets. The cost savi ngs and options for accessing medications will allow pet owners, humane societies and res - cue groups with budget restric tions to provide better treat - ment for the pets in their care. SECTION 2: Identify which businesses are required to comply with the proposed ru le using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and what the minor cost 16-10-102 Washington St ate Register, Issue 16-10 Proposed [ 132 ]2013 County Business Patterns - Washington - Major Industries Threshold calculation NAICS codeNAICS code descriptionTotal establishmentsPaid employeesAnnual payroll Services769 216 231 223 89 7 3 0 0 0 SECTION 3: Analyze the probable cost of compliance. Identify the probable costs to comply with the proposed rule, including cost of equipm ent, supplies, labor, profes - sional services and increase d administrative costs; and whether compliance with the proposed rule will cause businesses to lose sales or revenue. There are minimal costs associ at ed with requiring veter- inarians to release prescriptions to clients upon request. When asked by the client, veterinarians would need to take the time to write the prescription an d give it to the client or, if they choose, call or fax the prescription to the pharmacy of the client's choice. If the vete rinary facility were to fill the prescription, appropriate veterinary staff would need to retrieve the drug, give it to the client, and keep records of drugs ordered and dispensed. There should not be a signifi - cant cost difference between the two scenarios. Veterinary facilities may lose revenue by complying wit h the proposed rule. Potential lost revenue is difficult to determine, as there are a number of variables that contribute to whether a client would fill their prescription at the veteri - nary clinic or at a phar macy. Factors could include: Client preferences for conv enien ce of filling the pre - scription at the veterinary clinic versus cost-savings of fi lling the prescrip tion at a pharmacy. Client confidence in obtaining a pet prescription through a pharmacy rather than the veterinary practice. Whether the drug is available through veterinary clinic only, or is widely available at pharmacies. The degree to which the veterinary clinic already offers cl ients written prescriptions in accordance with best practices. Honoring a client's request for a prescription in lieu of dispensing is a provision of the AVMA Principals of Veterinary Medical Ethics. SECTION 4: Analyze whether the proposed rule may impose more than minor cost s on businesses in the indus- try. The department has determined the proposed rule will not impose more than minor costs on businesses in the indus - try. When asked by the client, veterinarians would need to take the tim e to write the prescription and give it to the client or, if they choose, call or fax the prescription to the pharmacy of the client's choice. If the vete rinary facility were to fill the prescription, appropriate veterinary staff would need to retrieve the drug, give it to the client, and keep records of drugs ordered and dispensed. There should not be a signifi - cant cost difference between the two scenarios. The Oregon Veterinary Medi cal As sociation conducted a membership survey in 2012 related to veterinary prescrip - tions and retail pharmacies. At the time, Oregon did not re quire a veterinarian to releas e a prescription to the client upon request. Oregon received responses from twenty-one percent of the veterinary practi ces across the state. Ninety- five percent of respondents reported that they honor a client's request to have a prescription filled outside of the veterinary practice. Ninety-three percent said that they do not charge a fee when the client fills the prescription outside of the veteri - nary practice. Based on these responses from the Oregon survey, most veterinary practices currentl y release prescriptions. Anec - dotal evidence and comments r eceived during the rule draft - ing process indicate that this is a common practice for private veterinary practices in Washington too. This rule would not impose additional costs for bus inesses that already follow this practice. Comments received during the rule-making proces s also indicate that corporate veterinary practices are much more likely to impose policies that require the client fill their pre - scription at the clinic. These policies will need to be am ended, and there is a minor cost associated with this. SECTION 5: Determine whether the proposed rule may have a disproportionate impa ct on small businesses as compared to the ten percent of businesses that are the largest businesses required to comply with the proposed rule. Although potential lost revenue is difficult to determine because of multiple variables, the rule may have a dispropor - tionate impact on small businesses. As outlined in section 2, seven hun dred fifty-nine of the seven hundred sixty-nine vet - erinary businesses are small, emp loying fewer than fifty peo - ple. Small businesses serve the vast majority of patients, incl uding issuing prescriptions. Since results of the Oregon study indicated most veterinary practices currently release prescriptions, and anecdotal evid ence indicates that this is Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-103 [ 133 ] Proposedalso true in Washington, this rule is expected to have a mini - mal impact on most small businesses. SECTION 6: If the proposed rule has a disproportion - ate impact on small businesses , identify the steps taken to reduce the costs of the rule on small businesses. If the costs cannot be reduced provide a clear explanation of why. The proposed rule adds mini mal costs and therefore does not have a disproportionate impact on small businesses. SECTION 7: Describe how small businesses were involved in the developmen t of the proposed rule. The small businesses potentially impacted by this rule are small veterinary clinics owned by licensed veterinarians. The Washington State Veteri nary Medical Association (WSVMA) is a major representative of the veterinarians who own their practices. The board has worked closely with WSVMA in the development of the rule, and WSVMA does not have major concerns with the potential lost revenue to veterinarians. The board notified interested parties about the rule making and asked for comments. The board has not received any comments from ve terinarians regarding poten - tial lost revenue with the potential implementation of this rule. SECTION 8: Identify the estimated number of jobs that will be created or lost as th e result of comp liance with the proposed rule. The department does not antic ipate any jobs created or lost as a result of compliance with the proposed rule. A copy of the statement may be obtained by contacting Loralei Walker, 111 Israel Ro ad S.E., Tumwater, WA (360) 236-4947, fax (360) 236-2901, e-mail loralei. walker@doh.wa.gov. The proposed rule would not impose more than minor costs on businesses in an industry. A cost-benefit analysis is required under RCW 34.05.328.

Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: This proposal will change the process for the field inspection of trial grounds, and is being pursued both as a result of the recent change to the crucifer quarantine to incl ude eastern Washington, as well as a result of a petition for rule making received on this topic. In addition, changes to the rule language will increase clarity and readability. Reasons Supporting Proposal: To keep black leg out of Washington, the department has adopted permanent rules adding eastern Washington to the regulated area of the cruci - fer quarantine, and requiring testing of all crucifer seed lots. As a result of these changes to the crucifer quarantine, it has become necessary to change the trial ground process to make it applicable to eastern Washington production practices.

The pro - duction of crucifer vegetable seed is an important industry in Washington state. The economic well -being of that industry is threatened by the introduction of crucifer seed infected with certain bacterial and fungal pathogens. In addition, cer- tain crucifer species produce dormant seed that, if present in a seed lot will persist into su bsequent cropping years. The resulting \"volunteer\" plants have the potential to become established as weeds in Washington state. The director has determined that a quara ntine is needed to protect the Washington crucifer vegetable seed (( indus - try)), biofumigant and oi l seed industries from the introduc - tion of seed from areas known to be infected with (( certain pathogens )) black leg of crucifers and black rot and from the introduction of crucifer seed containing dormant seed.

AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 09-21-050, filed 10/14/09, effective 11/14/09) WAC 314-29-020 Group 1 violations against public safety. (1) Group 1 violations are considered the most serious because they present a direct th reat to public safety. Viola - tions beyond the first violation do not have a monetary option upon issuance of a violation notice. The liquor control board may offer a monetary option in lieu of suspension days based on mitigating circumstances as outlined in WAC 314-29- 015(4). (2) Group 1 violations will be counted sequentially rather than independently by group. For example, if a licensee received a violation for over service on one day and a violation for sale to a minor a week later, the sale to a minor would be treated as a second offense since both violations are in the same violation group.Violation Type 1st Violation2nd Violation in a two-year window3rd Violation in a two-year window4th Violation in a t wo-year window Violations involving minors: Sale or service to minor: Sale or ser - vice of alcohol to a person under 21 years of age.

WSR 16-10-113 PROPOSED RULES DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE [Filed May 4, 2016, 11:09 a.m.] Original Notice. Preproposal statement of in q uiry was filed as WSR 16- 07-041. Title of Rule and Other Identifying Information: Coastal mackerel purse seine fishery, duties of commercial receivers and processors. The Washington department of fish and wild - life (WDFW) is proposing a rule amendment relating to the sal e and processing of mackerel from commercial fisheries. The rule amendment will limit the amount of mackerel that commercial receivers and processors can process for pur - poses other than human consumption. This rule supports maximizing the value of the fish caught. Hearing Location(s): WDFW Region 6 Office, 48 Dev - onshire Road, Montesano, WA 98563, on June 9, 2016, at 10: 00 a.m. Date of Intended Adoption: On or after June 15, 2016. Submit Written Comments to: Lorna Wargo, 48 Devon - shire Road, Montesano, WA 985 63, e-mail Lorna.Wargo@ dfw.wa.gov, fax (360) 249-1229. Assistance for Persons with Disabi Contact Tami Lininger, TTY (800) 833-6388 or (360) 902-2267. Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The purpose of this proposal is to limit the am ount of mackerel commercial receivers and processors can pr ocess for purposes other than human consumption or bait (also known as \"reduction\"). As proposed, the amendment will limit the amount of mackerel that can be processed for purposes other than for human con - sumption to fifteen percent of total weight of mackerel landed for sale per vessel per year. The permanent rule alre ady limits the amount of sa rdine that commercial receiv -ers and processors can process for purposes other than for human consumption. The proposed rule applies the same limit to mackerel. Reasons Supporting Proposal: This proposal reflects the establ ishment of a new trial pu rse seine fishery for mackerel in 2016 and the intent to apply the same limits on the reduc - tion of mackerel as exist in r ule for sardine. Previously, mackerel could only be landed incidentally in the sardine purse seine fishery; the new fi shery, however, will allow tar - geted fishing for mackerel and the potential for a greater total vo lume of mackerel caught. The intent of the proposal is to maximize the mackerel catch va lue by promoting utilization of catch for human consumption over reduction and minimiz - ing wastage of fish not suitable for human consumption. Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW 77.12.047. Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision. Name of Proponent: Lorna Wargo, governmental. Name of Agency Personnel Responsible for and Impl ementation: Lorna Wargo, and Enforcement: Steve Crown, 1111 Washington Street S.E., Olympia, WA 98501, (360) 902-2373. A small business economic imp act statement has been prepared under chapter 19.85 RCW. Small Business Economic Impact Statement 1. Description of the Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements of the Proposed Rule: The proposed rule requires comm ercial receivers and proces - sors to record on the fish tic ket as \"reduction\" mackerel pur - chased for purposes other than for human consumption. Redu ction refers to the conversion of fish into fish flour, fish - meal, fish scrap, fertilizer, fish oil, other fishery products, or Washington State Register, Issue 16-10 WSR 16-10-113 [ 153 ] Proposedby-products, for purposes othe r than human consumption or fishing bait. 2. Kinds of Professional Services That a Small Busi - ness is Likely to Need in Order to Comply with Such Requirements: Compliance with the pro posed rule will not require professional services. 3. Costs of Compliance fo r Businesses, Including Costs of Equipment, Suppl ies, Labor, and Increased Administrative Costs: Fish tickets (also known as fish land - ing receipts) are prov ided by the department of fish and wild - life to commercial receivers and processors at no cost. Fish tickets must be completed for commercial landings of mack - erel. The proposed rule does no t affect any costs of compli - ance, it simply requires specific notation of the disposition of purchased mackerel catch when that catch is purchased for reduction. 4. Will Compliance with the Rule Cause Businesses to Lose Sales or Revenue? No, compliance will have no effect on sales or revenue. 5. Cost of Compliance for the Ten Percent of Busi - nesses That are the Largest Businesses Required to Com - ply with the Proposed Rules Using One or More of the Following as a Basis for Comparing Costs: 1. Cost per employee; 2. Cost per hour of labor; or 3. Cost per one hundred dollars of sales Cost of compliance will be insignificant. 6. Steps Taken by the Agen cy to Reduce the Costs of the Rule on Small Businesses or Reasonable Justification for Not Doing So: The agency provides printed fish tickets. 7. A Description of How the Agency Will Involve Small Businesses in the De velopment of the Rule: A hear - ing will be held to review the rules as part of the rule-making process. 8. A List of Industries That Will Be Required to Com - ply with the Rule: Commercial receivers and processors of mackerel.

Purpose of the Proposal a nd Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The board of optometry (board) is proposing to amend WAC 246-851-370 Employed doctors of optometry, franchises and equipment use agreements. The first sentence of this rule forbids that an optometrist's salary be contingent upon the number or per - centage of exams given or prescriptions filled by the optom - etrist. The board received a pe tition for rule making asking the board to consider removing this sentence. The board finds that this language is outdated and does not reflect current practice. Removing the first sent ence of the rule will provide clarity. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The proposed rule elimi - nates the restriction on compensation based on percentage of exams given while still requiring optometrists remain cogni - zant of their responsibilities as licensed optometrists. The rule also communicates to the licensees and the public that the optometry license is independent of different types of employment relationships. There are other regulations, such as chapter 19.68 RCW, Rebating by practitioners of healing professions that provide safe guards against prohibited busi - ness practices. Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW 18.54.070(2). Statute Being Implemented: RCW 18.54.070(2). Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision.

Purpose of the Proposal a nd Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The purpose of this proposal is to retain ge neral season deer hunting opportu - nity for 2016. In addition, the purpose of the proposal is to balance the hunting opportunity between user groups. The proposal also increases hunting opportunity when deer popu - lations allow, and reduces the opportunity when declining deer numbers warrant a change. Current proposed changes will reduce antlerless deer hunting opportunity for archery and muzzleloader hunters in several game management units in northeastern Washington. Reasons Supporting Proposal: This proposal provide[s] recreational deer hunting opportunity and protects deer from overharvest. The proposal continues general deer hunting season opportunities for 2016 in most game management units, but reduces archery an d muzzleloader antlerless deer hunting opportunity in several northeastern game manage - ment units as a conservative management strategy due to population uncertainty created by a blue tongue disease out - break in 2015. These changes were not proposed earlier, but ongoing information sharing necessitated additional pro - posed changes. Statutory Authority is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision. Name of Proponent: Washington department of fish and wildlife, governmental.
