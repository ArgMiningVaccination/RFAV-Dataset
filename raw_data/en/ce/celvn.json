And now, five weeks later, it has altered the fabric of our country's society in ways we have never seen in our lifetime. A section of our dining table is cluttered with bottles of homemade hand sanitizer, essential oils, vitamins, homeopathic and anthroposophic remedies, and homemade Chinese herbal tinctures. I was grateful for Dr. Adam Blanning's article with his step-by-step instructions and specific remedy recommendations for management of flu-like symp- toms. We shared it widely on our LILIPOH Facebook page and you will find it in this issue on page 8. To say we are living in uncertain times is an understatement. One thing I know for sure is that this is not a time to sit on the sidelines. Some spiri- tual teachers might tell you that we can separate ourselves out from politics, social justice, and active participation in shaping the world we want to live in. That we just need to recite mantras and say our prayers. I could not disagree more. As longtime readers of LILIPOH, we have been learning side by side about how Camphill co- workers and villagers live in community and care for those of all abilities, how biodynamic farmers grow food and restore the soil, and how anthroposophic doctors and nurses teach us about having agency over our own health through best practices for holistic self-care and care for others. It is times like these that we must put into practice what we have learned, share it with others, and come together in solidarity with those who are in need. Please take some time to learn about mutual aid, the history, and how to participate in it or start a mutual aid network in your community (page 27). Here are some ideas to get you started: Offer some money to a farmer in your commu- nity so they can donate food to those in need. Check in with friends who are out of work and see if they need groceries picked up, or some cash for supplies or to pay their utility bill. Buy a set of the remedies outlined in Dr. Blanning's article for someone in your com- munity who may not be able to afford them. Reach out and write to prisoners. Those who are detained are scared because they do not have access to proper sanitation or the capacity for social distancing. anthroposophyforprisoners.org/ In my own state, I am spending my extra time participating in a Covid-19 resource hotline and relief fund for undocumented workers and com - munity members, all of whom are excluded from unemployment insurance and the $1200 federal stimulus check. In families where some mem- bers are US Citizens, if even one family member uses an ITIN to pay their taxes, no member of that family will be eligible to receive the $1200 payment coming from the federal government. scholarshipjunkies.org/relief There is much work to be done. It can be over- whelming. One of the brightest young activists I know, a transgender, undocumented and unafraid young woman from Mexico, gave me some advice, she said, in the words of Dory from Finding Nemo, \"Just keep swimming.\" We're all in this together.

We can collectively work to understand \"When I am sick, what is my body trying to accomplish, what does it need to do to get better?\" and then we work to support those tasks. Fever is created by the immune system to physiologically aid the process of dissolving and clearing out what has become too isolated, too stuck, too cooled in our own body. Inflammatory reactions\u2014also part of the immune system's activity\u2014work to recognize and remove those things that do not belong in us, which why we get inflammations during infections with viruses and bacteria (even when we get a splinter in our finger). It is possible to guide and support the body to accomplish its tasks. The suggestions listed below are helpful for illnesses or flus with strong fever. One way to help reduce the chances of getting ill is to proactively give the body what it needs. Warmth, whether physical, emotional, or social, helps integrates us into a whole. That's not just a physiologic process\u2014helping others in our community by sharing useful information is a social and spiritual correlate to that process. Right now is a time in the world when we need to think about how we help each other, not just get stuck in fear. Consider sharing this with others in your community. Please note: this is offered as general educa- tional material which cannot replace the evalu- ation and guidance of a trained medical profes- sional. You should always seek help if someone seems to be seriously ill, if you are worried, or if things are not progressing as you expect. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 But here are some places you can start... Things to do at the beginning of a flu illness (or when you think you are headed that way and want to support good immunity and vitality): Slow down and go to bed if you are sick /go to bed early if you are on the edge of illness: Fear of missing work or school, of inconveniencing other people, or interrupting our own busy schedules too often drives people to eliminate any symptoms as soon as possible. But feeling sick and taking some ibuprofen to get through the rest of the day is not a good strategy for getting through a flu. It hampers your immune system and spreads ill- nesses (you are often most contagious when you are just starting to get sick). Instead: Really slow down and rest quietly, without excessive stimulation. Movies, music, email, Facebook and Netflix are still giving you a very rich \"sensory diet\"\u2014which takes energy. Cut out non-essential stress or stimulation. If you or someone in your family has a fever or the flu, allow space and time for deep, un- interrupted sleep. Don't rush back into usual If you or a loved one are showing signs of Covid19, contact your health care provider. We should all follow the guidelines from our state and local Departments of Health. Unless you are in need of hospitalization, you will be told to stay home\u2014this is where Dr. Blanning's recommendations below can be very helpful and supportive!

Support and Protect your Warmth. Remember, our immune system creates fever because it is an important tool of the immune system. When you block fever you are actually reducing the way your immune system can work with an infection: Physically: put on enough layers of clothes so that you have consistently warm hands and feet. If this is not enough, add a hat, hot tea, blankets, or a hot water bottle. Children's bod- ies are small and they always need at least an extra layer of clothing compared to the adults around them (if you are comfortable in a shirt, put the child in a sweater and hat). This step is especially important at the beginning of a flu illness, when fever is usually rising. The best thing you can do when a fever is rising is to help the whole body be warmed, because that is what the immune system is try- ing to do. You can find a helpful guide for work - ing with fever at anthromedics.org/PRA-0807-EN #list-sections-3 Warmth from natural fibers (such as wool and silk) is best. Avoid reflexively medicating with Tylenol or Ibuprofen just because there is an elevated temperature. Try not to get stuck in fear\u2014fear makes us cool, harden, and contract, the opposite of what our body really needs to accomplish to work through a flu. See \"Fever, Fear and Riding a Bicycle: Working with Fever in a Different Way\" ( denvertherapies.com/fever-fear-and-riding-a- bicycle-working-with-fever-in-a-different-way ) Cleansing. When you are ill, your body naturally reorients its activity to reduce the amount of outside substances and influences it has to deal with so that it can focus on the illness at hand. You can support this process through a simple diet: protein should be avoided; instead teas, vegetable broths or soups, and simple grains can be given. If someone does not have an appetite, don't force them to eat, but do make sure they are still drinking. Lots of warm fluids should be taken, particu- larly Equisetum (Horsetail) Tea, which is useful for both hydration as well as cleansing the kidney system. Thyme, Elderberry blossom, LILIPOH SPRING 2020 11 REDUCING STRESSLime blossom, and Sage teas (possibly with honey and lemon) are also good for respira- tory congestion. No caffeine, alcohol, white sugar or processed foods. When there is high fever it is a good idea to clean out your digestive system with a dose of Milk of Magnesia or a glycerin suppository. This is especially important if you tend towards constipation or a sluggish digestion. Natural Medicines to help you get through the flu*: these are anthroposophic or homeopathic preparations (OTC = available over- the-counter, Rx = prescription; TB = True Botanica pharmacy, Ur = Uriel pharmacy, We = Weleda pharmacy) It is good to get these medicines so that you have them on hand when you need them\u2014don't wait until you are already in bed with the a fever! FOR BOTH PROPHYLAXIS (PREVENTION) AND TREATMENT OF FLU: Meteoric Iron Prunus pellets or ampules (OTC, Ur) For prevention, take 5-10 pellets, once a day For treatment of flu symptoms, 5-10 pellets, 3-5 times a day FOR FEVER: Apis Belladonna pellets or liquid (OTC, Ur and We, also known as Erysidoron #1, Rx, We) most helpful in the early stages of a fever, especially when the head is hot but the feet and hands are cool. Given as a drop/pellet per year of age, up to 10 drops/pellets for an older child or adult. Can be given up to every two hours.FOR FEVER AND CHILLS, BODY ACHES, BRONCHITIS: Gelsemium Bryonia pellets (OTC, Ur), especially if feeling weak, pale, with dull headache Children 5 pellets, Adults 10 pellets, up to 5x/day Infludo liquid or Infludoron pillules (Rx, We), for flu symptoms that are more in the airways, and for prevention of pneumonia: Children 10-20 drops of Infludo liquid in \u00bd cup of water, sip slowly through the day, or ages 1-5, 3-5 Infludoron pillules every two hours, ages 6-12, 5-10 pillules up to every two hours Adults 8-10 drops of Infludo liquid up to every 2 hours, 10-15 Infludoron pillules up to every two hours FOR MUSCLE ACHES, HEADACHE THAT COMES WITH STRONG FEVER: Arnica 30x (widely available OTC), can be used up to five times a day FOR SWOLLEN GLANDS, CONGESTION: Archangelica oil (OTC, TB), Archangelica Euca\u00ad lyptus and We) Rub into swollen gland 2-3 times a day IN THE RECOVERY PHASE: Blackthorn Tonic (OTC, TB) or Prunus liquid (OTC, Ur, Prunus body oil (OTC, Ur) EXTERNAL TREATMENTS*: Wrapped compresses: for bronchitis and working to prevent pneumonia. e.g., Wrapped quark (curd, or \"Farmer's cheese\") compresses. These have been found to be very helpful. Note: American cottage cheese, with the liquid squeezed out, can serve as a replacement if you are 12 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESSunable to find quark. For instructions, see: pflege-vademecum.de/qbw.php Wrapped mustard compresses can be helpful for the elderly and those who are bed-ridden, though it is a strong treatment and needs to be done with caution and care, as the mustard can actually burn the skin if the compress is left in place for too long. Mustard compresses are best done with the guidance or assistance of someone experienced in this process. For instructions, see: pflege-vademecum.de/ senf-thorax-wickel.php Wrapped ginger compresses bring a deep, lasting, penetrating warmth, for when you are inwardly chilled but not having a strong fever reaction. For instructions, see: pflege-vademecum.de/itrw.php Inhalations: which can be done simply by making a tent with a towel draped over an open bowl: Table salt steam inhalation: for mild obstructive bronchitia, for congestion and sinus pressure.OVERALL: Keep yourself dressed warmly enough that you cannot get a chill; especially protect your chest and neck from getting cold. This is helpful before (preventatively), during, and for some time after an illness Take the time you need to recover Seek help when you need it If you are well, make someone else who is sick a pot of soup You can find more information about local anthro- posophic practitioners, nurses and therapists at AnthroposophicHealth.org * Some of the descriptions about medicines and nursing treatments listed here draw from more complete information which can be found at vademecum.org Adam Blanning, MD , practices anthroposophic family medicine in Denver, Colorado.

We are forced to move, a re- lationship breaks apart, a workplace conflict urges us to change jobs, or perhaps we find ourselves swamped in debt. These life challenges are very hard but spur us on to make needed changes in our life. Often, the process of change is difficult, and we feel dis-ease. With time and numerous adjustments, however, we typically find ourselves back on course. But what about those events which are so shocking and profound that they seem to stop us in our tracks, causing us to freeze, unable to move on? These are life's traumatic events. They seem to come out of left field, unexpect- edly, and often they drastically alter our life, for the worse it seems. A terrible car accident may leave us in great pain, unable to work, and unable to care for ourselves and our family. A significant betrayal may break our trust in hu- manity, causing us to isolate and withdraw from social engagement. Or perhaps it is a daily be- trayal, such as domestic violence or child abuse where our very safety may be at risk. We might be witness to a terrible shooting or victims of strengthening the community Together in Trauma SUSAN OVERHAUSER, PHD 14 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESSterrorism. How do we cope with these significant traumas? Sudden shocks alter how we experience events. With a sudden shock, we are as if shaken out of ourselves. Instead of processing the event with our thinking engaged, we are placed in a state of alarm. The bells of our nervous system are ringing high alert. The amygdala lights up and fires warning signals. In response, the frontal lobes (the part of our brain which sup- ports reasoning), go offline, unable to respond. Instead, blood flows to our limbs in the hope we can perhaps avert danger by fighting or fleeing. In this bodily state, perceptions of the world go directly into our body-mind, unfiltered by thinking. Traumatic events can become lodged in the perceptual memory supported by our right brain\u2014without being connected to linear time and our autobiographical sense of self. We become stuck in a trauma time where the dangerous event is omnipresent and our life is always in danger. Normal memory fails at these times. People often report amnesia during and immediately after traumatic events. It is as if our biology is protecting us from the reality of know- ing how much our life is or was at stake. After the traumatic event passes, the body's functioning gradually returns. Animals will typically go through a phase of trembling to release the nervous tension of the situation, before getting back up to enter life again. People blessed with resilience will draw family and friends close and process the experience with those they trust. Ideally, they allow time to recover and recuperate. Many humans, however, often try to resume daily life as soon as possible after a trauma, without taking time to realize how deeply the trauma impacted them. Once again, it is as if the psyche doesn't want the whole person to be aware of the depth of the trauma. It is these unresolved traumas, stuck in trauma time, which cause so much trouble for us. With deeply impactful trauma such as being near an explosion or being threatened with a knife, or with traumatic experiences repeated over time (such as repeated physical or sexual abuse), the tracks of trauma on the body and nervous system are deeply grooved. Individuals experience hyper- vigilance, an expectation that bad things may occur at any moment. Sudden or loud noises cause an immediate and excessive startle response. Part of one's attention is always alert to potential sources of danger. One finds oneself always orienting to BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE EVENTS WHICH ARE SO SHOCKING AND PROFOUND THAT THEY SEEM TO STOP US IN OUR TRACKS, CAUSING US TO FREEZE, UNABLE TO MOVE ON?

The trauma(s), stuck in omnipres- ent trauma time, is never over, but is potentially happening again at every moment. This is the type of trauma which requires help and interven - tion from caring others. There are several differ- ent types of approaches to treating trauma. One is a top-down approach, using cognition to make sense of what happened to one, and developing insight. This is accomplished through what is called talk therapy, which in- cludes much more than mere talk. Good therapy includes warm caring from the coun- selor, a holding empathic en- vironment, the development of a collaborative trusting relationship, and working through issues not just cog- nitively, but also through the counseling relationship. For many survivors of childhood neglect or abuse, the relation- ship with the therapist is the first genuine empathic rela - tionship they have allowed themselves to truly take in, and this itself is the source of much healing.

Flooding involves re-experiencing the traumatic event almost as if it is happening in the moment, this time feeling the full impact on one's feelings\u2014experiencing the terror, panic, grief, and loss. Experiencing the feelings and implications in full consciousness allows emotional processing to occur. If the full event is recalled, including what happened before and after the event, the trauma is properly placed in autobiographical time, and the body-mind no longer regards the experience as omnipresent. In other words, it is moved from trauma time to ordinary time in the memory. This type of work can now be done much less intensely and more safely with methods such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). However, with both talk therapy and flooding, aspects of the trauma may remain in the body as tension patterns or automatic patterned responses to certain events (panic upon being behind the wheel of a car, for example). In these instances, a body-based approach is called for. There are several new forms of somatic therapy particularly effective at processing trauma which is held in body memory. Most widely known are Somatic Experiencing, which works quite well with single incident trauma, and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, which works with developmental trauma as well as single incident trauma. One of the complicating factors of significant traumatic events is amnesia. It is the nature of trauma to overwhelm the natural meaning-making systems at the time of the event. The danger to life or limb, the danger to important attachment relationships, and the danger to the sense of self can be so intense that the psyche cannot tolerate SUDDEN SHOCKS ALTER HOW WE EXPERIENCE EVENTS. WITH A SUDDEN SHOCK, WE ARE AS IF SHAKEN OUT OF OURSELVES. INSTEAD OF PROCESSING THE EVENT WITH OUR THINKING ENGAGED, WE ARE PLACED IN A STATE OF ALARM. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 17 REDUCING STRESSknowing what is happening. In these instances, the body-mind will typically dissociate. To dissociate means the event is compartmentalized and not connected with the rest of ongoing reality; the event is lost in an unremembered dissociative fog. Dissociation is an amazing capacity of the mind to break off intolerable emotion and sequester it in hidden areas of the mind where it is lost to easy access. Dissociation is a very powerful de- fense. Once a person begins using dissociation, it is then often used for all intolerable emotional experiences afterwards. That is, the experience of overwhelming trauma leaves the individual vulnerable to a style of coping which includes avoidance of strong emotion and amnesia for large sections of life experience. This in turn causes the individual to feel confused by life events, as he finds himself responding in ways which don't correlate directly with events themselves. A variety of triggers in the environment may automatically set off old response patterns, or hyper-reactive emotional responses. One is triggered and either gets overly emotionally wrought (panicky, anxious, hyperactive)\u2014hyper-aroused\u2014or one goes numb (frozen, sleepy, depressed)\u2014hypo-aroused. A reaction in one direction is followed frequently by a reaction in the other direction; suddenly the person's life seems like a chaotic mess, an emo- tional roller-coaster. It is particularly impactful when children are exposed to trauma over long periods of time. While experiencing trauma and dissociation, children lack the cognitive and emotional resources to cope with the rest of life, even if life is normal. The developmental tasks of the stages during and after the trauma might be skipped over or engaged with on a surface level, without much success. These afflicted souls might find themselves as adults, finally away from the abusive settings, unable to cope with the challenges of adult life. These indi- viduals benefit from therapy with a psychotherapist who specializes in treating trauma, as the resulting issues are complex and multifaceted. Developing resilience is both the antidote to trauma and a protective factor. Resilience is a term used to characterize all those qualities and aptitudes which help one to manage life's very challenging moments with greater ease. A very important feature of resilience is social support. Individuals with strong attachment relationships to parents or romantic partners fare better. People with considerable social support\u2014whether in the form of close friendships or group membership\u2014 also tend to respond better. The most significant determinant of whether a trauma will have last- ing effects is whether or not the individual has someone with whom to talk deeply about the experience very soon after it happens. Additional resources include financial stability, intelligence, adaptability, a sense of competence, and an internal locus of control\u2014a sense that one has control over one's life, rather than life just hap- pens to one. Each and every one of us is capable of reduc- ing the level of trauma in the world by helping our friends and acquaintances when they are challenged by life events. Association treats dis- sociation. Friendship heals alienation. Integration heals compartmentalization. Trust heals mistrust. These brief rules-of-thumb can serve as helpful reminders when we forget how to cope with reactions and emotions that arise from something perhaps forgotten! As we seek and find the true humanity in each other, the whole community strengthens. Trauma can bring people together. We gather strength from each other. Living in true togetherness, we are the solution.

In the lecture titled \"Concerning the Soul Life in the Breathing Process,\" Rudolf Steiner gave an example of how \"anxiety depends simply on inhalation and exhalation,\" and linked the breathing process as a means of triggering the experience of panic in a nightmare. Anxiety, in its many forms, is the most common health issue of our time. It is certainly a common issue seen by health profes- sionals and educators. Here I will briefly discuss the breathing process within the human rhythmi- cal system, research on the connection between breath and health, and how to anchor the breath as a path to wellbeing and calm by introducing the Take Four Out-Breathing Technique. In numerous lectures, Rudolf Steiner discusses the breathing process as a measured rhythmical experience in the human being (for example, in \"The Metamorphoses of the Soul Forces,\" Berlin, LILIPOH SPRING 2020 19 1917; and \"The Relationship Between the Breathing and the Circulation of the Blood,\" Dornach, 1923), specifically noting we take eighteen breaths every seventy-two heartbeat\u2014or one breath every four beats. He also notes this rhythmical measure is connected to the breathing process of the earth (such as the rhythms of night and day, sleeping and waking, and lived experience in the world), where we take in daily experiences of life as well as give something of ourselves out to the world. He also highlights the earth's rhythm with the sun during the four seasons. For example, in \"The Cycle of the Year as Breathing-Process of the Earth,\" he explains the characteristics of the seasons and all of the cosmic events which take place during those times (mid-winter as a deep inward holding of the breath, spring as the beginning of the out- ward movement of the breath, mid-summer as a complete exhale, and the autumn as the breathing forces beginning the return movement inwardly again). In brief, there is a correlation between the outside universe and what happens within each person, so \"that our inner rhythm can be found outside on earth as well.\" Significantly, it is impor- tant to see the rhythmic systems within the human being and of the earth are tireless and constantly in motion\u2014moving perpetually in a lemniscate of activity and rest. Steiner's ideas about the connection between the measures of heart rate and breath show up in modern research focused on heart rhythm coher- ence (McCraty & Tomasino, 2004): the \"orderly and harmonious synchronization among various systems in the body such as the heart, respiratory system and blood-pressure rhythms\" (HeartMath Institute, 2020). Researchers have found this pat- tern of heart rate and breath is directly connected to health outcomes. For example, they have been able to see how an erratic or disordered heart rhythm pattern related to frustration can shift to a smooth, harmonious, and coherent pattern when a person self-generates a heartfelt feeling of ap- preciation. Using brief practices of heart-focused breathing while remembering positive emotional states (such as appreciation, care, or love), people have been able to increase and maintain extended periods of heart rhythm coherence, preventing or reducing stress responses (McCraty & Tomasino, 2004). Research on slow breathing has also been shown to have positive health effects, due to the increase in breath and heart rate synchronicity, lowered blood pressure, and an overall state of relaxation (Russo, Santarelli, & O'Rourke, 2017). In light of these ideas, the Take Four Out- Breathing Technique is a short practice which aims to work with the rhythm of a particular aspect of the breath, emphasizing the out-breath cycle (pas- sive, inward aspect of the breath) that increases the heart rate coherence and slows the breath for assistance with anxious states. The practice is as follows: Take Four Out-Breathing Technique (Time of exercise: approximately one minute) Make sure to keep the eyes open during the exercise. Take a long sigh to help the body experience the physiological feeling of the quick and full out-breathing experience. Muscles should significantly let go in the upper body leaving a feeling of dropping down and releasing all muscle tension. Take a second sigh to re-experience the drop-down letting-go experience. A feeling of heaviness may be experienced. Take a normal in-breath (how much the body needs without pressure to breathe in deeply). Allow the body to do what it needs to do to breathe in normally. Breathe out slowly (follow the breath out and down to the relaxed, letting-go state where the lungs are totally empty). Mentally count one. 20 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESS Take a second normal in-breath. Breathe out slowly. Mentally count two. Take a third normal in-breath. Breathe out as slowly as possible. Mentally count three. Take a fourth normal in-breath. Breathe out as slowly as possible. Mentally count four. Take a fifth normal in-breath. I recommend patients practice for four days, a minimum of four times a day in relaxed times, to teach the body to feel and experience the relaxed, passive state of the out-breath before using it in anxious or stressful times. The practice can be done at any time, walking, sitting, or ly- ing down. A cue word can also be added to the breath count; a word that triggers the body to relax such as calm, let go, or relax. The cue word can be added in the following way. Breathe out as slowly as possible: follow the breath out and down to the relaxed, letting-go state where the lungs are totally empty; mentally, count one and say the cue word; then continue on through the remaining steps of the technique. If the practice is done consistently, saying the cue word to oneself can trigger the relaxation state and the Take Four breathing process can begin easily. Healthy breathing and rhythmical processes have positive and significant impact on well-being, the potential to decrease anxiety, and may in- crease more positive emotional and physiological states. With practice, the Take Four Out-Breathing Technique can assist patients struggling with anxiety, in its various forms, as a first step towards healing. REFERENCES McCraty, R. & Tomasino, D. (2004).

[CAN] INCREASE AND MAINTAIN EXTENDED PERIODS OF HEART RHYTHM COHERENCE.Homeostasis describes a thousand miracles happening every moment. If we're hot, our bodies automatically work to cool us down; if we're cold, they work to warm us up\u2014to keep us at the ideal temperature ninety-eight degrees Fahrenheit, plus or minus a couple of degrees. If our body temperature exceeds five degrees colder or warmer, our organs shut down, whole systems fail, we hallucinate, and we die. People differ in ability to tolerate extremes. Early in World War II, when German submarines began sinking British cargo ships, the old sailors hung on to pieces of wreckage cursing the enemy, until they were rescued. The younger merchant seamen couldn't tolerate the cold water and died. These die-offs were so disturbing England embraced the Outward Bound movement to train young people, who, growing up in factory towns, had not experienced the challenges of the big world. We will call this resilience, the ability to tolerate wider variations in homeostasis. Understanding homeostasis of the body will help us understand how those old sailors survived. Taken for granted, because unconscious, very sophisticated, overlapping systems are sensitive to small changes in temperature, acidity (pH), the right concentration of hundreds of enzymes and hormones in the blood and gut, and more, human sensory systems respond swiftly. Opening the pores in skin, exuding sweat to evaporate, lifting the hairs to create a bit more insulation, opening and closing (dilation and constriction) of blood vessels, directing blood to the periphery or to the core, breathing more quickly (or deeper or shallower)\u2014our bodies do all this without think - ing. Botanists describe the opening and shutting of the thousands of pores in the leaves of plants, the stomata, with awe. Trees have hormones also, showing at its base, homeostasis of the body oc- curs in the etheric body (sensitive to conditions of the environment, both outer and inner). Each organ of the body has its own best level of acidity, temperature, and other qualities. There are many sub-systems within the whole, each with its own watchers and regulators. Maintaining homeo-stasis (same-state) requires negative feedback loops. When the heat goes up above the normal, an enormous number of unseen assistants react with actions that say, \"Don't go that way! Come back to center!\"\u2014reacting against stimuli. One gets the picture of multitudinous sense organs and responders pushing away any stimuli taking the body away from the comfort of average. This is the extraordinary ordinary of homeostasis. Playing soccer, meditating on a mountain top, extreme sports, to such challenges to homeosta- sis, most people respond, \"Nope, not for me, I'd rather stay at home\" (a negative feedback loop) \"and watch it on my television.\" The decision to stay at home introduces the notion of a homeostasis of the soul. What are the hot/cold correlates in the world of soul? The Homeostasis of the Soul DAVID TRESEMER, PHD 22 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESSworkshop of soul manages the meeting ground of the dynamic physical world and the I (the spark of spirit come to earth to have experience through the body). Though strong, the I is also delicate. The soul produces a personality to surround and protect the I. A little life experience can open anyone to the notion of spirit powers residing beyond the edges of our sensory awareness. Those who are oriented to self-development, to spiritual experi- ences\u2014seekers or indeed anyone who keenly observes the world\u2014have likely had experiences that have proven to them unseen powers exist. And one's destiny is in part to travel back along the path of one's own I to one's origin in spirit-lands. One can feel one's destiny as issuing from spirit- powers; one can ardently desire direct experience of them, as a birthright. However, these powers can be dangerous. One takes a substance, some form of DMT or LSD or any of a number of chemi- cal substances, and has a blast of light, and sees truth, and beholds universes\u2014\"To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wildflower,\" as Blake wrote\u2014and enters paradise. This seems the right direction, returning home, as some say, or seeing the light, or finding God. Why can't one stay there? Why does one come back with a hangover, or lingering dullness, or a difficulty with integrating that may last months? Because of homeostasis of the soul. The hu- man soul cannot tolerate the blast of light, insight, power, energy, kundalini\u2014not beyond a glimpse. Let's say we have a blast of a different kind\u2014a car-wreck or an explosion or a fall off a ladder. Both body and soul react by rejecting the stimuli as best each can. At the soul level, we edit, misperceive, repress, forget. Homeostasis. The soul mediates the necessities of physical existence\u2014the homeostasis of the body\u2014and the immense powers of spirit. The soul builds a personality, eccentricities, peculiarities, tempera- ments, and habits to protect the I. These all act as buffers to protect the body and the I from being burned to a crisp by spirit-powers. The soul will even go to the lengths of creating pathologies. OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder, DSM #300.31 ) engages our attention or agoraphobia\u2014 fear of public or open places (DSM #300.22) takes our mind off anything spiritual. Psychopathology has so many ways to create consuming distrac- tions\u2014in service of homeostasis. Are we claiming all the pathologies in the DSM are created by the sufferer as a form of defense? To a degree, yes. It's important to understand how TRAUMA IS WHEN AN EXPERIENCE CROSSES THE LINE OF HOMEOSTASIS AND HASN'T BEEN CONTROLLED.

Understanding disease as an attack from outside on an innocent victim may have some truth to it; the point here is to understand also how homeostasis works from the inside. Because of negative feedback loops, any experience that exceeds the pleasant dullness of normal is rejected, ignored, suppressed, or misconstrued. Trauma is when an experience crosses the line of homeostasis and hasn't been controlled. Using the metaphor of body homeo- stasis, trauma is as if one has been burned or frostbitten and can't ignore it. One thing to note about trauma\u2014the traumatized remember only a tiny fraction of what happened. In other words, the rest has been wiped out or submerged by the systems of homeostasis of the soul. What has been remembered so exceeds the normal, it has become a conduit for spirit-powers (which have large impacts on a person's life). Everyone has experienced some kind of trauma upon which to test these observations. (More comments about trauma another time.) In the anthroposophic psychology course, we list the many ways the soul as protector creates WE ARE INVITED TO CULTIVATE POSITIVITY BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS TEND TOWARD THE NEGATIVITY OF REJECTING MOST EVERYTHING. BECAUSE OF HOMEOSTASIS, POSITIVITY DOES NOT COME NATURALLY, AND MUST BE ENCOURAGED, DAILY, IN LITTLE STEPS. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 25 REDUCING STRESSenergy-structures in each human. It is like the streets of Paris during a revolution. People feel the spirit-powers (soldiers) coming to overwhelm them; they barricade the streets with their kitchen chairs and tables, their beds, their transport-carts, all precious, all familiar. In this manner, the soul works to protect against the powers of spirit energy. The familiarity of the pieces constructing our barricades\u2014our person- alities\u2014makes it easier to say, \"Nah, that's not a barricade\u2014that's me, really me!\" Examining homeostasis of soul helps us un- derstand why earnest seekers, some who have meditated or chanted or hyperventilated for years, have accomplished so little. It explains why we see students of spiritual science whose capabilities are obvious, yet they sabotage themselves through crippling self-doubt and debilitating habits and why people who take high doses of LSD or DMT have amazing experiences, but are unable to maintain them, or to get on with their lives. When we attempt to gain access to spirit, we actually work against ourselves. We use the barricades to protect us from being burned up by spirit. Ironically, we are meant to achieve awareness and cooperation with spirit. We do this not by storming the gates of heaven with intense breakthroughs, but by proceeding step by step, progressively softening our defenses, dismantling our pathologies. Rudolf Steiner gave exercises that seem so frustratingly slow, yet with patience build strong pathways, small at first, through the barricades meant to protect our I. (We will mention only a few here.) Steiner invites each of us to develop equanimity. Why? Because humans tend to high dramas that heap the protective barricades higher. Thus equanimity must be cultivated, daily, with active awakeness and compassion for oneself. We are invited to cultivate positivity because human beings tend toward the negativity of reject- ing most everything. Because of homeostasis, positivity does not come naturally, and must be encouraged, daily, in little steps. We are invited to nurture openness because human beings tend to protect ourselves through closed minds and hearts, through prejudice, pre- conception, and contraction. The best response to the news becomes, \"Hmm, how interesting!\" and \"Wonder what the full story might be?\". All of these are best learned through relation- ship with other human beings, the friends and foes with whom we came to wrestle again and again, who teach us over time how not to be victims, but co-creators. Relationships will pull us out of the tendency of homeostasis to cocoon ourselves. At the soul level, these disciplines increase our resilience so, in the world of soul and spirit, we become more like the old sailors in the cold ocean, expanding the limits of what we can tolerate. This description is simplified from the com- plexity underlying all these dynamics. Part of this complexity is deliberate obfuscation by the soul\u2014another technique of homeostasis.

The links below will take you to a wealth of interesting information ranging from the kind of activities a mutual aid network can offer, how to start a mutual aid network in your community, the history of mutual aid, and how and why mutual aid differs from top down institutional non-profit organizations and charity. What is mutual aid? According to Dean Spade, Associate Professor at Seattle University School of Law, and scholar of the mutual aid movement, \"Mutual aid is a term to describe people giving each other needed material support, trying to resist the control dynamics, hierarchies and system-affirming, oppressive arrangements of charity and social services. \"Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions, not just through symbolic acts or putting pressure on their representatives in government, but by actually building new social relations that are more survivable. Most mutual aid projects are volunteer-based, with people jumping in to participate because they want to change what is going on right now, not wait to convince corporations or politicians to do the right thing.\" Spade lists some of the ways that mutual aid is different from charity: An understanding that it is the system, not the people suffering under it, that creates poverty, crisis, and vulnerability Governance/control by people who are most effected (can mean having a membership base of those most effected, or being formed in ways that ensure those providing the aid are from the same group as those giving the aid, or models that allow allies to participate but focus on accountability to those being served) Transparency about how they work, any money they use or manage (many mutual aid projects are not funded and are all volunteer run) Open meetings and pathways for new people to join and participate Political education within the organization to help those working in the project to expand their awareness of experiences that are not their own, to build solidarity, and to make the project supportive and welcoming to marginalized people Humility and willingness to accept feedback about how to make the project more useful to the people it serves: Long-term commitment to provide the aid the project works on Connection to and solidarity with other mutual aid projects and other transformative work Commitment to dignity and self-determination of people in need or crisis Consensus-based decision making rather than majority rule Source: bigdoorbrigade.com MUTUAL AID 101 TOOLKIT Mutual aid is \"cooperation for the sake of the common good.\" It's getting people to come together to meet each other's needs, recognizing that as humans, our survival is dependent on one another.

Along with Greek statues, Giotto's chapel, Rembrandt's portraits, and more, van Gogh's artwork takes its place in the story of hu- manity's unfolding through time, speaking volumes about movement itself, and also of the possibility of our reawakening to life forces streaming in the physical world. Vincent van Gogh's personal experience also tells a story of and for humanity, in our current era, of the soul's intense struggle to reconcile earthly existence with a call to something higher. His life stands as a kind of advanced guard, informing us of what it is like to undergo torments of soul or soul-illness in the interests of a spiritual way of being and working in the world. This is something felt by many in the modern era who, on a near daily basis, ask: What is mine to do? How can I make a real difference? What do I need person- ally so that I may give to the greater whole? Do I turn inward? Face outward? Why, when I aspire to something more, do I engage in self-sabotage? It can be confounding, the soul's predicament: ever vulnerable to lower (astral) impulses while at the same time inspired, whether quietly or noisily, to serve one's individuality and its higher tasks. At the close of 2019, a major news network discussed the most significant events and is - sues of the decade, such as climate change, the capture and killing of Osama bin Laden, and so forth, and ranked most significant a grouping they collectively named social ills including, but not limited to, addiction (particularly to opioids and technology), mass shootings, suicide, bullying, and isolation; as well as correlative depression and anxiety. Social ills are not new, as the human condition goes, but in recent years the numbers have spiked\u2014and caught our attention. We are noticing soul-illness now, in ourselves and others, and this is a beginning. As a young man, van Gogh's search for his vocation took a common course. He tried his hand as an art dealer, like his brother Theo. He took a position teaching young boys, which led to an interest in missionary work. His feeling for the suffering of others being genuine and deep, he began to study to become a clergyman, hoping Vincent van Gogh's painting as ministry to the soul To Be \"Among the Early Risers\" LEAH WALKER 28 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESS LILIPOH SPRING 2020 29 in part to please his father. But ministering proved difficult for him; he hadn't the constitution. He drifted for a time. When he awoke to his particular gift at twenty-seven\u2014in his twenty-eighth year, Vincent began to paint. Before shooting himself at thirty-seven, in ten short years, Vincent van Gogh produced some 2100 works, including 860 oil paintings, most of which he completed in the last two years of his life. Vincent was a prolific writer as well, a fine writer. His entire biography is found in his letters to Theo: 1640 pages (significantly condensed in Dear Theo: The Autobiography of Vincent van Gogh). He wanted to share everything: every thought; every image; every spiritual insight; every detail of his surroundings; every new idea about painting, every play of light, every color of the night; every event and escapade. Despite Theo's devotion\u2014he always responded to Vincent's letters\u2014and the occasional opportunity to work with other painters, including a relatively long-term collaboration with Gauguin, van Gogh lived largely isolated. Perhaps Vincent couldn't put his finger on it then, but to the close observer it is plain now: he had no peers. No one else saw what Vincent saw or knew what he knew; this left him alternatingly depressed and incredibly anxious, longing so to be understood. Isolation evokes anxiety and leads to despair. And nothing quiets anxiety faster, nothing lifts the soul more readily or provides better comfort than a feeling of being understood, which is an activity of love. Arguably at the root of today's social ills is a failure of understanding, of love. Remarkable as it is, for many people, understanding does not come naturally (though one can learn). As individu - ality grows, understanding will continue to wane and feelings of isolation, intensify; all the while, ironically, individuality will seek its own recognition, particularly in the mirror of the other. Individuality wants to experience itself, in relationship, in com- munity. The human being longs to be seen. Adam Bittleston suggests when we are seen there comes \"the tranquility and action of inner peace.\" Being seen brings tranquility and action. The internal hyper-movement of anxiety (and its obsessions) can come to rest. The stalled move- ment of depression may be brought into motion when we are seen\u2014perceived, acknowledged, included. One can get on with one's work, find one's place in the scheme of things, belong, and contribute. Vincent's letters, penned when he was twenty- one to thirty-seven years of age, show changes in his thinking which follow a typical pattern. He was at first idealistic and enthusiastic. He was occasion- ally deeply affected by others' opinions of him; he was particularly concerned that he not disappoint his brother or father. He desired recognition and financial success (which never came). He grew aware of his fight on earth: If we are tired, isn't it then because we have already walked a long way . . . is not then the feeling of weariness and the burning of the head a sign that we have been struggling ? [He finds refuge in nature, in his work; he begins to trust his eye and mastery. He eventually embraces, though fleetingly, the great gift of devotion to something higher\u2014\"the painting being for eternity.\" [Thirteen years before he would paint The Starry Night, at age twenty-four (three years before he'd even begun to paint) Vincent wrote:] . . . I looked from the window of my room on the roofs of the houses that can be seen from there, and on the tops of the elm trees, dark against the night sky. Over these roofs, one single star, but a beautiful, large, friendly one (April, 1876). 30 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESSIt is significant to me that, for Vincent, the star is friendly. In this moment, did his soul recognize something? Connect itself to its task, to some- thing higher? Perhaps perceive its telos? Adam Bittleston describes this soul-spiritual, develop- mental phenomenon in this way: The relationship between the greater and the lesser in the universe is not such that the greater simply commands the lesser being. The greater may reveal a purpose, which the lesser can receive in devoted reverence, and make its own in action. But the greater can also be utterly silent, and wait . . . for the soul to mature into \"a more perfect servant of the greater.\" \"The task of the soul is to discover out of its own resources the inner principle of its own spirit-being. More than discover, [the soul] needs to give birth to the soul's Light.\" The soul may give birth to its own light. The struggle, then, is labor. I find it a limited perspective which declares van Gogh mentally ill or dubs him a tortured artistic genius (though he himself referred to periods of imbalance as artistic freaks). Soul-illness is too often viewed as something to get over in order to get on with a so-called normal life. This is consolatory, at best, and hardly inspirational. Instead, we might look to develop sensitivities more like van Gogh's. \"The figure of a labourer\u2014some furrows in a ploughed field\u2014a bit of sand, sea and sky\u2014are serious subjects, so difficult, but at the same time so beautiful, that it is indeed worth while to devote one's life to the task of expressing the poetry hidden in them.\" Imagine bringing this quality of perception to the understanding of human life. Imagine manifest life experiences being serious, beautiful, and worthwhile in the search for LILIPOH SPRING 2020 31 a glimpse of the hidden individuality that creates them. [Bittleston writes,] In reality there is a self, belonging to each of us, which is not to be found with the ordinary consciousness, but has a hidden existence; it is this self the Angel tries to guard, and to reveal to us at certain moments. The Path is the work of this self in the ordinary consciousness. As we grow in understand - ing . . . the everyday self changes. It learns to be servant, not unruly lord. . . . However chaotically, Vincent successfully negoti- ated outer influences and expectations, including harsh criticism, to arrive at a self-determined, inner conviction about the value of his artistic labors and discoveries. His soul\u2014his vulnerable soul, from a certain point of view\u2014proved able to serve something higher. This belongs to the archetypal design of the human life, of human development. And van Gogh accomplished it: he bridged the struggle of the earthly soul to the fulfillment of a preeminent spiritual-artistic task. This is profound transformation. Lead into gold. I hear tribute to van Gogh in one of Mary Oliver's poems. She sees him, his individuality, and speaks to the community of things he knew so deeply, and to which he belonged, to which we all belong: Am I not among the early risers/and the long-distance walkers?/Have I not stood, amazed, as I consider/the perfection of the morning star/above the peaks of the houses, and the crowns of the trees blue in the first light?/Do I not see how the trees tremble, as though sheets of water flowed over them/though it is only wind, that common thing,/free to everyone, and everything? Can you picture The Starry Night? The Cypress? Wheat Field? Early in life, and even as Vincent began to paint, he longed to minister to the needs of others\u2014to serve others\u2014serve is the Latin root of minister. I wonder, had he any idea his paint- ings would do this: minister to the soul, struggling and otherwise? I wonder, how many will he yet serve? REFERENCES Bittleston, A.

I may have glanced at the television screen, but I wasn't allowing it in emotionally, unable to decide if I could let in another deadly shooting after so many. There are certain things you have to do to cope. One of them is to go numb instead of letting yourself go crazy. I think this may be just about the saddest thing I have ever said. I go to bed at night worried. I want the House and the Senate to be better than this, better than picking at each other. I want them to act. I scream at them to act, that's how far gone I am. Even if I can no longer keep all the shootings, wars, strikes and attacks straight, I am desperate for them to stop. One of my friends said she has stopped turn- ing on the news. \"I'm am less and less armored against the horrors,\" she said. \"The world is driving me nuts.\" I can't believe how long it's taken me to write about this, but in 2015 when newspaper writers were gunned down in Paris, it struck the deepest personal chord. I felt as though a huge part of my morale was left lying on the floor of the Charlie Hebdo office. Daily life became problematic for me at best. On the surface I was okay, but I shutdown inside, haunted by how the writers and cartoon- ists must have felt in their last moments. I decide rather quickly to have nothing but \"irreverent and non-conforming\" opinions for the rest of my life. I think I will never be able to make peace with this. That night, after dinner, instead of clearing the dishes I sat staring out the window at the Space Needle. I told my husband how one of the finest compliments I have ever received came from a poet who was also a Catholic nun: Madeline DeFrees. She told me she enjoyed my irrever- ent take on things and that I had the soul of a non-conformist. \"I will never forget that,\" I said. \"Or how humble she was, generally,\" which, by the way, is something I always admire in another. I went on to say how most of the poets I knew in the days of my earliest writings had big egos, too big, \"greenhouse-strawberry-big,\" I say, \"and as rarely sweet.\" I talked on and on that night. The dishes never made it to the sink. I think I was trying to break the spell of despair, free the lump in my throat. I started to cry. Well, not cry exactly. Sob. In the days after the shooting, I had to take time off from writing, but more importantly, time off from Shouldering Guilt That Does Not Belong To Me. Neither of which I am very good at. The best way for me to do this is to get outside where at least I have a fighting chance at escaping my mind, where people are talking about, oh, let's see ... how about those Seahawks? \"On your way to the game?\" I say to the first man I see. That's all I said. But I felt better already. He wore sunglasses with the Seahawks logo embed- ded into the lenses, a Seahawks Shirt, a Seahawks cap. He was so happy, this man. I smile for the first time in days, warm to the idea of losing myself, of wandering. In the Sculpture Park, I spot a woman who clearly needs a hand getting down the wooden steps that lead to the sand. She is ballet-thin and fashionably dressed. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 33 And for a second I thought she was much younger, but when she lifted her head it was clear she was likely in her eighties. Her clothes, however, were younger. But not as if she is trying to look younger, just that maybe she likes to keep up, pay attention, just not to every trend. She wore a long, a-symmetrical, wool sweater over black skinny jeans. \"You look lovely,\" I said. She came right back with, \"Well, I do love me my clothes. With gusto, according to my husband.\" She laughed. I hadn't heard the word 'gusto' in a while, so I laughed too, but what really touched me is how quickly she responded. I remembered my mother telling me that she longed to talk to people more in her later years but that it didn't happen much anymore. \"Most of the world is so much younger, they don't want to talk to an old lady,\" she said. \"They don't even see me. I'm finding it harder and harder to go out.\" I'm telling you, those words were like a knife to my heart. \"My husband is the same way,\" I said to the woman. \"You're not one of those women who take their husbands shopping with you, I hope.\"\"Oh, he's gone now,\" she said. But they had a good marriage, she said, \"right up until the cancer.\" I listened. And she talked. And I talked. And she listened. And today as I remember her, I realize she loved being listened to, noticed. But more than that, she loved being included. Conversation helps us feel connected, helps us get out of our heads and into the immediate present. A much better place than spending too much time alone with our fears. Because, let's face it, the shooters and terrorists will not let up. So even if every journalist will need to wear a bulletproof vest, if we let fear lock up our hearts and squash our voices, the terrorists have won. I realize, while writing that last paragraph, that I'd been holding my breath, and then the words rushed out. With gusto! I will put away my work and go for a walk, leave my terrors tied to my desk and let the city wash over me as I learn to persist, to be more resilient, to laugh again. Author and speaker Mary Lou Sanelli has published seven collections of poetry, three works of non-fiction including Among Friends (a Goodreads notable title). Her first novel, The Star Struck Dance Studio of Yucca Springs, was recently released by Chatwin Books. marylousanelli.com I WILL PUT AWAY MY WORK AND GO FOR A WALK, LEAVE MY TERRORS TIED TO MY DESK AND LET THE CITY WASH OVER ME AS I LEARN TO PERSIST, TO BE MORE RESILIENT, TO LAUGH AGAIN. 34 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 REDUCING STRESSPrint Subscriptions One year quarterly print subscription $20 Two year quarterly print subscription $30 Two or more print subscriptions: You and a friend $15 each (per year) Adopt a school, librar y, clinic, or college: Two or more print subscriptions $15 each (per year) Digital Subscriptions One year quarterly digital subscription $10 Two year quarterly digital subscription $20 Order in Bulk for Your Community 5 issues $3 each + $8 shipping per 5 issues 25 issues $2 each + $12.75 shipping per 25 issues Indicate one: Bulk quarterly Bulk single issue no____ Become a \"Friend of LILIPOH\" Our newest subscription option for those who want to do more to support our work. $100 includes a one year print subscription $200 includes a two year print subscription NAME ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIP PHONE EMAIL 1# NOITPIRCSBUS NAME ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIP PHONE EMAIL 2# NOITPIRCSBUS NAME ON CARD CARD NUMBER EXP DATE SEC CODECanadian Print Subscriptions One year quarterly print subscription $41 Two year quarterly print subscription $70 International Print Subscriptions One year quarterly print subscription $67Amount Enclosed $ Please make check payable un US dollars ON LY: LILIPOH Publishing, Inc PO Box 628, Phoenixville, P A 19460 Or charge my MC or Visa Auto-renew when my subscription expires ISSUE 86 VOL. 22, Winter 2017 $5.00 86Cover.indd 1 12/20/16 11:05 AM We are an independently published magazine run entirely from subscriptions and advertisements.

Climate change -> Climate chaos. Civilizational in crisis -> Civilization headed for collapse. Systemic problems are multiplying with breakneck speed now, and \"climate change\" has moved, faster than anticipated, from a heady discussion to a gut-wrenching existential issue, reverberating in our hearts. Our inner climates in response to the news and crises deserves attention as inner seawalls (trauma, social breakdown) will crash upon us too. This post reflects my first efforts, to date, to metabolize rapid climate disruptions and to offer a framework for situation- and self-observation. I'll be at the 25th US Climate Conference in Santiago, Chile with a quiver of questions to investigate while there. Humans have been here before, I tell myself. The Black Plague picked off half of Europe. Hiroshima and Nagasaki began humanity's flir- tation with nuclear energy as weapons of war. The Doomsday Clock was set to 100 seconds to midnight January 23rd, 2020; it now includes climate disruptions and the fake news erosion of democracy in the mix of existential threats.But have we really been here before, where the whole planet, the basis of life itself, is threatened? In her article Facing Extinction, Buddhist teacher Catherine Ingram opens with a litany of the intersecting global stresses that will eventually decimate our species. If you need the recitation of climate ills to let the data penetrate, her recitation has both heart and integrity. Maybe every civilization, as it comes down, assumes it's the worst end of the world there's ever been. But this collapse is ours to face and feel, whatever came before, whatever comes next. The dam broke on my own assumption that climate chaos was still avoidable or at least decades away with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report ( ipcc.ch ). Despite how long and hard I've personally worked to illuminate a better, saner, simpler, smaller, and more beautiful way of life, given the likelihood of overshoot and projected collapse, I was shocked. I never considered we would lurch towards and stumble over the cliff, a point of no return, so soon.Climate Change from the Inside Out Shock. Grief. Respond. Relief. Repeat. VICKI ROBIN LILIPOH SPRING 2020 39 Shock. When you hit something so hard your system is rattled and something flies loose: Shock\u2014hat the body does to preserve the core when there's a life-threatening injury. Shock\u2014hen something you never ever thought would happen happens. I was shocked I had focused so intently on solving the part of our predicament visible to me, that I missed the panoramic view of how far gone we are. This is the form of denial that says, \"Yes, it's bad, but we can fix it. Still.\" I was shocked that my theory of change had missed the mark by a mile. I was thinking in a linear way about a multivariate complex four- (at least) dimensional problem, applying Newtonian mechanics and good Western rational thinking to a tangled, interwoven, still terra incognita living system. \"Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I can move the world\" seemed like a good heroic motto. If I failed, I assumed I needed a longer lever or a different place to stand\u2014not that I was 90% blind. I was shocked that my identities were knocked off their moorings. I'd been touted as\u2014and called myself\u2014a social innovator. A scout. A cultural creative. A best-selling author. I'd almost made it to the finish line of life with a beautifully crafted story of my evolution and impact. While I've had a rich, varied, influential, adventuresome life, and more than my fair share of recognition, climate chaos has swamped my personal story. The difference I'd tried to make was not equal to the mess we've collectively made. I was shocked to find myself tumbling in the waves of shock along with everyone else, unable to find my own footing. If I'm a scout, then my job is climbing the mast or the lookout and help my people find their way. But I could not see how and where the multiplying threats would gather into a perfect storm of mission-critical system collapse. Even the best scientific minds, while accurately measuring the specific systems spiraling down, cannot say for sure how or when it crosses a threshold, a point of no return. Storms are bigger, in the wrong place at the wrong time, but do these mount in significance to indicators of destabiliza- tion or are they just freak storms? Glaciers are melting, but when does this tip the earth systems so far out of balance civilizations cannot contain the damage? Climate chaos as the defining issue of our times has come to the fore just in the last year. Normally cautious, scientists have now bro- ken the glass on the fire alarm and it's screeching. Concurrently, new books have captured public imagination. The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming by David Wallace-Wells and The End of Ice: Bearing Witness and Finding Meaning in the Path of Climate Disruption by Dahr Jamail both document the unremitting decline. Climate Grief We've long had symptoms. We now have a name for the disease: climate disruptions. But what is the prognosis. The shock for me is that we've gone from a treatable condition to a fatal prognosis. That's what has me reeling. I'm ping-ponging around the well-known stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance without resolution. Used to being a leader, or at least a scout who is riding shotgun on the stage coach, I felt blind\u2014 and if blind, then unable to fulfill my self-assigned duties. People have looked to me. If I just shrug an \"I dunno,\" I'm useless\u2014at least in my estimation. The shell of my identities and coping mecha- nisms cracked. I was a china doll after all, not a giant or the Lone Ranger. Shame at my failures, though, turned to relief that I no longer had to drag my successes, identities and roles around anymore. Here we are together, I thought, in the middle of the muddle. 40 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 OUR PLANETNext came the emotional impact of all that is perishing in this fire\u2014literal and metaphori- cal\u2014roaring across our earth. They used to call it shell-shocked in prior wars, this state of seeing everything through the filter of death. The Douglas firs won't be able to thrive here. Gone. The seas in my seaside village will rise, swallowing my town slowly. The children I adore are cursed with scrambling for survival. Forget the old dream of each generation doing better than the last. Or the current media stories of millennials never even getting to the level their parents have enjoyed. There's a nightmare waiting for the little ones. Friends tried to comfort me. There's good news, they'd say. Look at this project or read that story. Such points of light, though, were swallowed by the darkness of bleaching corals and bubbling methane and calving ice sheets. The weather made me cry. The Empire penguins losing their homes made me cry. The loss of bugs. The loss of birds and the morning chorus. I sobbed over each random story of some new part of the web of life winking out. Not because these are indicators of the bigger picture, but because each precious life is perishing because of greed, blindness, ad- diction to normalcy, the religion of growth, hubris. These are not normal times, yet almost everyone seems to be sleepwalking. People and animals and whole species are dying too soon. I felt like the prophets of old, haggard in rags in the public square, preaching collapse while the Romans ate, drank, and were merry. I knew I was being uncooperative. It's impolite to not cheer up, to be the death of the party, the Eeyore of climate chaos, the depressive in the corner. But I could not go back into can-do solu- tional mode, and the path forward felt like night in an endless forest. I just had to let grief have its way with me. Guaranteed, it was no fun. I wasn't taking dark pleasure in my pain, being significant in another macabre way. I was despondent and lamenting and it felt like the rightest response to the suffering we have caused. Because we've done this. Just because I've been a Pied Piper of Frugality doesn't get me off the hook. I was born now on the planet. I've inherited the entirety of human history and especially the worldview of Western Civilization: dominance, separation, profit, progress, growth, wealth. Not special. Not separate. Not holier than any thou out there. No smarter. No better equipped. Another naked hu- man, shivering. IF THIS IS THE END OF OUR WAY OF LIFE, OF RELATIVE SAFETY, OF OUR SPECIES, WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. WE ARE MITIGATING AND ADAPTING AND FEELING AND THINKING IN CONCERT.

September 6 - November 22 APPLY TODAY 603.876.3342What broke the spell? In part it was recognizing this enveloping sadness was actually weakening my emotional sturdiness. It's one thing to grieve. It's another to enter unremitting despondency and not take care of yourself. I applied emotional first aid. Activated foundational faith in the essential goodness of life--and in me. Recited gratitude for my blessings, and there are so many. Gratitude began filling my well, not as a resistance to grief, but as a poultice on the wounds. I invited myself to dinner with friends and spent a long evening in the gloaming speaking of this gloom and they simply listened and cared. Then I discovered the Positive Deep Adaptation Facebook Group (PDA), facebook.com/groups/ deepadaptation . More later about Jem Bendell, the academic and sustainability leader who published a well-referenced paper a year ago called \"Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy,\" that sparked a rapidly spreading conversation, on the PDA Facebook forum and elsewhere, about what time it really is on planet Earth. Are there any critical paths left to reversing climate change or at least stopping the rise in atmospheric CO2 dead in its tracks? The core assumption you buy into on the forum is this: collapse is inevitable, catastrophe is probable, and extinction for humans is possible. I dove in and found literally thousands of people who are right where I am\u2014shock and grief. They talk about powerlessness and disbelief. They talk about personal and local resilience strategies\u2014 gardens and water systems. They wonder whether marches and speeches do anything. They wander into wondering whether famine, overpopulation, environmental refugees, and racism will lead to a Mad Max scenario or whether our better angels will still be singing. They talk about what kinds of economic, financial, and money systems might replace predatory capitalism. They post pictures of gardens and articles that inspire and talk about where to move. They disagree without debating. They ask questions that elicit hundreds of com- ments, almost none snarky or belligerent. I spent hours reading every post and the comment strings, finding myself in so many places. The nearly 7,000 members accelerated my learning, added fine detail to my nascent thoughts, added com- ments to my comments\u2014the biggest, best global conversation I've ever had among peers peering into an unknown future. You can feel despondent and crazy when you're the only one you know going through climate grief because we've lost the prevention game and are into the unknown waters of how to adapt. Through this I found some footing in this new world where bravery means facing facts not fight- ing dragons. Here's the map I made for myself (likely copied from someone else, maybe Jem): Prevention -> Mitigation -> Adaptation -> Deep Adaptation My journey started when I closed the door on prevention and to my many creative strategies for standing in the flow of history like a traffic cop. I accepted mitigation is the best we can do. There is so much we can do to mitigate the effects of rising CO2 in the atmosphere. Project Drawdown out- lines a hundred known strategies and ranks them by efficacy. A lot have to do with agriculture, a topic that I've studied and written about and promoted locally through my book Blessing the Hands that Feed Us and the 10-Day Local Food Challenge (localfoodchallenge.org ). I reviewed my notes from the 2019 Global Earth Repair Conference where the possibility of regenerative practices\u2014from water to food to shelter\u2014scaling to meet some portion of the consequences and started informing myself about the state of the movement and best strategies and legal frameworks. Mitigation is a kick-ass occupation, especially when you don't mistake it for prevention, as though we could turn future collapse back to the past 44 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 OUR PLANETclimate stability. I think this is a very common mis- take, because so many strategies have the fervor of solutions rather than the maturity of doing what's needed. If you are a sustainability professional, as Jem Bendell was and still is, you have a stake in the space of prevention staying open. It's both what you do and what you believe will work. What the shock and grief accomplished was stripping even subtle forms of climate consequences denial that infused my uber-cool strategies. A 2019 article by Jonathan Franzen in The New Yorker that mirrors the Deep Adaptation understanding came under blazing fire from sustainability professionals. Do we have to be in denial of death in order to lead and inspire and make crucial decisions? Does recognizing we are in the era of consequences\u2014what we've already done is enough to end the 500-year story of end- less economic growth\u2014enervate activists? It did for me in those months of shock and grief, but I was coming out of this... but into what? I realized that I was in a different and somewhat disorienting territory. If I am not doing my projects in order to make specific changes I believe can be tipping points, what's the point? Why do anything? All change work involves strategies and tactics. Would working for change now be like the classic loyal Japanese soldier found in the woods years after the war ended, still fighting? Or is there a dif- ferent change? Or a different way to do anything? I gave up the phrase \"in order to,\" as in I am doing this in order to have that happen. It was like taking all the vowels out of the alphabet. I became mute about anything other than observations in the present moment. I didn't answer emails \"in order to.\" Or read books \"in order to.\" Or hang out with friends \"in order to.\" Things were what they were. I did what I did. I had no linear explanations for why. Had I needed to change things in the past \"in order to\" feel better? Assuage my conscience? Shut out the horror of living among predatory, selfish people willing to crash Nature to party on? Do I go to bed \"in order to sleep in order to be rested in order to have a good next day or be effective in something? Do I eat \"in order to\" live? Be feelings? up \"in order to\" am a defector from active engagement in supporting or creating much needed change? Am I giving up the fight when I give up the instrumental reason? Am I going all gooey and hippy? Giving up \"in order to\" stopped the busy buzz of mental processing. Was \"in order to\" a koan? At the risk of being corny, what came in as I emptied my transactional mind was love. The grief had picked the lock of my heart and a sense of great love arose along with great honor to just have a human heart that can feel love. I act in love, not in order to love. I do what I do in love, with all my talents, skills, connections in service to us as we emerge from the cocoon of endless growth into these stories of loss, disruption, danger, and reori- entation. If I am of use, great. If who or what I know can help someone, somehow, great. If my strategic mind is needed as we all search for a way through our predicament, wonderful. I'd preached \"we're all in this together\" to stop others with their reck - less addiction to growth-as-good. Now, thanks to not-knowing, I know truly we're all in this together. Response Through this reckoning with shock and grief, and finding community among people seeing what I see, I'd moved into responding to the climate crisis in ways that fit for me. Friends and I are hosting a witness circles called Breathing Together as the Climate Changes. I'm on a committee to produce a community event that will include county of- ficials\u2014from commissioners to mayors to agen- cies to businesses and NGOs. I'm pressuring the county for a Climate Action Plan to at least raise the conversation about mitigation and adaptation LILIPOH SPRING 2020 45 locally. The PDA's Community Action group is discussing how to have online Deep Adaptation Groups and I'm considering becoming a host. I joined our teens for the School Strike. I'm helping a Permaculture Teacher plan a workshop on my island to help prepare us for what's ahead. And I included Deep Adaptation in my recent 5-day workshop on Money, Life, and Meaning\u2014the group was grateful to have the elephant of climate change in our midst. These are actions, yes, but all come from this shock and grief process. It's not activism per se. It's responding from an activated heart. I am not pressuring anyone, but more than ever I'm a force to be reckoned with because I'm showing up and speaking truth and risking rejection or ridicule or worse. I'm not just focused on Deep Adaptation. I'm working on mitigation and adaptation strate- gies as well at every level of scale\u2014personal to global. Relief I feel spacious, present, and happy. The shock, grief, and response phases have freed me, wid- ened my scope like a mother's birth canal widening to let a child be born. I am not resisting inevitable climate collapse. Nor am I disabled by grief. It's a strange state because I am working full on for change without thinking we will change in time to avoid the prognosis. This process of metabolizing our climate pre- dicament I call: Shock -> Grief -> Respond -> Relief -> Repeat. Repeat means that we'll keep experiencing shock and grief and being called to respond from our hearts again and again as conditions change. We'll be in acceptance and resistance and lament- ing and engaging all at once or in sequence in the years ahead as we see how things unfold. If this is the end of our way of life, of relative safety, of our species, we are in this together. We are mitigating and adapting and feeling and thinking in concert. In the Deep Adaptation forum, I wrote: I let the grief and despondency grind through my defenses this last half year as I confronted the inevitability of the math and the accelerated timetable of climate chaos. Surprisingly, I've popped through to a state of curiosity, creativity, and spaciousness. What was pulverized: my dejection and anger that nothing I'd done in my 30 years of activism had prevented this, and my illu- sion of control and agency (if I do x then y will happen), and my self-imposition of false responsibility for people who've looked to me for guidance, my pride that I've been ahead of the curve (and am now in the confusion and despair soup with everyone). I refused to be consoled because what we are facing isn't touched by normal encour- agement to buck up or look at the good side. I've shared here and with local friends each step of the journey. I am also taken the Good Grief Network ( goodgriefnetwork.org ) course - based on the 12-Step programs - which I highly recommend. Before my heart was ground down along with my will, I activated self-care to put a floor under my descent. Perhaps I was served by having had cancer and undertaken the Descent journey of the Inanna myth so am familiar with the blessing of the stripping away. Both lead to an emptiness that seems to precede a natural buoyancy from lightness rather than exuberance. I still have a kit bag of strategies I've expressed through books and projects and games etc, but the need to push these out to \"save us\" or even \"save\" those who listen is gone. And I'm sure I will learn more skills/ strategies/ 46 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 OUR PLANETgames as time goes on. I can still write and speak to groups. As others travel from prevention to mitigation to adaptation I can offer what I've learned along the way. So I think it's the pressure to solve our dilemma and all the handmaidens of resistance to reality that has left my body mind and heart. Prior to this process, creativity curiosity and spaciousness might have felt like denial or resistance or feral seeking an opening in the wall - but now it's unencumbered. For the nonce until the next round...\" This is much like the experience of going from diagnosis and treatment to prognosis and prepar - ing to die. When a close friend was diagnosed with lymphoma, treatment began and he seemed to be responding well. At least the cancer was contained. We all went on with life as usual, helping him adjust to this new reality. Four years from diag - nosis, the cancer turned into aggressive leukemia. The doctor gave him weeks to live, at best. It was clear I had gone to sleep on how fatal this cancer could be. I got busy researching alternative treat- ments as if we could fish a miracle out of the hat. We all got reactive while he went stoic and refused to have any long faces around him. No one really knew what to do. Just as the doctor ordained, he was dead in two weeks. Most of us have these experiences of loss of a loved one. They are so unbelievably painful and the prospect of saying goodbye in every detail to our way of life may be too excruciating for any of us. Trauma One final aside. Concurrent with this process, I've been untangling a long-buried relationship trauma. About the time I came to the climate relief phase, I'd gotten to what seems to be the root of my personal issue and the energy of it left my body. I wonder if this is an accidental parallel or if the shock of climate consequences will kick MAYBE EVERY CIVILIZATION, AS IT COMES DOWN, ASSUMES IT'S THE WORST END OF THE WORLD THERE'S EVER BEEN. BUT THIS COLLAPSE IS OURS TO FACE AND FEEL, WHATEVER CAME BEFORE, WHATEVER COMES NEXT. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 47 up old traumas in many people. Will we need cli- mate therapists? Climate social workers? Climate coaches? Are people in these professions ready to receive the influx of traumatized people? Are amateurs like me hosting climate witness circles able to widen our circles? The Position Deep Adaptation network is looking at hosting witness circles via Zoom. I'm sure the professions are waking up to this. For example, Leslie Davenport (lesliedavenport.net ), author of Emotional Resilience in the Era of Climate Change, is developing under- standing and practices. Back to the Deep Adaptation paper by Jem Bendell and the Deep Adaptation online groups. I recommend you read the paper carefully and follow up with his blog, both are available here: jembendell.com . He is offering an expansive, clear framework for us to weave into our lives. Join the Positive Deep Adaptation Group. There's a search box so any topic that interests you can pop up. I love the four R's/ Deep Adaptation questions he poses in his paper. They help us focus our minds and work. Resilience: what do we most value that we want to keep and how? Relinquishment: what do we need to let go of so as not to make matters worse? Restoration: what could we bring back to help us with these difficult times? Reconciliation: with what and whom shall we make peace as we awaken to our mutual mortality? In his paper he says: In pursuit of a conceptual map of \"deep adaptation,\" we can conceive of resilience of human societies as the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances so as to survive with valued norms and behaviours. Given that analysts are concluding that a social collapse is inevitable, the question becomes: What are the valued norms and behaviours that human societies will wish to maintain as they seek to survive? That highlights how deep adaptation will involve more than \"resilience.\" It brings us to a second area of this agenda, which I have named \"relinquishment.\" It involves people and communities letting go of certain assets, behaviours and beliefs where retaining them could make matters worse. Examples include withdrawing from coastlines, shutting down vulnerable industrial facilities, or giving up expecta- tions for certain types of consumption. The third area can be called \"restoration.\" It involves people and communities redis- covering attitudes and approaches to life and organisation... The paper didn't include the last question about Reconciliation. He and the whole community are learning together what adaptation at this level means. The conversation is open and ongoing. Repeating and evolving. We are learning to- gether. You are welcome in. Your voice is needed. Your transformation of shock and grief into response and relief is needed. We're all in this to- gether. Humanity finally has a common challenge. It's not the Russians or the Chinese or the Middle East. It's our way of life based on our addiction to oil in service to progress, domination, exploitation, winning that is being shut down by how natural systems are responding to the demands and as- saults. Will we rise to it? Stay tuned. Vicki Robin is a prolific social innovator, writer, and speaker.

The environmental crisis, which does not only include climate change but general environmental degradation, certainly stands out. Our moment demands more care and connection with the peculiar regions, beings, and elements of our earth than ever before. At the same time, we are in the midst of a power- ful technological revolution. In the USA we spend around eight to ten hours per day engaged with some kind of screen, whether it be our computer phones, computers, or television. Even without hardware implants, we have become half cyborg. One central concern voiced by Steven Talbott, and echoed by many, is the possible increasing \"inabil- ity of children, by the time they have grown up, to experience an organic and deeply motivating con - nection between themselves and the larger so- ciety or between themselves and the physical world.\" We are experiencing a clear demand to foster more meaningful connections with the earth at intangible inspirations Bringing Spirit into the World in the Anthropocene Epoch NATHANIEL WILLIAMS LILIPOH SPRING 2020 49 the same time we are incorporating technologies into our lives that dilute these very connections. But there is more. When we look at culture in the US we can discern two characteristic tendencies. One is basi- cally utilitarian. We cultivate it through much of our scientific and technological culture. Charles Taylor has called it a \"disengaged stance of rational analysis and control towards the self\" something that involves a striving to \"distance ourselves from our embodied understanding of things in order to achieve clear and distinct knowledge.\" Taylor has traced this in all manner of instances, such as in modern medicine where we heavily rely on images of the human, such as x-rays and graphs. This process is \"alienated from our anchoring in the world, in real fleshy reality; which we can only recover access to through the lived body, whose testimony is being shaped or even denied by 'virtual' reality.\" He calls this process excarnation. It involves viewing the world at a distance to try to discover abstract and general functions. This can lead us to picture the world, and people, as variables that can be, more or less, arranged and rearranged at our pleasure. On the other hand, we have a culture that cel- ebrates individualism, uniqueness, and expression in people. We feel we are all on journeys to try to achieve authenticity, to follow our passions\u2014 perhaps in order to find how we can fit into the greater life of the world and society. We can view each individual as a work of art. This orientation to one another is certainly pro- found, but it is also so easily corrupted. We cater to our notions of individualism when we create businesses and commercial enterprises. We pres - ent promises of the most profound experiences of authenticity, like love, through activities such as owning cars. \"Love, it is what makes a Subaru a Subaru.\" We use our utilitarian culture to encour- age consumption through data processing that informs both advertising and political propaganda. Thus, there is an alarming interaction between the utilitarian tendency and expressive dynamics in our feeling for our lives and society. We all too easily overlook how the very audibility of words and the visibility of actions have a revelatory character. They are openings into an intangible web of political and social life. They are irradiated by meaningfulness and ethical impulses. We are touched by the who OUR MOMENT DEMANDS MORE CARE AND CONNECTION WITH THE PECULIAR REGIONS, BEINGS, AND ELEMENTS OF OUR EARTH THAN EVER BEFORE. 50 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 OUR PLANETof a speaker, a who embedded in a biography and a wide web of human relations. For all its \"intangibil- ity, this in-between is no less real than the world of things we visibly have in common.\" How can this web become more connected to solidarity, mutual support, and care for the earth? Indeed, one fundamental challenge in this situa - tion is how to bring the love of unique and diverse, expressive life toward the earth. Our sciences need to be enriched sites of connection; our notion of individualism needs to be rooted and grounded, to be connected more to others, to our place and context. We need to develop forms of individuality more embedded in the realities of the world and we need more spirit in our science. A version of the striving to bring spirit into the world, and objectivity into knowledge of ourselves, was beautifully expressed by Rudolf Steiner in a sculpture depicting human nature. On the left you can see two beings, one is below the other. The one on the bottom is rigid and tight, the one above has no feet and is being enclosed in a bubble. On the right we see the same figures above and below, but now a new figure appears in the middle, one that can see the spirit in the earth while overthrow- ing the spirit that tends to enclose us in egotism. At Free Columbia a new program is beginning this fall aiming at just this. It is named after Mary Caroline Richards, a potter, poet, essayist, and fierce advocate for the renewal of education. It is a full-time curriculum consisting of arts, sciences, and practical classes. Courses in biology, physics, and mathemat- ics are developed to encourage rich engagement with the enchantment of the natural phenomena, not just their lawfulness. Poetry, visual arts, and singing are pursued to explore the objective, intangible inspirations so central to artistic experience. Applications are currently being accepted for the cohort beginning in August. Between fifteen to twenty students will be accepted this first year. There is not a program quite like it anywhere in the country. and It is intended as a contribution to the unique challenges of the Anthropocene and the digital revolution.

Over 200 participants from twenty-eight countries gathered to search for approaches to a deeper understanding of the current question of the climate crisis. We explored ways to define individual contributions to shape a healthy future for people and nature. Contributions ranged from the question of hu- man consciousness. We considered the relevance of the way we shape our relationship to the world and to ourselves\u2014the connection of these aspects with the current social, economic, and political situation in the world. We discussed the climate question as an inner crisis of mankind. We learned about practical projects and approaches in response to climate challenges. In discussion groups, workshops, and artistic performances, we deepened our exploration of the above aspects. We opened a space to develop and take away our own approaches to these complex issues. Throughout the meeting, participants ex- pressed this thought in various ways: this confer- ence gave us hope; we met all sorts of people who are concerned with these same questions and who are committed to doing good. The conference left us with hope that a healthy future for people and nature is conceivable and can be shaped. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 55 56 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 EDUCATION + CHILDHOOD The Critical Challenge of Our Time It would be hard to find many issues as strongly defining of our time as our mounting diversity: lo- cally, statewide, nationally, and globally. One might argue it is our time's defining issue. The distance among groups is growing greater. In the United States alone, more than half of all ba - bies born are people of color. By 2030, the majority of young workers will be people of color. And by 2044, the United States will be a majority people of color nation. Research signals the powerful hope for a shared future in these phenomena. The wins from diversity are growing clearer in brain research. Diversity is empowering for all who live within its orbit. Brain research shows what many have known intuitively: diversity builds cognitive flexibility with the ability to innovate, be adaptive, and be inclusive. The wins are already defining action on the stock market. Blue Chip companies are charting the course to value those who are diversity fluent (more even than those who are fluent in math or computer science) because of the bottom line. Intercultural relations have come to be seen by top performing companies to lie at the heart of organizational effectiveness, enhanced product innovation, and optimal customer relations. Those aiming to do well increasingly seek the one who can reach profitable arrangements across lan- guage, race, and gender differences: the one who is comfortable in a boardroom, at a barbeque, and at a Bollywood dance. Yet, despite the growing diversity and mount - ing value of being diversity fluent, both eco- nomically and socially, we are becoming more segregated. In the United States alone, we are more segregated than sixty-five years ago, de- spite the 1954 Brown versus Board of Education court ruling. The question is where are the promising practices of how to confront this chal- lenge? Waldorf education offers an important example. The Task of Waldorf in its 100th Year As we celebrate Waldorf's groundbreaking work for justice (pulling down walls of isolation between class, gender, and country), we note the first Waldorf School in 1919 was the first to be coed, kindergarten though twelfth grade, and waldorf education & diversity Leading for Inclusion MONIQUE BRINSON and IDA OBERMAN, PHD LILIPOH SPRING 2020 57 cross-class\u2014with the children of the factory owner sitting beside the children of the factory workers. How have we carried forward this mission? Waldorf schools have grown to be known as an elite educational option, so we are at risk of for- getting our original intent. We have a strong his- tory and global examples of Waldorf leading for inclusion, for example in South Africa Township's Zenzeleni Waldorf School; Monte Azul in Sao Paulo, Brazil; or Israel's El Zeitoun and Ein Bustan, where Arab and Jewish children learn together. Our task now is to build up this heritage, rest- ing firmly on Waldorf education's original intent, in the West, as in a public Waldorf school just outside of San Francisco in Oakland, California, known as the Community School for Creative Education. How can we, as the Waldorf community, strengthen our voice to make the changes for justice and inclusion we were tasked from in- ception to fulfill? What living thinking is required of us? Community School for Creative Education (CSCE) BRIEF HISTORY Waldorf schools have historically been founded by groups of dedicated teachers, parents, or a blend. Community School for Creative Education (CSCE) was born from community organizing, with a different entry point. Starting in 2007, CSCE's founder Dr. Ida Oberman, PhD was trained in the Faith in Action leadership model (then under PICO's Affiliate Oakland Community Organizations). Under careful tutelage of her organizer, Emma Paulino, Ida learned to do one-on-ones, join with other leaders in research meetings, and then create actions and reflec- tions for renewed one-on-ones. Out of that initiative, local parents led the work to research Waldorf schools and high-performing, high- poverty schools in Oakland's flatlands to make the decision Oakland was ready for a Waldorf COMMUNITY SCHOOL PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, A MONTHLY FOOD BANK, FREE EXTENDED-DAY ACTIVITIES UNTIL SIX IN THE EVENING EVERY DAY. 58 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 EDUCATION + CHILDHOODSchool. After three years of planning and build- ing relations in the Oakland community, the country's first intercultural urban public Waldorf school was born. The journey was not an easy one. They were declined twice by the district, and once recom- mended for decline by the County Office of Education staff. Eventually, they were approved in a surprised turn by a board member who be- came convinced a Waldorf option in the flatlands community was worth the chance. The approval exemplified the power of having a community voice. At the public hearings, fifty-two individuals from different languages, backgrounds, and roles rose up to speak in support. That was a decade ago, June 2010. Today, CSCE is comprised of grades transitional kindergarten through eighth, serving 283 students. In diverse Oakland, it is among the most diverse schools. The student demographic is comprised of forty-eight percent English Learners; fifteen percent entitled to special education services, over double the average charter school and higher than the district; and eighty-two percent are from low-income families. The student population is ethnicly diverse: sixty-two percent Latinx, eigh- teen percent African American, ten percent Asian American/Pacific Islander, four percent Caucasian, three percent Native American and three percent multiracial. A full-service community school, Community School provides mental health services, a monthly food bank, free extended-day activities until six in the evening every day (including summer school). Extended-day programs are laced through with watercolor painting, circle time, and main lesson book work. A signature feature of the school is deeply networked in community, in fact, the school serves as the community hub; it is not separate or disconnected. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 59 OUR COMMUNITY: ITS RICHES AND CHALLENGES We reside in a community that is among the most diverse culturally vibrant neighborhoods in diverse Oakland. Vietnamese, Mexican, and Cambodian restaurants vie for attention. Art from different cul- tures and religions decorates neighborhood walls and floats as notes through the air. In contrast, the community of which we are a proud part is also known for human trafficking, drugs, and violent crimes at four times the state's rate (and a rate one third higher than the city itself). OUR SCHOOL CHARTER AND OUR LEADERSHIP The idea for an urban public Waldorf school took shape when in 1984, Henry Barnes, founding teacher of the first US Waldorf school in NYC 1928, contacted Ida Oberman when he heard of her intention to start a public Waldorf school in an inner city setting. Henry told Ida, \"we have to go where the children are.\" Over the course of the years, the idea be- came reality. In 2007, the work to form a planning group led to a carefully-crafted school charter document in consultation with veteran Waldorf educators Betty Staley; Dr. Linda Williams, PhD; Mr. Christof Wiechert; renowned scholar Ms. Zaretta Hammond; and the encouragement of Professor Linda Darling Hammond. In 2017, the seventh year of the school's biog- raphy, Principal Monique Brinson and Executive Director Ida Oberman created a formidable leader- ship team. Grounded in the school's charter, we have been focused, together with the school com- munity, to further develop our urban intercultural THE HOUR IS NOW FOR WALDORF EDUCATION TO STEP FORWARD AND TAKE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AROUND CUTTING-EDGE SOLUTIONS TO CONFRONT THE DEFINING QUESTIONS OF OUR TIME: DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN OUR WORLD AND IN EDUCATION. 60 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 EDUCATION + CHILDHOODWaldorf model to advance equity, ever aimed at returning to the original intent launched with the first Waldorf school in Stuttgart 1919. Three Pillars of Community School and Three Early Fruits Community School rests on three critical pillars: our community; our Waldorf inspired, standards- aligned, equity-focused program resting on the foundation of the arts; and our adult research and education. Among fruits we count in this early phase are first and foremost our students, then our families, and finally our academic gains.Pillar One: Community Our community lives inside and outside the walls of our school. The year is laced with festivals from Day of the Young Child, to Lunar New Year, to the Birthday of the Venerable Prophet Mohammed, to Black History Month. For each festival, families join to bring food, celebrate, decorate, share, learn stories from each other's cultures, and learn to cook each other's favorite foods. With our families and our community outside the walls of the school, we have done monthly safety walks for example, dear John go home, to fight human trafficking and lift human dignity. Our students, families, and staff have partnered with a nearby district high school to make a mosaic to adorn the outside of our school building. This LILIPOH SPRING 2020 61 The call to adventure.

At the ribbon cutting of this mosaic, the children from Community School and youth from the nearby high school were surrounded by staff families, while the nearby Oakland Cambodian Buddhist Temple chanted songs of peace. Pastors from nearby churches offered prayers. Community leaders spoke up for the power and promise of our neighborhood. Our children were at the center of the celebration, while the chief of police held a watchful, benevolent eye to make sure all traffic slowed, which marked moment of community unity. Elected officials frequent our halls as readily as do the police or members of the faith com- munity. The mayor of Oakland came to speak to our children on Lunar New Year, as we greeted a revered group of educators from the Waldorf School in Chengdu, China. We were invited to join festivals at the nearby Cambodian Buddhist Temple and received the honor of being allowed to stand a revered distance from the head monk for a picture. We are invited for the festivals of our OH lone brothers and sisters on Indigenous People's Day. While the police in our community all too often instill fear in children, the sergeants and lieuten- ants and officers come to us as we celebrate the Day of the Young Child, to read with the children. Pillar 2: Waldorf Inspired, Standards-aligned, Equity-focused Program Resting on the Arts THE ARTS: FORMING OPENING CIRCLE At the center of our work is education as an art. Every morning we open as a whole school com- munity with children, staff, and families, to recite: \"this is our school, let peace dwell here. . .\" first used by Cecil Harwood (1898-1975) in the first Waldorf School in an English-speaking country, Michael Hall. Using drums and song and verse in at least three languages, the children and whole community open the day. Through the intensive work since inception with Mr. Bernd Ruff of Friends of Waldorf Education's Emergency Pedagogy and bolted on brain research, we have grown ever more focused on this opening circle as the mo- ment to invite children to find their place, in relation to their own body, to their neighbor, to the whole community, and to nature. Once this fifteen-minute ritual is completed, children sing, by grade, go to their classrooms, and the day begins. THE ARTS: HANDWORK Handwork is a central joyous thread that weaves through the life of the school. Founding commu- nity member Ms. Nhan Le works with the lower grades to crochet, knit, and finger knit. In the upper grades, students work in paper origami to adorn the space in accordance with holidays. Veteran Waldorf volunteers join for wreath making, silk dying, and crown making. THE ARTS: CLASS PLAYS The power of the class play enlivens the children. The fact that Community School English learners and children identified in need of special educa- tion services have outperformed the district for the past five years in a row, we attribute to our language, acting, and song-rich environment. THE ARTS: GARDENING A key feature of the handwork is the garden work. Blessed by generous donor gifts, we receive support in extended day and during the day so children can combat the research noted nature deficit and experience growth from the planting of the seed, to the bloom, to the harvest, and to the making of the soup. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 63 EDUCATION + CHILDHOODTHE ARTS: RECITATION As we recite every morning, we recite every celebration, lifting up for all the rhythm and ritual and power of art through speech. Students learn one world language, Spanish, from Transition Kindergarten on, and we are now building in the option of Mandarin, from middle school on. The power to learn to recite in different world lan- guages was a goal of Dr. Steiner's that Community School has embraced. Pillar 3: Academic Steiner Teacher Education \"I do not want to be adulated! I want to be understood,\" Steiner admonished us. We know at Community School all practice has to be inti- mately linked to research. Since inception, we have begun our Urban Waldorf Teacher Training under the guidance of Dr. Mary Goral, PhD and co-leadership of lead teachers Ms. Delano Hill and Ms. Sara Alvarado. At the same time, we have benefited by sending our teachers to the Rudolf Steiner College Public School Institute with the generous support of the late Arlene Monks. Most importantly, as of 2018, the Mills Waldorf Professional Development Certified Program was formed through a partnership with Mills College School of Education and Alanis University in Allfter Germany. The program is now recognized by AWSNA, Alliance for Public Waldorf Education, and WECAN. It offers a two- summer, two-week Mills Waldorf Professional Development Certificate with ten graduate cred- its, with the experience of Waldorf Education training under Mr. Bernd Ruff in Emergency Pedagogy and Jots Scherer, dean of Flanks School of Education. We are proud to begin our third year this summer. In 2019, on the state test, our African-American students outperformed all other public schools in the city (district or charter). Our low-income Latinx students won a high growth prize for being in the top ninetieth percentile in growth in English Language Arts and Math. Finally, our students identified as in need of special education out- performed the district by double for a sixth year in a row. The hour is now for Waldorf education to step forward and take a seat at the table around cutting-edge solutions to confront the defining questions of our time: diversity and equity in our world and in education. Waldorf education can celebrate its power as a tested model to confront challenges and harness opportunities. We know the power of diversity of head, heart, and hand; diversity of the other and me; diversity of the community and us; diversity of our com- munity and the world. We have the wind in our back. The growing body of research on social emotional learning and brain research confirms what Waldorf education has adapted across time, language, class, and culture. It is time for Waldorf practice and research to speak as the Steiner-hired Waldorf teacher Erich Gabert did, \"Waldorf education is not imitation but inquiry; it is not replication but research; Waldorf is not done but unfolding.\" As we enter Waldorf education's next 100 years, we are called to the task of an unfolding leader in advancing social justice. Adapted from talks given 09/06/2019 at the Alanus University, Alfter, Germany; and Stuttgart Waldorf School Faculty Meeting, Stuttgart, Germany, 09/12/2019 As principal of the Community School for Creative Education, Monique Brinson brings 10 years experience as an Oakland Principal and 16 years experience in administration along with 10 years experience as a founding teacher/teacher.

ANNOUNCING NEW PR OGRAMS STARTING 2021 Explore the exquisitely created realm of Soul \u2014 so intensely challenged in these times, so beautifully resilient when nurtured. I found Camphill Village right when I needed it most. I had just moved back into my par- ents' house after my plans had fallen through elsewhere. I was stuck, feeling unhappy, and more than a little lost about how to move forward. While talking with my dad one day, he chal- lenged me to think about the things I'd done in the past that made me feel most uplifted. That's when I began reminiscing about how community has brought me comfort and joy over the years. Though I didn't know what I wanted to do next, I knew I needed a place where I felt a sense of belonging. I knew if I could surround myself with people who challenged and inspired me, I could at least feel supported until I figured out what came next. As I searched for my path, I made sure to keep up with my journal, capturing snapshots of my journey and my daily experiences and feelings. Journal Entry, 12/10 I don't know that I can be fully happy, or even satisfied, with a \"normal\" life for myself... work during the week, then back home, with hobbies & friends & church, etc., etc., etc., sprinkled in where they fit.I need meaning & community & rest & faith & laughter & good food & activities & celebrations ALL THE TIME, IN WORK & IN PLAY. So began my search for a place that I could call home, even if just for the time being. While brows- ing the website Backdoorjobs.com , I came across an advertisement from Camphill Association of North America: \"Spend a year developing yourself. Discover your deeper purpose and share your life and gifts in a thriving intentional community with Camphill!... Camphill Volunteers live and work alongside chil- dren, youth and adults with developmental and other disabilities in rural communities throughout the U.S. and Canada...\" As I sat reading the description, I reflected on whether this type of place would be right for me. Rural lifestyle? Well, I sort of knew how to garden and farm. Intentional living? I had taken part in some week-long service trips during high school and college. I did have some experience work - ing with people with disabilities from substitute teaching a few special education classes, and I have a close family friend with autism. On paper, it wasn't an exact fit. Still, something about the ad spoke to my soul.Camphill Village Minnesota Finding a Home and My Best Self OLIVIA TARLTON 66 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 EDUCATION + CHILDHOOD LILIPOH SPRING 2020 67 Grade-Level Preparation (ECE to Grade 8) for the 2020-2021 school year Experienced Waldorf instructors at each grade level and inspiring guests from the greater community.

Live in community Incorporate spirituality & intention into daily life Cherish the little things Give back, care for others daily, do something iportant Reconnect with nature Slow down Celebrate life in all its forms Develop greater patience & selflessness Above all, Camphill sounded like a wonderful op- portunity to learn all that I could. And, when I visited Camphill Village in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, that's exactly what I found: a place where everyone can learn and grow. It's judgment-free\u2014the perfect place to work on improving yourself in all the ways you possibly can, while still being celebrated for who you are at this present moment.I came to Camphill Village Minnesota for a three-day visit before accepting a residential volunteer (Camphill calls this a coworker) position. But it only took a few hours of being here to know that this is what I had been looking for. After touring the village set amidst picturesque snow-covered hills and frozen streams, visiting the pigs and cows, exploring the colorful weavery, and savoring the laughter-filled harvest kitchen, we ar- rived at the home where I would stay for the next few days. I was greeted by the house members, who gifted me with coloring pages exclaiming, \"Welcome to our community,\" and embraced me in warm hugs. I remember not being able to sleep my first night because I couldn't believe how incred- ible and right this place felt for me. JOURNAL ENTRY, 3/21 I've been here for two days & I've already been shown immense love & acceptance, laughed a lot, been treated to two fun outings, & cheered others on.

Accrediting Council for Continuing Education & TrainingACCREDITED BY LEARN MORE: gradalis.eduBefore coming to Camphill, I wasn't sure what it would be like to share a home with folks with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Would they respect my personal space? Would I feel burnt out immediately? Would I have enough patience for the job? What would the learning curve be like? What I didn't anticipate was just how hon- est and genuine my housemates would be. I es- pecially love how true they are to themselves, and how they've taught me to embrace who I am, too. I've never been appreciated this much, or made to feel so good about myself. In this community, made up of people with and without disabilities, every day is viewed as a new opportunity to remind each other just how special we are. JOURNAL ENTRY, 4/9: Here We dress in our best for outings to Dairy QueenHere Where we are comfortable in our bodies, which are able & determined & filled with goodness Here Where we look forward to Thursday visits to the library Here Where we are thankful for our food & our community & the planting of Easter grass Even though snow's on the way, We feel warmth Here With each other While each day looks somewhat different at Camphill Village Minnesota, most weekdays have 70 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 EDUCATION + CHILDHOODa certain schedule that we follow. For example, my Fridays typically look something like this: 7:30 - 8:00: Wake up and get my housemates moving. Cook oatmeal, make coffee and tea, and set the table. 8:00 - 8:30: Say grace and eat breakfast together. Talk about what we did last night, how we slept, and where we all will work today. 8:30 - 9:00: One housemate does the dishes, while everyone else brushes their teeth. I get dressed and get myself ready for the day. Everyone puts on their coats and heads out to their workplace. 9:00 - 11:30: I work in the weavery this morning. As a crew, we finish setting up one loom, weave red and white placemats on another, and weave tites out of recycled grocery bags on a third loom. 11:30 - 12:00: Leave the weavery, check the mail, chat with the staff in the office, and walk over to the harvest kitchen. Catch up with friends before lunch.12:00 - 1:00: Enjoy a homemade pizza meal with the rest of the village. On Fridays, that means around 30 people! 1:00 - 2:00: Relax at our house for Rest Hour. 2:00 - 4:30: Housekeeping time! Together we sweep, mop, vacuum, and clean bathrooms. We never forget to break for tea and nonsense jokes. 4:30 - 6:00: Pick up my housemates from their workplaces, and head home for some down time. I cook dinner for our household and someone else sets the table. 6:00 - 6:30: Eat and chat some more at the sup- per table. 6:30 - 7:00: One housemate does the dishes. Then, we all get ready for community movie night. Don't forget flashlights! 7:00 - 9:00: Enjoy a movie night with friends. LILIPOH SPRING 2020 71 9:00 - 10:00: Help my housemates get ready for bed. Read Little House on the Prairie with one of my housemates before he falls asleep. 10:00 - 11:30: I have some time to myself before enjoying a peaceful night's sleep. JOURNAL ENTRY, 8/9 So far Camphill has taught me to be less intimi- dated to try new things, less stressed over small things, less quick to judge others, & more comfort- able in my skin. I accept that I'm a goofy dancer & horrible singer & am not perfect ever, but I can always be better. Through all of this, I am learning a lot: how to weave on a loom, how to preserve vegetables, how to confidently cook a meal for large groups of people, how to bake bread and make homemade yogurt, and how to grow apples. Along with these skills, I am developing less-technical\u2014but just as important\u2014life skills, too. My housemates have taught me a lot about healthy communication. I distinctly re- member knocking on a housemate's door and entering before she gave me permission during my first week at Camphill. Later, she told me that she would appreciate it if I would wait for her to tell me to enter her room. Since then, I've found myself working harder to be upfront and honest about my feelings with other people. It's a process. But my housemates are teaching me more each day bout being genuine, setting boundaries, and both asking for and giving forgiveness. I've also learned to be patient by observing the patience of those around me. It helps that things move at a slower pace in our community. I know that it will take us fifteen extra minutes to get through the line at the grocery store because we're all paying with checks, and I'm okay with that. In fact, I have begun to enjoy it! I'm constantly reminded fast does not equal better. When we go slower, we have more time to talk with the employees and to enjoy each moment more fully. JOURNAL ENTRY, 7/24 How special is it to share a meal together. Don't take it for granted; acknowledge the sacredness each time. One of my favorite parts of daily life at Camphill Village is mealtime. The food we eat is incredible because it is fresh and grown on our land. I can IN THIS COMMUNITY, MADE UP OF PEOPLE WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES, EVERY DAY IS VIEWED AS A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND EACH OTHER HOW SPECIAL WE ARE. 72 LILIPOH SPRING 2020 EDUCATION + CHILDHOOD The Christian Community is a movement for the renewal of religion, founded in 1922 with the help of Rudolf Steiner.

Celebration of the Festivals Renewal of the Sacraments Services for Children Religious Education Summer Camps Study Groups Lectures think of multiple Saturdays during the summer where at least ten of us\u2014people with and without disabilities alike\u2014harvested green beans together. We shared stories and sang songs as we went, taking time to appreciate the beans that had grown from seeds right before our eyes, the sun that warmed our bodies, and the company of one another. Similarly, meals are made with love in our community. And enjoying this food alongside wonderful people makes it even more special. As we eat, we talk about how our days are going and what we're looking forward to. We joke around and tease one another. We play games at the table where we roll our napkin rings to the person across from us and take part in races to be first to blow out the candle. At the table, we strongly resemble a fam- ily. Like any family, our time together is not always light-hearted and fun. Some meals, we're quiet because we're still waking up or unable to escape the gloomy weather's hold on us. Some meals, we're grouchy or annoyed. Some meals, we just don't have much to say. Despite our moods and the weather and chaos of the day, we still sit down together and take part in this important ritual, which speaks lengths about our commitment to one another. JOURNAL ENTRY, 12/8 I wish all people could experience a place as beautiful as this; a way of life so loving, peaceful & intentional... so full of laughter & compliments & dancing. I didn't know I was signing up for something that will be so hard to leave. Olivia Tarlton joined Camphill Village Minnesota as a coworker in March 2019. Hailing from the suburbs of Dallas, and more recently, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Olivia enjoys reading, biking, and picnics. She is learning to enjoy the winter. After leaving Camphill, her next adventure will be obtaining her master's degree in order to become a middle school English teacher. volunteering at camphill Residential volunteers are an essential part of daily life at the fifteen Camphill communities and affiliates in North America. Called coworkers, these volunteers live, work, and enjoy daily life alongside fellow community members with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities, such as autism and Down syndrome. While living in Camphill communities, coworkers undertake diverse responsibilities and learning experiences, from assisting in pottery, weaving, or woodworking studios to helping out in biodynamic farms, gardens, and bakeries; cooking community meals; sharing household duties; and leading excursions to nearby towns and cities. \"Many volunteers describe their time at Camphill as transformative\u2014a chance to discover themselves; develop lasting friendships; and gain creative and interpersonal skills in a diverse and supportive environment,\" says Leila Kaplan, Camphill Association of North America's Volunteer Outreach Coordinator. In 2019, Camphill Association of North America launched a College Loan Support Program to help make it possible for more young people to work as live-in volunteers at Camphill communities in North America, while continuing to meet their college loan repayment obligations. Camphill volunteers who meet eligibility requirements can receive up to $250 a month\u2014or $3,000 a year\u2014 in loan repayment support. Select Camphill communities offer additional college loan assistance to accepted applicants who have education debt in excess of this amount. In addition to loan assistance, coworkers' basic living needs are met. During their tenures, they receive medical insurance; a monthly stipend; a private room in a beautiful environment; wholesome, mostly organic meals; and other essentials. Camphill's volunteer program also includes education and mentorship for those who wish to develop their inner mindfulness practices, whether creative, spiritual, or intellectual.

Drop-offs at school mostly go well. The children are eager to see their friends and have much to look forward to for the day. Pickup at the end of the day, especially if the children are playing with friends, offers a wide view from smooth-and-congenial to distressed-and-stormy interactions. Is there some magic to ending the day well? There probably isn't (drat and blast!). But attentive watching of friendly and smooth(ish) interactions does reveal a common element. Here's an example. A parent arrives in the play yard to fetch her youngster who is deeply engrossed in play with other children in the sand. As the parent approaches, one of the children holds up a cup with sand piled in it. \"Ice cream cones!\" is announced. \"What flavor?\" asks the parent. \"Chocolate!\" Extending hand forward, the parent asks, \"May I have one?\" The children look at one another with delight in their eyes and make an especially hearty sand cone, which the parent takes plenty of time to savor. \"I really enjoyed that cone. You all make good ice cream. I would like to have some more tomorrow when I come again.\" After sitting for another couple of minutes the par- ent announces, \"Come on, feet. Let's get moving.\" Parent extends a patient and inviting hand, and parent and child head off to go home. Two children are lying on their bellies on the sand, digging as deeply as their arms, stretched to full length, will reach. A grandfather comes to ferry his grandson home. \"What are you digging?\" The children reply, \"A hole to the center of the earth.\" \"Ummm,\" says the grandfather. \"That is really deep. When I was small, I always wanted to dig deep into the earth. Could I help?\" He is readily welcomed. After the trio dig for a while, the grandfather observes, \"This digging needs lots more work. I think we will have to keep going again tomorrow. We've gone as far as arms will go. Tomorrow we will need shovels.\" Grandfather gestures to leave and a satisfied child comes along. One more slightly different, but irresistible, interaction between a child and a teacher comes to mind to share. In the kindergarten, children were sitting with the teacher on the circle rug. One six-year-old boy sat next to the teacher. The little boy tented his knees, lowered his head, and sort of wrapped his arms to hide his face. Intrigued, the teacher looked to see why he had concealed his head. She saw him blowing a huge spit bubble. She said, \"That is the biggest spit bubble I have ever seen. Wow. I know that I couldn't do that.\" The guiding our children Enter the Flow and then Go NANCY BLANNING LILIPOH SPRING 2020 77 Curbing Climate Change Through Biodynamic Agriculture By Elizabeth Candelario As the certifying agency for Bio- dynamic farms across the USA, Demeter's vision is to heal the planet through agriculture.

Each of these scenarios could have turned into an impatient or critical confrontation, but did not. What is the common thread that led each to another place? In each case, the adult entered into the realm of the children's consciousness and joined in the flow of their activity\u2014their play, even their potentially provocative behavior\u2014in an objective, friendly, and interested way. The adult acknowledged the child's world and affirmed it was a worthy place to be by appropriately entering into it. The parent and teacher entered the flow and then sensed the right moment to guide the child into the world of time and practical matters without a jarring shock to the child. The consciousness of little children is so dif- ferent from the adult, time-driven, logical, practi- cal state of, \"Come on. Let's get this done.\" Little children do not live in time and are not conscious of time in an awakened way. Whatever children are doing is completely absorbing and the only thing going on in their universe at that moment. They are the activity and are completely devoted to it. They still have the memory of the spiritual WHATEVER CHILDREN ARE DOING IS COMPLETELY ABSORBING AND THE ONLY THING GOING ON IN THEIR UNIVERSE AT THAT MOMENT.

Their consciousness is yet more connected to the there than to the here. One can suggest that they are still living closely to the kingdom of God, as mentioned in spiritual writings. Holy writings state that, unless one becomes like a little child, one cannot enter the kingdom of God. Many great thinkers speculated what this means. Can it possibly mean we can approach this mystery by intentionally entering the time- less, consciousness-flow of the child's devotion to her task and rest there for a moment? Might we thereby open a doorway to otherwise dim memories of a world from which we came\u2014where all was good?These are lofty metaphysical questions that may seem rather distant from ice cream cones in the sand box. We can ponder whether playfully and sincerely digging to the center of the earth will bring us closer to the kingdom of God in our own adult ways. Whatever might be true, one sure thing is that entering the flow, dwelling with the child for a moment in this timeless devotedness, can surely help at pickup time.

Bead weaver, push your sharp silver needle through the golden beads of your amber tears. Pull taut the shared cord of his memory through every bead's dark center again and again. Count a prayer and declare renewal on each bead of amber, turquoise, and coral. Repair this broken necklace, its scattered beads rolling 'round and 'round in a shallow cedar tray. Tap the beads in the canopy of light, the bare bulb haloing your head. Weave the singing necklace back. String all the pieces to its clasp. Hold it all in your hands. Hold it all together and make it whole again.For you the amber beads melt warm honey of life's ancient stirrings. The turquoise beads \u2014 shapeshifters \u2014 spin azure dreams for you. The coral beads pulse life's sea force \u2014 walking tides' labyrinth for you. Hold it all in your hands. Hold it all together and make it whole again. Work the puzzle with your grey green goddess eyes. You know each night the sun bead drops. You know the path through the night bead's darkness. You know each morning you will string radiance to the rising sun. \u2014 BY SHARON METZLER-DOW A jeweler in a jewelry shop asked for a poem; she said her son had died at sixteen three years ago and she could not get past it \u2014 how could she move on?
