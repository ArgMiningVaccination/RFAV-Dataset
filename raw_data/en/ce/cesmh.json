Common names A Plant Reclassified Into the Family Ericaceae. The Indian Pipe was originally classified into the family Monotropaceae, but after further research was reclassified to be included in the Ericaceae family of plants (heaths). Heaths are herbs, shrubs and trees that thrive in acidic soil, like cranberry, blueberry, azalea and rhododendron, and are known to have the same kind of relationship with mychorrhizal fungi. Since Indian Pipe has no chlorophyll, it cannot photosynthesise its own food like most plants. Therefore, it has to obtain nutrients from another organism. The way it does this is by having its roots tap into the mycelia of a fungus. Meanwhile, the fungus's mycelia tap into the host-tree's roots. Many fungi and trees have this type of relationship - it's called a \"mycorrhizal relationship.\" These plants are classed as \"epiparasite\" or \"mycoheterophyte.\" The plant benefits by more efficient mineral (especially phosphorus) uptake. The fungus benefits by the sugars translocated to the root by the plant. Both organisms help each other out. Indian Pipe, however, does not appear to give anything back to the fungus or the tree. It takes nutrients from the fungus that it had received from the tree. Since the fungus then has to take more nutrients from the tree, this makes Indian Pipe a parasite of both the fungus and the tree. Botanical Source and Description. Indian pipe plant has a dark-coloured, fibrous, perennial root, matted in masses about as large as a chestnut-burr, from which arise one or more short, ivory-white stems, 4 to 8 inches high, furnished with sessile, lanceolate, white, semi-transparent, approximate leaves or bracts, and bearing a large, white, terminal, solitary flower, which is at first nodding, like a downward facing smokers pipe, but becomes upright in fruit. The calyx is represented by two to four scale-like deciduous bracts, the lower rather distant from the corolla. The corolla is permanent, of 5 distinct, erect, fleshy petals, which are narrowed below with a small, nectariferous pit at the base. Stamens 10, sometimes 8; anthers short on the thickened apex of the hairy filament, 2-celled, opening by transverse chinks. Stigma 5-crenate, depressed, and beardless. Pod or capsule 5-celled and 5-valved; the seeds numerous, and invested with an arillus-like membrane (W. G. Eaton). History and Chemical Composition. This is a singular plant, found in various parts of the USA from Maine to Carolina, and westward to Missouri, growing in shady woods, in rich, moist soil, or soil composed, of decayed wood and leaves, and near the base of trees. The whole plant is ivory-white in all its parts, resembling frozen jelly, and is very succulent and tender, so much so that when handled it dissolves and melts away in the hands like ice. The flowers are inodorous, and appear from June until September; their resemblance to a pipe has given rise to the names Indian pipe or Pipe-plant. The root is the part used; it should be gathered in September and October, carefully dried, pulverized, and kept in well-stoppered bottles. A. J. M. Lasch\u00e9 (Pharm. Rundschau, 1889, p. 208) has found in this plant a crystallizable poisonous principle, which also occurs in several other ericaceous plants; it is named andromedotoxin (C31H51O10). Action, Medical Uses, and Dosage. Indian pipe root is a tonic, sedative, nervine, and antispasmodic. It has also been employed in febrile diseases, as a sedative and diaphoretic. The powder has been employed in instances of restlessness, pains, nervous irritability, etc., as a substitute for opium, without any deleterious influences. It is reputed to have cured remittent and intermittent fevers, and to be an excellent antiperiodic. In convulsions of children, epilepsy, chorea, and other spasmodic affections, its administration has been followed with prompt success; hence its common name Fit or Convulsion root. The juice of the plant, alone, or combined with rose water, has been found to be an excellent application for obstinate ophthalmic inflammation, to ulcers, and as an injection in gonorrhoea, inflammation and ulceration of the bladder. Dose of the powdered root is from 1/2 to 1 drachm, 2 or 3 times a day. It has also been employed in cases of acute anxiety and/or psychotic episodes due to intense drug experiences. The herbal preparation of aerial parts given 1-3 1ml doses has in numerous cases given quick relief to these episodes within 15-30 minutes, at which time the patient falls asleep to awake calm and clear hours later. It seems in these cases, a repressed traumatic memory emerges from the depths of the subconscious, putting the person into a state of emotional and/or sensory overload. It has been used effectively in treating severe mental and emotional pain due to PTSD and other traumatic injury, as well as severe nerve pain due to Lyme disease. There is a Cherokee legend about the Indian Pipe: Long ago, when selfishness first entered the world, people began quarrelling, first with their own families and tribal members, and then with other tribes. The chiefs of the several tribes met together to try to solve the problem of quarrelling. They smoked a peace pipe together, while continuing to quarrel among themselves for the next seven days and seven nights. In punishment for smoking the peace pipe before actually making peace, the Great Spirit turned the chiefs into grey flowers and made them grow where relatives and friends had quarrelled. MONOTROPA'S PROVING When Misha Norland first came across Monotropa in woods in Vermont USA, he was immediately struck by its appearance: a ghostly apparition; white shrouds on leafy floor of dim woodland. Closer inspection revealed a translucent flower and stem emerging from the ground, completely lacking green; a parasite for sure. He picked a few and was amazed by the structure's lack of density; the plants collapsed in his hands almost as if they had melted. Being prepared to bag whatever he found, he placed all that was above ground in a bottle he carried for just such a purpose. Here the plants quickly blackened. When he returned home a few hours later he added vodka for preservation, ready for later potentisation. At the time he did not know that herbalists find the roots the most medicinally active part of the plant, or else he would doubtlessly have taken these. However, it is usually found that all parts of a plant are in fact medicinal, just that some parts, like root or bark or seeds predominantly concentrate one or another active ingredient. When potentised, the difference in strength of individual parts loses significance, for it is the quality of the entire plant, rather than the quantity of active ingredients in specific parts, that matters. Certainly the proving brought out a wealth of characteristics. The tincture was run up to 30c potency in the classroom (substance unknown to provers), with provers taking turns at dilution and succession, using Korsicovian methodology. The final potency of 30c was used as the proving dose. As is our custom at the School of Homeopathy, just one dose was taken, proving diaries and daily supervision, commencing from this point, and continuing for two months. MIASM The prominent miasm is the AIDS miasm. This is because the boundary issue is paramount. For Indian Pipe to survive it needs to become confluent with the mycelium of fungus, that in turn becomes confluent with tree roots for its nutrition. Also the structure above ground looses its boundary and melts away when handled. Hence its other names, ghost plant, corpse plant, wax plant. The feeling of having no boundaries between oneself and the world, of being vulnerable, naked and exposed is perhaps the most basic feeling of the AIDS nosode, and its opposite state, of feeling isolated, alone and cast out. In Indian pipe, vulnerable boundaries, loss of direction, disconnection, confusion, and not belonging to family or group oppose fortification of boundaries, sense of direction, connection, clarity and confrontation leading to resolution. There are, of course CANCER miasm themes, but these seem secondary and of a compensatory nature. VITAL SENSATION Writing about the family Ericaceae, Rajan Sankaran states the following: need to move from one place to another; wandering; extension; change. Jan Scholten writing about Ericales (newer Cronquist classification) has this to say: they have the feeling they are only tolerated and are not really accepted anymore... they often live in poor conditions, which they can do as they do not need very much... they may long for recognition and compliments... in the end they can become bitter... they may see themselves as unimportant, taking no place, having few needs, offering themselves for others. This echoes Edward Bach's indications for the flower remedy Heather. In 'the twelve healers', he states: for loneliness, those who are always seeking companionship of anyone who may be available, as if they find it necessary to discuss their own affairs with others... In these latter respects we find powerful resonances with Indian pipe with its issues of being tapped in, carried by the flow, and its opposite state of being blocked, of having the flow cut off, feeling isolated, numbed-out, alienated. And because Indian pipe is an epiparasitic Eracales, and relies completely on its hosts for nutrition, the indications given by Edward Bach for Heather seem to be amplified. The proving revealed another strand running alongside that of Ericaceae, that seems to be related to the plant's mycorrhizal relationship. It is of course, the fungal theme of invasion and expansion, as well as issues like dependence on water, decomposition, and dissolution. The vital sensation that Rajan Sankaran derives from Fungi is invading, burrowing, digging, excoriating, and eroding. Dreams of underground tubes and tunnels, basements, burrowing, rising high and diving deep were consistent Monotropa proving themes. The consensus in this proving experience was that when it is possible to push through these dark, lurking unpleasant truths and \"bring them up into the light\" we can reconnect and become one again with Source. Michal Yakir writes (the full version is given in the attached appendix) the remedy displays the Ericales themes. The main themes of the Ericales: Obligation to give to the family, which becomes a liability; surrender to the family's dictates. Anxiety for health, need to be taken care of, dependant. Alienated and rejected from family and nurture, oppressed and imprisoned by the family unit. Coming into own fruition, seeking recognition outside the family. Creativity issues. Domineering, emasculating feminine; male-reproductive pathology; tumours and growth. Obstructed and rigid, with male sexual organ pathology. Even emasculating feelings. Immobility, joints, rigidity, obstructed, resistance to change, or flowing and changing. Dreams (An analysis of the dreams and their significance has been written by Jane Tara Cicchetti and is presented in full in the appendix.) The provers produced a prodigious number of dreams. There were approximately 232 dreams and possibly more as some were not identified as separate dreams, but put together with others. The most frequently occurring powerful imagery was that of a being morphing from one state into another. Transvestites, cross dressing, drag queens, a child becomes a cat, a person dressed as a cow, human legs became super pistons and transforming, grotesquely, into a younger person. In a similar category, there were images of new species created after this change had occurred. These included crows with Darth Vader heads, a slug/worm, Amish family with hippopotamus teeth; a human with horse or goat legs (Pan), a farm of animal/beings fused between human and animal, a man with ridiculously huge biceps. Another group of images related to the brain. There at least 10 dreams where characters appeared with either autism, brain damage, or serious mental problems. There was one appearance of Downs syndrome. There were quite a few images of elderly people and premature aging. Also several dreams contained images of autistic people in wheel chairs. Two dreams had an interesting reference to magnetic force. Finally there were a few strong images of brutality, animal testing, and hypodermic syringes. Mappa Mundi Differential Diagnosis We would obviously look for relationships within both the Ericaceae family and Fungi, and elements in the third row of the periodic table and compounds deriving from them, with a particular focus on Phosphorus. Additionally Opium whose herbal action Monotropa mimics. Anacardium and Anacardiaceae. The AIDS nosode. Molluscs. Rhus tox and Thuja were also mentioned repeatedly during the proving; in dreams and as antidotes respectively. We wish to single out Lindsay Samuelson, who was one of the provers, for her sterling work in collating, synthesizing and writing up this proving. This represents a huge amount of work and requires a depth of understanding so as to bring out themes in a useful manner. Without this labour a proving is no more that an assemblage of random facts that while leading to reportorial inclusion, does not enlighten the reader. MONOTROPA'S NARRATIVE Written by Lindsay Samuelson Proving Themes Being tapped in brings flow Flow travels through tubes Tubes get inflamed, congested Congestion creates dysfunction Dysfunction breeds chaos Chaos divides, which direction? Direction gets confused, lost Loss of direction creates panic Panic scatters Scattering causes separation Separation is isolating Isolation seeks unification Unification requires leadership Leadership draws in support from other sources Source nourishes and brings strength Strength directs will Will provokes resistance Resistance produces struggle Struggle creates quarrelling Quarrelling craves Justice Justice must confront Confrontation needs power Power fears loss of power Power oppresses Oppression feels Heavy Heavy gets suppressed Suppression flattens Flatness is lowly Lowly is vulnerable Vulnerable boundaries get penetrated Penetration goes deep Depth hides Underground Underground is hidden Hidden is dark Dark becomes illuminated Illumination brings clairvoyance Clairvoyance brings truth Truth brings connection Connection taps in Tapped in brings calm flow The following themes are but one way to categorize the provers' information into a 'story' of the remedy. Its multi-dimensional expression is difficult to capture in one set of designated themes. My main objective is to present the raw data and to leave the interpretation to the reader. The final 'theme', entitled 'MISC DREAMS' is for all dreams that express not just one but a multitude of themes. I hope that these particular dreams illustrate the synergistic relationship of the themes I have presented below: CALM FLOW Imagine drifting in a tube. You are flowing freely without resistance. The direction of travel is set. There is nothing to resist, just to relax and go with the flow. There is inherent order in the process. Being tapped in and connected to Source means you are on your path, wherever it may take you. This state of connectedness is so perfect that neither fear nor anxiety arise. A major theme in this proving had to do with the connection to source which provided, protected, and moved things along with ease to their resolution. Tubes and tunnels, flowing liquid, and being a part of a group (often in swimming pools and oceans) were strong proving themes. Keywords/Phrases Smooth Intense but not chaotic Connection Go with the flow Drain Effortless I just accept Attuned GROUP Being unified with the group provided security for the provers. They experienced an intensified longing to be connected to loved ones. Strength and support were sought by their company, and with this arose anxieties of separation. Several provers strongly desired to be home safe with their families, fearing danger when they were not. One often takes a leadership role, asserting a sense of direction and providing security to those perceived as more vulnerable. This was seen in several dreams of protecting children and the handicapped amongst the group. A need to be included in the group and not left out came up a lot in this proving. Space and time were misjudged leading to disconnect from others (missed appointments and broken communications). Sensations included feeling as if \"in a bubble\", and \"in my own world.\" A need for space and separation from the group was also experienced. This isolation had a sense of not relating, not fitting in with the others. There were also instances of trying to establish one's own bed amongst the group, as if one was worried they would not have a place amongst the group. Bird's nests also came up several times (another name for the plant). This can be interpreted as needing to carve out one's own space amongst the safety of the group. This feeling of feeling included or excluded from the group occurred in many social situations as well as in the dream world. Keywords/Phrases Abandoned Snubbed Lonely Left behind Rejected Split up Not Listened to Bonding with others DISCONNECTION/CUT OFF Imagine being disconnected/cut off from the group, the flow. Being separated occurred through either obstruction or detachment. When a tube is obstructed, there is constriction, pressure, chaos, and explosive intensity. When a tube is detached from source, the contents become stronger or weaken, depending on whether they are still attached to source or not. A severed tube that connects to source still has great power but no direction. However, contents of a severed tube cut off from source become weak, vulnerable, separate, and eventually drain dry. But in both cases of detachment, control is lost. Throughout the proving diaries we see examples of disconnection via obstruction or detachment from source in the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, genitourinary and digestive systems. General symptoms included congestions, inflammations, constrictions, pressures, restlessness, numbness, and in-coordination. Specific conditions mentioned in the proving included a wide range of pathologies including peripheral vascular disease, aneurism, gout, severed body parts, autism, dementia, and psychosis. These conditions all illustrate this concept of flow being obstructed or detached from source. Obstructive dreams/delusions included cars driving down narrow roads, barricades, and traffic jams. Dreams of disconnection included bleeding, severed body parts, leakages and becoming detached. People were cut off from others, some by losing the group, being left out, or being emotionally detached in provocative situations. These are just a few examples of many experiences of obstruction or detachment. Keywords/Phrases Numb Disconnect Severing Cut off Splintering Constricted Pressurized Explosive DIRECTION When the steady direction of flow provided by Source is disrupted, confusion and restlessness set in. There was a distinct feeling of being cut off, of not knowing \"which way do I go?\" There seemed to be no way out, of being 'in limbo' but unable to move through to the other side. Having to decide which direction to navigate left provers feeling dithery and restless, often alternating with apathetic hopelessness. There was a strong dependence on others for guidance. Dreams of maps and patterns, different routes and possibilities were illustrative of this sensation. The struggle to move through manifested in congestions and stiffness, better for movement. There was also a feeling of being half-in, half-out. Many lay awake at night neither asleep nor awake...somewhere in between. There was a sense of duality; of two ways or two directions. One prover described it as \"thinking two different things at the same time, as if two trains of thought, one conscious and one unconscious.\" It was as if the normal route or impulse was disconnected enough to allow alternate possibilities to seep in and influence direction. Keywords/Phrases: Off the rails Feeling adrift No way out Push through Half in, half out Duality On the edge Different routes Flittering Lost for any direction Sucked Struggle to move through PENETRATION/FORTIFICATION OF BOUNDARY In order to seep in, boundaries must be penetrable. Fences, perimeters, edges, surfaces, neighbourhoods and armies represented boundaries between two sides. Some boundaries were represented as invincible and fortified, others were penetrated by overwhelming forces. Power and strength opposed debility and weakness, physically, mentally, and emotionally throughout the proving. Pains were stabbing, pricking, and often focused in one spot. Penetrated boundaries were also experienced on the mental/emotional levels. Provers felt on the periphery of the group, had sensations of 'people seeing right through' them, and wanting to be invisible. Others expressed feelings that people were 'feeding' off of them. Dreams of being bitten, raped, vaccinated, and attacked were widespread amongst the provers. The most extreme of this boundary violation was expressed through torture. Both animals and humans in captivity were victims of violent cruelties. The boundary that separates one from the other was also represented by edges. There were sensations and dreams of \"on the edge\" of both physical and mental landscapes. Skimming, floating and surfing on water was a repeated sensation amongst several of the provers. The edge of reality was also illustrated by the presence of ghosts in the room, which ties into the sensation of being halfway between two states: in this case, reality and imagination. Uncertainty of boundary was expressed in other ways. Confusion over identity, age and gender were seen a lot in dreams of transsexuals, twins, and transformations between young and old as well as between ugly and pretty. Is this a male or a female? Is it the same person or someone else? Is this mine or yours? One prover was diagnosed with breast cancer during the proving just days after resolving to stop taking responsibility for other family members children. She wrote days before her diagnosis: \"nothing I do seems to make any difference and it is taking over my life. I am realising that all my efforts have very little effect. Am considering letting go of things I cannot change, at least for a little while.\" The experience of differentiation between the group and the individual boundaries became either hazy or fortified. This also occurred in a variety of other physical pathologies, particularly of the auto-immune system, where the boundaries between self and non-self become blurred: AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis were named and symptomatically experienced by several provers. Keywords/Phrases: Piercing Stabbing Leaking Intrusion Hijacking Taking over Freeloading Boundaries crossed UP/DOWN Tapping into the hidden truths lurking beneath the surface, boundaries between dark and light became pierced, allowing things below to rise up from the depths. Dreams of underground tubes and tunnels, basements, burrowing, rising high and diving deep were consistent proving themes. Polarities of flat, heavy, weighted down sensations contrasted floating and weightlessness. The consensus in this proving experience was that when it is possible to push through these dark, lurking unpleasant truths and \"bring them up into the light\" we can reconnect and become one again with Source. Keywords/Phrases: Diving down Rising high Mountains Valleys Descending Basements Underground Flying Underwater Floating Dark Light Hidden Exposed Low High Ice Fire LOSS OF CONTROL The chaos and confusion of being cut off from the calm flow of source eventually led to loss of control. This manifested in both pleasant and unpleasant emotional states. Some found their anxiety relieved, becoming passive and relaxed rather than experiencing their usual need to be 'in the driver's seat', micro-managing others. Conversely, others found themselves in a state of intermittent but chronic panic. Intense depressions and panic attacks were experienced and provers questioned their sanity. To compensate, a compulsion to put things in their proper place was seen in the majority of provers. Cleaning and organizing were attempted to create order amongst the chaos. Another coping method was \"ducking out, going underground\" expressed by others as going \"underwater.\" Instances of throwing things with great precision exemplifies the desire to focusing power in one direction to compensate for the lack of focus and frenetic \"ditheriness\" seen throughout the proving. Additionally, provers were drawn to the flow and direction of patterns as well as flowing waters. The patterns seemed to provide focus, a sense of order. Compulsion for order alternated with a lack of clarity in complicated situations with no perceived way out. Keywords/Phrases: Meticulous Untidy Unbearable Unresolvable Losing mind Overwhelmed Frenetic Giddy Nausea Claustrophobia Anesthatized Stoned VULNERABLE/DEPENDENCE Loss of control created a sense of vulnerability. Connection to source was lost, and so was sense of direction. Chaos and panic, and the feeling of having no control were expressed as intensified fears of car crashes, tragic accidents including drowning, and being the victim of violent crimes. The overwhelming power and force of the sea was referenced numerous times in the proving in both waking and dream life. There were numerous dreams of tidal waves as well as sensations of being sucked back in to negative mental states. These sensations lead to a helplessness and dependence on others for protection. Neediness, clinginess, and a fear of abandonment were strongly experienced in this proving. Keywords/Phrases: Vulnerable Unsteady Challenged Disabled Reliant Unable to cope Exposed Sad and Lonely Supported Powerless Precarious Safer with the group CONFRONTATION/RESOLUTION Attack from the outside creates two basic responses: fight or flight. In \"fight\", one stands up for oneself, while \"flight\" concedes that the other is dominant. A split decision is made which determines the relationship. One is to become victim, feeling bullied and dominated. The other response requires greater strength and courage to assert themselves, preventing future attack if successful in the fight. Throughout this proving there was a growing awareness of being victimized, of vulnerable boundaries being penetrated but with this a rising strength to confront and resolve situations which were previously suppressed. This was seen in numerous circumstances having to do with confronting those who had used their powers to bully others into submission (including sexual abuse cover-ups). On an international scale, the Occupy movement protested social and economical inequality and arose just as the proving began. Keywords/Phrases: Bullied Confront Startled Adrenaline Attacked Fight Hide Stand up for myself Assertive Dominated Peaceful Menacing INTENSE WAVES Many provers felt they had finished proving only to feel sucked back in by another wave. This wave cycle ebbed and flowed, and proved quite uncomfortable to the provers. The proving seemed to go and then return for over a year in some cases. There were numerous examples of feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, often depicted in diary entries about the sea. One prover looked out at the sea and for the first time found it \"menacing.\" It made her incredibly sad and threatened. It took her several hours to recover. Others dreamt of large waves sweeping swimmers out to sea while they watched from afar, helpless as each wave rolled in. There was an abundance of dreams with a sense of being overpowered by the sea. The pressure and power of this remedy ebbed and flowed, churning up the repressed issues in many prover's lives from the depths of suppression. Desperation, weakness, and disconnect prompted provers to \"go underground,\" and \"sweep things under the carpet.\" The intensity of the pressure and heaviness in this remedy was \"unbearable\" for some, they could not even write about it in their diaries. Eventually they turned against themselves by way of a deep self-loathing. The appearance of severe degenerative disease illustrates this heaviness, hopelessness and loss of control. Perhaps it was madness in the end that forced provers to face the darkness head on when no other alternative alleviated their suffering. These forces gradually wore away at them, tormenting them to the point of confrontation. Connecting to the darkness became imperative to finding the light. Keywords/Phrases: Sucked Drawn Receding Sudden surge Swept away Clinging No anchor Tossed Resolve Regression Forced Extreme exhaustion This remedy penetrates the space between dark and light, above and below, me and you, suppressed and expressed - a dynamic journey of faith in the direction of travel. Like a surge of water released after building up in an obstructed pipe, provers who had previously become flattened or disconnected were pressurized enough to gain the strength and force needed to fortify boundaries and reconnect to source.

Energy intense but even, not chaotic. 01PF 1 0:00:00 NS After taking the remedy I notice a feeling of peace, as if I could fall asleep, although I am not aware of feeling tired. 07PF 1 0:00:10 NS The room felt ethereal and I felt we were doing something very sacred. I kept looking at the word 'Harmony', the title of the book we succussed on. The trees, mountains and beautiful natural scenery on the cover seemed a good omen, the eve of something very special. As the remedy was passed around, I made sure my successions were on the words and images that made me feel at one with the world. In the process the book was dented. I couldn't decide if the book was sacrificial or if I was participating in disrespectful destruction. I chose to look at it as sacrificial. 02PF 1 0:00:00 NS Everything feels more voluptuous, all senses alive. Even my shower feels lovely and refreshing. In the moment. The sense of being truly alive. The mellow feeling is strong. 08PF 2 XX:XX:XX NS Drove a short distance after a glass of wine, but did not feel aware of the effects as I normally would. I already felt unreal, but also quite attuned to the world around me. Relaxed feeling. 03PF 2 0:21:30 NS A feeling of gentleness in a conversation, something I haven't experienced with him before. A feeling of calm. There was a sense of openness, my guard was down and I was comfortable with the silences. Being comfortable with silence is not usual for me. I'm fully aware of it at the time and in retrospect I wonder if this remedy has taken away a sense of fight-or-flight. 01PF 3 16:30:00 NS Anxiety is not felt as intensely as normal. At home my partner invited people over even though I had to catch a plane in the early morning and hadn't packed yet. Big trip tomorrow but somehow do not feel overwhelmed. Normally I would have a drink to relax. Enjoyed the company even though I was really tired. Finally, I went to bed and left them to let themselves out when normally I would have felt obligated and polite to stay up until they left. 02PF 3 XX:XX:XX AS On the way to the airport I felt rushed but surprisingly calm. I had things to do but without a sense of anxiety or urgency that is normal for me. Although I didn't feel focused, I felt calm. Usually I feel unfocused and anxious. 02PF 4 0:08:00 AS More calm than usual today, travelled with family member which brings up old stressful patterns of behaviour but I was not stressed or wanting things to be different. I just went with it, without expectation or resistance. Everything just seemed to flow in the way it was meant to. 02PF 4 0:11:55 AS I feel very calm, floating, serene. 11PF 4 XX:XX:XX AS Feel calm most of the day and slightly spaced out. The day hasn't been busy so I haven't tested my ability to focus and react. I have pottered and done an adequate amount of work. 01PF 5 XX:XX:XX AS Still feeling very relaxed as get to work. Was told that team is losing some admin time. I would normally react to something like this quite strongly, get cross and find out exactly what was happening and why. Today it just doesn't matter- what will be will be. Don't feel as if its worth the effort to get upset or annoyed. I feel it doesn't matter, its not important. Lovely feeling, just going with the flow. 06PF 5 0:09:30 NS Son needs to print off some homework but printer has run out of ink. Normally I would get really cross about this and want to know why husband hasn't got a spare cartridge but today I remain calm and arrange for a friend to print it for him. 06PF 5 0:19:00 AS Really enjoy taking the cases of 2 children this afternoon. Don't feel nervous at all- unusual- I've had big problems with nervousness before consultations and although its been getting better I have still had it recently. 08PF 5 0:15:45 NS The feeling of peace and calm is fading as I think about all I need to do today. This causes an inner tension/panic but I try hard to grasp the calm feeling where time is plentiful. I don't feel agitated and remain calm. 06PF 6 XX:XX:XX AS Whilst driving into work, I feel very positive and optimistic. It is as if all of the negative thoughts that I have been having recently have been blown away. I no longer feel anxious and worried but calm and relaxed. 07PF 6 0:08:30 NS In supermarket, its very busy and lots of people with trolleys. Normally I would get very agitated and annoyed with all the trolleys but today it doesn't bother me, but I do feel a strong need to finish and get out in to fresh air. 06PF 7 0:11:30 AS This is the first day since the proving I feel a little on edge and irritable.

Would normally get annoyed about amount of mess he makes but tonight it was ok despite the mess everywhere. Just tidied it up after him. Run out of hot water so had to leave washing up but again that was OK. Normally I would have to sort it out there and then. Left it till morning. 06PF 7 0:20:00 AS Less emotional intensity is creating more space and energy to tackle those unfinished things that need completion. Some of the ways these are being tackled seems to be in the realm of pure potential energy. Pure manifestation 11PF 7 XX:XX:XX NS Sorting through paper work and find a bill that hasn't been paid.

Feels I am a nicer person! 06PF 8 0:13:00 AS Aware that I have lots I need to do today but this is not stressing me out. Just decide to work through each thing one at a time. Have also arranged to meet husband for lunch, again wouldn't normally do this when I have so much I want to do today. Feel disconnected from what I need to do although know I need to do it. 06PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS I feel more carefree, happier, lighter and brighter 11PF 8 XX:XX:XX AS Son is a lot calmer and relaxed. Hasn't really settled at secondary school since he started in September but I now feel he has shifted slightly. One of his lessons he worries about and normally cries before going to but this morning only had a slight moan and then off he went to school easily. Tonight he has been invited to a friend's birthday party where he won't know anyone else. Normally he wouldn't go because of this but today he isn't worried and goes quite happily. 06PF 8 XX:XX:XX AS Leaving home for Norwich - would normally be quite stressed as we are leaving later than planned but today it doesn't matter. 06PF 9 0:08:15 NS Dreaming about lions. Saw some, big and strong. A male and one or possibly 2 females. I was quite close to them and it was all very calm. 06PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM We prepare lunch together, sharing tasks so it all seems effortless. Everyone relaxes completely. After lunch we take a moment to ourselves. I find a window seat looking out to the sea. The house, its decor, atmosphere, are timeless. It's time out of time; completely restorative. We have everything we could possibly need, nothing in life that we 'don't need'. I've rarely been so relaxed in my life. 11PF 11 XX:XX:XX Busy doing housework. Usually I would hate and resent the time this takes but today I just get on with it and quite enjoy it. Feel very calm and relaxed. 06PF 13 0:15:30 NS Feel much calmer. Car Park very busy and this would normally annoy me but I remain calm and eventually we find a parking space. 06PF 16 0:13:30 Aware that I'm getting up much later than usual, not hurried by things I need to do or motivated by the idea of having a cigarette with my coffee. I lie in bed and, instead of being driven out of bed by morbid thoughts or things to do, I lie there completely relaxed with my mind blank. In the back of my mind is the knowledge that I should get up but it doesn't motivate me to do so. I'm aware of a slight guilt every now and then that I'm being ineffectual but even that doesn't motivate me to get up. 01PF 17 XX:XX:XX AS Late for starting work but I have no desire to get there. The sun is shining in the sky and I yearn to turn the car around and head for a big open space. I visualise myself dancing in a big open field - arms spread wide as I turn round and round and dance, enjoying the sensation of freedom and no pressure and I am totally oblivious to everything. 06PF 18 0:09:30 NS I feel loving and gentle and calm towards my little one, I don't feel like popping our bubble. I'm doing some work, it's oddly efficient, smooth, it doesn't feel like working. 11PF 18 0:10:00 AS I'm not getting stressed. I get lots of work done, hardly noticing, making work calls, writing. I like this sense of never feeling stress. I'm getting so used to it I could almost believe it's the normal me. 11PF 19 XX:XX:XX AS I'm very calm and empty of extraneous worries and mental or emotional clutter. I'm not striving. Being without irritability for the past few weeks, increasingly, is as if there is less \"noise on the line\". I'm very calm. I'm much less reactive. Partner is less irritable too. 11PF 21 0:23:00 NS I seem to have a greater tolerance threshold; that includes alcohol (wine) and coffee as well as people. There is no striving. It is as it is. I keep wiping up, not making any leaps of progress, just paddling along. 11PF 21 XX:XX:XX NS I'm more in the mood to meditate than get all wired up. I feel equanimous. I still don't care about money, I just don't want to have to care about money! 11PF 27 XX:XX:XX AS I felt confident. I had no problem with talking in front of the class. If I had something to say, I just said it. I've never felt like this before, it felt like the real me without any nervous tension to get in the way. 12PM 29 0:12:00 NS I sat with the others during lunch and was taken back by how calm everyone seemed. Everyone appeared to be completely integrated. I felt no nervousness or tension, there was an ease with the group I've never felt before. I noticed that I felt confident in their company. For the first time I could just be myself. Spoke to another prover who mentioned that she thought I seemed \"smooth\" in my communication and position with the group. She said she'd never seen this in me before. Whenever I talked in front of anyone about anything I just said whatever came into my mind without any hesitation. I feel liberated by this. No more tension and being weighed down by doubt. I really like me when I'm like this, so much easier and relaxed. This is the first time with these people I felt completely at ease. There's no tension outside or inside of me, everyone and everything feels harmonious. 12PM 29 0:14:00 NS I'm feeing less cosmic today. Maybe I'm coming back down to earth. I'm starting to experience doubt, impatience, and wondering if the proving substance has worn off. 11PF 32 XX:XX:XX AS Problem with my laptop and computer programme. Normally I would get really annoyed when it won't work but I remained calm, despite wasting several hours trying to fix it. 06PF 36 0:13:30 NS Serene. I feel happy and content. Complete. I'm not rushed or impatient this morning, we are in perfect time even when we only have a minute or two. I've enjoyed every moment being on my own with child. 11PF 36 XX:XX:XX NS I feel calm and focused. 11PF 48 XX:XX:XX RIGHT WORDS Throughout the evening there are several instances of misunderstanding words people are using. I heard \"midges\" instead of images, \"seven\" instead of Severn, I said dark and someone heard \"dog\". 02PF 1 XX:XX:XX IOS Lots of times people mishear one another's words; there is confusion over meaning as well as hearing. Images / midges. Severn / severed. 11PF 1 XX:XX:XX Whilst I am talking to people I am aware that I am finding it difficult to think of the right word. I know what I want to say but am finding it hard to express it clearly. I'm surprised that other people don't seem to notice that my speech is delayed or that I am hesitant over words, but no-one remarks on it. 07PF 1 0:00:30 NS Sometimes struggling/fumbling for the right words to describe something and can't remember names of people and things (RS). Sometimes also finding just the right word just comes to me very easily (more of a NS). A couple of times I check the word out in the dictionary to be sure that it means what I think it does- I'm surprised by this sudden articulateness about 'big words' -its less like me! This continues (still experiencing by day 4) 08PF 2 XX:XX:XX NS A prover asks me how you spell phallus to write in his proving journal. I say f-a-l-l-a-c-y. He says no, phallus. 11PF 2 0:10:30 Could not gather thoughts to express them through words, although concepts were clear in my head. This happened after I had being sitting in a cool wind, which I had found very distracting. 03PF 3 0:15:30 IOS I have noticed an ease with writing my diary. I can find the word I want to fully express what I want to say. Not only this but a poetic expression is coming through. 01PF 4 XX:XX:XX More words with a slipped meaning: \"improving instead \"proving experiences\", \"live\" instead of love. \"Anagram\" becomes \"Enneagram\". Interesting that these are not just mistyped words resulting in spelling mistakes, they lead to actual words with a different meaning. 11PF 5 0:12:00 NS Saying completely the wrong word in a sentence e.g. talking to my son about his driving test, \"you'll loose money if you do that\" instead of \"you'll loose points if you do that\". Mistakes also in writing: more spelling mistakes than would usually make in typing- more reversal of letters. Also using the wrong buttons to perform operations. This continues throughout the proving, until my 2nd antidote. About day 70 I'm writing reports on the computer and I suddenly notice that I'm not making spelling mistakes nearly so often as I was doing. Its not been so bad since- this was definitely an intensified Sx during proving) 08PF 6 XX:XX:XX I feel like I am able to better communicate information appropriate to her level in regards to my beliefs on spirituality Usually I feel frustrated and don't know how to communicate to people appropriately. 02PF 7 XX:XX:XX NS Trying to write my diary about my dreams but can't get the words out, can't follow the memories 01PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM Processing and clarifying in perfect words my thoughts and understanding of homeopathy. Helps to develop and progress the understanding. I end with a complete understanding. 01PF 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM Just realised that forgetting words has been a common theme throughout. 06PF 24 XX:XX:XX NS Have become aware that when I am speaking on the phone at work my voice doesn't sound like mine. It sounds quite mature and clear and has authority; it sounds calm. Usually I feel uncomfortable on the phone talking to strangers and trying to vocalise what I want to say, often fumbling with my words. The words come easily. 01PF 28 XX:XX:XX I've made one of those spelling mistakes that make a different word. 11PF 46 XX:XX:XX ALTERATIONS OF CONSCIOUS/UNCONSCIOUS PATTERNS Not that bothered if I drink alcohol or not. Spaciness in head has taken the \"edge\" off of anxiety which I usually quiet with a drink. There is no longer the need to self medicate. Having said this, I am not refusing to drink and I picked the largest glass of champagne on an offered tray out of habit. 02PF 2 XX:XX:XX AS Have a glass of wine but don't seem bothered about drinking it. Don't have a cigarette for ages either. Normally, at the end of the day, I'm rushing to have the things that help me to wind down. Eventually I have a drink and a cigarette but more out of habit than desire. This continues through day 17. AS 01PF 2 XX:XX:XX AS Put my lenses in wrong way round. Can't remember the last time I've done this. Normally, my response to the colour coding on the container is completely automatic by now even when I'm really tired. 01PF 8 0:07:00 NS As I'm typing I try to make an 'i' with an apostrophe for the dot and then an I. The automatic use of 'i' momentarily escaped me and I was trying to create one. I'm really confused for a moment because I don't understand why I can't make it work and then I remember to use the 'i' key. It's as if my automatic action, habit or learned behaviour is momentarily not functioning. 01PF 11 0:09:00 NS Plan to go to the bank. Something is telling me I shouldn't go but I ignore that. I pass a clothes shop I never go to because I think it might use slave labour. I go in and buy a red top, a red dress and a pink top. I then start to feel guilty and think the red is the blood of young children. It's not so unusual for me to think like this but it is unusual for me to do something despite thinking like this. I won't allow my thoughts to carry on, shutting them down so I don't have to make a decision about whether or not I should wear these clothes. Eventually, I look up the store's code of ethics to make myself feel better even though I know deep down it's all a scam anyway. I decide later that week to return the clothes. 01PF 11 0:16:30 NS My consciousness was in a machine, there is a control panel on the front of this this robot / i.e. my consciousness is in the machine, the control panel is on my chest. A hand (someone else's) is seen programming the panel. I woke up 1 minute before alarm is set to go off, as if programmed! Four days later a child is playing with a robot. It is like the robot from my dream. It unnerves me and I find it enervating. I want it out of my space. 11PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was asked to pick a colour for a password (in connection with computer access) and I instantly said green without conscious thought. 03PF 20 0:09:30 NS Fitted with a bionic limb (lower leg); it has very sophisticated wiring and circuitry that look like a computer generated image of a cross-section of anatomy. Advances in medical technology mean that it can respond to thought-for-motion nerve impulses. 11PF 36 XX:XX:XX DREAM CONNECTION Felt incredible sense of connection with everyone as soon as we started making the remedy. I sensed that this was vibrational but it was very 'fine' (as in light) and could not exactly feel it but knew it was there. As if every cell in my body is 'fizzing' in a 'fine' (as in light) way. Lasts for 2 days. 09PF 1 0:00:10 NS Everyone wants to stay together. Being all together is preferable to everyone scattering. I offer to go out to get food so we can all stay together and don't all split up and go off in various separate ways to each search for something to eat. I have a very strong sense of cohesion \"like valencies\" to adhere to the other molecules of the group. I can't pull myself away. I'm too bonded in to the group to go home. Another prover offers me to stay in her room. I'm relieved, I can stay with the group. I don't give another thought to going home to my family, which I'd intended to do. I cannot bear the group to be split up and go in separate ways. I don't offer to drive, I just go along for the ride. I'm absorbed into the mass (I would usually be more proactive and offer to drive). Part of the group leaves. I expect them to feel the intimacy too but they must be oblivious to it. I feel bewildered by this. They are staying closely huddled together. They have formed a group and we are forming another group. 11PF 1 0:00:55 NS We are all wearing socks of exactly the same colour, mauve 01PF 1 0:03:00 NS It felt important to be a part of the group. It was challenging for us all to keep focused on one task because we seemed to be all in our own worlds 12PM 1 0:01:30 NS My teacher is in the foothills of a desert landscape. He picks up a rock, a stone the size of a phone, and holds it in his hand. It has a magnetic force, and it connects him to a friend of his across the world on another continent (in the US), who is holding a similar magnetic rock. There is a magnetic resonance and they can communicate with this rock. There is also a sense of discovery and confirmation. 11PF 1 0:00:15 DREAM When people laugh it seems distant, I don't quite connect with the joke, just the echo of laughter. I feel content, but slightly lost 11PF 2 0:10:00 I feel very dependent. I'm all right if I can connect to two of the group; that means we're connected in, and I'm hoping that they're connecting to two others so we stay connected as a group. I'm not normally like this, it's like an obsession to be close to the group. We're all a bit helpless and we are just following him around. We must be heavy to carry around. We move like a dense cloud. We just stand there, clumping closely together in a bunch, not knowing what we're supposed to be doing but not doing anything else. There is no self motivation to do anything. 11PF 2 0:15:00 NS I am very aware of the people around me and have a strong desire to touch them or hug them as I feel that I need physical contact with another person. This isn't common for me, as I am usually only tactile with people close to me such as family and close friends, however, today I have the desire to touch and hug many people. 07PF 2 XX:XX:XX NS At one point a classmate got up and walked over to the white board and very quickly drew a pattern made of interlocking circles that rotated again to make a circle, like an intensified atomic symbol. It was as if there was a need to bond with others and to be heard. 12PM 2 0:21:00 NS This morning one prover bonds with me instantly. She insists on coming back into the dining room to keep me company while I have breakfast, even though she has already had her breakfast. Usually we'd take some time on our own to collect our thoughts or do some work before class in the morning, but companionship seems far more compelling today 11PF 2 0:09:00 AS Usually I am happy to talk to the family and hear everyone's news, but today it feels as if I am pretending to be interested. I feel happy to be around other people but don't feel the need to communicate. My husband holds my hand and it makes me feel secure. Although I don't feel like talking, I do feel the need to touch other people. My eldest child sits on my lap for quite a long time, which is something he hasn't done for years. We both appear to be completely at ease with this and I feel very close to him. 07PF 3 0:08:30 NS I'm in a very good mood. It's delightful to see child but I must get back to my group 11PF 3 0:08:00 Felt intense love towards the tutor, I felt linked into her positivity. I felt uplifted, energised and warmth, this was accompanied by tingling in my shoulders and spine. I wanted to validate her existence. I visualised hugging her and validating her incredible work and way of being. After visualising this, my emotions intensified and I felt that I wanted to cry. I had tears in my eyes and the intensity of the feeling stayed for some time. 12PM 3 0:14:30 NS Full of anxiety about sick daughter in Australia, and problem grandchildren and ties at the moment here. Feel as if I need to be chopped into little pieces. 09PF 4 0:12:00 OS There is a longing for it to get colder and to withdraw and internalise. I usually hate the cold weather and darker days but I'm looking forward to it this year. 12PM 4 0:15:00 NS I'm feeling really distant from my partner and the cats, as if we aren't in the same place. I feel angry towards them. 12PM 6 0:11:55 NS My relationship with my partner which has been very strained for several months has improved in the past week. We are getting on much better and communicating in a more positive way. He says that I seem lighter and happier, as if a weight has been lifted from me. It feels as if the barrier or wall that was in place between the two of us has been removed. I am able to look forward again for the first time in months. Also, my sexual desire, which had been missing for some time, has returned. We are able to laugh and joke together and my sense of humour has returned. I don't seem to be taking life as seriously any more. 07PF 6 XX:XX:XX AS I'm more detached in a way, less emotional, less reactive, less feeling stressed, more calm; but I'm more connected. I felt like I could trust everyone on the course weekend. 11PF 6 XX:XX:XX NS I felt a real connectedness with the supermarket assistant. She felt so real. I felt a channel of love open up to this woman 12PM 6 0:17:15 NS As I lay back and relax I start thinking about cancer and how blessed I am to have my immune system working so well to keep my organs still working as one unit instead of being torn apart by cancer. 02PF 7 0:12:00 Broken connection, broken appointments, difficulty getting through. My work phone call is put off from appointed hour to the next; several times during our conversation, the call is broken off and we link up again. 11PF 7 0:11:00 I am noticing confusion around issues of communication and technology. For example, my email from my home account doesn't appear to be working and several people say that they are not receiving the emails that I am sending them, despite them appearing in my sent box. It seems difficult to make arrangements. I have also noticed that my college group, who usually contact each other by email every few days, are not contacting each other at all at the moment 07PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS My partner and my friend and I walked to a pub and as we did this I found it difficult to coordinate a conversation with my friend and to walk through the crowds of people. I felt detached and cut off and I was unable to communicate effectively. 12PM 8 0:18:30 NS This morning I was thinking how wonderful it would be to go to the sea on holiday. Out of the blue an invitation comes to stay by the sea. The host is pleased to have company, she doesn't like to be there alone and she doesn't want to spend the week there on her own. She craves a connection. I feel so invited and included. 11PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS At a pub I connected with a man, we were drawn to each other. My partner didn't feel like he was part of what was going on, he was detached from this situation and I was just focussed on this guy. 12PM 8 0:22:15 NS At a gathering. Each person has been given a bowl of chocolate crunchy looking truffles covered in white chocolate sauce. I'm standing on the periphery of the group to which I do not belong. I want to ask my supervisor something but am a bit nervous of interrupting. Everyone welcomes me and offers me some of their chocolates so that, by the end, I have more than any of them. Now I'm slightly embarrassed that I have more and try to return some of the chocolates, without success. Because I now have more, I don't feel part of the group. 01PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM The dream is about lining up the position inside and outside of a house. An architect is trying to align the position from outside to inside via the walls and windows. I am inside. The dream has a mood of architecture meets connecting and aligning. 11PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM Have a need for the family to stick together. Husband and my relationship drifted over past couple of years but now it feels better, closer. I now get the sense that it will be ok. 06PF 9 0:06:40 NS I'm feeling frenetic and chaotic and not relaxed because I don't feel connected. I don't feel connected with the earth, with source, with my own core. Its as if my feet aren't planted firmly on the ground, like I'm at sea without an anchor so I'm blown by the winds and tossed by the currents and can't be still. It makes sense that my libido is increased because my 2 lower root chakras are about connection and grounding. This week I've felt too much buzzy energy in the upper chakras, particularly in the heart and throat chakras. I feel disconnected from source. 08PF 9 0:20:30 NS I feel fed up and want to be alone since yesterday. I take myself away from the family and go and have a hot bath to try and relax but once in I soon want to get out. I feel tearful but I don't cry. My feet really sore and I thought a hot bath would help but it just made them itchy. This resolved once they had cooled again. After, just lie on bed for a short time (10 minutes) before joining the family again. I didn't want to talk to anyone. 06PF 11 0:20:00 NS I am a young man in this dream. The history of baths and how they developed from being public and communal to becoming private, self-contained and isolating. Somewhere in this dream I was in public changing rooms of a swimming pool feeling confused 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM I receive a text from my eldest son who is away at university at the moment. In the text, he writes 'I feel disconnected from the world at the moment and feel as if I'm missing out on loads of things. 07PF 13 0:16:30 NS As I lay in bed my thoughts turned to a friend who had died three months before. I wondered if she could somehow hear or feel me trying to connect with her even though she was dead. I had a clear vision of her in my mind, it felt like she was right there with me. The next morning, the phone rang and when I answered it I thought it was this deceased friend. I was shocked, blood pumped and I felt dilated. I listened in absolute disbelief, I had to ask who it was twice before realising it was actually someone else. Strangely, the person on the other end of the phone was someone who worked with me for the friend who had passed away. She was calling me to arrange to send a photo of the person who died. 12PM 13 0:23:00 NS I'm in a canteen with my mother and some other female relatives and friends. We are all talking together. An old Jamaican woman comes in and sits down with her daughter. She has a slightly sour, teeth-sucking look on her face. In between that she also has a tired, soft face. Keeps changing. My mother would like to talk to her but I'm not sure she will be friendly. After an initial coldness they are chatting away. I feel really happy watching because of the easy communication. 01PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM At a festival, wandering around by myself. I didn't fit in. I felt alone and trying not to be bothered that I was on my own. I went from booth to booth pretending to look at things which I was not interested in. My belt was not on right (it was heavy and thick leather). I wanted it to sit right on my hips but I felt if it was not quite right that I looked stupid. I kept trying to adjust it as I walked around acting cool, as if I was in control of the situation when really I felt out of control. It felt to me that if and when I had it on right I would be accepted by the others, that they would understand me finally for who I was. I think I finally either took it off or completely gave up. I recognized a melody playing on the radio. It was the song \"Mad World\" which was a very sad, sombre, and lonely song, albeit beautiful. As soon as I recognized it I lit up, as if there was something I could identify with in that scene. I think it was the one thing in the environment that I felt I could connect with and therefore connect to those who also liked the song. 02PF 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM At a party I don't want to be at because of a splitting headache. Manage to be sociable but it's hard work. Stand by myself by the bonfire and feel a bit alone but better. Can hear the fire and the wind in the trees in front of me, can hear the music and the chatter behind me. I know in my mind that the music is much louder than the wind and the fire but I hear them all at the same volume, one doesn't intrude on the other. It's very calming. 01PF 16 XX:XX:XX AS Today I have heard of 3 sudden break ups, where at least one of the people involved is devastated and shocked that their partners have dumped them. They are all very depressed and feel abandoned, as if their hearts will now harden and the next relationship they have will be affected negatively. 02PF 17 XX:XX:XX NS Driving to my first appointment I have a strong need to be on my own. I don't want to talk or engage with anyone and feel quite tearful. This has resolved by the time I get to my first appointment and I continue my work day as normal. 06PF 18 0:10:20 NS I don't feel like inviting children over to play. Do we even know any? It all seems so distant. 11PF 18 0:10:00 AS Angry and irritable before going to bed. Didn't want to speak or be touched by partner, just wanted my own space. 12PM 18 0:22:15 NS Arrive at work. Although I do the usual things, talk to colleagues, make phone calls etc., I feel detached from my work colleagues as if I don't belong. This does not bother me. 06PF 18 9:45:00 NS I was incredibly pissed off with work colleagues. I felt they were not team players. They were ignoring me, unapproachable and volatile and made me react the same way: ignoring them, with an air of volatility and therefore unapproachableness. 02PF 18 XX:XX:XX IRS I watch a vacuous TV show about people living in a wealthy area. I'm struck by how the relationships have no connection and that's making them unhappy, they think they can have a relationship without it touching the sides. All that money doesn't compensate for a connection. 11PF 19 0:22:00 NS I don't feel comfortable socialising at the moment. It just feels like too much effort and I prefer to be with a small group of people or on my own. 07PF 20 0:09:00 NS I feel as though the colour green is very important to me, but I cannot explain in what way or why. I find myself speaking of it, dreaming of it and thinking of it, it seems to preoccupy my mind. I have a sense of recognition, or familiarity when I see or dream of green. 03PF 20 0:09:35 NS I could not get motivated to have the interaction with the children. I sat there and listened for them to leave. I felt like a sad, lonely miser of a person. 02PF 20 0:20:00 NS The phone call brings up thoughts of my parents and I feel quite sad and momentarily tearful. I ask out loud for them both to get in contact and tell them how much I miss them. 06PF 21 0:09:15 I was late to meet a friend. Got to station to change trains and I needed to make a connection. I worried she would not be at the meeting spot. She did not pick up her phone and I didn't want to make the journey without confirmation that she would indeed be there. I couldn't be motivated out of laziness and depression so I sat at the station instead. 02PF 21 XX:XX:XX DREAM I went to the pub I work at and sat at a table by myself, but feeling looked after and acknowledged by the others. Enough to get my work done but also feel like I was part of the gang. 02PF 21 0:21:00 NS I'd like to try some divining and had a brief experiment with it yesterday afternoon. It makes me feel that I'm reconnecting with the universe and can become a conduit again. 08PF 22 XX:XX:XX NS Generally the last 3 weeks, I've not been as sociable as usual and I've had less contact with my friends. I'm dimly aware of not being so involved with them, not so connected to them at the moment. Inclined not to bother. I have very much kept myself to myself. I haven't been out of the house much- only when I've had to. 08PF 23 XX:XX:XX NS I am with a group of 5 friends who are all going for a mammogram. We are all told that we have breast cancer and have to have a masectomy. In the dream, we compare our scars. However, the dream isn't upsetting or frightening in any way. I keep saying to everyone how unusual it is that all of us should have breast cancer. 07PF 23 XX:XX:XX DREAM At a store, an employee connected with us. He had a tattoo on his arm which said something like 'Forget the past, look to the future'. I asked him if he had a past which he wanted to let go of and he answered yes and that it was to do with a woman. The whole thing had caused him to be run over. I said 'look after yourself' and wished him luck. As we left I felt very emotional had difficulty in not weeping. 09PF 23 0:12:30 NS Woman had a tattoo on the back of her hand, but it was really old and faded. I was straining to try and read it. It was round with an elaborate floral border, like a wreath. It was a memorial to someone she lost a long time ago. It was fading, lost to the world as if it never existed. Fading into oblivion after its purpose served (its purpose was to help the person celebrate the connection that is now inevitably leaving her.) 02PF 27 XX:XX:XX DREAM I have an urgent need to telephone my daughter. She is going for a sleepover at the Science Museum in London tonight and I feel I need to make contact before she goes. Telephone Husbands mobile, but phone switched off. I very disappointed. 06PF 28 0:15:00 NS Felt a lot of love for the group I am with, as if we have finally gotten to know each other and understand each other. Feel very lucky to be part of it all. Had a campfire and I bonded with a woman that I felt particularly annoyed and averse to the first couple of sessions together. I sang in public without worry or fear of how I sounded. It felt free and nice. 02PF 28 XX:XX:XX AS I need to be on my own but everyone is disturbing me and wont seem to let me get on with my work. No one seems to accept that I need space and time for myself. 07PF 30 XX:XX:XX NS I'm looking at my partner and suddenly feel a tremendous love for him. Realise I haven't felt it in this way for a long time. 01PF 31 0:14:00 Partner says I am acting different and is worried about the status of our relationship. 02PF 14 0:24:00 Three weeks later, I have been feeling short with my partner, in need of space but at the same time crave connection. There seems to be nothing in between. 02PF 34 0:23:00 AS I had a strong desire to get out and get home. Children invited out with friend but I needed them to come home. I had a strong need for us all to be together. 06PF 36 0:15:30 NS Became very tense and frustrated trying to get son to do his homework. I refused to get in to an argument but had a strong desire to go outside for fresh air and to get away - a great need for space on my own. Within an hour he had settled down but I felt quite tense for the next couple of hours. 06PF 37 0:13:30 IOS I have pulled the drawbridge up. I feel closed off and rather irritated and grumpy. I'm going through the motions, a bit joyless and uninterested. This is very Unlike me. 11PF 38 XX:XX:XX NS I've had an awful weekend. I was in a bad mood and I'm in wrong-relation with everyone. 11PF 53 XX:XX:XX IOS I feel really connected in. Settled and focused. 11PF 57 XX:XX:XX SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT After taking remedy, sat quietly for about 10 minutes with eyes closed. Am image came to me - white shaped images, possibly human but no faces - all white, head shaped hexagonal, dancing, having fun. Fire burning on left side. Calm, peaceful image. Possibly a celebration or initiation. 06PF 1 0:00:10 NS The spaciness in my head is accompanied by a lack in self-consciousness. I feel comfortable expressing my opinion despite any conflict it may stir in the group. I feel as if it is my duty to myself to be honest with what I am feeling. I am adamant that I will get my way, with or without the group (hopefully with). I am not willing to compromise my desires. 02PF 1 0:00:40 NS A friend of mine suddenly had a very long penis that hung down below his sarong. My feeling was confusion, that this is not right - he has a normal penis how come it is suddenly two feet long or more? There may have been a sense of inadequacy. 04PM 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM Two men stand side by side not moving in the centre of a busy street, they have just swapped clothes. One is dressed in brown and green normal store, he looks quite country. The other is dressed head to toe in White rags. They look like they have been wrapped around him. Looking back now he looked a little like a mummy but I did not feel that in the dream, they were just White rags. The White one also had round glasses on, they were not quite straight as he had put them on quickly when he borrowed them from the other person. Both of them look very similar, where they the same person, or twins? The feeling in the dream together, similar, but different. 05PM 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM Looked at reflection in bathroom and noticed fine, dark facial hair around the circumference of my mouth. I felt humoured by this. 02PF 2 0:18:45 NS When I stood in front of her she looked old, haggard and really unlike I remembered her. She used to be individualistic and interesting to look at. When I knew her she was a dark/Gothic type who spent lots of time putting on eccentric make up and shocking clothes. She had let herself go and looked aged, tired and dull. I was really surprised at this 12PM 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM Several gay issues have been mentioned. I muse on gender. Male is male. A gay man is not more female than any other male. And a gay man is not necessarily more \"in touch with his feminine side\" 11PF 3 0:16:00 Everyone looks beautiful to me. Even sporty people seem more beautiful than I've ever noticed. [normally, sporty = not beautiful.] Tired worn out people look beautiful too, in their essence. I notice highlights in some people's hair as if they've made the effort to lift themselves above drudgery. 11PF 4 XX:XX:XX AS I'm preoccupied with whether to get my hair dyed. I've never had my hair dyed. My hair is its natural colour. It looks scruffy to me, I'd like to spruce up. 11PF 5 XX:XX:XX NS There were a number animal/beings sitting in lined formation on a gated piece of land, like a large holding pen on a farm. They seemed fused between a human and an animal. They all had on a large black cape with a large black rimmed hat that covered their faces on an angle, but you could see one eye. They looked a bit like the Phantom out of Phantom of the Opera. There was uniformity to all of them. I looked closer and I saw that this was actually a slug like animal with a shell on its back in the shape of a giant mushroom. They began dancing around in formation to a waltz. The cape and hat were actually skin and on top of this there were moulting feathers. They were black down feathers and this was a moulting process in the development stage of the animals' life. I felt surprised, things just seemed to become stranger and more revealing as I observed. Everything felt dark, not in a sinister way, as if there was some kind of gravity to what I was seeing. I felt like I was watching and learning things that I had never seen before. 12PM 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM There was a prostitute sitting on a seat at a desk on a street corner. A transvestite walked past the prostitute towards me. The fact that this person was a man in woman's cloths with make up and a wig was obvious to me. As he/she passed me I tried to get the attention of the prostitute and as I did this I looked at the transvestite and then back at the prostitute as if to say, you and I both know that is a man, not a woman. The strange thing was that the prostitute also looked like a transvestite. 12PM 12 XX:XX:XX DREAM Vacation with my daughter and her friends and we're having a nice time. All females. I go to the bathroom and I look in the mirror. I look really young but I also look like I've had my lips filled surgically to plump them up. I also look like a man in drag as my hair is in ringlets and my femininity looks very contrived. Basically, mutton dressed as lamb. I'm slightly uncomfortable about this because I can't quite recognise myself and I'm trying too hard to fit in. 01PF 15 XX:XX:XX DREAM Notice that I haven't put my hair up for three days. Always prefer to have my hair off my face and neck. But now it doesn't bother me and I quite like the feel of the hair round my neck. I try putting it up and put it back down again. I think I look Ok with it down; usually I think I look better with it up. 01PF 18 0:11:00 I'm in the bathroom. I look in the mirror and I start transforming into a younger person as if in stages. I smile and watch my smile transform into a sexual leer, young and confident. It's grotesque but I like the fact I'm looking younger. My body starts to look younger and fitter and more sexual. I'm looking at my body in the mirror, at its profile. The buttock and leg is of human flesh but its shape is accentuated and seems more animal in form. I'm admiring it and want young men to admire it too. I feel a bit repulsed but narcissistic too. 01PF 19 XX:XX:XX DREAM I tried on a pair of my partners shoes and decided that they looked great, so I wore them. 12PM 23 XX:XX:XX DREAM Getting dressed I would normally put on jeans and a jumper but today I have the desire to dress up so wear a dress. I feel somewhat over dressed for the day but it doesn't matter. 06PF 24 0:10:00 AS I receive a phone call which is very confusing as I can't understand what they are talking about. After much confusion, it turns out that they were trying to contact another person with the same name as me. For a while, I felt as though I was going mad. 07PF 26 0:12:00 RNS We meet his ex who looks older, very made up and stiff. Her dyed hair is curled like an old lady's though she isn't that old and she's dressed in rather old fashioned clothes. I can't remember her name as I go to introduce her even though I remembered it just moments ago. She is insulted and starts criticising me. I apologise. As I try to explain how I got it so wrong I get frustrated with myself and, because I cannot appease her, I get angry. I start shouting at her and walk away. 01PF 28 XX:XX:XX Dream Am by the river. Looking down on a stag party. The groom is being dressed up by a lady who has come to facilitate their preparation. He is dressing up in some garish costume, bit like a fancy lady or prostitute. See some dried hydrangeas and I associate them with old ladies gardens, very artificial and take some for myself and a friend. The same lady says I can't have them I have to pay for them. I feel a bit mortified and embarrassed. 01PF 29 XX:XX:XX DREAM On the train I sat in front, and to the side, of a couple. I initially thought they were a young man and woman. I was caught in their private moment as he talked to her with a strange flat voice which was stilted as though he struggled with words. After a while I realised that the man was a woman which intrigued me even more. I tapped her on the back and she turned around. Her features were far stronger and coarser than the reflection. As they walked away they both had strong legs walking with a man's gait. I wondered if they were dancers. 01PF 30 0:21:00 I saw a lady dressed up to go somewhere. She really stood out with an upright posture and sense of direction. She was quite plain and old; her features were quite coarse which seemed in contrast to her beautifully elegant attire. 01PF 30 0:09:30 Dream about 2 transvestites who had sex changes. The decision and operation took just 3 hours and what amazed me was the lack of pain afterwards. They both got up from the operation table, got dressed and went shopping. I cannot recall how I was involved although it looked liked I was observing it all through a screen, like a TV but it was live and very real. 06PF 32 XX:XX:XX DREAM Man lying on his back, elevated on some earth-type mound, and keeps trying to have a baby. His belly is like a mound with a lid on. I keep wondering why he's trying and then realise he is homosexual and then it seems to be a possibility. 01PF 33 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dreaming about cows. I think I had a cow costume on and recall walking across a muddy field with other people. 06PF 37 XX:XX:XX DREAM LEFT OUT/REJECTED I felt slightly abandoned by the group. They disappeared off to get food and I couldn't find the others. When I did I felt a little solidarity as they thought it was odd too. Felt a little put-out, like the group wanted to mark their independence. 04PM 1 XX:XX:XX NS It's very silent. This is really unusual and we feel very strange. We notice that the group have gone out without including us. I think it's a bit rude and feel snubbed. I feel lonely. 01PF 1 0:01:00 NS I'm desperate to have a bath, I have a compelling need to wash. I feel as if I'm sweating (axilla) and I feel a bit agitated about washing, but I'm worried I'd be left behind, they'd go without me. I have to rationalise it in order to override this urge to wash and to convince myself not to go and have a bath now. This is not the right time. We're all going out now, having finally reached a decision. 11PF 1 0:01:40 After leaving I experience a strong sense of wanting to stay with the rest of the group. It feels as if we should all stay together and by going home I am splintering the group. I feel as if I am letting the others down by going home. I feel a sense of loss and also that I am missing out in some way. When I get home, I keep thinking about the rest of the group and what they will be doing. I even consider going back to join them or ringing them and asking them all to come back to my house for the evening. 07PF 1 0:02:00 NS Group deciding what to do for evening - whether to go out and eat or get something and bring it back. I was indifferent just so long as I went with them. Went outside to phone home but made sure I was by the door so could see if and when rest of group leaving - didn't want to be left behind. 06PF 1 0:19:45 NS Felt uneasy, became preoccupied about being rejected by the group. Was being really hard on myself, really heavy. Took me ages to pull myself together, loathed myself. Felt that I had committed some sort of a crime. 12PM 1 0:00:35 There is a festival and everyone is leaving. I'm one of the organisers but I don't feel particularly in control and I'm not really enjoying myself. As the queue of cars leaves I stop each one and they give me something but I don't know if it's music or food. It's something I need them to give me. I feel like the one left behind. They're all happy-go-lucky and I am not. 01PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream that I was rushing around in my bedroom trying to organize myself to go out. Two people I knew had said we could all go to the town and they had said they would wait downstairs for me. They were not in a hurry, but I was extremely worried that the couple would go without me. The anxiety was intense and it made me take longer as I was panicky, could not think straight and therefore could not organize myself or decide what to wear. 03PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM With father and sister. Woke and noticed they were getting ready to go somewhere without me. I felt jealous and excluded because they hadn't woken and invited me along. 02PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am worried that the group will go outside without me, and I will not be able to find them. When I return they are still there, I am surprised and relieved. I want us to stay together and not get split up as I feel that we need to stay together as a group. The teacher suggests that we go for a walk either alone or as a group, and we immediately reply that we want to go as a group. I am glad as I feel that we are safer together and can protect each other, although I am not aware what we need protecting from. The group does divide up, but I am still with two other people which reassures me.. 07PF 2 0:11:00 NS There were new people in the room that I didn't know. This made me feel uncomfortable. I felt self conscious, I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I couldn't find any natural flow in terms of my interaction with the others. Just thinking about trying to interact caused blood to rush. I felt intense, light headed and ungrounded, as if I was lifting up outside of my body. Felt as thought I would be rejected by everyone for being foolish. I was mortified by the experience. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me. The more I tried to just fit in the more I felt that everyone could see straight though me. It was as though everyone knew exactly how I was feeling. The more aware I was of individuals being aware of me the more I wished that I could just blend in. 12PM 2 0:10:15 NS I felt excluded when two students seemed detached and distant from me. Their conversation sounded exclusive and I felt they weren't really interested in what I had to say. I decided that I wanted to be with other people and offered to share my bottle of wine with another person. Even though I was completely exhausted I felt that it was more important to bond with others in the group and to be accepted. 12PM 2 0:18:30 NS Dream that a group of people I know are sitting talking to someone else that I do not know. We are in upstairs flats with roof terraces/patios that are side by side, it is night time and there is a view of the the sea. My friends are sitting out on the patio next door but on the one next to mine. I start to think that my friends and not being considerate of me. Next I meet one of them alone in the corridor outside the flats and I try to speak to him, but he clearly does not want to speak to me, and tries to ignore my attempts to discuss my feelings about the group being inconsiderate of me and how I feel left out. I did not manage to express myself to him as he would not listen. 03PF 5 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm really worried that I will be rejected and that others will see me in a negative way. I have written an email to these two people to apologise for my actions 12PM 5 0:19:10 NS There was a woman in a wheelchair with some friends outside a pub having a drink on the footpath. I felt empathy for the woman who sat there and looked up to her friends as they all drank. She had to speak loudly to get their attention and seemed dwarfed by the throngs of people on the footpath around her. 12PM 8 0:18:00 NS I am sitting outside with another and we are working together. I wander off and end up talking to someone else and complete the assignment on my own. I wander back to my partner and she is surrounded by loads of people helping her do the assignment. I realise I must have abandoned her and feel ashamed because that can't look very good to the group. 01PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM One of the lecturers has just died and he's very popular so everyone holds a party to celebrate him. I am not included. I continue working and feel very excluded. 01PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was at my table and quite withdrawn in my own world. I don't know if I was drunk or just tired but I felt very heavy. Several famous actors from a TV show called FRIENDS were at an adjacent table and I knew that if they were still there that it was ok for me to still be there too. But then they left and I knew it was time to go. I saw one of them running for the tube after the others, they had left without him. I felt sorry for them being so recognizable and worried because he was now alone. I hoped he would find them. 02PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I wake from a dream in which my sons and I are being chased down a long hill by a very large black poodle. I don't remember much about the dream except that I am in the front and manage to run fast enough to get away from the dog, but my children are lagging behind and I can't decide whether to wait for them or to keep on running. 07PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM Go to see my partner who has spent the evening with all our friends. They've all had a wild time. They're all a bit tipsy, I'm completely sober. Feel like I've missed out but don't feel connected anymore. 01PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM Partner and I are discussing a train journey I am going to take. I say that I like travelling on trains especially if I am alone on the train. I say that I can be alone if I am moving, like on a train or walking, but I don't like being alone and static. This came out of the conversation but on reflection I don't know how true that is for me as a finite statement. 01PF 16 XX:XX:XX NS There's not much sense of humour or being able to see the funny side in this Rx. I've been aware of my family laughing at me and not being able to join in and feeling quite stern about their laughter. 08PF 20 XX:XX:XX Husband is away. I can't keep my eyes open, can't sleep, and am really worried. It is unusual for me to worry about him being away. I wonder if something has happened to him but more intense is a forlorn, forsaken feeling- he hasn't thought about me or bothered to let me know he got there safely. He's forgotten me, fallen out of love with me. I leave a few messages trying not to sound like the mad, hysterical, jealous woman I've suddenly become! I'm worried, anxious, restless, jittery. 08PF 22 0:24:00 NS She was talking to me but she didn't sound sincere, I could tell that underneath her voice she was actually being quite spiteful but she was covering it up with niceness. I was really affected by the way she made me feel. I felt rejected, out in the cold, it was as if she had moved on and left me behind. Later I went to see a musical about a young girl rejected by her family and had her inheritance stolen. My aunt also holds onto the inheritance of my grandparents. 12PM 27 00:23:00. I walked into the room with the rest of the provers. There was one seat remaining which meant that I had to interrupt the conversation between two people. I felt uncomfortable because the one of them seemed a bit irritated. I felt shabby, sweaty and smelly as I hadn't given myself enough time in the morning to find some clean clothes. She said, 'I see you have come prepared with make-up and hair done'. It was only after a moment that I realised how that odd comment was meant as a criticism. I became aware that I was sitting in a room full of women who felt very different to me with their make-up and nice, clean clothes. I felt shabby, ineffectual and wondered what I had to contribute. 01PF 30 0:14:30 NS Everyone else seems to be confident and knows their place and I am floundering on the side trying to fit in with the group. I hate this place, it make me feel raw, displaced and angry. I feel unwelcomed, alienated and uncertain. Every one seemed to be engaged in conversation and they were laughing and being themselves while I was sitting there on the edge feeling completely peripheral. 12PM 30 0:22:15 NS All day I have a feeling of not belonging in the group as if I am on the outside, the periphery. I have a longing to get home. 06PF 31 XX:XX:XX NS I have sent a friend several texts recently but have heard nothing back from her, though I know she has contacted other people. I worry that I may have offended her in some way. I feel rejected and slightly resentful. 07PF 33 0:11:00 NS DETACHED I felt detached, cut off and out of it, a bit like I was floating. Felt isolated as if I wasn't part of what is going in front of me though I was still able to interact with what was going on. It is like there is something between you and what was going on. I felt mellow. I felt like a complete universe was contained within me and that everything external to me was cut off, as though a bubble surrounded me. 12PM 1 0:00:30 NS I feel like I am in a bubble, with the music filling my headspace, drifting in and out of conversations. It's like being high. It's like being in a nightclub where everyone is high on ecstasy and feeling connected, and I'm tuning in to the altered state of consciousness even though I'm not on drugs, I'm just high on the music. 11PF 1 XX:XX:XX Our class went into the year 4 class uninvited. I was the first to walk in and felt very unaffected when the teacher responded by asking us to leave. I would normally have felt I was disrupting and been embarrassed that we weren't welcomed but I didn't care what anyone thought which is pretty unusual for me. 02PF 2 0:17:15 CS I am sitting in class listening to the lecturer but at the same time, I have a feeling of being detached, as though I am watching myself from the outside. It feels as if time has stood still and I am completely in the moment and the past and future do not exist. 07PF 2 0:11:45 RNS Felt very unreal shopping in my local supermarket. It seemed strange and dream-like as there were people I knew from college there with me. Everything felt very out of place. 03PF 2 0:19:00 IOS Feeling really detached. I couldn't really define or understand the nature of the detachment. I feel apathetic to understanding this feeling, I couldn't be bothered with defining it yet it was at the centre of everything. 12PM 2 0:17:00 NS Partner complains that he has been looking after child all weekend while I was away. This is nonsense. I smile beatifically and float out of the room. I remove myself from his orbit. Usually I'd argue. 11PF 3 XX:XX:XX NS Felt as though my awareness was altered, as though my consciousness was bigger and covered a wide area outside of myself, but at the same time very present to everything. 03PF 3 0:10:00 NS Detachment is even more pronounced. I feel that I'm not part of what is actually happening around me. I can see, hear, listen and interact but at the same time there is a distance with between me and what I'm interacting with in. There is a comfort in this as though it gives me license to be a bit sloppy and uncaring about what I say and do. It's as though whatever is going on isn't real in anyway and that any consequences will therefore be inconsequential. I feel like I'm watching what is going on but I'm not part of it. 12PM 3 0:13:45 NS I feel intense but at the same time detached, as if in a bubble. The thing was that I was detached and didn't really care if I had offended anyone. 12PM 3 0:11:00 NS I meet a stressed friend in the street, and we chat for a bit. Normally I find myself drawn in to her anxiety, I feel it escalate in my own stress level. But today I don't feel any stress in myself. I am peaceful. I feel detached and loving. I don't attempt to help her as I usually would. I stay out of it. 11PF 4 0:10:30 NS I'm feeling Zen. Unattached to outcomes that I can't control. Friend is trying to persuade me to take control and steer it, but I don't get drawn into that orbit. It is my life to decide. 11PF 4 0:12:00 NS I feel spaced out, stoned. I last felt like this after smoking something in 1988 in Australia and I can now relate that I have never been the same since. 06PF 4 0:07:45 NS I felt detached from the outside environment, as if bubbled away. I was enclosed by a glass, air-conditioned structure that cut you off from what was really going outside. 12PM 5 XX:XX:XX DREAM My ex-husband phones me to tell me that he has been made redundant and doesn't know how much longer he will be able to pay me my usual financial support for the children. He has been under threat of redundancy for several months and I have been very worried about this situation happening. However, when he tells me what has happened, I feel calm and detached. I able to reassure him and also to make some practical suggestions as to what to do next. I am surprised that my reaction is calm and measured. I feel as if I am watching myself reacting and that I am present but detached from the situation. 07PF 5 0:18:30 NS I feel detached from everything that is going on around me. My connection to things is vague and tuned out, it was as if I was just going through the motions to get what I need and to return to home. 12PM 5 0:17:15 NS Part of me in the situation and part of me detached observer. 08PF 6 XX:XX:XX I don't feel any emotional reaction to the news of my friend's aneurysm. This seems quite cold. My familiar response would worry about this friend's illness, and wonder if there was anything I could do to help? I would feel drawn in to the problem. But I feel detached from it. My lack of reaction is definitely a proving symptom; and I like the emotional distance it gives me. I don't have my usual concern or empathy. I feel quite removed from it. I know I should send words of support. Eventually I send a message but I have to really think hard what to say, it doesn't come spontaneously. 11PF 6 0:22:00 NS Feel like I am in a bubble or cocoon which is very safe. The car has become the bubble. Get to work and stay in car. Enjoying being in this bubble and don't want to lose this calm, peaceful experience. I feel as if I should be scared but I'm not - this is natural. This feeling stayed with me for most of the day. 06PF 6 0:09:30 NS I am responding to situations differently, without energy depletion going into being stressed, or in a rush, and without feeling so triggered by things, without reacting with indignation, irritation, hurt, fear, without anxiety, worry, concern, embarrassment, shyness or self consciousness of what someone thinks of me, without overconfident facade or under confidence, without feeling so emotionally engaged in situations (whether these situations are mine or other people's), without gossip, or indignation, with less procrastination than is habitual for me. I'm more removed from situations but I'm not being heartless. I'm smiling beatifically and placing my energy with the best intention for the best outcome, but I don't feel I have to leap in and rescue things as much as usual, to define who I am 11PF 7 XX:XX:XX AS Detachment. This remedy substance we are proving has altered my emotional state from heightened reactivity to very cool removal and distance from reacting. I'm beginning to find this new state 'normal'; perhaps I won't even notice it in a few days, it's best to note it now. 11PF 7 XX:XX:XX NS Someone phones me in their habitual state stressed, irritable, impatient, bristling with frustration. I'd normally feel worse afterwards and wish they hadn't called, then feel upset about it for ages. Today it doesn't affect me. I remove myself from it, let it go, and go straight back to what I was doing. 11PF 7 0:14:00 NS My partner has also commented several times this week that he feels more 'spacey' and 'light headed' than usual. He says he feels more distracted and is not finding it easy to concentrate. I also notice that he seems to be a lot more cheerful and playful and much less irritable and depressed than he has been during recent months. When I ask him how he is feeling, he says that he has much more energy this week and that he is now getting up and looking forward to starting the day. He says that 'lying in bed feels like he is wasting his time'. 07PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS On the train and feeling really spacey. It's as if I'm detached from what is going on around me. I feel clouded in my mind and quite vague. It's like being under the influence of a drug that has altered my awareness and function. I feel better for staring, sitting and doing nothing. 12PM 8 0:17:50 NS Friend phones to nudge me to send a card to friend or visit her in hospital. I might not have thought of it. I don't really care, not really. I feel unbelievably detached. The detachment feels \"ordinary\" to me. I don't say I won't go and visit, but ask \"What ward?\" even though I know I'm not going anywhere near the place. 11PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS I decide not to travel on the same train another friend has booked, I don't think it leaves enough time to get to the wedding on time. She is habitually impatient and I don't want to pick up on this stress! I travel on an earlier train so I can go at my own pace. She's offended that I travelled separately, but I don't really mind. I feel relief and detachment, in a friendly way. We can travel back home together, late at night, when it matters to keep each other company. 11PF 9 0:10:00 Go to a beautiful wedding. But neither the ceremony, the readings, or the speeches bring a tear to the eye. This proving remedy is without sentimentality. 11PF 9 XX:XX:XX NS The sensation of being detached from everything is pronounced. I don't feel present in my body. I'm going through the motions of doing things but I'm not really part of what is happening. It feels like there is a lag between the any action and of my mind being connected to it, as though my mind and body are separate and there is a slight time difference in the mind catching on that I'm doing something. 12PM 9 0:08:40 NS I'm in that floaty spacious space. I don't know what day it is, let alone what date! We are very relaxed. Child has a thing about time, he is trying to tell the time. 11PF 13 XX:XX:XX Conscious that internal chatter of negative thoughts has returned. This is in contrast to the dropping off of thoughts, which acts to reduce this internal chatter, something I have been aware of since proving started. 01PF 15 XX:XX:XX AS A man was found guilty today of murdering a girl whose body he dumped in the woods. I was so affected by that case last Christmas. It hardly affects me today. The one lingering effect on me now is the question of where his fantasy turned to action. That is more bothersome for me now. 11PF 15 XX:XX:XX Watching movies on my computer that kids have made on their mobile phones. They all have to do with extreme bicycle acrobats and skateboarding. They are all of accidents and falling, but surprisingly not gruesome or painful. One kid becomes pinned to a chain link fence and his body is upside down in the basket of his bike. I curiously watch to see how he undoes himself from this tricky position. He manoeuvres his way back to right side up. I am surprised by my lack of worry for him. 02PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM Aware that I'm getting up much later than usual, not hurried by things I need to do or motivated by the idea of having a cigarette with my coffee. I lie in bed and, instead of being driven out of bed by morbid thoughts or things to do, I lie there completely relaxed with my mind blank. In the back of my mind is the knowledge that I should get up but it doesn't motivate me to do so. I'm aware of a slight guilt every now and then that I'm being ineffectual but even that doesn't motivate me to get up. 01PF 17 XX:XX:XX AS Feel completely ok, cannot believe that I have this problem of a recently diagnosed breast cancer. 09PF 20 0:20:50 With my mother. I would normally probe and try to understand her mood and help her through it with positive suggestions. I almost care about how she is feeling but the care doesn't persist so I don't act on it. I let her dwell on her mood, I don't get pissed off with her but I don't feel any concern either. I just don't take it on. I decide later that I may talk to her about it but the motivation to do so disappears. 01PF 21 XX:XX:XX AS Thought about how I've been in the proving- the word nonchalant comes to mind. Also a sense that I'd been merely going through the motions. 08PF 21 XX:XX:XX Driving my mother home. Start ranting about my daughter's father and how he is affecting my daughter.. Manage to stop myself because I suddenly can't be bothered to get angry. I don't want the anger and I don't have the energy or compulsion for it. Usually I would escalate and take it to a point of unbearability, knowing I was doing it but unable to stop myself. 01PF 22 0:14:00 AS Feel detached and feel I have plenty of time. The house is a mess but that doesn't make me annoyed. Day 26: I still have this sensation of having plenty of time although logically I know this is not true. 06PF 23 0:14:00 NS Since starting this proving I have not worried about money or checked balances. Normally I would be quite vigilant and ensure we stay within our budget. I know that I need to sort it out but it still isn't a priority. 06PF 24 XX:XX:XX AS I am late but still I feel in no hurry to go. I enjoy the drive. I don't rush and enjoy the sunshine. I am aware that I am very conscious of the sky. 06PF 29 0:07:30 NS My thoughts were elsewhere. I am a bit removed, although I feel proper quality warmth and affection for him. 11PF 34 XX:XX:XX NS I am not irritable today. I am calm, but distant. I reply to lots of texts but I don't call back and cling 11PF 34 XX:XX:XX I have that pleasant detached helpfulness and love again, without the reactivity. 11PF 50 XX:XX:XX DETACHED FROM RESPONSIBILITY No one seemed capable of being able to compromise or say exactly what they wanted, in case they went against another group member wishes. Even if you did say what you wanted to do it inevitably went against what another person wanted to do. I was getting annoyed that things seemed to be going around in circles, but I didn't let anyone know this. Eventually, I was detached from being bothered about how long it took to do anything. I was quite willing to leave the worry up to someone else for once. 12PM 1 0:01:30 NS The indecision takes forever; it's a complicated decision to make, everyone seems indecisive, no one takes a leadership role. The only impetus is from the one person who wants to eat, who is getting agitated. 11PF 1 XX:XX:XX NS My son starts talking to me about some of his anxieties and worries. I would normally try to comfort and reassure him. However, on this occasion I sit back and listen and don't say very much at all. It feels as if I am watching myself talking to him. I feel calm and relaxed and not emotionally involved which is not my usual reaction. I usually find it very difficult not to feel emotionally upset myself, although I try not to show it as that makes him worse. He asks for my help to make a decision, but I calmly and firmly tell him that I cannot do that and that it is his decision not mine. 07PF 3 0:08:30 NS I don't offer a lift to someone who is heading back to the city I'm driving to. I'm not connected to them. I leave them to it to them to sort out their own plans. Usually I'd feel obliged to help and I'd go out of my way to give them a lift. 11PF 3 0:17:00 NS I am feeling much calmer and more clear headed today. I feel more able to deal with the problems that I have been faced with over the past few weeks. I feel more detached from them, as if I am an observer, and less emotionally attached. I am able to sit back and listen and observe, without feeling that I am responsible for solving them and making everything right. 07PF 4 0:13:50 NS I make breakfast for everyone but no one comes to the table. I don't make packed lunch for them. I feel no responsibility for them, they can sort it out for themselves. I float out of the door to take child to school. We're late but I don't get stressed. Normally I'd be shouting \"quick-quick, we're late!\" by now, even if I tried not to get stressed. We waft in only seconds late. 11PF 4 0:08:00 NS I meet a stressed friend in the street, and we chat for a bit. Normally I find myself drawn in to her anxiety, I feel it escalate in my own stress level. But today I don't feel any stress in myself. I am peaceful. I feel detached and loving. I don't attempt to help her as I usually would. I stay out of it. 11PF 4 0:10:30 NS I'm feeling Zen. Unattached to outcomes that I can't control. Friend is trying to persuade me to take control and steer it, but I don't get drawn into that orbit. It is my life to decide 11PF 4 0:12:00 NS Feel stoned/spacy with a dull frontal headache accompanied by a very laid back and content feeling. I feel I am on an exciting adventure (life in general) and that all is well in the world. I think about my colleague at school became extremely irritable and did not hide it once the proving began. His mood reflects a discomfort I normally have. I now feel neutral in the eyes of others. I normally feel overcautious and oversensitive of others feelings and apologize for any negative shift I may have caused. I do not feel I impact people and don't feel so personally responsible as I normally do. 02PF 5 0:13:00 AS Usually I'd be concerned about who is standing on the train and give up my seat for anyone. Today I take no notice of anyone else. Normally I'd think that was selfish, today I think it would be interfering to step in. 11PF 9 XX:XX:XX NS I am realising that all my efforts have very little effect. Am considering letting go of things I cannot change, at least for a little while. 09PF 11 0:16:00 NS Husband not feeling well so has gone to bed. He was annoyed when we get home with friends that he expects everyone to be quiet. I am not feeling very sympathetic towards him which I would be normally. 06PF 12 0:16:00 AS Not getting involved feels more normal to me. An old lady was watching us playing on the beach yesterday. She looked wistful. In my normal state of mind, I'd have felt a pang about the issues of out-of-town owners of second homes turning locals into a servant class. Instead of thinking about second homers stealing homes from locals, I said \"isn't it lovely\" about the house and skipped up the garden path with the kids to this place of privilege. I'd buy it without a second glance if it was on the market if I had the asking price in my piggy bank. 11PF 13 XX:XX:XX Child is so tired he storms out of the room when his father gets heavy with him over eating his dinner. I don't intervene. Usually I would intervene. I would feel aggrieved on child's behalf, being protective I would say something disapproving and it would lead to an argument. I don't start an argument, and I don't run out after child. I don't get involved. I stay seated. Child returns to the table. 11PF 13 0:19:00 The woman shouts at her children non-stop and criticises the girl constantly. I give up trying to be a human shield. I retreat, I go to my room. I feel unable to change it. It's uncomfortable to observe it, but I don't feel as upset as usual. I have to leave be. 11PF 15 0:09:00 Felt negative, irritable and unenthusiastic about everyday life. Especially irritated by my husband, as I felt resentful towards him for needing a lot of emotional support and encouragement. 03PF 26 07.30 IOS Semi-awake, a significant realisation that I am not responsible for any of my family and whether or not they use homeopathy. I cannot save them, they have to do it their own way. It's a relief and I feel at peace. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX NS I feel very irritated with my partner when I get home. He offers to help me with different things but needs me to tell him what I want him to do. I wish that he would take charge and make the decisions for a change. I am fed up with having to take all the responsibility in the house. It is easier if I am on my own, then no-one can make any demands on me. I feel overwhelmed with everything. I am tired of looking after everyone else and need to be selfish for a while. 07PF 29 0:18:30 RNS DETACHED FROM PANIC Driving. Get this image and sense that along the way I am going to come across a decapitated body. Further down road I will find the head inside a motorbike helmet. Not alarmed by this, it's as if this is a normal everyday occurrence. 06PF 1 0:07:30 NS Sleep in tent alone. The thought would normally terrify me but I feel challenged and rise to it. I remain in a state between awake and asleep. I can imagine it as a thin line between the two. I hear footsteps in the grass and I acknowledge fear but don't physically feel it. Normally I am jumpy, heart pounding when I hear a noise. This time I hear repeated gun shots and then a car travelling at high speed and I acknowledge that it could be a murder but I just listen without fear. I acknowledge that it's exciting because it's a murder but I don't feel the excitement. I could almost say I'm numb but I'm not because my senses are alive. I don't react in my usual way. 01PF 1 XX:XX:XX CS For a long time, there was an owl calling. I thought about my friend who's sleeping outside in her tent and is afraid of the dark. Although I think of her there's not the usual empathy or anxiety for her I might feel. 08PF 1 XX:XX:XX NS Come home to hear that my father has fallen and hit his head. Feel very serious and calm whereas normally I would be panicking and very upset. As well as feeling calm I feel nothing, not even concern. I know there is concern and worry but it's not touching me. I don't even feel bad about not feeling it. 01PF 3 21:30:00 AS I say to myself that this remedy must be an anaesthetic or adrenalin. With this general feeling comes a lightness, spaciness. Small noises make me start, not physically so much as my senses. It's a general feeling of the senses being really alert but me not responding physically, or if there is a response, as in the panic feeling, the return to calm is immediate. It's as if everything I am doing or thinking is cut off before its resolution. 01PF 4 XX:XX:XX AS Did not feel nervous as a passenger with my daughter driving the car, but quite relaxed. Felt as though I was not quite in my body. (My daughter has only just passed her driving test and is still in her teens.) 03PF 5 0:14:15 CS Normally I would get offended and angry but instead I very calmly give him a bit of a smile and he apologises. I was aware that this reaction was easier on myself than the normal one of feeling offended and angry. 01PF 5 XX:XX:XX AS Feel that life is short but I feel very calm and enjoy the sensation despite the fact I am aware I will die soon. This isn't scary, it feels very normal (only feels normal normal since start of proving). It's the norm and means a new beginning. 06PF 6 00:09:00 NS LOSS OF CONTROL, MENTAL/EMOTIONAL Someone asks me about my evening. I begin to tell her that I was unwell and become very tearful which surprises me as I wasn't aware that I felt upset. Someone else asks about me I burst into tears again. I am unable to control my emotions. People try to comfort me but I feel uncomfortable. I just want to be left alone and to sit in the corner so that no-one can see me crying. I don't seem able to talk without crying. This is unusual for me as I try to control my emotions in public. I feel embarrassed and wish that I was invisible. I am worried that they will judge me. 07PF 02 10.30 NS Had piece of news about daughter which elicited from me a very emotional reaction. Felt extremely anxious, threatened, raised voice and pounding heart. 09PF 5 0:18:00 NS I start to feel invincible while driving, like I am an artist at driving, as though I am in harmony with the vehicle, perfectly in control without even having to think about it. 04PM 6 XX:XX:XX NS I felt vulnerable about who I was and what I did, as if I was going to be attacked and ridiculed. 12PM 8 0:22:15 NS Watching film about bomb disposal unit in Iraq. I become incensed at the film and see it as yet another propaganda film. I get giddy and feel a bit like I'm losing control of my rational thinking. It feels like a nervous buzzing in my head. I want to fly into a rage about this. 01PF 9 0:22:00 IOS Asked my 17 year old son if he'd noticed any difference in me. He said that I'd gone from extremes of chilled out to 'oh my god its a disaster'. He said that I have a slight tendency to this anyway but that it had been much more extreme than usual. 08PF 9 XX:XX:XX IOS Inside my body doesn't feel relaxed, there's a vibrational, buzzy, restless energy. Feel it as fluttery and restless. The general feeling has reminded me of my mum. She has a nervous, neurotic restless energy- but is also prone to depression. She'll read about something that's happened to someone else in the paper and then worry that it might happen to her or 1 of us- a definite sense that something bad might happen and that the world is a chaotic and not safe place. The last week I've been feeling heavy and 'down' but not relaxed; not in the moment. I'm wondering also now, how much the mood swings of earlier in the week were associated with having to go out and do things that have made me feel stressed and anxious. The second half of the week I have hardly been out of the house. I feel safe in my house and in my valley. I'm happy to just be at home with my family and particularly with my husband. I feel strongly connected to him but I wonder if there's a bit of neediness to it too. He'll look after me and protect me. Day 10, xxx I've no anxiety about being out- feel as normal. (with hindsight I was out with the whole family- such outings were fine- it was only when I was out on my own or with just 1 or 2 kids I felt very anxious) 08PF 9 XX:XX:XX NS I am reading an article about cancer in the newspaper, when I suddenly feel very panicky and anxious. My chest feels tight and I feel very fearful. I start to think about dying and what happens when you die. This makes me feel even more panicky and I feel as if I can't take in enough air to breathe normally. I am worried that I have a serious illness that has not yet been diagnosed. I also feel nauseous. 07PF 10 0:19:00 NS Unable to concentrate on any mental work. Sitting around in an anxious, agitated, unmotivated and exhausted state. I'm uncertain of how to move forward. Part of me just wants to sit, but sitting around feels unbearable. I'm on an edge just waiting for myself to either implode or explode. This is an incredibly powerful feeling, if the energy implodes I feel I might lose my reason, like I will go off the rails and lose track of my sanity. Had to get up and go for a walk as I was starting to feel suffocated and began to panic. Whilst walking had to take lots of deep breathes and concentrate on not feeling out of control in my mind. Felt as though I was losing my grip, overwhelmed. There is a weight and pressure from the middle of my back extending to the middle of my head behind my eyes. I feel emotionally overwhelmed, like I'm going to cry any minute, it's intense and I can't put my finger on what it is. It's like being on a roller coaster and wanting to get off. Things could get out of control and I want it to stop, but I can't because the ride has started and it must run its course. 12PM 13 0:14:00 NS I fell asleep and awoke not too long after with my left arm numb. Associated with this pain is a pain in my elbow where the ulnar nerve passes (funny bone). It was as if my neck had pinched my nerve and the whole of my left arm was numb. I was frightened. But I did not want to get up as it was cold in the room and I was too tired to move. I began to feel as if I was going mad. The sensation was as if my skull had been cut off at the top and my brain was coming out, evaporating into the world, out of my body. The lid was off and the container for my mind was opened. It was scary, unnerving and I felt I was losing control. I wondered if I was dreaming my experience but I knew I was not. Perhaps I was still half asleep. I got up and made my way across the dark room. I thought I saw and felt the presence of an animal, a grey, furry cat at the door. I did not want him to get out. I realized that this could not be, could it? I was fearful I was going mad, seeing an animal in my room as well as the loss of sensation of my arm. I quickly opened the door. As the light poured in my senses came back to me, although when I went back to my bed my left arm was still numb. Since this time, my elbow where my ulnar nerve runs (funny bone) has felt achy, 4 days later. 02PF 26 XX:XX:XX NS This proving remedy had initially helped to alleviate my underlying discomfort and discontent, and now it has returned and I am angry. I feel I need to get rid of it any way I can or else I will go mental. I wanted to alter my mood any way I could. It was too early to start drinking so I decided to clean the bathroom instead. Maybe I could clean to alter my physical reality to help with my mental reality. I focused on uncluttering, getting rid of all the superfluous objects and items that littered my space. This helped for about an hour, although the discomfort returned, full force. I was joyless and quite sensitive to any arising/perceived conflict or need to do something I didn't want to do. This discomfort was almost one of deep mental anguish or suffering, like a chemical imbalance I was doomed to. I finally convinced myself that a cigarette would help. Smoking helped by making my head feel dizzy, and reminded me of the beginning of the proving and how I didn't feel I wanted to drink or smoke as I already had this nice \"buzz\". I am realizing that in my normal state of existence I experience a lot more discomfort than I realized. I fear that this is mental illness and I am physiologically doomed to experience it as my natural state. After the cigarette I took a shower which also helped 02PF 21 XX:XX:XX AS I have an intense experience- like being sucked into blackness. The blackness is inside of me so its more like having all the happiness and joy- all my soul sucked out. Except I do feel like I'm sinking into the blackness: my joy is being sucked out so I'm sinking more and more into a vacuum. Its doesn't last long and I fight my way out. I'm not willing to go there. There's been a feeling, I think, for the last few weeks that there's something under the surface of the flatness. 08PF 22 0:24:00 NS Feel emotionally quite 'wobbly' and fearful today. 09PF 23 0:09:30 NS Have woken up with what's like a panic attack. Real despair. I'm writing this at 9.00 and its been going on since 7.00. I can't find the words to describe it. I just feel like crying. There's self loathing and fear. It feels as though this thing that I've been sweeping under the carpet has finally got me. I've felt the lurking, menacing possibility of sinking into this nothingness for days and a few times its made a grab for me. I feel I can't un-tangle what's going on, can't even really connect to what I'm feeling. This is so hard to write- the words won't come. There's a complete absence- an absence of love, of me, of connection of joy. I found myself wondering whether people when they feel like this kill themselves. I was thinking of knives. But I don't think they could. I don't think there's enough passion or motivation even for that. I think it could lead to self harm- just so that there's something to feel. Writing this I want to cry but my sons in the room next door so I'm not free to. That's part of the trouble. Not free to express emotions, have to hide them away, sweep them under the surface and carry on as normal. At this moment I feel like I've been doing that all my life. I'd like to hide away under the duvet but that's not a safe place either because I'm there and its myself I'm scared of. I can't connect with any of the positive experiences of my life, with any of the good things. Its all been sucked away. I think if only I had a talisman or a charm or a spell I might be able to ward it away but I haven't and I can't. I can't call up the resources. I wish I had the house to myself. I did wonder about getting in the van and driving to the coast but I'm also scared of driving. Everything is more complicated than need be- nothing is straight forward and simple and easy during the proving. 08PF 26 XX:XX:XX NS DITHERY, LACK OF FOCUS I'm becoming more aware of a sort of ditheriness that has been there from day 1. Its forgetful, a bit confused, can't find words, can't find things that I've just had. There's quite a bit of having just done something and immediately forgetting that I've done it. There's a complete lack of recall about having packed books in a bag- I remember thinking about which bag to put them in but I don't remember having put them in a bag! Its got a bit of a panicky sense- 'where are those books, has someone else taken them.' 08PF 1 XX:XX:XX AS Intense problem processing information. Am hearing what people are saying but having difficulty processing it. The harder I try the more a pressure across forehead, behind eyes becomes. Feel I have to work hard to keep eyes open when it seems natural to close them. Also along with this, people seem a long way away and I feel detached from them. 06PF 2 0:10:15 NS I am having trouble focusing on following the thread of conversation. I feel spacy, like I am hazy and distracted with my interior world. Like being in the world with a gauzelike haze between me and everything outside of me. 02PF 2 0:17:30 AS Trying to organise myself to have a shower. Walking in and out of room with different things to take. Do this three times or more. Packing is also difficult. It's because my plan for going to the shower or packing changes or maybe it's because I've forgotten the original plan, I'm not sure. I don't feel stressed by it, more bemused and confused by it. I manage to laugh about it. 01PF 3 00:10:00 NS Tried to help daughter with homework, which I had been keen to do, but could not think. The task felt impossible, so I had to give up and ask her father to help instead. Felt like I had let them both down 03PF 3 0:18:30 IOS I'm all over the place. At times fully concentrated, once committed to the job in hand. In between I'm flitting from one thing to the next. I almost start to panic but then the feeling dissipates as I chase another thought. My body feels completely relaxed compared to the flightiness of my thoughts. 01PF 4 XX:XX:XX NS Suddenly remembering that I have work to complete, as if I had never known it before. And then I remembered it. 01PF 4 XX:XX:XX NS Definite problem with vision and perception. Head feels very foggy inside and feel I need to concentrate really hard on normal tasks. Have a tendency to feel dizzy if I let the concentration lapse. Objects again look further way than they are. Feel slightly clumsy and bump in to things which wouldn't normally do. Keep dialling the wrong numbers even though I have the number in front of me. Lasts all day. 06PF 4 0:07:45 NS I filled a bag with things that I wanted to buy, but I had gotten a bit confused as to what I was buying and what I had already put into a bag. I knew there was another bag somewhere else in the shop with objects that I wanted to buy but I wasn't sure where it was. I became distracted by something that was outside the shop. I paused for quite some time trying to figure out what it was. I then became distracted by my urge to shop again and then became preoccupied shopping again. 12PM 5 XX:XX:XX DREAM Can't find things I'm looking for. Began to get very angry, started slamming things in frustration. I lost my scissors but then found them exactly where they should be. I'm confused as to where things are or should go, just went to make a cup of tea, couldn't find the tea bags because I put them in wrong cupboard. Then after finding the tea bags I realise that I had already put a tea bag in the cup. I couldn't remember just doing this a few seconds before. 12PM 6 0:09:50 NS Suddenly remember that I have some work to complete. This has been at the back of my mind constantly for the last few months but I have completely forgotten about it. Remembering it now is as if it has only just been suggested to me. 01PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS My focus is flittering e.g. I file a report and then can't remember if I've added certain bits. I keep having to go back to check. I notice the complete blankness about what I just did again and have to try really hard to stay on task and concentrate. Its as if my brain is flittering all over, not in the moment. I also notice mistakes in spelling and typing are much more common again. 08PF 8 0:09:00 AS I'm trying to watch talent competition on TV with my daughter but find it incredibly frenetic and very difficult to watch because of that. I'm really wound up by it! After about 20 mins or so I can't bear it any longer and go for a bath. 08PF 9 0:21:00 AS I sit at my computer to write, however I am unable to concentrate. I try to read but the words and sentences are jumbled and don't seem to make sense. I am frustrated because I need to get this essay finished but my mind feels as if it is all over the place and I keep forgetting what I am planning to write. I am finding it hard to organise my thoughts logically and then write, which isn't something I usually have a problem with. 07PF 10 0:10:30 NS Head feels foggy and I need to concentrate hard while writing this which increases the sensation of straining across the forehead. 06PF 11 0:08:50 ROS I am getting muddled with my words when I'm speaking. When I answer the phone to clients and take down their telephone number, I have to concentrate very hard and repeat the number back to them, as my brain seems to be jumbled and working more slowly than usual. My short term memory isn't as good as it usually is and I feel as if I'm not working at full speed. I am also making quite a lot of typing errors when I am typing letters. This continues for several weeks, muddling dates, phone numbers, causing confusion and a lot of problems at work. I am very embarrassed. I quickly forget and can't retain information. Everything is in a whirlwind. I have to write lists to stop me forgetting things that I have to do. 07PF 11 0:14:00 NS Really forgetful still. 2 examples stick out today: forget my debit card and have to borrow money for lunch from a friend. Leave my handbag behind where I've been sitting and don't realise for at least 15mins but fortunately another friend has seen it and picked it up. 08PF 13 XX:XX:XX NS My thoughts drop off, they don't persist long enough for the emotion to escalate. The thoughts and emotions appear but then they go again just as quickly. I feel more calm, with a sense of logic about my decision. I asked my partner the next day how he had perceived my behaviour. His words were that my behaviour was 'erratic'; I was not clearly communicating with him. 01PF 16 XX:XX:XX My son texts me to tell me that there is a parent's evening at school this evening, which I had forgotten about. 07PF 16 0:16:00 NS My husband's mother and father arrived at our house and I could tell there was something wrong with them, but they did not explain what it was. Then I suddenly realised that it was actually Christmas and we had no decorations in the house, no gifts or seasonal food and that we had completely forgotten what time of year it was. My in-laws did not speak of this, but I thought they must be upset. I was shocked, devastated and could not believe that I had somehow forgotten and let everyone down. 03PF 18 XX:XX:XX DREAM My parents have a whole barrow full of old, half-used tins of paint. They ask me to check if any of it can be re-used. I suggest we donate it to charity instead. They don't listen to me so we carry on. We are trying to remember which colours we have as we check the paint and it gets confusing. There is some repulsive pink paint and yellow paint coming out of two containers like it's increasing in volume, oozing out. The paint lids are off, colours are appearing and the quantity of paint is disturbing me. It's as if it's all increasing in size and quantity, more forceful, and so the task becomes bigger and more impossible. I look around and there are loads of DIY tools around. I'm a bit overwhelmed, a bit disturbed and slightly despairing. 01PF 19 XX:XX:XX DREAM Tried to keep focussed and calm but could feel my mind busying ahead towards my day. Started to get caught up in a rush of things to do before leaving, felt I needed to keep focussed. Feeling like things were starting to build up, well up. I felt like I had things under control but that something might take over, that I would lose control. 12PM 19 0:09:00 NS Driving to work I forget my handbag so have to turn back. Yesterday I forgot my lunch. I've also been misplacing books over the past week. I think I haven't put her trainers in her PE bag. The more I try to concentrate on this the more anxious I become. I feel guilty and a failure. This feeling of guilt stayed with me all morning, making it difficult to concentrate on anything. By 14:00, I just had to come home, the need to check trainers were not on shoe rack overwhelming. Felt really anxious, constriction sensation in throat and chest, and for a few seconds, shooting pains in back of neck. This reaction was totally out of proportion and I wouldn't normally react like this. 15:30 collected daughter from school, trainers were in her bag. I instantly relaxed but still have a niggling doubt that I'm not totally with it at the moment. 06PF 20 0:09:10 NS Writing anything takes a lot of effort and I have to bust one sentence out at a time. Each sentence is carefully constructed and it has taken me the whole afternoon to write a paragraph. I start to fiddle around with the construction and get caught up in the same sentence for hours on end. Very confusing. I stare at what I'm writing and it all became blurred, there is no wider focus, I'm unable to take in a sentence in a wider context. When I walk away and rest from it for a moment I can come back to it and it is clear, but then the drained, blurred feeling returns and I lose myself in what I'm doing again. 12PM 21 0:16:00 RS I keep needing to check that I have locked the door and turned off electrical items. I go back to the boat to check that I have turned the heater off and yesterday I went back home, ten minutes after I left to check that I had locked the house. This has been happening for the past few days. 07PF 23 XX:XX:XX NS I realise I haven't heard any of what she's said or written any of it down. Like I wasn't there- but I was. Completely blank about what just happened. I'm horrified but haven't got a clue what to do- I can't admit what's just happened. 08PF 26 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am feeling anxious and my head feels a bit dizzy and buzzy, but not in the fun, calm way as at the beginning of the proving but rather in an anxious and insane way. I am hypersensitive both physically and emotionally. I want to be in my own space. I want wine, I want to move but also want to be alone. I feel trapped as it is too cold and uncomfortable to go outside. The cold would bristle my skin too much I had a strange sense that I needed to do something but forgot what it was. It seemed important, almost urgent, but I could not recall what it was. My thoughts feel scrambled and anxious-nothing in particular. It is a restlessness, or perhaps a need to organize my thoughts as to where I have been and where I am going. 02PF 27 0:19:00 NS I'm starting to doubt my ability to cope. I am finding it too stressful and worrying. 11PF 50 XX:XX:XX POWER, STRENGTH/WEAKNESS, FLATTENED I go to a beautiful swimming pool set in grass common land. When I get in it transforms into a functional and ugly exercise pool full of people in lines doing exercises. I join in with the feeling that I'm expected to. Teacher at the edge of the pool is demonstrating an exercise, raising both arms above the head, grasping hands together and flexing the muscles. He has a stereotyped appearance of an Australian life guard, highly bronzed, muscular with long blond hair. He is like a cartoon as he grimaces doing the exercise and his biceps are ridiculously and unbelievably huge, leaving me feeling bemused. I'm the only one who struggles to do this exercise. I can't hold my arms in the position for long, I have no strength in my muscle and my arms are shaky from the effort. 01PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM I began to pick up stones and threw them across the group into the distance. I was aware that I'm a bad aim when throwing anything and that I could hit someone, but didn't care. I felt free, independent, strong, energised 12PM 2 0:17:15 NS Feel flat, can't be bothered and even a bit cynical of other people's enthusiasm. I feel a bit like I can't be bothered. The feeling reminds me of the teenage school child who \"not bothered\" who's observing the boffins. (Again common theme that comes and goes throughout). Its like I'm seeing it second hand- looking at it but not really feeling it or being in it/part of it - not connecting with it. I don't like myself, I'm not comfortable with myself. This is something that has been healed over the years but that seems to have fallen away- maybe I've just been putting on a front and compensating all these years. I feel stuck right in it at the moment. (This becomes a common feeling- comes and goes until anti-dote proving on day 28 and even then it returned for a bit until took 2nd stronger anti-dote on about day 68).08PF 2 0:20:00 NS An internal humming and grinding, it has great strength and power, nothing can stop it it is relentless, powerful, like in internal bulldozer. It feels good, it feels I have the power and support to do things. I have the internal reserves, the torque, the motivation to get things done, but slowly, steadily, with strength. 05PM 3 0:08:30 NS I was in a rugby scrum and the rest of the team were women. I felt strong and in control. I was the No.8 and one of the second-row fell out, so I easily picked her up (still in my bent position) and plopped her back in position. Feeling of strength, power and superiority. 04PM 4 XX:XX:XX NS Working as a waitress. Manager was trying to tell me something and I couldn't make out the words he was using in a conversation to me. He became increasingly annoyed. This led me to absolute fury and I walked off. I felt powerful. 02PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM While driving my mind is wandering and I imagine being something small at the side of the road and getting run over by the tyre. I imagine the huge tyre tread coming at me and flattening me 04PM 5 XX:XX:XX NS I felt invalidated, vulnerable and challenged. I wanted to react to her with tension and by pushing back. 12PM 4 00:08:55 DREAM Had been thinking as I woke up about daughters parents evening at school this evening. Telling myself to be strong and not feel intimidated. The thought of this evening is bringing up feelings of needing to be strong and not feeling small to prevent being walked on and flattened. 06PF 5 0:06:00 NS I notice there is a marked polarity between the feelings of staggering/weakness/not being in control and the feeling of power/control/superiority. 04PM 6 XX:XX:XX NS Boyfriend was being mean, a bully. He pretended to pull back on a rope I was holding on to and acted as if he was going to let go and it would flick me in the face. Instead I let go and it hit him. It snapped back at him and I said \"I have had enough of you\". I was pissed off. He spent the rest of the dream trying to restore my affection. I was glad for the attention and was hoping he would change for me. 02PF 7 XX:XX:XX DREAM A procession of four completely red vehicles, one of them might have been a horse box. There was a feeling of pride and invincibility, like I was part of a strong team. 04PM 9 XX:XX:XX NS The bloke with the toughest (criminal) background is selected from the wedding guests to walk me and a friend back to the underground station. I feel pleased to be escorted, it feels safer. 11PF 9 XX:XX:XX I remind myself how supportive a friend was to me this summer when I was going to pieces with stress. My life as I knew it was pulverising. Now it seems more stable. It has only minimally changed but I thought everything was disintegrating when it was going through the breaking down stage before being re-formed. Perhaps it is strengthened. 11PF 15 XX:XX:XX Told a friend that I had learnt to say no to my partner and that since doing this I realised I had the power to change the direction of my own life. I was really taken back by the fact that I said this. I realised I had empowered myself. I felt stronger and clearer about who I was in that moment. 12PM 24 0:18:00 NS I have just had a letter from the hospital following my recent routine mammogram that there is 'an area on the film which needs to be looked at more closely'. I am pretty shocked by this... Also there has been so much controversy recently around people being wrongly diagnosed with breast cancer. I find the thought totally horrifying that I might be diagnosed as needing further treatment when, in fact, I do not need it at all! How on earth will I react if they want to stick a needle in me to take off fluid from a 'benign cyst'? Surely this is interfering with something. I am worried that I will not have time to think about it and consider, as all the above will be a progression intended to be done if THEY deem it necessary. I feel that once the system sucks me in... 09PF 14 0:12:45 NS I'm a powerful woman and want to have sex with my partner. The sensation of power is in my thighs particularly. I am bigger than him. My partner is attracted to my advances but also intimidated by the power of them. I am too forceful and he decides to go off with a pretty young woman who is much sweeter than me. I'm disheartened but the sexual energy is still strong in me. 01PF 29 XX:XX:XX DREAM Exercising my right leg by standing on it and flexing it so my body rises up and down. This is in an effort to help the problem with my right knee. As I keep doing it the leg gets stronger and stronger and my legs are now working like super pistons. When I feel the thigh it is as hard as bone. My friends are watching me, mildly amused, and asking me what on earth I'm doing. 01PF 29 XX:XX:XX DREAM I go and sit by the sea as it grows dark. I want to see it again and not be menaced by it this time and I'm not. I'm alone but feel very at peace. A man standing on a surf board, paddling with an oar, paddles up to the shoreline and talks to me. He wants to tell me how difficult it is to stand on a surf board, how good it is for strengthening the muscles and tendons of the legs. 01PF 34 XX:XX:XX NS Unable to manage entries into the diary today. Feel tired and drained from concentrating on what feels like negative misery. Unable to make diary entries on days 39 and 40 as felt too tired and drained. The feeling comes and goes throughout the proving 12PM 37 0:09:00 NS Swimming. Feel incredibly relaxed, breathing even, as if I'm gliding effortlessly through the water. This is unusual, am usually pulling much more, making more of an effort and get out of breath quickly because I don't swim often enough to build up stamina. 01PF 36 0:16:00 AS Walking along a ridge. There are other people too. I am walking with a kind of force that splits the rock open, like a chisel splitting wood, going through the rock. There is a lot of power, slicing through. It could almost be as if I'm on my belly with arms stretched forward, hands together stretched forward slicing through the rock. 01PF 40 XX:XX:XX DREAM Partner throws an egg timer at me. It's like the size and weight of a pebble held in the hand. It hits the cervical area of my spine, the bone that sticks out most. There is no pain. It's more like a sound, a whack, a call for attention. 01PF 41 XX:XX:XX DREAM STRUGGLE TO MOVE THROUGH Our group is excruciatingly slow and hard to set in motion. One woman's car \"breaks down\" in the parking lot but it is later discovered that she just hadn't maneuvered the gearshift properly. This seems a fitting metaphor for how we as a group cannot move forward. As forthright as I am about my opinion I refuse to make the group decisions. We are leaderless, indecisive and it is a real struggle to leave school. I feel hungry and frustrated. 02PF 1 0:02:00 NS Somebody says something and its misheard by another person e.g. midges instead of images, seven instead of southern etc. Becomes a source of amusement. But it is halting the flow of conversation. This continues for another day. 08PF 1 XX:XX:XX NS Had uphill struggle with group decision about whether to go out, or to stay in to eat. We wanted to be together, but it took ages to decide. 09PF 1 0:02:00 NS It was as though either way it was going to be complicated, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid this in the first place. 12PM 2 0:12:00 NS Feeing quite agitated. Class is taking time to get going - want everyone to hurry up and get on with day so can get home. For once I want time to go quickly when normally I want time to slow down. 06PF 3 0:10:15 NS An ambulance on the way to school holds up traffic. Child says \"that ambulance took up our time\". Usually he'd be concerned about what happened that needed an ambulance. Overlayed on this is serenity and an encompassing sense that everything is everything and all is as it should be. 11PF 4 0:08:30 NS Slightly negative feeling towards doing the proving. Do not want to have any more symptoms, as I am tired of the intense dreams and strange sensations. I have have been through so much the last few days/weeks. Feel a little sorry for myself. Helping others does not inspire me, I do not want to be the person who is helping.. 03PF 9 XX:XX:XX NS Something is working against me the past few days. I am getting very frustrated as I am trying to arrange appointments. However, this is proving impossible as we are unable to agree a time that is convenient for the three of us. I can't understand why this is so difficult. It seems as if something is working against me, and I feel discouraged and demotivated. I am beginning to have doubts about whether this is going to work out for me. Two days later: I feel as if I have achieved very little today due to things that seem to be outside my control. I keep being interrupted but am also aware that it is me who is unable to focus on what I am doing. 07PF 10 0:13:45 NS Everything is more complicated than it needs or ought to be, nothing is straight forward. I think part of the trouble is that I'm dwelling on the bad too much. Things get blown out of proportion in my mind- seem too much to deal with, a big drama and that makes me feel anxious and chaotic and panicky. Example: Friends arrive for lunch and not long after a garden log cabin we've had on order is delivered. We were expecting that this might happen but its pouring with rain and the truck gets totally stuck in our narrow road. We have to unload it all piece by piece in the pouring rain and carry it down the road. But I'm also trying to make lunch and not completely ignore my guests, phone to try to find someone to help tow the truck out, dry the friend's son's clothes in a dryer that keeps blowing all the fuses in the house and be a sociable host. I sort of cope but find it all very frenetic. They're really old friends and totally cool about the chaos going on around them, muck in and help with lunch etc. Despite this I'm not relaxed, on edge and after they've gone feel quite tearful about the whole thing! Its just so difficult to relax and go with the flow at the moment. This continues throughout the proving. 08PF 11 0:11:30 NS A packed commuter train came rolling in and I realised that it was my train. I was far down the end of the platform and had to run up the platform to get on the train. There where enormous crowds of people and I knew I had no chance of getting on the train. I debated whether I should try, part of me wanted to just give up but I knew that it would be difficult to get to my destination if I didn't try harder. I knew I had to act quickly even thought it would be a struggle. I just wanted to take it easy, sit back and not struggle, I wanted to walk away from the situation but I knew this was the only chance I had. Part of me was resigned to doing nothing and the other part knew I had to try. I felt tired and strained though. 12PM 12 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in a huge city in the middle of winter. It was blowing a gale with black clouds and raining hard. I came out of a train station and had to walk across an enormous open mall that lay between huge city buildings. I had to get to the other side and the wind blew straight across it. There were no people for some distance, I was alone. I leant into the wind to reach the other side. The wind blew so hard I couldn't walk forward, it blew me backwards and I was losing my balance. I decided it would be better if I walked backward and leant back into the wind. It was like pushing something with your back but the distance I was making was negligible so I stopped. I decided that it would be too much work to get across the mall by walking and that I should head back down to the underground train and take it closer to where I was going. 12PM 12 XX:XX:XX DREAM It feels as if we're in the way. I get my timing almost right, leaving. Host's mother arrives just after we have left. I have to back up quarter of a mile along an unmade path to let her pass. 11PF 12 XX:XX:XX NS I was walking down a street that had road works, the pedestrian area was narrow and walled with protective fencing. I decided to float and fly over the top of people to get ahead. I began to fly/float clumsily along, I had no momentum to push forward and had to use my feet to push on the shoulders of people to get ahead. I was beginning to hang in the same spot. I felt self conscious about this. I was overly sensitive and I didn't want to annoy or bother people, I just wanted to get ahead. As I floated and flew I struggled to maintain height, it was like I was a deflating balloon. 12PM 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in a car with my ex-boyfriend driving on a scenic country drive. The road twisted and turned around a hilly valley towards a scenic look out. The road threaded around the tops of the hills. As we drove towards a scenic look out we had to drive though a gate that had a series of speed bumps. Each speed hump was made of wood, they were kind of like a forest trees just laid out long ways, and each varied in size. As we cleared the majority of the humps they then began to get higher and the jolts of the car became more violent. As we drove over each speed hump on return and reached nearer to the exit gate, the speed humps began to get closer together and their height increased to such a point that it was nearly impossible to drive the car over them. As the car went over each of the last humps there was an uncomfortable jolt in the cabin. I questioned if we get the car over the humps. The last two humps were ridiculously high, they caused a lot of discomfort. I really didn't think the car could make it over them. 12PM 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm now fed up with the proving. I feel good in myself but have had enough and just want to move on now. Life is short and I have lots of other things I need to get on with and feel this is holding me back because of the amount of time it is taking. 06PF 14 0:07:00 NS I feel overwhelmed by the amount of demands I have on me. I feel that I am neglecting so many of my other important responsibilities. I also felt that I was not up to the task. A very strong genuine sense of not being able to cope and wanting a way out. Talked with my husband about feeling like I could not carry on my studies, and felt better after the conversation. Everything felt more balanced, I did not feel so stuck, but like I had more choice in what I did. 03PF 14 0:11:15 IOS Tiredness continues, it's difficult to stay focussed and to keep motivated to work. I just want to relax and rest, I feel like everything is a struggle. My eyes are tired, my mind is tired and I want to stop and do nothing. 12PM 16 0:12:00 IRS I realised my situation echoed the one from childhood, it came up into the light of consciousness from some dark crevice. I start to feel relief. If they are not resolved, you vascillate. Doing nothing doesn't help, the anxieties increase and go round in circles until the right decision is made. If you make the wrong decision, or if doing nothing about it is the wrong course of action, the anxiety of conscience becomes a stuck state. 11PF 16 XX:XX:XX NS Despite this 'unreal feeling' I feel as though the distance is having a stabilizing effect on me, more able to see decisions through. 11PF 16 XX:XX:XX During mediation had a vision of my Guru, she highlighted that I need to remain grounded at a midway point in order to reach above and below. Shortly after I remembered a friend who had passed appeared. I opened up a dialog with him in my mind and began to talk. The conversation flowed forth. He said that this was like taking any kind of drug, that there would be ups and downs with it but that I needed to stay with it and ride it out. He said that even though it felt uncomfortable a positive side would soon kick in. He reassured me that it would be ok and asked me to stay with it. 12PM 18 0:14:00 NS I found it difficult to find any resolution about this situation. There doesn't seem to be an answer that will give us everything we need. Part of me realises that I have to just work with what I have but the other part of me wants a fix to these problems. The only thing is that if we try to fix any of the problems it will just create more work. If we leave the problems, they still need to be fixed. The only answer is to not worry about it but I can't let the worry go. 12PM 27 0:19:00 IOS I feel stressed and under pressure to get my work complete, somehow I just feel I can't get on top of things. They seem to be piling up on top of me. Feel as though I'm pushing and pushing but not getting anywhere. I'm tired and want to stop but if I try to do this I can't relax and have to work again to feel better about it. 12PM 19 20:00:00 NS 10 days later: No matter what we look at or touch then becomes a complex problem and adds a load of stress. Everything turns into an intense and heavy issue that drains me and creates pressure on myself or my partner. 12PM 28 0:16:30 NS There were so many people that it was hard to move along the street. There was a sense of urgency, some tourists were trying to organise themselves to get to the airport, they were concerned that the crowds of people might slow them down and that they may miss their flight. As I left and went downstairs there were people everywhere in the lobby and they were walking against me as I came down the stairs. There was a feeling that I was going against the flow, it was becoming overwhelming. I was beginning to worry that I wouldn't have enough time to get the airport, it felt urgent and I was getting anxious. 12PM 20 XX:XX:XX DREAM I felt drained and heavy from the conversations around the issue of moving. 12PM 23 0:09:00 NS Feeling very irritable and need to exercise. I have a strong urge to go swimming and be underwater. I go swim and feel so much better for it. While in the water I didn't feel the same relaxed state I usually do, rather a need to swim hard and fast. I was aware of a deep tightness in the back of my neck and my arms ached quickly, worse on the left side below shoulder. Every time I inhaled I felt a sharp stabbing pain in my chest causing me to take only short in-breaths. Each time I put my head under the water to swim I felt I could hear someone calling \"Mum\". 06PF 23 0:11:00 Such a complicated arrangement to get child met after school, the arrangements keep falling through. This has been a recurrent theme for several days now. 11PF 29 XX:XX:XX Sitting in preparation to talk about my experiences I felt overwhelmed, I felt as though on the edge of wanting to tell but not being able to tell them. Felt a welling feeling, it was an overwhelming sensation and my heart pumped with adrenalin. I was stuck on an edge of not being able to move forward but not being able to retreat. I could feel my heart race, my blood pump and my energy drain away from my mind and body. 12PM 30 0:17:00 NS Feel tired and unrefreshed after sleep. Do not feel I have the resources to cope with the day. Disinterested in life generally. Cannot get motivated, and cannot find anything to feel positive about. Everything feels very bleak and hopeless. Cannot see any value or interest in life. Cannot find anything to feel happy about in life. Cannot imagine an end to the feeling of hopelessness and helplessness. Persists to day 34. 03PF 33 0:08:00 IOS I want to move on, move away from it, for it to be over. 11PF 34 XX:XX:XX Driving a people carrier. My mother is somehow involved, I think I'm looking after her. I drive up some really steep stone steps into a narrow, tunnel like street. I think the car is going to tip over backwards, it's so steep. 01PF 35 XX:XX:XX DREAM I wake up in a very argumentative mood. I feel terrible and seem to have no control over my emotions. I feel angry and irritable with my partner and he says he cannot do anything right. I can't stop thinking about things that have happened in the past and keep tormenting myself with guilt. My partner tries to get me to move on, but I cannot let go. He tells me to think about the positive things in our relationship, but I am unable to see anything positive today. I can't see a future for our relationship and tell him this. I feel very vindictive and unable to forgive him for things that he has done in the past. We move on for a while but I keep coming back to it and cannot let go. I keep pushing and pushing until I get a reaction from him. I am aware that I am being unreasonable but I cannot seem to stop myself. It feels as if I am being controlled by something outside of myself and I am powerless to do anything about it. 07PF 36 0:09:00 NS I feel a lot of loving memories towards that time and hope it can be resolved. I realise how many people in the family are struggling with unresolvable heart-achy situations. 11PF 39 0:13:00 Have bought lots of things from supermarket, not considering how I am going to get it to the car. I pack it all in 2 very heavy bags, in the process I put my finger through an egg shell. I then carry these 2 very heavy bags back to the car. Half way there I feel like crying, the bags are so heavy and I feel as if I am really struggling, although I can't stop because I don't want people to look at me and think I can't cope. 06PF 42 0:09:40 NS I have an essay open on my computer which I started three weeks ago and still haven't finished. I can't seem to get motivated to finish it, and just seem to keep procrastinating and putting it off. I don't feel anxious about it though and don't feel under any pressure to get it finished. 07PF 25 0:19:00 NS I was standing on the edge of a breakwater. I was about to start a race where I had to first swim to the other side of the inlet. People were wishing me luck. As I dove in under the water I could hear someone from the breakwater talk to me. They were in the middle of asking me something when I took the dive. I swam back to the breakwater to answer the question. At the same time, I knew it was a race and that I was now getting behind. 12PM 27 XX:XX:XX DREAM I felt stuck on an edge, I couldn't move forward but I couldn't retreat. I then felt unable to recover. 12PM 30 0:17:00 NS I began to talk about money, the lack of it and the fact that we're stuck in our lives and unable to move forward because of this. I felt miserable. I looked at my dinner and felt that I had spoilt any hope of enjoying my food. 12PM 32 0:21:00 NS Tired of throwing everything at life only to watch things move in reverse. I just end up exhausted. 12PM 35 0:15:00 NS The feeling of wanting to get these to the right place is excruciating. 11PF 58 XX:XX:XX AS CLEANING, ORGANIZING I'm living in a house near the high street. All the adjoining backyards have been rearranged with new fences. There is now more order and also access through them to the high street and that feels clearer and better for me. Some of my belongings are part of a display outside a shop/house. They have been there a while and look well embedded. I want to take them back to their rightful place, I want to get everything that is dispersed back to one place. I feel guilty because I'm ruining the display but my need is stronger than the shop's. 01PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM A white van in the street had the words DIRTY printed on the back. I pass this trailer again the next day, it has DECONTAMINATION UNIT on the side. 11PF 4 0:10:00 NS I take the car to be valet cleaned. I've wanted to do it since day 1 of the proving, although I've never had my car valeted. I had already been to the car wash but it still seemed that it had to be properly cleaned. I wanted it sparkling clean. Even after being valeted it doesn't seem clean enough. It's still a scruffy old car. I might have to call the cleaners to come to my house and do a clean as well. 11PF 5 0:12:00 NS I found myself at my messy flat. It looked like an overwhelming job and my friends were behind me coming up the stairs to visit. I started to grab some papers and organise the place and within moments it was miraculously spotless. I felt really pleased. It was so easy and the circumstances had flowed, stress-free. 02PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am usually tidy and like things to be in their proper place, however, whilst I have not become untidy, I seem to be less concerned if other people are untidy or haven't put things away properly. I don't feel the need to tidy up immediately. 07PF 6 XX:XX:XX AS Have a strong need to get organized. Spent the afternoon organising paperwork. Not overly productive but relaxed about it whereas would normally get quite tense and want to get it done as quickly as possible. The need to sort things out is to do with the need to be organised and structured rather than because I can't stand the clutter which is normally the reason behind it. Continues to next evening when I iron, which is something I would not normally do at this time. 06PF 7 0:12:30 AS Truly, in real life I am not a neat freak. Usually I think \"ironing? what about real life?\" I think I will have to iron the bedclothes if I'm going to feel comfortable. I want a bed with sheets steam pressed smooth like. 11PF 7 0:14:30 NS I'm changing all the bedclothes and washing the sheets. Lovely fresh white cotton on the washing line. I have gone into overdrive with the washing, as if it is a compulsion. I'm thinking, any minute now I'll be ironing these sheets. I want things to be SMOOTH. I order a new mattress. Fresh, quilted, lovely. This lasts until day 48 of the proving. 11PF 8 0:10:00 AS I remember seeing her organising something around a pool, as though she was moving bags out of a holiday home 12PM 8 XX:XX:XX DREAM Got quite stressy about tidying up before some friends arrived for lunch. Got the kids tidying their rooms and rushed around tidying downstairs. Find this much more stressful than usual 08PF 11 0:11:30 AS Couscous has gone mouldy while we were away. I throw it out and wash the dishes. Did I need to see it to be reminded of the life cycle? It's up to us to make the most of these offerings and then clean up before they go off, back into life cycle. I have a sense that cleaning up is an important part of the abundance cycle. My most abundant friends are the ones who know what / when to throw away. My most stagnant friends who struggle with debts, not having enough, are the ones who hoard clutter and mess and don't know when to throw stuff out and clean up. My house is full of clutter, I want to do a clear out. 11PF 12 XX:XX:XX NS I remember dreaming about organising things and putting lots of papers in files and envelopes. I was very organised and methodical. 06PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM Rubbish is a theme, but it is rubbish piling up instead of clearing away rubbish. I have to wade through bags of split open rubbish strewn across the street when I walk down to the local shops. I don't want to live in a rubbish heap.. Two days later: I have a full waste bin in the kitchen and it has been sitting there for 2 or 3 days, without me taking it out to the dustbin (I had been emptying it compulsively 3 times a day). I haven't noticed any smell. I'm not doing enough cleaning. 11PF 21 0:21:00 AS 11PF 19 0:09:00 IRS I'm noticing symmetry, beautiful shiny metal pots planted with neat box trees, in matching pairs, on a balcony on either side of a front door. It gives me deep sense of satisfaction to see the symmetry. My own garden is wild, wooded and unkempt, a haven for squirrels and hedgehogs and birds, and usually I love the fairy nature of this. I'm finding the calm and order of planted box trees in heavy pots either side of a strong front door or in light metal pots on a balcony, reassuring. I like the sense of order, balance, and I'm drawn to the smartness too. 11PF 20 0:09:00 NS Have spent the day feeling motivated and, in between phone calls, have been getting on with trying to 'unclutter' the house. Lasts all day. 09PF 20 0:16:30 IRS I am feeling the need to get organised. 06PF 33 0:06:00 RS Dreams of packing and unpacking and being away from home, on holiday, on a trip, going somewhere etc. become a common theme throughout proving 08PF XX:XX:XX DREAM I look at pictures of hotel rooms with the beds made up with crisp bed linen. Laundered pressed sheets. I want the walls and woodwork painted fresh white. 11PF 24 XX:XX:XX NS PATTERNS, SENSE OF DIRECTION Focus was drawn to the patterns on the carpet, they really stood out to me. 12PM 1 0:00:30 NS We play group games. None of the random instructions get me joined up with anyone. I drift out to the furthest edge and find myself drawn to anything with patterns and spirals in nature. We are taken outside for a walk in nature. I am drawn to the patterns in tree bark, tiny twiddly patterns on leaves, the beauty of nature is magnified. I'm high on this state 11PF 3 0:10:00 I was really drawn to the drain during my shower and after I had finished my focus was drawn immediately to the wash basin drain hole, and then to the water in the bottom of the drawn to the toilet pan. As I looked at this I notice that the water circled around the drain before draining away. I was as though I'd never seen the circular nature of the grate or of the water going into a circled drain before 12PM 4 0:10:15 NS Swimming. Wanted to play a game with the others in the pool. It was a race of some kind but the others weren't participating. I felt disappointed because I wanted to race. Then I realized that the water was draining from the pool and I got angry. I tried to find the culprit and stop the draining but it turned out that the pool had drained naturally due to the pull of the moon. The pool was really old, almost like an old fountain. It was square shaped. 02PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM Driving down a freeway at night and turning off the freeway to the left. I knew where I was going. 12PM 4 X:XX:XX DREAM Left the house 3 times today before actually going to the airport. Each time I would be halfway down the street and then suddenly remember important items that I had not put in my bag (drivers license, toiletries, etc.) I went back and fourth three times, as if a flash of intuition led me each time. I felt really grateful for the sudden flashes. 02PF 4 0:13:50 NS A parent at our new school, takes my arm and steers me along the road in the direction she is going, it's out of my way but I don't object. Work can wait. We walk around in a loop until I realise we could have got there far more simply by going in a straight line up the hill! But we'd have missed walking the circuit together, arm in arm, and I appreciate that she was trying to make a connection and bring me in to the group. 11PF 5 0:09:00 NS I'm watching a longboarder skimming his board along the sharp edge of a concrete block. Shavings of wood are coming off in long, thin curls. It's really satisfying to watch and my eyes are at a level with the edge so I can see really closely. It repeats itself again and again. 01PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm preoccupied with the pattern of my journeys. I have been becoming aware of these looped journeys in the past few days. Big loop west from house to school. Big loop north-west to garage. Then big loop to south-west school. Big loop north. I've never thought of my journeys as shapes, patterns or loops before. Today I think, why not do something amazing and show the patterns of the movement of your life? Why has no one thought of doing this? 11PF 6 XX:XX:XX NS I was in a state of semi-consciousness and my whole field of vision was filled with a pattern. Firstly, raised dots followed by a tyre-tread pattern. It was very graphic and the pattern was three dimensional, formed by relief and shadow. I lay there enjoying it for a while. I was essentially half awake between 05:00 and 09:00 but was relaxed and not anxious as I might normally be if having difficulty sleeping. 04PM 2 XX:XX:XX NS The children are bouncing off each other today like particles in a particle accelerator. Usually they run around in flowing patterns playing tag until they have to form a line to file into school. 11PF 8 0:08:30 Lining up tape measures in shape of cross so that each measure points to a central point. I'm focusing the forces into the centre in preparation for something. I'm not sure but it's something like a remedy. I do this repeatedly to get it right without any particular feeling attached apart from a sense of industriousness. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM In my mind I have a recurrence of the images of motion I had in the first few minutes of the proving, the acrobatics, the trapeze, back flips, swirling and twirling. In real life in my physical state I can't do that, I don't have the courage to even try! But in my less weighted down state of the imagination I do this choreography of motion, backflips, somersaults in the air, using trampolines or trapeze, in human physique, not shape shifted into flight. 11PF 19 XX:XX:XX NS People. Slopes and spirals. Caught up in a spiral in reverse. Person lying on a wooden contraption which is sloping and the slope reverses so that they are upside down and then right way up. It's something to do with states. 01PF 20 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was looking at a map of the British Isles. My focus was on the north east coast. There was a river on the map and I closed my focus in on this area, like a telescopic lens. I narrowed down a number of islands that lay in this channel of water. My vision kept focussing in to the left of the map, picking one island. Each time the scaled narrowed down closer and turned left or west to another island. The feeling was that I was narrowing a search to find an island to go on holiday. 12PM 20 XX:XX:XX DREAM I saw a lady dressed up to go somewhere. She really stood out with an upright posture and sense of direction. 01PF 30 0:09:30 NS I feel nothing other than clarity of the inexorable destination of the direction of this process. 11PF 34 XX:XX:XX NS TWO WAYS The feeling of duality: when you push through the \"can't be bothered\" mentality, there's an easy intelligence. 08PF 3 0:09:00 NS Realise that as I am writing, I am typing the wrong words. These are not typing errors though, I am actually writing a word which has a different meaning, for example, I have written 'improving' experiences rather than 'proving' experiences, and 'live' rather than 'love'. My mind seems to be thinking of two different things at the same time, as if I have two trains of thought, one conscious and one unconscious. 07PF 5 0:12:05 NS Someone I meet has one thumb branches into two. Afterwards I try to work out if it is on the right hand or the left hand and this seems very difficult to tell my right from left while remembering facing the person. (Normally I wouldn't have this problem working out left from right). 11PF 6 0:15:00 NS Three different routes, sometimes going through woods. One has a dotted pattern, one has a line and the other I can't now remember. I'm testing them, trying to visualise them. 01PF 8 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm in limbo, half of me has time and the other half feels I don't have time. I'm fed up with it, I feel so lethargic. Tense feeling inside. So pissed off. Can't be bothered with anything. Failure. I'm stuck. Supervisor asked me what limbo was. \"I don't know what is real and what isn't. What is me and what isn't. Things are getting on top of me.\" 06PF 11 0:21:00 AS I'm living on a sloping ridge looking down into the valley. It has snowed and the moon is so bright it's like daylight. I can see all the way down to the town in the valley, the snow is gleaming because it's packed down. I'm so excited I want to go for a walk but I don't want to go on my own. My neighbour walks with me for a bit then she wants to go home because her feet are getting wet. I want to offer her a pair of shoes but really she wants to go home. I don't know what to do, I'm torn between venturing out on my own with possible danger or giving up and going home. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm a young man. I'm looking at stains from ejaculating on sheets. Each stain makes a long stripe across the sheet. The stain can be in different positions on the sheet and my dream plays out as different images of these various possibilities. So one possibility is horizontal, one third the way down; another is halfway vertically; another is third way vertically etc. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM After a while went into 'not properly asleep or awake' mode. 09PF 15 0:05:15 NS Have a view from on top of a hill looking over a landscape of descending hills with pathways in the valleys. It seems alien, just the colour mustard yellow. I have a map of this landscape and am choosing from the many different routes available. It's like having two maps, one in my hand and one below. I'm walking around these pathways and I feel aloneness but also adventure. 01PF 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM I go to see my osteopath again who says that he has noticed that whereas, in the past, I was predominantly right brained, now there has been a big increase in my left brain activity and that both sides of my brain are much more in balance. 07PF 20 0:11:30 NS There's a mismatch between my perceptions of things and how it actually is. 08PF 20 XX:XX:XX AS I am not convinced that going back to Australia is the right thing to do. I think that partly being there is an option, and that partly being somewhere else is the other answer. Half in and half out is ideal. 12PM 24 0:15:00 NS Reflecting on the observations of people yesterday, the people are echoed in my dreams or vice versa. As if my dream world is sensitizing me to what is happening in my waking world. 01PF 31 XX:XX:XX NS I am feeling very torn between staying and leaving- I take myself out of the present and into the future, thinking where? When? How? What can I do now? Stay present. 02PF 34 0:23:00 NS LOSS OF DIRECTION We don't go where we were intending to. After driving around a circuit of the hill outside town we end up elsewhere. 11PF 1 0:03:40 NS Feeling pretty desperate, weeping. Do not know which way to turn. Feel there is no way out. 09PF 4 0:15:00 AS It's as if everything I am doing or thinking is cut off before its resolution. 01PF 4 XX:XX:XX Contentment is not about where your home is, but where your head is'. I often feel like emigrating but those feelings are less today. 04PM 8 0:12:00 AS I am aware that I have to think about the route to take and cannot remember the way that I usually get there. 07PF 7 0:20:00 NS I feel quite tearful and lost. I have lots of things I need to do but I just can't be motivated. Feeling tired, can't settle at anything, beginning to feel restless and a bit annoyed with self because I have a lot of things I need to do. This creates a tension inside of body and I feel like I want to scream \"Leave me alone\". I feel a bit lost. 06PF 11 0:18:15 NS I still have insight. Sometimes I know which way something is heading. At the moment I've lost this compass and feel like I need to check things out with someone to anchor it. 11PF 13 XX:XX:XX I have lots of things I need to do but have difficulty settling at anything and drift from one thing to another, achieving little. 06PF 13 0:07:00 NS From the beginning I felt the flittering, frenetic, chaotic aspect of the remedy. For me the aspect that its brought out is this onerous, impossible journey thwarted by many twists and turns and obstacles in the way. There's no 'straight on' in this journey and you can't control the way you're heading. 08PF 14 0:08:00 I wake up and partner has re-arranged all the furniture in an attempt to clean up. I am so frustrated and angry because all the furniture and books are in different places or unfamiliar. I'm looking down on it like a map and I can't make sense of it. 01PF 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM I have to go and stay with my sister but I have no phone, no map and I don't know where to go. I ask people from the congregation but they can't be bothered with me. I feel completely lost for any direction. 01PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM I feel we have come to a cross roads, I'm unable to move forwards but going back to what I was doing seems so unrealistic. I feel lost, unsupported, hard done by and utterly frustrated. 12PM 22 0:21:00 NS Feel restless and a bit lost. Lots to do but don't know what to do. 06PF 22 0:14:00 ROS I have gone to local town to get some food. By mistake I park in the wrong car park 06PF 42 0:09:10 NS LOST TRACK OF TIME Sometime between morning and afternoon I lost track of time... 11PF 2 XX:XX:XX ROS I seemed to be waking up hourly to look at the alarm clock, although the time on the clock didn't seem to change. During the night I am aware that I have to be awake at 5.30 am to wake my son. I wake up suddenly when my son bangs on my door saying that he has to leave. I look at the clock by my bed which says 5.20 am and it still seems to be working. However, he is saying that it is 6.20 am. I am very confused and disorientated and can't work out what the real time is as every clock I look at seems to be saying a different time, either being fast or slow. 07PF 4 0:06:20 NS I have been really confused about the dates in the proving diary, and all are incorrectly sequenced. I calculated the dates to be two days in advance of where they actually are. 12PM 5 0:09:45 NS I was waiting for a plane in an airport. I didn't take notice of the time and was quite relaxed about the whole affair. I realised when I looked at my boarding ticket that the flight actually left in 10 minutes. I bolted down the concourse of the airport to try and get to my gate but realised the gate was a very long way away. I knew I was going to miss my flight. There was disbelief; I couldn't understand how I could have gotten all this so wrong. 12PM 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM Friend is having an operation this morning to staunch the blood flow in the brain. It dawns on me that the date is month 11 year 11 and the operation is at 11am. This friend had an obsession with 11:11 as some kind of cosmic gateway. I realise with a kind of chill of realisation that she has manifested a life or death 11:11:11:11:11 gateway for herself. 13, 17.00 NS Confusion over dates. I've just realised that I got completely mixed up over the dates of Friend's operation. It was 21.10.11 that's 10: not 11:11. 11PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS Felt confused about the date of a meeting with someone. Tried to contact person to no avail. 09PF 12 0:07:15 NS I arrive at the station to catch my train only to find that the train that I have booked tickets for is an hour later than I actually thought. I checked the tickets the night before and this morning so cannot understand how I've got it wrong. I end up having to buy new train tickets as I can't use the ones I have bought. 07PF 12 0:15:30 NS My partner reminds me that the clocks are changing this evening, and I spend quite a long time trying to work out whether we are gaining or losing an hour and what the time will be at a certain time. However, despite him trying to explain this to me, I still have difficulty understanding the concept. Three days later: Even though the clocks and watches in the house have been set to the right time since the hour changed, they all seem to say different times and its hard to find out what the correct time is. 07PF 19 0:11:00 NS 07PF 16 XX:XX:XX NS I realise that I am experiencing the passage of time differently than usual. Events of yesterday, or recent days, seem as though they are long ago, like distant memories. It is as though more time has elapsed than actually has. I also realise that this symptom has been present in varying degrees for approximately 10 days, but it has seemed difficult to pinpoint until today. 03PF 17 0:09:00 AS Time is so long and stretched out. I've lost track of time, it seems very distant. I feel quite isolated, distant, away from it all, away from everyone. I know there are people, I'm not really isolated, but I'm far away from them, out of range, out of the loop, out of everyone's orbit, far away. 11PF 18 0:13:00 NS I discover that I have made a mistake with some social arrangements. This is due to my perception of events in the recent past as though they happened longer ago than than they actually did. I am getting confused by this. 03PF 22 0:11:00 IOS I wake suddenly at 5.30 am, convinced that it is 6.30 am, so jump out of bed, only to be told by my son that I am up an hour early. I feel exhausted but don't have time to go back to bed now. 07PF 30 0:05:30 NS I became concerned that I was hungry even though we had just gotten back from lunch. Suddenly I realized we hadn't eaten yet, it was just tea break earlier. I became relieved I would be eating but strangely aware that I have never mistaken tea break for lunch before. 02PF 32 0:11:00 NS Largely I feel calm. Almost blank. My short term memory is blank. I can't remember if I took the dog out for a walk. I had no memory at all of the morning - it's a blank. This has happened since news of the likelihood of a court case. 11PF 32 XX:XX:XX NS I forget the meeting with a friend and we have to rearrange for tomorrow. I forget again in the morning but then I remember and I go back and meet up with her. It's unusual for me to mess up meeting arrangements. 11PF 60 XX:XX:XX NS DEPENDENCE/VULNERABLE Driving car out of college grounds and steering wheel felt stiff and heavy with deep vibrations. Did not feel able to drive the car. I tried it a few moments later and could feel no problem, but still did not feel confident, so got a lift with a friend. 03PF 1 0:01:30 NS I was alone in the basement of the building when I heard the manager strongly whisper down to me but I couldn't understand what he wanted. I heard a scuffle upstairs and outside of the window and felt I was in the middle and witnessing some crime. My life was in danger if they saw me. I had seen something I wasn't supposed to and I was afraid to take a shower in my home...the shower was a huge room and in it I would be quite vulnerable being naked with the slippery tiles. It wasn't fear of sexual assault but more bodily injury if someone tried to beat me up. 02PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM An elderly couple have a severely handicapped son they are carers for. He is quadriplegic - paralysed in all four of his limbs. He is mentally handicapped, he cannot speak, communicate, or feed himself. He was born with this brain damage causing all his disabilities. The son is now an adult, whose quality of life is severely limited. His life is limited to being in a wheelchair while his parents look after him - their life has revolved around looking after him. The elderly couple's age is around 68-78; they are feeling their age, not sprightly and youthful. The lady has arthritic hands and knees and stiff painful joints, her mobility is affected and she finds it harder to move around and do everything, she moves slowly, with effort. It is a simple existence rather limited and they don't get out much. The son is cared for at home and this couple have to take care of everything, which limits what they can do. They are reliant on each other, this couple. It is their life. The elderly man's heart is under strain, as well as feeling he weight on his knees. He is a small man and feels he is shrinking as his bone structure ages. He has a flutter in his chest whenever he thinks about this situation, and has pangs of angina from any physical exertion. Everything feels like exertion nowadays. They are worried and fearful as they are increasingly aware of their aging bodies. They worry about what will become of their son, this poor afflicted immobile son, their dependent, whose life is so dependent on their ability to cope. 11PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM Saw a man helping an autistic man with a wheel chair into a car. I felt overwhelmed by emotion when I saw this. Felt sadness and empathy for the disabled man and became tearful. I entered into a supermarket and became acutely aware of other people who were physically challenged. I noticed a man in a wheel chair, someone in a mobility scooter and lots of frail elderly people. I was overwhelmed at how difficult everyday activities like shopping must be if you were physically challenged. I felt empathy for all of these people. On the way home from shopping I noticed a wheelchair ramp. 12PM 6 0:17:05 NS Of someone in a wheelchair. 12PM 7 XX:XX:XX DREAM Went to play \"Driving Miss Daisy\". It is about growing old and friendships and understanding people and their neuroses and loving them regardless. The woman in the wheelchair reminds me of my grandmother who is senile. She was so strong but now needs someone to wipe her chin. I cry during the performance (not unusual) for the suffering of human kind. Something about disorientation and agitated people makes me sad. It also reminds me of my uncle that I often go visit. He is so vulnerable and dependent. Growing old can be so sad and lonely. 02PF 8 XX:XX:XX IOS I ran into an actress I used to work with and look up to many years ago. I didn't think she'd remember me but she did. She was older than she should have been and she had a cane and wrinkles. She looked tired. I knew she had an autoimmune disease. I felt she was vulnerable and not happy. I told her I was studying homeopathy and felt proud that I'd moved on. She told me she had taken Rhus tox and we both felt the gravity of such a remedy, almost as if it were like chemo (poison)...heavy and stiff was the essence and that showed how much pain she was in. I sympathised. 02PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in the countryside. I was standing at the edge of a hill looking down into a dam, it was at a great height. There were powerful gusts of wind that wiped up the water in the dam creating white wash. the scale of all of this was enormous. I felt frightened by the expanse of water and of its depth, and of the isolated setting of the dam, There were no other people. I felt vulnerable and exposed against the power of a man made structure that supported so much frightening force. I was told that sometime the houses nearby were flooded by the dam. 12PM 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I think that during the proving there was a stronger than usual need to have my family and particularly my husband nearby-because he nurtures and cares for me. Imagining that he would stop loving me was like a complete disconnection from all that is good. 08PF 22 0:24:00 NS Head is a White tube with opening at top and my brain is exposed. 05PM XX:XX:XX DREAM I stood by the sea on my own for a bit just to say hello to it. I have a huge love and wonder for the sea. Instead the sea was black, swirling and menacing. I felt it was going to catch me in its swirls. I felt giddy by it. I tried to overcome the feeling because it was making me feel sad as well as threatened, as if something had changed in me so that I couldn't love the sea anymore. The feeling of menace remained and I had to go away from it. In the car I felt so giddy, falling asleep and a slamming feeling as I lurched awake. I felt sick. When we got home I tried to throw up but couldn't, just excessive salivating. I felt very sad. I blamed it on rich food and wine. My partner said later that both he and my daughter thought it was the proving. 01PF 29 XX:XX:XX NS Feel weak, slight giddiness, shaky and stomach bit tender. Ask partner to drive me to station to catch a train because I feel needy. 01PF 30 0:08:30 NS I was walking into the ocean from the shore line. There were two islands close to shore on the right and left of me. It was in the middle of the night and there were 2 or 3 people ahead of me walking into the water. We had communication devices so that we could talk under the water. I was concerned walking into the water because I wouldn't be able to see sharks and I was frightened I might be taken by one. The water was murky and visibility was limited as it was dark. As I swam under the water I told the others of my fear. Just as I did this a giant sea animal swam in front of me. It was an animal I hadn't seen before. It was crossed between a whale and something much more agile. At the same time I knew the animal was very intelligent, it was an authority in the water. As it swam past me I could see that it had caught a shark that was stalking me. It held the shark unharmed and alive between its enormous mouth. It swam away taking the shark with it. I didn't think it would kill the shark, it was just taking it away so that it wouldn't harm me. The animal was protecting me, looking out for me as I went along under the water following the others. 12PM 36 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am so stressed about the situation. I don't want it to be heading in the direction it's heading in. I'm so stressed by it. I can't deal with it. 11PF 53 XX:XX:XX ACCIDENTS, LOSS OF CONTROL, SOMETHING TRAGIC MIGHT HAPPEN Someone says the word seven and I hear severed which reminds me of the recent motorbike accident of my nephew who was six inches from having his leg severed off. I talked about how my sister had previously had a vision of a white dot in the distance coming rapidly towards her. My nephew was then hit by a motorcyclist in white leathers who came out of nowhere. The group discussion turned to the colour white and severance, also several encounters of car accidents and police lights. I have the feeling that something tragic might happen. 01PF 1 XX:XX:XX Stuck in traffic for ages because of a crash that has 3 ambulances and an incident unit fly past. Later there are a couple of ambulances too on the other side and another flies past me when I reach my destination. Later that evening the road is closed and there's a traffic jam. There are more ambulances and police cars. I must have seen more than 10 in 1 afternoon. 08PF 1 XX:XX:XX NS Go to pub in friends car - as drive out of College she gets sensation that her steering has gone strange and she has no control, describes it as \"wobbly and vibrating\". 06PF 1 0:20:25 NS Experience a tightening in body, exacerbated in chest. Strong need to get out and get home but how could I do it safely? Feel on edge and have a choice to live or die. Jittery sensation in body similar to having low blood sugar. I feel I need to open door carefully and peer out to make sure its safe. Risk of getting shot. Feel anxious and scared. Realise that getting home would be difficult so getting back to group would be a safer option. 06PF 3 0:08:00 NS Driving home I have at a sudden sense of precariousness. I never like driving on the motorway and always have a sense of the madness of all the cars going somewhere and a slight sense of danger. But the word that comes strongly and suddenly to mind is that its precarious. 08PF 3 XX:XX:XX NS My husband tells me that he nearly had a very nasty accident yesterday morning. He was driving along a main road at about 50mph when a tractor pulled out of a field gate onto the road ahead. The driver was an old man and just didn't look and my husband had to slam on the brakes and skidded lots. He said \"2 seconds later and I'd have been dead.\" 08PF 3 XX:XX:XX NS The driveway is littered with cars pulled over on the verge, apparently broken down or stalled. I've never seen this before. Several people cannot get in because their car or van wasn't working.11PF 3 0:19:00 NS Felt very uncomfortable and frightened as a passenger in a car when my husband accelerated and drove at slightly higher speeds on the motorway. Feel sensitive to speed of car. Any amount of acceleration frightens me, and I feel the fear in the front of my chest/trunk. 03PF 4 0:10:00 NS Driving home. Suddenly something big and hard hits my windscreen. I'm startled and aware suddenly of my heartbeat and then when its over I feel very precarious again and panicky. I have a sense that this remedy is precarious and that it invites accidents and I have fear that something bad will happen. There's something specific about road traffic accidents. I'm fearful for myself and for my family and I don't like it. I want to get back home where I feel safe and I want to gather my family around me. I feel the need to all be careful. 08PF 4 0:13:00 NS My son accidentally sprays petrol in his eye. In this much more real incident I'm much more calm (RS) and handle it well but I do feel like oh, my god, what's next? The whole feeling of the day is chaotic. Things coming at you and not being really in control. Also a sense that actually most of the things aren't that major but that I'm not coping with things as usual. I'm much more panicky, noticing little things and seeing them as presentiments. Foreboding. 08PF 6 0:10:30 NS Driving seemed thwart with difficulties and potential hazards: a complicated diversion, stuck behind a tractor cutting; an old lady who walked across the road without looking and then a strange noise under my car. I thought the tyre had gone and had to get out to check- but found nothing amiss. After that a tractor with a huge trailer in front of us hit the curb (twice) making the trailer wobble terribly. Writing about it afterwards it sounds melodramatic but at the time it felt scary and also bizarrely unreal that a short journey could have so many minor incidents. There's a strong sense still that something bad is going to happen and that there's something out to get me. I saw 2 police cars today, that's police cars and ambulances everyday since the proving started. I usually don't see them for weeks on end! The fear and sense of danger feels oppressive. I don't like it. Its starting to make me think twice before going out, particularly in the car. 08PF 06 18.00 NS I see a woman thrown out of a car. Her body hits the road and is flung about, limbs like a rag doll, until she comes to rest. She has blood over her and I can see her pain. She tries to raise herself up then dies. I then see a man walking along with blood wiped in stripes across his body. People walk by as if nothing is happening. It feels a bit dark. I feel like I'm watching all this, completely uninvolved and only slightly affected. 01PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM Walking through the city, I was aware of the large number of people walking around. I imaged what it would be like if a bomb went off. I thought about thousands of people running hysterically out of control and the danger this would present. I felt that there was no safe space, every step I made seemed to step into someone else, it was impossible to walk in a straight line. It was frustrating and I felt myself getting tense. There were so many people going in so many different directions all bumping into each other. Things felt volatile. Felt vulnerable and exposed. 12PM 8 0:18:22 NS A thought comes in to my mind that we will be involved in a car crash which may be fatal and its all linked to the remedy. I don't mind about me but don't think it should involve the children as they are too young. I'm not prepared to take risks. 06PF 9 0:06:15 NS I've noticed that I'm easily startled. Driving along there's a car with hand sticking out of the boot. I nearly jump out of my skin before my mind engages and I realise its fake. 08PF 10 XX:XX:XX NS Friend is having an operation this morning to staunch the blood flow in the brain. It dawns on me that the date is month 11 year 11 and the operation is at 11am. This friend had an obsession with 11:11 as some kind of cosmic gateway. I realise with a kind of chill of realisation that she has manifested a life or death 11:11:11:11:11 gateway for herself. Later I realize that I got completely mixed up over the dates of Friend's operation. It was 21.10.11 that's 10: not 11:11. 11PF 13 17.00 NS It comes to me that there are many things in everyday life that upset, disturb and even frighten me. This feels like a revelation to me, as I am usually unshockable, easy going, not someone who is easily thrown out etc. I do not feel able to be the tough, resilient one anymore. 03PF 13 00:21:30 AS My husband says, \"what have you got on your back?\". I jump out of my skin- I don't know what I think is on my back but its I assume its something unpleasant before I even think. Its straw which I've picked up from sitting on some bales earlier in the day. (The being startled is about assuming that something bad is happening and fits with earlier moods) 08PF 13 XX:XX:XX AS I looked up and saw a passenger jet flying low and coming in to land, but it was coming way too fast. I felt really concerned, things were out of control. Then the jet swooped up and began to do Ariel acrobatics. I was a little surprised and I watched for a while and moved on. 12PM 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM Driving when suddenly pictured wheel coming off car and wondered if would be possible to survive that sort of crash at speed. Considered whether it was possible to bring the car to a halt without its turning over in those circumstances. Put thoughts out of my head as wanted to escape from the horror of the picture of the car being out of control and did not want to imagine the outcome. 09PF 15 0:17:00 AS I woke up on behind the steering wheel of a car in the middle of a lane on a highway. I was a little disorientated and was trying to put the pieces as to how I had ended up in this surprising situation. I looked behind me and another car was directly behind me with a driver still asleep at the wheel. I felt a sense of urgency, I had to get off the highway because cars where driving past and I realised this was dangerous. I was like a sitting duck; an accident waiting to happen. I couldn't get the car started. 12PM 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM I really don't want to drive home. I wish I could leave my car and travel in the car with my partner. Driving back home, I feel very nervous and tense and drive very slowly in the slow lane. 07PF 24 XX:XX:XX NS Drove like a mad woman endangering myself and others in order to make a deadline. If I did have a horrible accident then at least they would feel guilty and it would validate my feeling of injustice for not letting me leave earlier. I could have been killed or killed someone but I felt it was more important to make it on time. I felt hard-done by. I arrived 1 minute before deadline. 02PF 25 XX:XX:XX NS An asteroid has whizzed past the earth in a narrow miss. That's how it felt driving 2 days ago. Cars were pulling out of side turnings without looking and people said it felt having narrowly missed being involved in the car pile up that led to a fireball. 11PF 27 XX:XX:XX Sensing something deep. Feeling of death and sadness. Feeling of dread, inevitability. Made me feel shaky and fractured. Wanted to cry. Felt sad for friend, didn't want her to suffer. I thought also about a recent bad car crash. After the initial shock it brought up some strange feelings in me. They seemed inappropriate because of the horror of it. I outwardly express horror but feel secretive because inside I was feeling something different. The fire and destruction felt like a catharsis, almost as if that would feel good and final, a burning out. A strong energy. The suddenness and violence. Cleansing by intense heat, turning to dust instantaneously. I felt as if I was there, as if I was drawn into it. 01PF 28 0:07:15 NS UP/DOWN, HEAVY/LIGHT I was sitting back in the moment with the proving group meditating during the succession of the proving remedy. Next moment there was water spraying out of the successed bottle around the proving group. I was then diving into an ocean and it was in the middle of the night back in my hometown. I was diving under the stars into the dark of the night and deep into the Indian ocean, then as I came back up I would leap into the air and up into to the universe. I then dove back into the water. I was detached whilst watching this in mind. 12PM 01 0:13:00 NS I dive underwater, plunging from a rocky cliff into a pool, the bowl of a waterfall. The water is bubbling with air bubbles. The pressure is intense, very dense. I feel this as a heaviness, a physical pressure, depth and distance. I dive down to an underwater cave carved out in the rock. I am aware that the rock has an electromagnetic charge or force. 11PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM Our principal is on top of a mountain, he has a print out of data, he lets the paper unfold (like an old-style computer printout of folded paper) and it is so long that it falls down entire the height/length of the mountain. He is jubilant to have all this data (on the proving). 11PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM It is very interesting subject matter but it's heavy stuff, too heavy to take it all in. I feel like I'm floating. I just want to space out and drift off. Usually I am clear-minded and responsive and I concentrate in class. But I can't stay attentive. 11PF 2 0:11:00 NS We are driving fast in an old fashioned VW beetle over hills in a city. As we came over the top of the hill the car would lift and then drop back onto the road as we descended down the hill. This caused a lifting sensation in the stomach, of lifting upwards into the air. 12PM 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM Recall an image of an animal and the word weasel. The animal was burrowing. 06PF 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM Woke feeling overwhelmed about family problems, got up and feel better when I have been 'under water'(as in shower). 09PF 6 0:06:00 RS In a team meeting but finding it difficult to stay still, keep getting up and feel more animated than normal. I'm not sure if my feet are always on the ground as I feel \"spacey\" and find myself treading heavily on carpet to check. At this stage I feel that I need to confess to colleagues that I have taken something and I don't feel grounded and may float off. 06PF 6 0:09:45 NS Feeling overwhelmed and weighed down by problems, and lacking in energy. 09PF 8 0:17:35 OS My mood is flat this morning, neither up nor down. I don't seem to be having the mood swings of earlier in the week. Seem much more stuck in tired, flat, heavy energy but also with this flittering mental focus too where its still hard to focus on tasks and be in the moment. It seems a bit of a paradox that I don't feel still and in the moment but neither do I have much energy. I don't enjoy Halloween as much as previous years. 08PF 8 XX:XX:XX NS My parents come to visit us at home and they seem very lively and energetic today. My mother doesn't stop talking for the whole time she is with us. Although they are both 80, they seem so much younger and full of life. My youngest son, who has also been somewhat subdued and quiet recently, is also more chatty and animated over the last few days. He has regained his sense of humour and is joking and being more playful around us. 07PF 8 0:16:00 NS I come across a middle-aged couple sitting on their veranda looking down over the hill. They are surrounded by high, bleak walls of houses to either side. I say what a shame they have to live with these and they reply that it's ok because, after a long struggle with the authorities, they're going to be pulled down. So I am pleased for them but then they show me the building site behind their back garden which will soon be full of modern houses. I look at all the beautiful nature that will disappear but feel quite distanced from their experience. 01PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM Feeling worried and anxious. Everything feels dark and heavy, like there's a heavy weight on my head and shoulders, and in my mind. My heart sinks when I think about where we live. I feel that there are so many heavy issues at the moment including the direction life is taking. I feel drained, empty and light headed. Tired and need to keep taking deep breaths. Day 18: Feeling really heavy in my mind and emotions. Everything feels depressive and down, like a dark cloud hanging around me. Whenever I think about work or any other kind of responsibility I fill with emotion, mainly sadness. I'm anxious and uneasy about the future. I'm worried about whether I can keep up with other life demands. Next day, I felt completely wiped out, exhausted to the core after what felt like the lowest part of a difficult day. Day 19: As I was paying I felt a sinking feeling, like the tension that I this had created began extending down towards the ground. I could feel the tension become grounded; I was stuck to the ground with it. Day 22: Felt very heavy, everything seemed dark and ominous. Day 36: Confidence is really low. I really drain myself and everything becomes black and heavy. Day 38: Everything in my life feels like it's weighted down. I question if I have the stamina and the strength to get through the next month. Day 42: Feeling exhausted, energy is so low. Just staring at things, can't engage with anyone in any way. Fed up, can't be bothered. Feeling like everything in my life is at some kind of an all time low 12PM 13 0:10:00 IOS During meditation I had a vision of my Guru. She said that I needed to learn to control and contain my energy which is a resource that lay within me with great depth. It was up to me to understand how to learn how to use and control this resource, that I couldn't be shown by someone, this must be done from within. She took me to a previous dream of a dammed valley filled with water and surrounded by mountains. She said that I needed to find the half way point located at the shore line of the dam. This would allow me to remain grounded so that I could reach towards mountain tops to draw from the resources that they held. This shore line position would also allow me to reach down into the depths of the dam and the resources that were held within me and which could then be distributed. The meditation left me feeling I had gone from being controlled by my external and internal processes to being in control from the centre of me. 12PM 14 0:13:07 NS Before the proving started my normal response to having lots of things to do would be to become more manic and to get on top of it but now I feel lethargic when thinking about what I need to do and can't be bothered. 06PF 14 0:07:00 NS There hasn't been much humour in this remedy at all 08PF 14 0:08:00 I noticed an expensive car. I began to worry about money and the lack of it. I felt mentally and emotionally heavy. There was a sensation of being weighted down. I questioned what it would be like to live in an expensive part of the city and to have lots of money and to not have to worry about finances. My focus was pulled to the looks on people's faces and what it was that they were wearing. I thought they looked mostly average and perhaps poor. This really got me down. I don't want to be surrounded by poverty, or people who don't care about life. I could feel my spirits get lower and I began to feel tired. 12PM 15 0:15:30 NS I have been experiencing this heavy vs light feeling. I noticed that a heavy looking book felt very light (in weight) when I picked it up. 11PF 16 XX:XX:XX NS Go for a shower. I'm feeling so much better than I have been - as if a weight has been lifted; more buoyant, altogether lighter. I've got enthusiasm and am looking forward to my day even the little jobs like picking up things the kids have left lying around the night before don't feel like any trouble. These are the things that have been weighing me down. (Prover fluctuates between these two feelings on and off throughout proving) 08PF 22 0:07:00 AS There's a numbness, a lack of feeling (except for fear)- just an emptiness, an absence. And with it complete self-loathing and worthlessness. Physically its expressed as sore tightness in the whole of the chest area and into the shoulders and neck. Oppression, not able to breathe fully and heaviness. Like its been clamped but clamped by a weight. (Next day 27): can see that if I can go deep down then I can also rise up high. If I can recognise the absence of joy and love and creativity then I can also feel and know their presence. 08PF 27 XX:XX:XX NS I was sitting in the passenger side of the car and we drove along the edge of a mountain top road that overlooked an enormous, deep lake. As we drove along the road it took us lower down the mountain side and closer to the edge of the lake. Next moment we were driving along side the lake, nearly at its water level. I looked out from the car and could see the dark water at the edge but underneath the water lay a white-yellowish stone that gave it a border around the entire edge of the lake. I could now see that the lake was natural and not man made. The water had a tannin colour that leached nourishment of the surrounding forest. I felt a belonging to the environment of the lake, there was a sense of connection. The next moment I was hovering in the air miles up looking down at the lake. Then with full force I began to plummet into the centre of the lake and as I hit the centre, water rushed up around the sides of me and flew up into the air for hundreds of metres. I had hit the lake so hard I had gone to the bottom of the lake and created a wall of water that was forced up into the air in an around me. I then looked up to what was a dark nights sky. I stood there and then leapt upwards towards the night sky and high up into the stratosphere. The experience surprised me but it felt natural and real. 12PM 27 XX:XX:XX DREAM As soon as I woke up today I felt completely different from when I went to bed last night. Last night I felt I just wanted to sleep and be still and quiet, and when my partner came in his energy was full and impactful. He was happy and light, but I was heavy and tired, and had no way of dealing with the intrusion other than just going to sleep. I snapped at him a few times when he went to hug me or said something to me as I was jolted from my sleep. I realized I hurt his feelings. As soon as I woke this morning I immediately apologized. 02PF 35 0:14:24 AS Supervisor came to me holding a wooden staff. She asked me to follow her. It was the evening and it was dark. We were at a beach and she dived into the ocean, I followed her. She swam down into the depths and as I followed her we then emerged on the surface of the water just off a deserted island. We swam to the shore and walked to the middle of the island. She looked at me and said that the answers were deep down in the middle of the island. She began to dig a hole in the ground and encouraged me to do the same. She was really enthusiastic about this and said that if I dug down really deep I would find what I was looking for. Next moment we were diving into the ocean, we were diving down and back up again. It was dark. I could see stars and everything had a blue black appearance 12PM 35 0:18:30 NS Within the space just over 24 hours I've heard the term Fire and Ice three times. 12PM 45 0:22:00 NS (Day 35): Woke up full of self loathing again. Feeling like my proving experience is completely invalid, like I'm a fraud. So intense. I feel really heavy and black about this, like it's the end of the world. (Day 41): Really getting tired of being in this state. Just feel low, pulled down and heavy. (Day 46) It feels dark, heavy and shameful. I want to distance myself from it as much as possible. I want to get away from it. 12PM 46 0:10:00 IOS Another forgotten relationship long distant rises to the surface of my memory. More old issues being released. 11PF 55 XX:XX:XX AS TIDE A sense that things are coming in waves. This morning I felt fairly normal on an emotional level and now I don't feel like my usual self at all. Physical and emotional symptoms are coming and going in waves. 08PF 4 0:13:00 NS Another strong wave of fear. An uncertain situation fills me with a sense of fear and foreboding. I feel helplessness but more fear than I would normally feel. The fear is felt in my upper chest (I usually feel fear as butterflies in my stomach). Concomitant with the fear is nausea and the dithery feeling again. We have no control over it. Its ours and yet not ours. I can't focus on any one task- even little tasks like sorting the washing, sweeping the floor are difficult. I find myself, for example, sweeping the same bit of floor twice. My thoughts and focus is flittering all over the place. I can't hold them and have to keep checking what I've done/ am doing. It has a fast, busy, fleeting, flittering energy that makes me think of buzzing insects. With this there's a haziness and heaviness again in my head. I feel really uncomfortable with this energy because it feels like massive regression. The intensity of fear and flittering starts to pass- like a wave again. As the emotion diminishes so does the nausea. By the afternoon, I feel just like my usual self. Bizarre because it felt so intense this morning. 08PF 5 XX:XX:XX NS Feel really happy this morning, laugh with kids and little things make me smile. The mood is light, easy. I hope that the provings swinging to a happy/light place now! Three hours later, I have another strong, intense mood swing, Very sudden. I sit on my bed and a big sigh and the heavy feeling is there again. I'd like to crawl back into bed and stay there. I feel tearful. A sense that nothing lasts. Nostalgia. Something bad could happen any moment and wipe it all away. The happiness, the love, the good things are all very precarious. We have to be very careful. Concomitant with this I'm aware of a sense of heaviness in my forehead again. Noticing the weather which in the last 2 days seems to match my mood swings. One moment sunny and then short, sharp bursts of rain. 08PF 6 XX:XX:XX NS Most children (if not yet overly controlled by controlling parents) are in the wave energy form. Pure energy and movement is how they experience and express themselves in life. So many adults are in the dot mode as we become increasingly focused on our life roles. Aware of being observed, of our role, of the right behaviour. Very few adults even dance after teenage / twenties. Maybe if we dance, do art, walk in nature, laugh naturally with friends, not forced- we can glimpse this wave. Maybe surfers catching a wave to surf. Often not even in the best possible opportunity life offers us, when we are looking after our children, who are in pure wave. 11PF 8 0:08:30 I really enjoyed myself, laughing till my face hurt, and surprised myself by eagerly getting up to dance without needing a few drinks. I had a lot of energy to expend. This energy felt very child-like and free; I was demonstrating how some children dance so fast with so much energy and completely out of time. I felt like a crazy ball of escalating energy and I felt very light too. Only a massive hot flush stopped me. This feeling is familiar, but usually a heavier more intense feeling; this feeling was lighter. I usually have to suppress it because it's completely inappropriate or uncool. 01PF 15 XX:XX:XX AS Coastal region with sand dunes and tracks running through. There are beach huts where young people are hanging out. I don't belong but it feels ok, I'm passing through. I'm then much higher and looking down at the layout of the land. There are inlets and raised areas so that the coastline is quite intricate. The sea starts having a big surge and the water pushes up against the shore line, smacking into the sides and creating big splashes and sprays of water. It does this repeatedly. I see a golfer on top of a green hillock continuing to play golf despite the hazard. The water keeps enveloping him and then receding. He tries to cling to the grass but it has become wet and slimy so he's slipping around on it. After several waves he disappears. I see a woman walking by and I cry out to her to tell her what has happened but we can't do anything. 01PF 9 XX:XX:XX I really feel like I'm not proving anymore and wasn't yesterday either: that its stopped suddenly. (In hindsight I think I was still in the thick of it. I don't want to be proving and I don't want to write the diary so its easier not to pay my emotional Sx too much attention .Every time I say that I feel like the proving is receding (also Day 20, 23, 25) I seem to get sucked back in, sinking a little deeper and darker.) 08PF 13 XX:XX:XX I had the image of an enormous vacuum cleaner tube sucking me up, presumably never to appear again in my present form. A sensation of having no control and of nobody being able to help me. I feel a sense of abandonment in my chest and diaphragm. I want to put my hands there to try to protect myself. 09PF 15 0:16:30 NS The distant far away feeling is even more exaggerated, memories arising from times when things changed in my life; merging with myself as I was then and now. It's very deep and labile. Like waves and fluidity and realigning something in myself. I become aware of how you are never unchanged by any relationship. 11PF 19 XX:XX:XX AS I'm swimming in a large rock pool by the sea with friends. In the distance we see a tidal wave coming in and overwhelming people as they try to run away. I'm in the pool watching it happen but also seeing it happen from above. I see a young male surfer overwhelmed as well. The rock pool environment feels separate from the environment that they are in. 01PF 19 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was led into a wooden cave I am unsure where we are going. Quite humoured by situation. A basement with a shallow cement wading pool. There are waves as the water comes in from a tube and it sounds like waves splashing on the rocks in a sea. There are deckchairs around it and some rafts bobbing in the water, trapped in a small corner due to the waves. We sat around this area of deck chairs. I felt amused and impressed that it existed indoors and underground. 02PF 26 XX:XX:XX NS My partner was driving, it was hot and dry. Everything looked arid and there were vast baking open spaces of desert sand. We turned right onto a bridge where we came to a standstill because the traffic had banked up. As we sat in the car on the bridge we looked down below and could see that the bridge crossed over many other bridges that crossed over each below. The next moment the water began to quickly rise up from below and immerse over the lower bridges. As it rose we quickly shut off the vents and windows to ensure no water would come in. There was a sense that this was a temporary flood but there was a deep sense of urgency that this flood of water may be much stronger than we anticipated. I felt panicked, unsure and overwhelmed. 12PM 26 XX:XX:XX DREAM I feel a need to get on with things. I have work to do. Somehow space has filled the space! The solid bits are chunking up. I'm cleaning the house against a tide of mess, while hoping to manifest the finances for a cleaner to whoosh it back to one step ahead instead of so many steps behind. 11PF 27 0:08:00 A tidal wave was coming into the shore. Next moment there were a series of rolling waves followed by white wash. I dived under the tidal wave and thought that I could perhaps avoid being caught up in any of the devastation. I was aware that I could drown and that I needed to sustain my energy, so that I could ride out something with enormous potential to overpower me. At the same time I knew I'd needed to maintain my energy for the duration of a number of waves that were still to come. When I came up from under the water I could see more waves coming. There was a sense that this was an extraordinary set of circumstances, that things were out of my control. Despite this I could see that it was a beautiful sunny day. There was beautiful white light reflected off the whitewash and foaming bubbles. Even though I was stuck in a tidal wave I thought I was going to give this a go. Against the odds, I knew I could possibly come out alive. 12PM 28 XX:XX:XX DREAM We've been visiting an island- just off the mainland and separated from it by a narrow channel like a river. But the tide is out and the channel is dry and sandy with big 'rock/sand pools'. Great place for kids to play. When the tide comes back it will be an island again. The island itself is charming. Its a lovely sunny day and we're on the sand in the channel and I'm with family. All of a sudden a massive wave comes along the channel- not like the tide coming in which would be much more gradual but a sudden massive surge of water like a tidal wave. It sweeps me (and everyone else) away. I'm struggling under water for a while, can't breathe and think this is it- I'm going to die. But I don't die- I survive and I'm floating on the surface. I'm just floating, feeling nothing. I can see the shore quite close but I've no impulse or energy to swim to it. Just floating in suspended nothingness. This floating feeling exemplifies the flatness of the proving. I wake up thinking that I've survived- that its a healing dream, but there's no joy to this survival because I'm left suspended in the nothingness and can't save myself (and therefore heal myself) properly because I can't swim to shore). 08PF 29 XX:XX:XX DREAM I feel like crying. I keep getting waves of extreme exhaustion. 06PF 52 0:17:00 FLOW/BLOCKED FLOW I was woken up by a distinct sensation of running water. In the dream I was urinating in my bathroom and the sensation of flowing water/fluid was very clear and real, so when I woke I thought I must have wet the bed, but there was no physical fluid in reality and everything was dry. 03PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM I felt as if it is easier to express my needs without the usual resistance or hardship I feel from others with stronger personalities. It is all flowing and connected. Continues through to day 9. 02PF 4 XX:XX:XX CS Feel like I have hit a wall - I do not feel able to have any more experiences. Had no dreams and have no unusual sensations today. 03PF 8 0:08:00 NS We go for a walk in the fresh air. It's very blustery, the wind blows cobwebs from our minds. 11PF 11 XX:XX:XX I empty rainwater out of a picnic cooler box that was left outside by previous visitors. The water is stagnant, it stinks as it goes down the drain. The host's child says her mother will be upset by stinking water in the drain by the back door, so I sluice it out with household cleaner. The stinky smell wafts back up the drain. 11PF 12 00:2:00 I've opened all the windows to let all traces of the old out and the fresh air in. 11PF 14 0:15:00 Awoke in the dark and all of yesterday's information flooded in. 09PF 15 0:05:15 NS There's no creativity in my approach to every day things. The feeling is thick- stuck in a mire of thick, dull, gooey, sludgy nothingness! May be now, finally that I've recognised this it can turn. (This optimism reoccurs- keep thinking or hoping proving might end and that things will get better even at worst) 08PF 16 XX:XX:XX NS There is a leak in the drainage pipe. The flexible connecting pipe has been eaten away by rats so there's a gap in the pipework- the sink is not connecting to the drain. There's a muddy swamp under the floor boards and it stinks. We're amazed we haven't smelt it earlier. Its pretty disgusting. Next day: At last I realise I'm in a state of shock over the leak. I can't get the image out of my head. I feel as if the mirrored my state of mind- no flow, can't connect so a 'mire' has been created in me. 08PF 20, 00:01.00 NS I'm not making mistakes in typing so much. In retrospect it was as if there was no flow from my brain to my hand- or at least the flow was more corrupted/broken than usual. 08PF 21 XX:XX:XX Get out of the shower and can't turn the tap off. I call a friend who's a plumber. This is the second plumbing issue in a few days. Next day: The house is very hot because the boiler isn't working properly- the hot water isn't working at all. No flow, too much flow again!! 08PF 24 0:08:00 NS Feeling shaky today. My daughter's father comes over. He is being confrontational. I don't want him here. I want to cry and cry. I feel claustrophobic and become intensely aware that my flat has filled up with bits of furniture and wood to make a bed. The sitting room is full of my daughter's stuff that has to be unpacked. I have to move the chaos to access the wall socket. I want to drive away in my car but the battery has gone completely dead. I find my daughter in her bedroom crying and I really want to cry too but I can't. 01PF 27 XX:XX:XX NS I'm in a massive, beautiful old house full of antique furniture from all over the world including lots of intricate ornaments and china. The place is falling apart. Family friend is there alone with her maid. It's empty but full of stuff and the atmosphere is heavy and oppressive because everything is so old and stagnant. There is a smell of mould. The feelings of nostalgia can be overwhelming if I find myself sitting in a room there, on my own, for too long. 01PF 28 XX:XX:XX DREAM The outdoor bathing area is being pulled down and a new one has been installed indoors. It's modern and very styled, like a swimming pool changing room. The water pours out of a deep metallic blue metal shape. It's a bit like an elongated hairdresser's drying hood. The water pours out rather than gently trickling like the outdoor water feature. It's a dark place and not very friendly. 01PF 30 XX:XX:XX DREAM I have a strong desire to be outdoors, to walk in the fresh air. Inside is claustrophobic. Stomach feels in knots and I feel quite nauseous at times. 06PF 36 0:10:15 NS The sound track is the sound of a dripping tap. I can understand why people seek distractions. I rarely feel so flat. This is unlike me. It is much more down to earth. It doesn't have the sense of spaciousness or scope of the cosmic 'bigger picture' or the immensity and potency that could be unleashed. It is a closed-off sealed-in feeling. Stale. Small town. 11PF 38 XX:XX:XX NS PRESSURE READY TO BURST I just want to stop all of this processing. It was an effort to try and point out the fact that things are always so heavy. I feel overloaded, heavy, intense and tired. I've reached saturation point. 2 hours later: I was putting everyone on notice. I wasn't in the mood for behaviour that led us around circles or challenged my short fuse. I wanted things to remain focussed and had no tolerance otherwise. 12PM 3 0:11:00 NS My mood is black. I'm tired, heavy, weighted down, as if I'm made from lead. I am feeling mentally and emotionally volatile, like I will explode if anything over-stimulates me or gets in my way. I started throwing containers around violently to make a statement. I had to close the door to try and centre myself. I wanted to blame him. I had no energy to deal with this situation. I felt intense and angry, I wanted to hit something. I felt better being alone and for strong tea. 12PM 6 0:08:45 NS I woke up with a song playing in my mind which staying with me for hours after waking. It was a 1970's pop rock song by Jigsaw called \"Blown it all sky high.\" This song had been in the background of my mind for a few hours in my sleep before I woke up. 12PM 7 0:08:00 NS I was telling someone \"I just want this balloon to pop/burst\" 02PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM Talked to mother and she asked how I was. As soon as I began to tell her she cut me off and told me of a relative who had a mastectomy. I felt dismissed, invalidated, hurt that she couldn't hear me and that she didn't been bothered to take time to listen. I cut her off and told her I had to go. She knew she'd hurt me but I couldn't bridge anything for her. It felt like I was on an edge and that I needed to burst or reveal something. I felt a welling sensation. My emotions were pushing at the edge. My emotions began to pump to just below the surface. It's like a force comes through me and channels my focus with intensity. I can't pull these back, they want to come out and so I have to give over to what they need. I have no control over this, no matter how hard I try. I feel like something is welling up inside me with pressure and force. There is enormous gravity to this. I feel upset and unsettled. 12PM 11 0:11:34 NS Feeling really tired, especially behind my eyes. Feel heavy, tired, strained. Behind all of this feels like there is a bank of emotion inside me, welling up inside ready to burst. 12PM 13 0:09:45 Next day: Feeling worried and anxious. Everything feels dark and heavy, like there's a heavy weight on my head and shoulders, and in my mind. My heart sinks when I think about where we live. I feel that there are so many heavy issues at the moment including the direction life is taking. I feel drained, empty and light headed. Tired and need to keep taking deep breaths. I feel as though there is a well of emotion inside me, like I want to sob or lash out at something in a violent rage. It feels like I'm going to burst. (This feeling repeats itself through the proving) Day 22: Things just seem to keep mounting up in terms of the stresses and worries. We seem to be working continuously without a break and we don't seem to be getting ahead. It feels heavy and full. Day 27: I feel as though things are beginning to overwhelm me. I don't know where to start to get a sense of order back and I feel a lack of support. Order is really important to me at the moment because I feel like things are falling apart. My day hasn't even begun and I am burning out already. I feel intense and on the edge, like I'm going to erupt with rage. I have to force it back down to control myself. 12PM 27 XX:XX:XX IOS My partner and I have a minor disagreement and I burst into tears. I am very emotional today. It's as if all my emotions are on the surface at the moment. 07PF 22 0:15:00 NS I feel very restless and cannot settle to anything. I have a bubbling sensation inside me as if I'm about to erupt in some way. I feel restricted and trapped as if I need to escape although I'm not sure what from. 07PF 32 0:19:00 NS Walking home my mind is filled to the brim with all the pressures and worries that my partner and I experiencing. At the same time, I am acutely aware of the beauty of the natural environment at the same time. Mind wanders from all encompassing heaviness of my problems to the lovely damp wintery days. 12PM 28 0:16:00 NS I feel as if my outburst over the weekend has helped to clear things and I feel much lighter and less weighed down by old emotions, which I have suppressed. 07PF 36 0:19:00 NS CONFRONTATION: BRING TO LIGHT/HIDE UNDER CARPET Although I felt very mellow a things upset me and so I don't think I can have been as mellow as I thought I was. Another resident came and told us off for being too noisy when she was trying to sleep. She was really rude and it seemed very unreasonable. I can't think we were being very loud and it was quite early. But I was quite put out by it and felt quite agitated.. Although the woman who told us off was rude and unreasonable I didn't want it to happen again. I wanted to conform. 08PF 1 XX:XX:XX NS Someone not part of our group came down from her room in her dressing gown to tell me to be quiet at half past 9 in the evening. She said she might have to phone for assistance. Why is she so important that she has to impose her will on others. I was not apologetic. I felt indignant and my reaction was far more aggressive than usual, usually I might feel sympathy for her situation. 04PM 1 0:21:30 NS I felt compelled to revisit a relationship problem which had obviously, not quite been put to bed but must have been 'simmering' and had remained unresolved. Wept and became very upset. 09PF 2 0:16:30 NS I have a visual flash of reality, a hurtful situation I'll have to deal with when I get back home. I collapse inward like a dot to cope with it. My physical posture is to go into a ball, head tucked down to my tummy, arms and shoulders collapsed inwardly. 11PF 3 0:15:00 NS I couldn't believe that I was being so forthright, but I didn't care. I felt I had to make these differences clear otherwise they would assume I was okay about working in such a way. I felt intense that I had to stand up for myself. Shortly after I wanted to cry, but felt that if I cried I would be vulnerable and I didn't want this. 12PM 3 0:17:00 NS I am in a restaurant with two of friends. After the meal, we go to the cash desk to pay the bill, however, the bill is slightly more expensive than we expected. I am happy to pay it but one of the other students becomes very irate and refuses to pay. She is arguing and demanding to see the manager. I am very embarrassed and just want to pay the bill and leave, but no-one listens to me and they keep arguing. 07PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM In the middle of dithering I decide to phone about a mattress I ordered 8 weeks ago which should have been delivered after 4 weeks. This morning I leave a really assertive message saying exactly what I want to happen. Result-its being delivered in 2 days. Here's the contrast again between dithering and assertive action. 08PF 5 0:09:30 Feeling irritable (old self) because family member complains very loudly to the staff of a restaurant we are dining in. All the patrons can hear. I feel embarrassed to be associated with her (we look alike and are dining together). This is not a new feeling but a return of my normal state. It is accompanied by a very bright, warm room which increases my agitation. I lost my appetite for breakfast and felt nauseas. I craved a drink to self-medicate. I fear that my old self is coming back. I feel annoyed to be part of a unit with her and feel restricted and pressured, dominated by the relationship and not free to do as I please. I want to tell her to be quieter, nicer, less argumentative with the staff as they are people too. She is completely unaware of the impact she makes on others experiences. I feel fortunate that after the breakfast incident the rest of the morning we are separated. I lounge by an indoor pool all alone. It is peaceful and I can reflect on how I am feeling. 02PF 7 0:09:45 IOS I went to a meeting about a delicate negotiation that was potentially a legal dispute with a state of mind where a peaceful resolution for all concerned was the highest possible outcome of the meeting. Afterwards I was sent notes of the record from our meeting, but the notes were not accurate. Crucial things were omitted and some details in the statement were incorrect. I was not emotionally triggered by it, I didn't feel upset. Nor was I challenging or angry or any of those ways of reacting which can set things off to an argument. I felt very cool and clear that things should be dealt with transparently. It felt necessary to set the record straight. It was done without worrying about it. I sent it in the spirit of peaceful resolve, without quivering weakness I'd had before our meeting. 11PF 7 XX:XX:XX NS Had bath in near darkness but dawn outside. Putting light on at that time of the morning does not work with me, it is too harsh. Into my mind came the feeling surrounding the 03.00am phone call received from the hospital just over two years ago to tell me that my aunt had died. It felt as if it had just happened. Wept. 09PF 8 0:06:15 OS Put the light on in the bathroom to brush my teeth. Never do this, preferring to avoid switching lights on in the morning even when it's quite dark. Switch it off again. 01PF 8 0:07:00 NS Two men sat next to us at a pub and I sensed something wasn't right about them. They looked dirty and untrustworthy. I was worried they would steal something. My friend began to talk to them. One of the men was really rude. He was insulted that she seemed confused about his country of origin. I could see that the actual confusion stemmed from the fact that they couldn't hear what each other was saying. My friend tried to smooth things over with him. I then detached my attention from my partner and friend and then turned and focussed on the man. I asked him why he felt it necessary to insult my friend. I felt a rush of blood and my mind and senses became dilated. I was prepared to use violent force if necessary. Part of me wanted him to take it to a violent level. I put a magazine up to block him, pushing him back down without touching him. All this time I felt controlled and aware of my processes. Part of me felt liberated. By this time my friend was forcibly restraining me as I was leaning into the man. The man got up and returned with a security guard. The man demanded some sort of justice but the security guard did nothing. We then sat in a stand off with the man. I knew we wouldn't move, he was wrong and we were right, so we had to stand our ground and show we were on top. 12PM 8 0:20:00 NS Feel generally more like myself today. But have felt that I can't be bothered to write my diary so that feeling is still there. I've really had to make myself write it. I can't be bothered. Don't feel like I've got a lot of motivation or get up and go. 08PF 9 XX:XX:XX Two men are walking down the high street looking for something they want. I think I may have that thing. I am carrying a phone and if they get my phone they might get information that I have that thing. I walk past them hoping they don't see my phone and look for somewhere to hide it. The lead is only so long and I need to find a place before the length runs out. I know they suspect me and I feel afraid because they are really menacing. 01PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM Feeling a bit down and unable to do the things I need to do. I eventually make myself start and then I become totally absorbed. 01PF 11 XX:XX:XX I'm working in a school. My Head of Faculty picks up on an incident that happened a few years back involving another member of department and a child. I'd been Head of Department at the time and the incident was dealt with- I felt properly- by myself and the former Headmaster. I don't understand why the Head of Faculty is bringing this up all these years later. 08PF 12 XX:XX:XX DREAM I don't want to be pushed, I'm tired. I just want it to stop so that I can hide away. 12PM 11 0:12:00 NS Had an argument with partner over money. I'm in the dark and don't know what we have and what we don't have. This makes me feel financially disempowered. I am then forced to bury my concerns. Deep down I feel guilty about money, particularly about my lack of income. Told partner that he was unfair but he blocks me out. His comments left me feeling like I'm flapping in the wind. I have no power to help take control or rectify this situation. I stood my ground and didn't back down, he was being unfair. Once I started talking about it I wanted to get to the bottom of it, I couldn't let it go. 12PM 11 0:20:00 NS I visit my parents and as soon as I arrive they start telling me how concerned they are about my sister and I not contacting each other recently. Although they are calm and reasonable, I feel very defensive as if I have to justify myself to them. I had been feeling guilty about not having contacted my sister recently. 07PF 12 0:17:00 NS Normally I'm passive and crumble into a nervous and exhausted wreck with lots of crying after he comes over. This time I am assertive. I demand to be allowed to react to what he says and I am not afraid to let his agitation and anger escalate when I refuse to just listen. Normally afraid because I think it will send him over the edge. I want to communicate with him. It's imperative I calm him down because I want to protect my daughter from further suffering. I am very clear about all these things and stay calm, I don't crumble. I feel I'm also being effective in calming him down. When he leaves I have a momentary collapse into crying and then the moment goes and I feel free to go for a walk in the sun. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX AS Keep rationalising that I'm tired and run down. I feel like I need a rest or a break but can't force myself to address this. 12PM 14 0:13:20 NS I feel I have to lock myself away in our flat. I have an aversion to running into neighbours or to use the common spaces that we share. There is a collective force or energy that stagnates in the building and within people. I don't feel the other people who live here have good intentions, they all seem so selfish and counterproductive. There is no friendliness and cohesion and this really upsets me. I sense an uneasy tension whenever I walk out my front door and I get in and out of my flat and the block as quickly as possible. 12PM 15 0:16:00 AS Feeling very anxious about visit to hospital. Keep trying to push it to the back of my mind. 09PF 16 00:20:15 NS He's not coming back into my house. It was almost easier to ignore my feelings of disquiet than say \"don't come back\". Regardless of what is 'real' or not, I know the right thing to do is to keep the boundary of what I want or don't want to have in our home. I've formulated what is behind my reluctance. I feel as though dealing with this situation has resolved an old situation for me that was a recurring theme during my childhood and young adulthood. My mother was plagued by similar worry and doubt yet her paralysis in panic overruled her taking steps to safeguard our safety. We didn't feel safe as children in our own home. This remedy proving is helping to clear old ghosts. 11PF 16 0:12:00 CS Why have I made such heavy weather of these big decisions in the past few months? I had to speak out; but it wasn't easy. It has been a journey, having to do it without confrontation but to speak the truth and to bring it to light, so that the situation can be resolved for those involved. Another dispute is negotiated and resolved. 11PF 16 XX:XX:XX I start ranting about how the Church is having to consider the potential benefits to be gained from supporting the Occupy encampment. How the cycle may return to when the Church ruled the country. How the country may look to the Church as their leader. It's all crazy stuff and I feel slightly crazed thinking and ranting about it. My daughter gets cross and indignant with me. I walk out in a huff. I feel a strong urge to go to the encampment. It all feels really significant. 01PF 17 XX:XX:XX NS A man comes and sits with us and talks, without stopping, about his politics. After some time my back starts to stiffen up and I want to move. I don't know when he is going to stop. I then tell him politely that I've had enough information and my head is full and I can't hear anymore and so we part company agreeably. I don't feel nervous about telling him; I feel calm, assured and guiltless. I apologise but only out of politeness. I have never been able to do this before. 01PF 18 XX:XX:XX NS I can't believe that we've been living with this under the floor boards and missing all the signs, not taking enough notice. Its as if I haven't been connected enough and present enough to really see what's been going on and /or just pushing the signs to the back of my mind so that I don't have to confront them. All of this is very intense in the early hours of the morning. I shed lots of tears and gradually the tension of the day starts to dissolve and I finally get back to sleep. 08PF 20 0:01:00 NS History is whitewashed and falsified by the perspective of a ruling order and entire cultures can make themselves believe this is the truth - it's the position that a culture takes on. My belief about what's true is at odds with the way councils and governments operate. We don't really mind or do anything about it, we just know it's not how we'd choose to do it. Shopping malls, widescreen TV, computer games are the opiates of the masses. Bless the bold lady with no mattress who is camping out at the protest. She's whistling into the wind. But bless her for having the courage of her convictions and for doing her futile task with such good humour. 11PF 20 XX:XX:XX In a bedroom closet. My mother in law is hovering over my shoulder chatting to someone. I notice a notebook and I open it. Its my late husband's handwriting and I recognize the book as a diary of his. I close it quickly as I do not want my mother in law to see it lest she have an emotional \"incident\". The feeling is of avoidance of an uncomfortable situation. 02PF 21 XX:XX:XX DREAM At a friend's flat who I have fallen out with. I needed to eat a plate of raw meat, thin slices of carpaccio. It made me feel ill (I am a vegetarian) but I wanted to eat it before it went bad. I had to complete this task. I was trying to get out of the house before my ex-friend got back. I didn't want her to know I was there. I felt afraid she would catch me there unannounced. It was easier to sneak out than to tell her I was coming. I had to do this for some project. My friend pulled up and I knew I was caught. I started formulating an excuse for her finding me in her flat. I didn't want to see her. 02PF 22 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm a bit bored by work. I'm also railroaded, into agreeing to give up some free time to work unpaid. I'm really not happy about this but am not assertive enough to say- its as if it happens without my full attention- like a haze and I haven't been able to say what I really think. 08PF 22 XX:XX:XX NS Dropping being so judgmental is why I was able to feel reconciliation with friends I'd been avoiding. Now I think, \"this doesn't concern me, it's none of my business\". I remember why I like them and I felt how much these friends like me. Time to move on from the disagreement. (Later): It was a reconciliation; it felt as if the stress and difficulties have been resolved and we have reconnected. I think this remedy has a stabilising influence. There is enough distance not to get worked up about it. 11PF 27 XX:XX:XX CS I am now suffering from stress and anxiety relating to being bullied by the company. This is indicative of my core condition and a strong sign that the proving has finished for me. My reaction is more defiant though, rather than feeling desperate I feel more like fighting. I will take legal advice and stand up to them. 04PM 25 XX:XX:XX AS Didn't manage the cup of tea. Didn't manage to move off the settee in fact. I can manage the routine somehow but not anything more that's demanded. I feel my diary doesn't express at all how bad its been. I've been in low lying depression for weeks (and obviously its not weeks) and that all the time there's been troughs from the flat. I've just ignored it, brushed it under the carpet so that it was hidden. Even in my diary I've hidden how bad its been. But underneath the flatness there's been something much worse- a complete absence of connectedness and of love. With that comes self-loathing. I feel as if its been lurking there, only partially acknowledged, in the shadows, trying to catch up with me and that it finally has. I've no impetus to even move today. I need to confront it head on but don't know how. I made an appointment to see my homeopath. I suggested next week but must have sounded quite desperate because he's made an appointment for tomorrow.08PF 26 00:11:00 NS I feel that yesterday morning I finally saw what's at the bottom of the proving- the ultimate darkness of it. Since then I've been able to reach out for help and explain to a few people what's been happening. Its as if I've acknowledged and confronted it at last. Now I feel ready to take my own remedy and leave it behind. 08PF 27 XX:XX:XX It is gratifying to stand up and challenge them; clear and strong and resolute. What went on is coming to light to be cleared and recompensed. It doesn't trigger my place of \"vulnerability\". It is very clear. Very strong. Very right. Nothing has felt so clear in a long while. 11PF 27 XX:XX:XX NS Momentary feeling of wanting to cry. Comes in my throat then goes away. I don't want to cry because I don't want to go to that place. 01PF 28 0:06:45 I get very angry with my partner over something which I would normally not mention to him. He has done something which he didn't tell me about and I get very annoyed. I accuse him of deliberately hiding things and being secretive about his life, when he is supposed to be part of a family. I am surprised at how annoyed I am and realise that I am shaking and trembling. Afterwards, I am surprised at the strength of my reaction and quickly calm down. 07PF 29 0:08:30 NS I'm slightly freaked by a few things but rising to them in a way that is new to me. 11PF 30 XX:XX:XX Our opponent is raising the stakes in our dispute. That means we'll have to raise the stakes too, possibly by going to court. It will expose an abusive situation that has been covered up. The truth is coming out. I consider carefully if I am still \"working in the light\" in integrity. I wanted to protect the community from this so I have done it as discreetly as possible. I feel unemotional about it, but sad that they haven't chosen the path of compromise, discretion and community that we offered. And also sad that we won't be able to stay on good terms and keep the happier side of the connection. Perhaps it was naive to think we could do that. It's a dark truth and I've shone a torchlight on it and said No! to it when others turned a blind eye. I feel clear about what we are saying No! to, the adult cover up of this bullying of children. The grief, trauma and confusion this summer as the world as we knew it collapsed from under us and around us, and all the worry and anxiety about what to say and what to do next, is all in the past. 11PF 32 XX:XX:XX NS Some people are painting their office. They are covering the first layer of paint, which is black, with another layer of very, very dark brown which almost looks black. They have been told to do so because the black is unacceptable. 01PF 33 XX:XX:XX DREAM Memories of old traumas have been cleared out. Some of these were dark and frightening. They have come to light and been cleared away. Having experienced this calm way of dealing with things, maybe I will be able to absorb it into me. 11PF 34 XX:XX:XX CS At home feeling constricted. I don't want to leave but I am not happy inside. I feel isolated, shut off from the world. I realize now that I thought I loved solitude but realistically it is an unhealthy way to withdraw and escape from resistance and conflict. I want to clarify my problems/challenges in order to push through them to the other side instead of sitting there with them on the other side of my protective walls. 02PF 34 0:23:00 AS Acknowledged I have managed to almost suppress the fact that I'm diagnosed with a serious disease. On one hand I'm completely accepting of my individual approach to my health. On the other hand I have learnt to become so sensitive to other peoples potential opposition that I have learned to keep it contained and hidden for fear of confrontation. 12PM 35 0:09:45 NS At a school meeting at Son's new school. Don't agree with what is being said so I challenge the teacher. Normally I would not do this, but tonight I felt strongly that I needed to get my point across. Afterwards I felt pleased with myself! 06PF 33 0:20:00 NS At work, could feel myself getting frustrated with colleagues who had a different opinion of an issue. Had to make an excuse to leave the office to get some space. Felt very crappy. I feel as if I can't talk to anyone about what has happened, as it reflects badly on me. 06PF 44 0:09:00 IOS Haven't been able to cry because have felt unaffected, distant from the situation. After phone call can feel tears coming but they don't. Eventually decide to get advice and support and then can't stop crying. 01PF 45 0:16:00 AS (Day 35): Woke up full of self loathing again. Feeling like my proving experience is completely invalid, like I'm a fraud. So intense. I feel really heavy and black about this, like it's the end of the world. (Day 41): Really getting tired of being in this state. Feel low, pulled down and heavy. (Day 46) Dark, heavy and shameful. I want to distance myself from it, I want to get away from it. 12PM 46 0:10:00 IOS Part of me thinks, duck out. Go underground, don't engage with it. 11PF 55 XX:XX:XX She came back because she didn't want to leave it on bad terms after arguing. This is a big reconciliation by her. I've never seen her back down or reconcile before. She is normally very fixed once she makes up her mind or takes against something. I am glad we've made our peace. 11PF 53 XX:XX:XX Another forgotten relationship long distant rises to the surface of my memory. More old issues being released. 11PF 55 XX:XX:XX Felt really heavy and weighted down about my feuding neighbours. Looked out the window as it had been stormy over night. Next moment black clouds came over and it became very dark. Then the wind picked up and began to blow really hard. There was a clap of thunder and stroke of lightening at the same time and then the wind blew on a horizontal angle. There was a gush of sheet rain along with leaves and debris. The wind roared. I looked out the window after hearing a loud crack and watched a 35 metre tree fall to the ground. Within in minutes the wind had completely stopped, the clouds disappeared and it was a beautiful clear, sunny day. I went outside and checked on the damage. The fallen tree had narrowly missed two adjoining properties by inches. I was surprised at how much light now fell into the garden. (One of the conflicts with the neighbours was to get this tree taken down before it fell, as the inside had been weakened by a fungus... but they had refused.) 12PM 59 0:09:20 NS A neighbour made a number of rude comments to my partner. She held him responsible. I interjected and talked right over her. I can't believe that she thinks she is some way an authority over us. Decided I'd had enough of these people meddling and bullying my partner and I. I've always felt restricted about what I can say in case of any political repercussions. I knew I was escalating the situation to a whole new level but was prepared to go there. Something needed to be done and I was the only one that had the guts to get it out in open and lay it on the table. I accused her of being a nasty bully who tried to dominate other people in the building to get what she wanted. I held them responsible for the tree falling over. Next day: Felt the issues between my neighbours had been vented for all to see and that I had finally found some kind of redress. Felt that I no longer had to carry the burden of being bullied and for others to see and to also take some responsibility for. Felt empowered and lighter. 12PM 60 0:08:00 NS I am obsessing over the idea of covering up white hairs with hair dye, and how annoying it is that once you start colouring you have to keep doing it although I have never really given it much thought before. 11PF 60 XX:XX:XX NS CONFRONTING RESPONSIBILITY We are in an empty pub when two singers come onto the stage. I am aware that the male singer is dead, although he is still upright. Whilst we are watching the singers, a member of the audience shoots the female singer in the chest. Blood shoots everywhere. I am wearing white trousers and they are covered in blood. I realise that my friend is no longer beside me and I am alone. I panic and decide to leave, before anyone can ask me any questions. I worry that they will think that I am responsible for what has happened. 07PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM On the bus there's a group of boys in their early teens. I know them and their parents. They're smoking. 2 of them are twins and slightly odd looking and I know that they're both autistic and that they're just copying the behaviour of the others. So I take the cigarettes out of their mouths and put them out. I put an arm around 1 of them and stroke his arm and try to explain why its not a good idea to smoke at their age. The feeling is protective and caring towards them. 08PF 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM I interjected a second time and insisted we keep things focussed. I made a woman cry. I apologized and became fixed on trying to make her feel better, but felt detached about how she felt and of what had happened. 12PM 3 0:15:15 NS Dreamt that I was at local hospital with my 2 children. Informed that a neighbour of my parents had been admitted with what I think was a stroke. They had a year-old child with them. I collected this child and took him home to my parents. I left the child at my parents home for the night. In morning I took over the care of this young boy again and told everyone what to do. 06PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dreamt in night I was pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl weighing 6lbs something. Recall that I was pleased to have a small baby as other two children had been big. 06PF 6 0:06:00 NS At the estate agency. They were mean and annoying. I was trying to avoid conflict. There was a rude secretary who said: \"its not my fault, not my problem\". I was infuriated. I felt that everyone refused to take responsibility for my circumstances and I felt very unsupported. 02PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM There is a fire in the house we are staying in and the son tells us to wait before we tell the fire brigade so that the house can burn. When the fire brigade come and I don't know what to do. I feel guilty but cannot disobey the son. I also don't want the fire brigade to know that we knew about the fire so I am cowering outside with my family pretending we are petrified. It's like a deceit carried out on many sides and I don't know where my loyalties lie. 01PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was helping my daughter get some qualifications. I notice a stamp with some kind of mark of approval that is being stamped on her work. I feel nervous and uncomfortable as I feel sure that she is not really entitled to this qualification, but I do not want to stop her from getting it. I was worried that it may cause trouble for her or me in the future, as things were not correct. 03PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I wake from a dream in which my sons and I are being chased down a long hill by a very large black poodle. I don't remember much about the dream except that I am in the front and manage to run fast enough to get away from the dog, but my children are lagging behind and I can't decide whether to wait for them or to keep on running. 07PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM The physical Sx I've had are similar to pains I have had in the latter stages of my pregnancy (heaviness and exhaustion, stitches in the chest, sudden nausea, forgetfulness and blankness). Even the dead arms are common to pregnancy because so much blood is diverted to the womb. Even that feeling that things are more precarious with the responsibility for a new life. We women tolerate these Sx in pregnancy because we know that there's a new life, a creation at the end. 08PF 14 0:08:00 AS Today I feel nervous and anxious about meeting new people and wish that I didn't have to do the interviews. I am worried that I wont be able to think of anything to say to the interviewees and I keep thinking about what I plan to say during the interviews. 12.00, NS I feel as if I have nothing interesting to say at the moment and somehow feel responsible for silences in the conversation, as if it is up to me and not the other person to keep the conversation going. I am tempted to cancel lunch, but don't as that would be avoiding the situation. I have less confidence than usual, and feel more self conscious. This reoccurs to day 21. 07PF 16 14:30 NS There is another shadow topic. At a party, a child dressed up as a ghost in a white sheet. It looked angelic. I said he looks more like a choirboy. Someone said \"Never let him do that\". They personally knew 3 priests who used to come to their home who were convicted of sexual abuse and were protected by the Church. Their aunt protected the reputation of the priest rather than her sister's young children. This story is now front page news today. We all choose whom we protect. It is a choice we make; even if we choose not to get involved, it's not possible to be neutral; even neutrality takes on a stance of cover up if it won't stand up for something. 11PF 16 XX:XX:XX NS A bunch of girls in school uniform running around in a department store environment. I was meant to control them they were being loud and inappropriate. I went up to one of them and she looked at me blankly-I felt she didn't care and would carry on running anyway. She was pushing a play shopping cart trolley and was barrelling around the store. I felt helpless. 02PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM A young boy around 12 years old looks on as if a father figure to another, younger boy, coaching him, training him. I realized this was his stepfather. He starts chastising the boy about the boy's real father as an irresponsible drug addict and how his real father would never take time with him the way the stepfather has done. I get very angry as I do not feel the boy should be hearing these things. The stepfather is being very inappropriate in what he says. 02PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM Being a mom is right for how my life is now, but I've been recalling times in my life before I had a child. I had a different lifestyle with different priorities. I feel like I'm reclaiming frivolous aspects of my persona and integrating the memory into who I am now. It's subtle. This mumsy me is not my whole life or my whole existence. This too will pass into another phase of life. 11PF 25 XX:XX:XX For the first time since starting the course I feel that I don't really want to go. Would prefer to stay home with the family. I have a strong sense that I am needed. 06PF 28 0:20:00 NS I feel compassion, appreciation for the weight of responsibility he is carrying. Some of his own team are suffering. Maybe he is carrying the burden of all humanity. There is something like a sigh, unexpressed but almost palpable. I sense, or I imagine I sense, that he feels a lot of something, maybe sadness. He has infinite patience with us. 11PF 29 XX:XX:XX IOS Looking at a wolf standing alone in an enclosure. He is leader of his pack. His hair is long and he looks very noble. But he looks exhausted as well, standing panting and dripping with sweat. The responsibilities of looking after his pack exhaust him and he is alone and sad. I want to comfort him but he looks dangerous and wild. 01PF 32 XX:XX:XX I'm staying at a friend's with my first boyfriend. He throws some of her cooking bowls across the room and they smash. He's vandalising her house and I can't stop him because there is a general feeling of disrespect for her house from everyone. I am sad for her but also worried about being caught. I start to wipe everything of our fingerprints. I try to find the bits of bowls and then find one that is only broken in a few bits. I try to piece it together, hoping she won't notice. 01PF 40 XX:XX:XX DREAM I feel hugely protective. 11PF 59 XX:XX:XX BOUNDARY FORTIFICATION I was challenged, frustrated and infuriated about the way she couldn't be honest as a person with me. I decided that was my experience and it was up to me to define my own boundaries 12PM 1 0:02:00 AS I felt exposed, as if he could see straight through me and was observing my egotistical side. I felt intense and cramped. I tried to push down my response and tried to appear as though I was completely at ease, even though I was far from it. I feel so self conscious about anything I say to anyone in class. I feel that I'm saying things to beef up my ego, demanding that others hear me. I have right to be who I am and to be listened to by others. I do have power, like we all have power, and these are simply examples of trying to harness and channel that power in positive way via who I am. I want to open up, focus and apply myself in a constructive way that feeds others and myself. 12PM 2 0:16:45 NS I remained standing on the outside of the group. I walked around the edge, intermittently looking off to the distance. I felt comfortable about being myself for the first time. I felt cheeky, devilish. I focussed on one member of the group and poked my tongue out at her. My real reason was to be playful in an effort to bond with her. I then stepped lightly and jokingly on her foot with my shoe. She didn't like what I'd done but I persisted. She covered her face like a child and I moved closer. I tried to reassure her I was joking but she blocked me out. 12PM 2 0:17:15 NS I walk into the house and my partner is eating a bag of crisps. I feel very irritated as he is eating them noisily and messily, dropping crumbs on the floor and I feel very annoyed with him. I want to shout at him to stop making the horrible crunching noise, but I stop myself and go upstairs. 07PF 2 0:19:00 NS I'm with my family and my daughter is as a young child. She has loads of mosquitoes, gnats and fleas flying and hopping around her legs. Then my family do too. I get a non-toxic spray and spray liberally around everyone. Not for the purpose of killing the insects; this spray just chases them away. 01PF 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am in a bubble. I'm spacey but self contained in my own head space. 11PF 3 0:14:00 Family member began asking me a question about something as I was still getting out of bed. I immediately felt overwhelmed (this is normal for me) as the answer was not yet apparent to me and I felt I needed to focus on getting myself fully woken up instead. I felt an immediate unusual clarity that I was not ready to answer her question. I then clearly communicated to her that I needed more time. I said this with a refined calmness. I was assertive and knew she could wait. This felt good. Normally I would give an exasperated reply but instead I made space between my thought and reaction I felt liberated and in control. 02PF 6 0:11:00 AS I am aware of an overall feeling of peace and calm. I feel connected to everything and everyone around me, but I also feel detached and removed from things. I don't feel any need to control what is happening and am happy to let situations evolve. I feel as if there is a protective layer between me and the people around me. It is as if there are now boundaries in place which weren't there previously. I am able to listen to my son, who suffers from anxiety, without needing to jump in with solutions. I am now able to let him experience his emotions without adopting them as my own. There are now boundaries in place between us and I am able to handle situations and problems in a more calm and rational manner. I am still able to empathise with people, however, I able to differentiate between which emotions and feelings belong to them, and which belong to me. 07PF 6 0:11:00 CS My friend comments that I seem much more focussed and clear headed than the last time we met which was about 6 months earlier. She talks a lot about the importance of me establishing boundaries in my relationships and says that seems to be what I am now doing. 07PF 7 0:20:00 NS With my friend, she insisted that she couldn't help me out financially and that I would have to pay my own way. I was a bit surprised by this, usually she was so giving but she was taking a much harder line with me. I was surprised at seeing this side of my friend, this isn't something that I knew about her. She was setting clear boundaries. Usually she was so giving. 12PM 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM Decided on the visualisation I am going to use to help with newly diagnosed breast cancer. I have a little fairy who flies inside my breast to the site of the 'problem'. She has a little bag and grasps hold of the cobwebby stuff of which 'my problem' is made, and puts it all in her little bag. She then flies quickly back down the way she came with her full bag, puts it down and touches it with her wand. It disappears in a flash of sparkly light. 09PF 18 0:17:20 NS Have been throwing the cat out of the bedroom the past few days as he has been loud and annoying. I felt angry that he would not adhere to my \"shushing\" him so did not feel guilty admonishing him from the room. This has now happened the last 3 nights. This behaviour is quite unusual for both of us. 02PF 21 XX:XX:XX NS I feel that this Breast Cancer diagnosis may protect her, shield her from some of the stresses in her life. She's been carrying so much worry for her loved ones. She has been so involved emotionally yet she has felt so powerless / hopeless, her own confidence in how she can do anything is always wavering. Other family members lean on her heavily, asking for money or taking a lot of her energy, she has been so burdened by this. I hope having a diagnosed illness will absolve her from the sense of duty of having to carry the responsibility she has felt for so many people in her family whose own family lives are so dysfunctional, that it will shield her from their demands 11PF 22 0:11:00 NS Felt angry today. Again this feeling of others looking out for themselves and not respecting my needs. I feel I need to strengthen my boundaries. 02PF 38 XX:XX:XX IOS Went out with a lot of people I did not know. Carved out my territory and really stood my ground 02PF 50 XX:XX:XX NS WHICH BED? Can't decide where to camp. Not sure where to put our tents - looking for nice flat bits and somewhere we can all be near each other. Wonder if we should just camp in our back garden. Seems appealing but worry that will have to be really quiet so as not to disturb the neighbour 08PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM Driving to work and start to think about birds nests. 06PF 4 0:09:15 NS I'm in Japan with 4 colleagues. We go first to a house of a Japanese man where our supervisor is going to stay. Its on the top of a hill in a village and there should be beautiful views but its dark. I look forward to seeing them in the morning. The house is cosy and the people welcoming. Me and the 2 other assistants are staying in a hostel. On the way I'm given a huge bundle of clothes (like a bundle of dirty washing- not folded).Its too big for my arms so we share it among the 3 of us and even then its hard to carry. We have to leave behind a cool box to collect later. We leave it open and just by a wall and I'm concerned it might be taken. We continue to the hostel and there are some negotiations about the price of a 4 bed room. We want to pay for 3 people but there's only 4 bed rooms. We don't want to share the room with anyone else so we're negotiating not to have to pay for a 4th bed. 08PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream that I was staying on a large boat with people I only knew a little, not friends. The boat had an upstairs deck (like a small ferry) and there was some confusion about which bed I would sleep in. I was trying to be helpful, but people seemed to misunderstand me and acted like I was being difficult. I was not part of my family, I was not a parent or wife etc., I was living my life alone. I noticed a long green tree branch, possibly a vine or weeping willow hanging down by the side of the boat, which seemed to stand out from the rest of the scenery and caught my eye, but I did not know why it seemed significant to me. 03PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM Sleep really well until daughter disturbs me. We swap beds. 17, 00:04:00 Woken up by daughter who wanted to come in our bed. This happens from time to time but since the proving I'm sure is happening on a more regular basis. I get up and go in to her bed. 06PF 13 0:04:00 IOS I was in a room and there was no bed for me. No one offered to help me and I felt angry and frustrated. I wanted to get out of the room. 02PF 20 XX:XX:XX DREAM I feel we need a new mattress, I am not happy with the one I am sleeping on, it is not good enough quality, I feel it sinks down too much and does not support me. I spend 8 hours a day in bed and the mattress needs to be the best it can, I must look after myself, my skeleton, my posture, I want the best mattress. I google tempura foam mattresses, they are expensive but I want one 05PM 30 0:15:25 NS Partner and I are still not sleeping together, this is the third week in a row we've been unable to sleep together. He keeps murmuring in his sleep and has coughing fits that wake us both up. Always really relieved when he goes into the other room and I have the bed to myself. 12PM 32 0:23:00 NS The hard board to the bed has begun to buckle. This can be felt through mattress. Spent the whole night aware off the mattress digging into my leg because of this. The next day, I watched TV on the bed and began to obsess: I started to worry about money and having to replace the bed. 12PM 33 08.00 NS BOUNDARY PENETRATION Went to the toilet and dug my finger nail into my leg so hard it pierced the skin. 12PM 2 0:04:00 I drank a bottle of wine with a classmate and found myself sharing some very private information about my life. I was really surprised that I allowed myself to talk about my sex life. 12PM 2 0:21:00 NS Mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted. I feel really heavy, weighted down. Intermittent euphoric feeling, as though energised again. My mind feels overloaded, as though over processed with too much information. I feel like I have been over exposed to people. It's as if there is no protective layer around me and I am exposed and raw. I just want to be alone and to find my own space. All thought processes lead to negative outcomes which ignite more negative thoughts. Many different feelings that seem to flow all at once, mostly negative. Feeling very irritable and angry. 12PM 3 0:08:00 NS I don't want people to sit near me, I want my own space and I have no problem with telling them if I or they have to move. Sensation of feeling cramped, hemmed in, and heavy. It's as though I have no protective barrier between me and anything that lives and breaths. I'm feeling intense and tired. 12PM 3 0:09:30 NS. Later that afternoon I felt raw and exposed with no protective layer. At one point the legs of the chairs of the people sitting next to me became locked onto my chair and I felt panicked. I felt as though I was hemmed in and trapped. I asked them to stand and I rearranged to chairs to unlock them. 12PM 3 0:13:00 NS Just wanted to be alone but was politely forced to converse with her the entire way. I felt raw, exposed, exhausted and drained 12PM 3 0:21:15 NS My normally outgoing and playful cousin was sat in a corner out of the pool. She looked excluded, uninterested, and uncharacteristically sad. My father was there too and was holding me up while I was swimming like one does when one was little. His hand was near my bum and I realized that it was no longer age appropriate to be carrying me in this way and I told him to stop. I felt boundaries were being crossed. 02PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM I felt offended that someone was in my garden without identifying themselves. I felt detached from her as I observed her through my window. I leaned out the window and demanded that she identify herself. She showed her ID badge, she was from the council. As soon as she did this I felt fine and closed the window. 12PM 4 0:13:00 NS I have just discovered a drill hole in the kitchen floor. It is a 6mm hole in the cork tiled floor. My attention was drawn to this when I was cleaning up cat litter that had been tracked from the litter box. I was astounded that I have never seen it before because the hole is located in the middle of the kitchen floor. 12PM 4 0:18:15 I was handed an African child suffering from starvation. I didn't want to take hold of the child, I felt that it was dangerous, unpredictable and dirty. I took the child in my hands but as I did it changed its life form and became a savage cat-like animal with sharp teeth. I felt the social pressure of needing to conform to more acceptable idea that this was a starving child, not a savage animal that could harm me. He then began to bite my hand. It tore the skin and drew blood. As it did this I politely grabbed its mouth and forced it away from me. I was concealing the real force I used. I was sensitive to onlookers in my attempt to remove the grab of the child's mouth and I managed to prize it off my hand. I was worried that the bite had infected me with a disease. I immediately went to the doctor to get a vaccination for any possible infection. I was told that I needed a series of vaccinations. The Doctor hooked me up to a machine that injected one after another into my arm. It felt like there had been dozens of them. I then realised that I had taken a suppressive orthodox approach to my health. I was shocked. I felt panicked and overwhelmed that I temporarily forgotten my holistic health management approach. I knew that I needed to get off the machine immediately. There was disbelief that I had fallen into this situation. I felt a sense of violation by something that I had no belief in. 12PM 5 XX:XX:XX DREAM Partner tells me statistics about numbers of microbes in our body and the massive gene pool available for us. He calls it an invasion and I immediately refute him and exclaim excitedly how amazing it is that we have inside us something that is bigger than us, like a whole universe contained within us. I feel elation and excitement and wonderment. I don't feel invaded at all, more privileged to be part of this incredible microbiotic system that has included us in its existence. My reaction is almost like some spiritual fervour, using words like wonderful, amazing, incredible. I have a sense of these microbes like a cloud existing within me and at the same time extending beyond my corporeal body. 01PF 6 XX:XX:XX NS The western world is hijacking knowledge from ancient civilisations and claiming ownership of it. It is responsible for the decimation of cultural heritage, the eradication of an advanced and deeply spiritual culture. I can feel my anger escalating and start ranting. The Western world becomes ugly and brutal and thieving in my eyes. 01PF 6 XX:XX:XX AS I saw a house in the distance and went inside. I discovered a friend living there who I hadn't seen for 25 years. She was living there with her extended family. I was really happy to see her but she didn't seem to be at all excited or pleased to see me. I felt like I was imposing on her and her family. My friend and her family went through the hospitable motions of accommodating my partner and I but I knew they didn't' really mean it. I asked her if she could arrange some drugs for me to take. She agreed to this and set about trying to network through her brothers and sisters to find something for me. I knew she didn't really want to do this but I let her go on as this was something that I really wanted. After a great inconvenience to my friend and her family she finally found some drugs for me. However, I was then unsure as to whether or not I should take the drugs. 12PM 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM Cat clawed at the carpet next to the front door in an effort to get out. I flew off my chair and burst into a tyrannical rage and chased the cat around the house. I grabbed him behind the chair and screamed no, no, no whilst pointing at him from above. My efforts had been completely out scale. Afterwards I found him hiding cowered in the corner. I felt terrible, I could see I had really upset him, his spirits were crushed. This was the lowest I have ever seen him. At the same time I knew that we needed to have boundaries and he had just pushed these. He needed to understand the limits of his place in the home. He looked broken. 12PM 6 0:18:00 NS I found myself walking up stairs of a stadium for a rock concert. I was clinging to this long-haired guy with a t-shirt on in front of me. I did not know him personally but we were both fans so somehow it was alright. I apologized eventually because I realized it wasn't really right to do that without knowing him or asking him...it was his personal space. 02PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM Sex attack, forced, by a gang. I'm out somewhere with friends, three men. A gang intercepts us. One of the men barges into our group to separate us and pick us off individually. We are kidnapped / abducted, bound, sexually attacked. The men are attacked too. Our legs are bound. It's a horrible dream. Very vivid. I lie awake for ages after a restless night trying to get to sleep. 13, 23.00 I've just gone back into my journal to add the shadow I'd been avoiding facing. I couldn't write about the bad dream of the sex assault; it was too vivid. 11PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM Sitting in the window seat during the storm, flies were coming in through the gap in the window frame. I was cleaning them up using wet toilet tissue to flush them down the loo. As many handfuls of tissue as I got, there were dozens of flies coming in, crawling over the window. 11PF 11 XX:XX:XX Have been on holiday on a nearby island and want to extend a few extra days. We go to see if they've got a spare caravan at a local caravan park. They take us to see the only 1 left. Its a very ancient but well kept caravan and very quaint. Its set in some rose gardens and we decide to have it. Outside the caravan park is the beach which is covered with seals so the beach nearest the sea can't be used by people. There are caravan site staff sitting in a line with tazer guns to keep the seals back should they transgress onto the caravan site part where all the people are. The people have the use of a natural man-made swimming pool that is filled by the sea and it looks very inviting. As well as the seals there's a huge whale on the shore (In the dream its a whale but like the seals it lives part on land and part in the sea. It moves like a seal but is more fish shaped). It wakes up & starts to move. Unlike the seals its allowed to wander onto the park side of the beach. Its obviously not dangerous. It shuffles up towards the park entrance. It looks heavy and as if movement should be difficult but its surprisingly quite 'athletic' and makes some breach type moves on the concrete. It climbs onto a land rover and threatens to tip it up. It comes back down the path and settles on the opposite side of some railings to me so I can get very close and look at its face. 08PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM Having to write down all the things that come up feels invasive. I don't want people to see what goes on inside me. 12PM 11 0:12:00 NS When I am walking through town today, it feels as if everyone is watching me and I feel very self conscious. I am more aware than usual of the people around me and I find that I am looking at them and what they are doing. 07PF 12 0:16:00 NS I'm in my home looking down at the snow and see three boys, each with one foot each on a motorised surfboard, surfing along the snow. The motors are making a really loud noise and breaking the peace. I want to say something but I'm afraid they'll ignore me and make it worse and I feel a bit threatened by them. I'm then in an outdoor public toilet and the three boys come in. I'm hiding but they find me. I'm a boy and I think they're going to rape me. In my dream I go through different scenarios of fighting them, one of the scenarios is shooting the first boy with a stun gun and then ramming the stun gun into the others. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM In my home town and there are lots of new buildings going up. This is happening very fast and is destroying the places which artist and squatting communities have used for many years. It's becoming like the financial areas of London. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am trying to measure an acre using a metric tape on the edge of a field. The tape is metal and bent so it's really fiddly. I have to keep fixing it and starting again. In the field, which has a high metal-type fence, is a beautiful old house with a gravel drive. A lady walks by and says it's for sale and it will probably be knocked down and a new housing estate built on it. She blames the government. I see an American family drive in in a big mobile home. It's as if they don't see me. I'm looking straight into the face of the young, blonde American girl speaking with her American accent but she doesn't see me. I think it's typical that Americans have come to buy this place and don't believe they will care about it. I walk on and look upstairs and there is a beautiful young girl in a room right at the top. She is talking to herself, a poem or something like that. I watch as if I am a peasant spying on the gentry, secretly and admiringly. Then there is a beautiful mother and then lots and lots of beautiful, ephemeral girls all filling the room. I realise she doesn't have a husband so they don't have a father. I then start making plans to save the place. There are lots of healers of various disciplines in the house. I don't consider them to be good for the reputation of the house so I decide to get rid of the 'dodgy' ones and replace them with 'proper' homeopaths. A part of me is aware of this 'taking over' behaviour and another part just wants to organise and do it without consideration for these healers. 01PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM I went outside into the communal area. I noticed that water from the concrete ceiling had been leaking through into the unit and onto our belongings. I have a dark and heavy feeling that lingers inside me as well as outside amongst the building. 12PM 17 0:14:30 IOS Dream that I had a row of about 4 raised bites along the top of my right shoulder. I was a little upset about this and surprised as I do not get bitten often 03PF 18 XX:XX:XX DREAM Psychic experiences have increased. My confidence in my ability to see these has also increased. I've stopped questioning myself about what I can see and what I can't see, I just pick it up and run with it as soon as I see it. Thoughts, feelings, visions are all tuned in and feel more acutely focussed. I notice things straight away now, don't dismiss or doubt. I feel confident that these are valid experiences that offer me insight, as well as opportunity to communicate and share. 12PM 18 0:08:30 NS I'm so cross by the way decisions are made. I can't bear governments, councils, committees. Opinions have already been decided for you, skewing statistics by what they don't ask. 11PF 19 0:09:00 AS I could see my supervisor was feeding off me, her mood was reflecting the one that I was experiencing. 12PM 19 0:11:15 NS Dream that our Guinea Pigs hutch had been opened by 2 sheep, 1 black, 1 white. I rescue 1 guinea pig but the other squeezes under a fence. I wake up as a ginger cat approaches her. 06PF 20 0:06:00 DREAM It was a nice sunny day and I was on a family outing. The feeling of the dream was pleasant. We paddled in a river. I was saying to one of my family how nice this was, then a grotesquely ugly, strangely coloured large fish came towards me in the water. It did not look natural, so I assumed it was a toy that was floating on the stream. I let it come close to me, as I did not want to be suspicious and untrusting, and thought it was quite sweet as it seemed to rest its chin on my forearm. Suddenly the fish was obviously alive as it opened its mouth; which was full of jagged, uneven sharp-looking teeth. I was terrified, and woke up just the fish was about to bite me. 03PF 24 XX:XX:XX NS My friend seemed to progressively become more nervous, it was as though he was feeding off my state. I was sensitive to this and I questioned if it was me who was creating this tension. Then I began to compensate this situation by trying to make everything all right for him, it was easy to forget about me and concentrate on his needs instead. 12PM 24 0:17:00 NS Beautiful Greco-roman mansion. Witnessed a beautiful view that revealed itself in the next morning in the daylight. I accidentally let the dog out through a curtain of thick plastic woven material. I tried to get it to play fetch in order to coax it back in. At one point it bit me on the hand and held my hand for several moments. I can't remember how I felt about that. 02PF 25 XX:XX:XX DREAM Cat has started to urinate outside of the cat box, to urinate all over the inside of the box and outside the box. He leaves urine on the backs of his hind paws and walks it through the house 12PM 25 0:11:50 NS A friend invited a fourth person to hang out with us. The fourth friend came over and brought his extended latino family. They all came over bringing drugs: in cigarette and pill form. I felt invaded that they all came by with these very tempting but unhealthy drugs. I accepted them even though I did not want to use them so I put them down on the bed. The family started stealing valuable possessions. I felt aggressive in defending these things and fought them off angrily. The older grandmother asked me for my sweatshirt. I gave it to her kindly as we waited for a taxi outside. I was angry at my friend and felt the friendship was over. The house to them was quite big and I thought they wanted to take advantage of me and my family. 02PF 28 XX:XX:XX DREAM I am able to keep a better perspective on what is happening and feel more reasonable. I have this idea that African and Afro-Caribbean people have a sensitivity to mood and can be a barometer for how I am feeling. I chat with an African woman as we walk along the high street and make her laugh. It's a good feeling and the connection feels a bit shy but warm. The barometer says I'm ok. 01PF 28 0:16:45 AS I could see a friend, he stood with his back to me. There was another man facing looking at me. The man facing me began to make a sexual advance towards the old friend but looked provocatively at me at the same time. He was being really dirty and the friend didn't know I was standing behind them. I was sexually aroused and really wanted to join them but felt I couldn't because of my friend. One part of me didn't care and the other knew that this was a boundary that I shouldn't cross. 12PM 30 XX:XX:XX DREAM Reflecting on the observations of people yesterday, how the people are echoed in my dreams or vice versa. As if my dream world is sensitising me to what is happening in my waking world. 01PF 31 XX:XX:XX Old tenant rings me. I don't answer the door or the phone or return the phone call. I feel scared. His friend comes round to the house and rings the doorbell repeatedly. I don't want to see them. I've locked the outside door to the porch. The image of having to put up a resistance to an intruder is in my mind. I don't want him here. I'm tense about it. I'm scared and I feel stiffened with fear. I'm a bit concerned about the paranoia. Is it paranoia? it is frankly. I was scared that he was a murderer. 11PF 32 XX:XX:XX NS There are workers crawling around my window spraying paint fumes into my bedroom. There are neighbours complaining today to me that we need to keep it down at night. I just feel so constricted and constrained in this home. Two days later the builders have scaffolding outside every one of my windows and today they scraped paint chips all over my shower by opening the window from the outside without my permission. They also painted with toxic fumes and my bedroom became unbearable to be in, stuffy with strong fumes at around 11am. They are not friendly when I walk into my kitchen and they are banging at my window. My neighbours can hear every move I make, and I am up late and drop things accidentally. I am tip-toeing around for hours and it is driving me nuts. 02PF 34 0:23:00 NS I wake from a dream about coming back into the Earth's atmosphere. I am going through layers of space, sky and atmosphere, reacclimatising, just as divers do when they resurface, only this is a coming back to earth. 11PF 36 XX:XX:XX DREAM Either the proving is wearing off, and I'm coming back, or I'm in and out of both. 11PF 36 0:17:00 Woke this morning with a severe headache, high on toxic paint fumes. The smell was burning my nostrils and my first thought was how heavily the fumes had invaded my bedroom. I feel angry that these people can just get away with doing this without any warning or notice. They are affecting people's health without thinking twice about caring for the well being of others and instead turn a blind eye to the health implications of their actions. I am feeling as if I live in a hostile world. Everyone is out for themselves and I cannot do anything about the implications of these childish behaviours. I want to scream. I feel helpless and hopeless: I am toxic and my cells are toxic. 02PF 37 XX:XX:XX NS I look up at the television which someone has turned on very loudly. I feel angry at the advertisements I am forced to watch by the media company. This one is of a violent video game which is a cartoon simulation of 2 axe murderers and a gang of zombies attacking a young family in their home. I want to scream. It is very graphic and in slow motion, right down to the strike of the axe into the neck of the father. It doesn't kill him, just takes a huge chunk of flesh and bone from his body. To make it worse, there is a very slow, orchestral sombre piece of music playing in the background during the massacre. What the fuck is this world coming to? I am now resentful that my partner has turned on this TV. I feel invaded by this as well. 02PF 37 0:14:00 AS Lots of orange and black striped shapes, pole-shaped and baton sized. Placing them in the ground, like a ritual, with my sister. 01PF 41 XX:XX:XX DREAM Living in a flat with my daughter and her father. Claustrophobic. Overwhelming. Daughter is busy and her activities are overwhelming me, she wants to involve me. This place is new. I look outside onto the balcony and there is a pub opening onto it. People are drinking. They're friendly but I don't want to socialise with them. There are outdoor concrete stairs coming into my room leading to a flat upstairs. People are at the top looking over. They're friendly too but I don't want them there. Want to escape. 01PF 41 XX:XX:XX DREAM Partner and I had bought a terraced house. There was something wrong with the foundations and I could see there was a couple of really large holes that had been bored through the brickwork straight through to the inside of the house. I felt that I knew the reasons for this and spoke with authority to my partner. I told him that water had penetrated through the brickwork and damp had lead to the erosion of the stone. The builders were going to scrape out the rest of the damp with a blow torch and heated iron instrument. I told them that was the wrong way to do it. I insisted that they use powered water pressure and a scraping utensil to get the rest of the damage out. 12PM 45 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm a bit concerned about paranoia. I was scared to let those teenagers into my house. I'm scared my supervisor will back away from me. I don't want anyone to know I am feeling like this. It feels weak, foolish, delusional, a bit loopy. I can see I've been delusional but I can't brush off the situation. The teenager has no aura, he has absorbed his energy field inwards, internalised it. It is not the same as emitting \"dark\" but it's on that spectrum of not light. I've only met 3 people in my life who have absorbed their energy field inwards like this. An African refugee who approached me told me what had driven him to escape his country and asked me for help. He had drawn all his energy inside him so he could pass unnoticed. I gave him a carrier bag of food and a train fare but I did not invite him into my home. With no energy field to sense, I could not trust him. I am looking forward to feeling a sigh of relief. To realising it was all nonsense. I'm not there yet. The front door is double locked. 11PF 32 XX:XX:XX Walking with friends and daughter through empty underpass at train station. We're in a heightened mood of laughing and joking, taking up the width of the pass. I'm suddenly aware of being enveloped from behind, a momentary feeling of being disconcerted, approached silently without having any sense of it. Then a man virtually steps over me to pass me by. I comment loudly, offended that he hadn't excused himself, and he turns to say, in a quietly indignant voice, 'I did say excuse me'. He wafts away and I joke to my friends that he was a vampire. I go to bed with a mixture of regret that I had spoken like that to such a beautiful and elegant man who was probably just trying to pass quietly by but also a feeling of menace and slightly creped out by him. It was the same feeling I had in a dream of a man in all black, sitting closely behind my right shoulder on day 17. 01PF 34 0:22:45 NS I saw neighbours I don't speak with as he has been feuding with my partner for the last three years. My partner and I are convinced that he is a charlatan swindling the old man that he lives with for his savings. I began to get angry that this man doesn't have a job and just freeloads off of the man he lives with. I get so angry that this man has so much to say and makes so much effort to cause trouble, yet he isn't even an owner and has no stake in the investment of the building. Began to recognise the fact that he is a bully and that he tries to make us feel uncomfortable in the building that we live. 12PM 56 0:23:20 AS Felt really heavy about issues with feuding neighbours. I felt that things had now come to a head and that something had to change. Partner was concerned and advised me to try and stop worrying about it and said that I needed to have a thicker skin. I began to realise that this wasn't possible. I told him that because I'm psychic it isn't that easy to do this. I explained that I feel things and sense that things that don't always make sense and that I can't just turn it off. For the first time I realised just how different my boundaries of perception are to most other people. I'm always trying to fit in like everyone else and to just act like they do, whilst underneath I feel, sense and perceive the smallest things. It's like being the princess and the pea. I often react to these small things, which appear irrelevant to others. Often are the tips of the icebergs to something of greater complexity or importance. I realised that because my boundaries extend much farther that I'm also continuously taking on much more. 12PM 58 0:22:55 NS I became acutely aware of the tutor who made me feel uncomfortable had sat behind my right shoulder. This really unnerved me. I could feel his energy, it was intense and overpowering. I was unsure of who he was or what he was thinking, he was like an unknown and guarded entity that was beyond my comprehension. I felt threatened by him. 12PM 64 0:16:30 GHOST I get a double flopper playing skittles. When the pins went down I felt completely in control but as though assisted by an outside force. 04PM 7 0:22:00 NS Lying in bed writing I hear my answer machine going off. I then realise that I have completely imagined their voices. 01PF 9 0:10:00 NS Wake up convinced I hear someone in the flat. Hear a banging outside, the noise typical of when the police come to ram doors down. I still think there is someone inside. I don't feel so much fear, more a sinister creepy feeling. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM I imagined I saw a figure on the staircase at my friend's house in London as I left the bathroom. About half an hour later I left the bathroom again and again thought I saw a figure on the staircase. There was no one their but the feeling was of a male presence, perhaps a man in his 50's in dark clothing. Uncomfortable but not threatening. 04PM 15 0:10:00 NS I am driving and the weather is very foggy with poor visibility. As I leave, I have the feeling that someone is in the back seat of my car. A lorry flashes its headlights at me and I think that he is trying to tell me that there is someone in my car who is going to hurt me. 07PF 21 0:20:00 NS Woken up in the night by myself breathing out with a loud, vibrational sound. Head in a tremor, feel slightly uneasy. Woken again later feeling uneasy on my chest, slight panic. Feel a presence in the room but go back to sleep. 01PF 22 XX:XX:XX NS Whilst getting ready for work, I have the sensation that someone is in the room behind me. I keep turning round to check but no-one is there. 07PF 28 0:08:00 NS I am sure their is someone is with me, but when I go to check I do not see anyone. As I leave I look through the windows into the house and then I think I see someone, but I look again and no one is there. This occurs again later, uncomfortable but not unsafe. It is a neutral presence, a feeling someone is in the room, but they will do me no harm 05PM 31 0:19:05 NS I cannot seem to stop myself. It feels as if I am being controlled by something outside of myself and I am powerless to do anything about it. 07PF 36 0:09:00 NS TORTURE/VIOLENCE I was standing next to a car on the inside of a fence when an animal began to approach me along the fence line. It was dark and I couldn't see the animal but it was stalking me and moving slowly towards me. I was petrified and feared for my life. The animal was hard to identify but I could see its black back as it moved closer. In the dream I was screaming at the top of my lungs but in waking life it was muted and I could barely manage a sound. I awoke. My mind turned to thoughts about monkey's in animal testing laboratories. The thoughts were linked to the dream. I sensed cages where individual monkey's were trapped in a clinical setting. They were isolated and had no comfort. It was soulless existence. 12PM 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM I wake up from dreaming and a voice continues for a short moment, giving me a factual account of how a small puppy is having a wooden block repeatedly pushed onto it. The puppy is being injured and is squealing. I am seeing it happen but my experience of it happening is through the voice describing it. The wooden block is part of a machine that repeats the action. 01PF 7 5:30:00 DREAM Dream about a young man suspected of doing something wrong, but I was not clear what it was. No one knew where he was, but he needed to be questioned about the problems. Next I see what I know to be the young man having his ear and then the side of his head chopped off by another man. This other man was supposed to be questioning the suspect, but just chopped him up without asking questions. I was watching in the room, I am shocked and horrified by this. I am very aware of the wooden table or chopping board that the young man's head is on, his head is turned to the right (resting on the left side). I can feel the sensation of the chopper slicing through the flesh and hear/feel the metal of the blade clicking onto the wooden surface. I feel very shaken up. I did not know what the young man had done, but his punishment was out of proportion with anything he had done. 03PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM Felt very upset while helping my daughter with hair removal which she was finding very painful. I did not feel able to go through the pain and suffering with her - it felt like we were both being tortured. I realised that this is not ok with me, and that we are both suffering too much. This realization was like a revelation for me, as I had not been so present to how upsetting I really found the whole process until now. I usually buried, suppressed or ignored how I felt, but now I did not feel able to do that. (I have been removing body hair in this way for my daughter for several years) 03PF 13 0:21:00 AS Some kind of machine or contraption that looks like something medieval, wooden, old. It's used for a ritual or something sacrificial. The feeling is dark and somehow I am involved. I think I may be going on it. Wake up with my head lifted up and gasping loudly, sweating and hot. Feel like I have escaped something dreadful. 01PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM While petting my cat and admiring its beauty, my mind visualised someone cutting the cats back leg off at the joint while it was still alive in some kind of a sadistic attempt to cause it harm. I felt slightly sickened and upset by the thought. How could anyone do such a thing to an innocent animal was utterly beyond me. I thought about how such an act would affect my cat. 12PM 15 0:19:30 NS Bought and cooked first chicken in 37 years. Felt it was a new adventure in my life as I normally do not ethically agree with farming and slaughtering animals. 02PF 17 0:18:00 NS Table full of piles of \u00a3500 notes. I'm with a group of people and we have planned to distribute this money around a site we have built with two big circus-like tents. We're staging a nightclub and the presence of people and presence of money will make the money multiply. So we place the money around the site but we have to be careful it doesn't get taken away. The party is a failure because it's so badly organised and turns into a shambolic mess with people just aimlessly wandering around. I go to the makeshift office and someone is lying on the floor ready to be tortured. It's a bit like a gangster movie. Person happens to be an ex-boyfriend. He dumped me really unceremoniously and I just let him humiliate me in the process. I start torturing him with some instruments. He breaks free and runs down a big, wide sweeping staircase. A group of women, one in particular, have designed a round table that, as it's dropped from a height, turns into a spinning object that seems to have some kind of blades so that when it lands on something it does so with great force, penetrating deeply into it. This weapon misses him. 01PF 19 XX:XX:XX DREAM I watched a very harrowing movie of war, torture, rape and a woman's life turned upside down by it. I could not get physically comfortable during the film. The main character kept a dark secret that turned darker at the end of the film which caused her to have a stroke and eventually die. After the movie I felt physically ill afterwards: feverish and battered. I felt very hot and intensely exhausted, as if I had lived the experience myself in just 2 hours. I had to have a shower before bed which kind of alleviated my feelings of overwhelmed intensity. 02PF 21 XX:XX:XX NS Woke and could not get back to sleep. Suddenly, out of nowhere, began thinking about French people eating frogs' legs and started wondering why anyone would. Then a worse thought. How did they kill them before they ate them?! Vision of their being dropped into pan of boiling water! Horrible vision! Horrific thought! Asked myself how anyone could DO this! Just wanted to get away from it as realised that, if it is true, then hundreds of little creatures could be suffering at any given moment! Hoped this was not the preferred method and tried to go to sleep unsuccessfully for some time. Went into some sort of 'awake but asleep' state and, as a result, got up a little late feeling tired. 09PF 14 0:05:00 NS Was watching someone prepare chicken in the kitchen. The plucked and beheaded carcasses were moving around, interacting with each other. I realized they were running around like \"chickens with their head cut off\" and then one of them was taken and put into boiling water. I felt horrible to witness this unacknowledged torture. The others were put into water in the sink and I had to look away as I felt they were drowning, suffering a horrible death. On waking in the morning I began thinking of caged testing animals in laboratories (primarily monkeys), locked in cages. The injustice and darkness about this acceptable behaviour made me feel very sad, angry and constricted with fear. 02PF 33 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dark skinned men with afros were tied from their wrists, hanging from the ceiling of a hut. Asian general was torturing one in particular who had big, wide fearful eyes. The unfeeling general was spraying a potent aerosol into his eyes and the man could not do anything to prevent it. It was unbearable to witness, the man could not protect himself against the torture. 02PF 64 XX:XX:XX DREAM REMEDY RELATIONSHIPS I ran into an actress I used to work with and look up to many years ago. I didn't think she'd remember me but she did. She was older than she should have been and she had a cane and wrinkles. She looked tired. I knew she had an autoimmune disease. I felt she was vulnerable and not happy. I told her I was studying homeopathy and felt proud that I'd moved on. She told me she had taken Rhus tox and we both felt the gravity of such a remedy, almost as if it were like chemo (poison)...heavy and stiff was the essence and that showed how much pain she was in. I sympathised. 02PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was speaking to the bus driver and I asked him if he could give me a remedy for the warts that had spread over my body, they were on my face and I wanted to get rid of them. I asked the bus driver what remedy he was going to give me and he said Rhus tox. I turned to him and said that couldn't be the remedy. In my mind I thought it was just a superficial first aid remedy that would never work. I asked him again to find a remedy for my warts. He reassured me he would but I didn't feel that he would call me back. The following morning, within the first few minutes of the class an example of Rhus tox was used by the tutor. This also led to examples of superficially treating a patient during palliation. Later on he began to talk about a patient who presented for warts on her face. 30, 00:14:50 During the afternoon class the next tutor talked about treating himself with Rhus tox. 30, 00:16.00 During the proving meeting one of the other provers talked about treating herself with Rhus tox 12PM 30 XX:XX:XX NS (Day 34): Took a constitutional remedy that I have found very beneficial on several occasions. My husband persuaded me that I may feel better emotionally, and I accepted the advice. (Day 35): Woke after a comfortable night's sleep. Feel enthusiastic about life, and looking forward to the day. Feeling nice, comfortable and balanced. Staphisagria antidote this proving. 03PF 34 0:20:45 The Rx I took on Day 28 was Thuja 200C. (I didn't know what it was at the time) I felt much better for about 10 days to 2 weeks but then started to feel very flat again- no energy, no get up and go, no motivation, quite depressed. I deliberately didn't write about this at the time because I was trying to put the proving behind me. When I saw my homeopath again (day 60) and explained how I was feeling I realised that I was still speaking the language of the proving. I think I'd slipped back into it without having really noticed- or a least I'd tried to deny it and ignore it. I took another dose of Thuja - this time a 10M. I think that did then allow me to put the proving truly behind me. 08PF 60 XX:XX:XX MISC. DREAMS I was observing a woman from inside the building who was applying for a role in a movie with a casting agent. The woman had children and was the wrong age for the role. The casting agent was eliminating her from the short list and the woman knew this. She began to work her potential by smooth talking the casting agent, the casting agent knew what she was doing but let her continue. I was impressed at how good she was at it. The casting agent resisted but in the next moment she had given her the opportunity to prove herself and granted her the role. I was then standing outside the building and looking up and down its east facing side. When I looked around to the front of the building the woman had all of her friends and family standing out the front of the building to meet someone famous on the movie. There was a woman sitting in a wheelchair on the middle of the road looking up at the building just waiting for something to happen. The casting agent was trying to get the woman to behave and to get things back into order. However the woman didn't seem to care, she had her role and was now more interested in exploiting her situation. The next moment a flood of traffic that consisted of motor bikes and cars began to drive up road to the building. They were more of the woman's friends who had come to see what they could take from her opportunity. 12PM 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM A huge battle is preparing and emerging in the Valleys, forest and highlands, it feels dark, green, damp. There are hundreds and hundreds of soldiers neatly lined up and set out in square battalions, like Romans. They are everywhere the eye can see across the land. One battalion moves off to go to the front line and the others part to let them through. On the brow of the hill the battalion stand in wait, holding strong, well supported by all those that stand behind them, they are knitted together, they will not be moved, they will advance. There is no leader. Then down at the front there is a little girl, about ten years old, pale and innocent, she stands there, she wears a White band on her head. It is quite deep and it covers her ears and forehead and goes up to just above her head. It has White tubes running up it. These battle dreams are about holding strong and advancing slowly, steadily moving and progressing, but doing it because you know you have the strengths, help and huge support of others. They are there with you, together you do it. 05PM 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM We're eating at the table. An ex-partner of mine is sitting at the head of the table. He's eating voraciously, deciding what we should, behaving like the man of the house, bullying and insensitive to us. We all sit quietly saying nothing. He's intruding and I feel really uncomfortable and slightly nervous some possible violence. It's interesting to me that I've dreamt about this ex-partner and another on day 19, both relationships in which I felt vulnerable and unsteady on my feet. 01PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM At this festival there is the most beautiful and glamorous woman dressed in some kind of science fiction/period drama costume. Her hair is dark and glistening with a kind of metallic crimson iridescence to it. High gloss hair, really strong and long down her back. It's swooped up here and there in sort of ringlets. She has a confident, leering and almost cruel look but there is also some drama or humour about her. She reminds me of the face I saw of myself in the mirror but that image is nothing compared to the power and presence of this woman. Some evil gangsters have approached her and they want to confront her. Someone gives her a fan. It's like one of those woven grass ones made for fanning a fire. This one is more ornate and much bigger. I am now in her body and feeling what is happening. It's like with each fan-motion the body is lifted up and, though we are falling down the side of a hill, each swoop of the fan lifts us up. It's like a butterfly only slower, a bit clumsy and chaotic in flight but heavier because we are bigger. We keep to just above the heads of the festival goers. I don't have complete faith in this flight and it's got no real direction or speed. I wonder if the gangsters would catch us if they decide to go on bicycles. 01PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm sleeping on the floor. It's derelict, dry and dusty. The colour of the brick and earth is sand-coloured. I'm lying on the dusty ground sleeping. The sun keeps rising. My daughter is a baby and I lay her down on the floor in the corner of what was once a cupboard. She won't go to sleep, squirming around on her belly, crying. I can't settle her. I don't know what to do. I go away and then come back. She is encased in a clear plastic bag. Her face is a bit furry. Her face is tight against the plastic bag and I'm worried she can't breathe but she looks peaceful, just wriggling a bit. I go to make a hole in the plastic bag but disturb her so I leave her alone. I feel like she doesn't need me, she's sorted herself out. 01PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM 2 women are in my room who shouldn't really have been there. They ask if they can use it. Then I'm in communal showers - large cubicles all in the same room; wet and steamy. They're really busy- the 2 women are there and others. I want to pee and you have to pee in the showers which seemed odd. I don't want to pee if I'm not also showering to wash it away and it's all so busy so I decide to wait. Later I'm in a shower. There's 1 other person- a friend. She picks up a long black, shiny, slug like thing (a cross between a slug and a worm- completely black) and is taunting me with it- threatening to throw it at me or waft it in front of me. I'm repulsed and scared. I grabbed it with the shower curtain and throw it out of the slightly open window- just a small gap. I'm surprised by the deftness of my action. The thing that sticks with me about the dream is my deft, matter of fact action of getting rid of the slug thing which opposes my initial (and probably usual) reaction of squeamish fear. On waking I'm puzzled because I couldn't say whether I and the other people were naked or clothed in the shower- I have no perception of that in the dream. 08PF 1 XX:XX:XX DREAM A man came in angry at me because I had placed my towel on top of his antennaes on the dressing table. \"Where are my antennaes?\" he demanded, as if I had lost them. I felt badly and searched for them under a towel. There were lots of black long bobby pins in a pile. I was trying to be helpful so I kept looking and looking. Eventually I found some antennae-like items on the dresser. They were black, long and thin with a tightly coiled end (like an old car phone antennae but smaller). \"Are these them?\" I asked. He said no, more disappointed. I felt responsible. I kept looking. I asked him when he had put them there and he said several months ago. I immediately felt less guilty as I realized that it wasn't my fault. I began looking in more logical places such as by the television. I went to the television set which was from the early to mid-80's. There were lots of tangled wires and cables. They looked more like a small box with cables attached than an antennae. He needed this box which was attached to this television to the other television which was about 12 ft away. I noticed the 2nd TV was my grandparents television from around the late 60's, early 70's that we used to watch when we were kids visiting them. I loved its beauty. It was covered in a tweed like fabric and had pearly dials. Real class...they don't make them like that anymore...I called for my sister to see if she recognized it and we shared in the memory. I started switching the dials to feel and hear the sounds to tickle my memories of it. 02PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM My sister and dad and I are at our old childhood home. It is uninhabited and we are in the garage. My sister has her hand on the door to the living room but is having second thoughts of entering. She was feeling scared to see what it looks like now which may be disturbing. This was a rare moment where she was more emotionally affected than I. We never went in (I am emotionless). 02PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM Driving outside through a town filled with young people (early 20's) walking the streets. It was some sort of festival and I noticed a few girls wearing very little and I felt annoyed/irritated. They were so full of themselves. The street narrowed down to an alley and we are just running over anyone that doesn't get out of the way. I feel this is wrong and we should be going a little slower to allow them time to move. The crowd starts to thin out as we go further down this road and the kids are getting younger and younger (11-13). Some wear school uniforms. They are less in the way but I feel we are going to get into trouble for running people over because we aren't supposed to be there. Then, a large, metal green/gray barrier pops up from below the ground and we can no longer move. I think I am relieved. We park the car and get out to walk. We are met by a lot of angry parents on the other end of this long alley who have lots of apples and fruit they are using as weapons. They hurl hard apples at us and I am the only one who picks up these weapons of fruit to retaliate. These people throwing them at us are angry parents but I don't know why. I throw and miss several times whilst getting hit hard. I finally hit this lady in the leg and am very pleased. She yelps and I make fun of her. She disgusts me. Like she is ignorant and stupid. I am really angry with these people and find them intolerable. 02PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM My daughter is having a party in my home. I don't like the people invited. There are lots and they are lounging around. Some of them look really unpleasant and I don't like the idea that she is associating with them. My home is in chaos. I try to get her to listen to me and my disapproval. I'm getting angrier as she doesn't listen. I get physically violent with her. I am frustrated and feel an incredibly uncontrollable rage at her defiance combined with her pretty, vulnerable looks. I feel very masculine and brutal in my violence. 01PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM Cousins and grandparents are in the basement. It is like a long way down to them, almost like an escalator in a tube station. It is almost time to go but I feel I need to spend some time with my maternal grandfather. I make my way down and pat my grandmother who has dementia on the head and go to my grandfather. Then we are told we need to go by a man. He was our guide. A sort of militant or mountain man. We left in an open military vehicle and as we left (driving through the house) I noticed there were two little desklamps on that emitted purple light and really close to the heads of two of my grandmothers antique dolls with painted faces. I was concerned they would be damaged by the unnatural light more than the heat. We drove away. Then I thought more about it, and asked my Grandfather what he thought about the light damaging the old dolls. I was trying to describe the type of bulb/lamps that they were to him. We ended up driving through a shop's lamp department and I spotted the same lamps there. Grandfather knew the answer. 02PF 2 XX:XX:XX DREAM With my dad and this man/guide and we are near a car or helicopter. There is a connection between me and the guide and he reaches for me to help me to where he is and I feel he is so manly. I am aware of my dad in the back seat and feel a bit uncomfortably embarrassed as he sees the connection between us. When he reaches for me I feel he is sacrificing his safety for mine. He is waste deep in a pool of icy water near our vehicle and I worry for him. He won't budge until I am safe so I climb in the car and then he does too. I worry about him getting hypothermia and roll up his wet trousers to expose his thighs. They are freezing. There is no blanket. I want to warm him up but I am in the back seat and cannot get to him. I notice a very deep cut in his thigh and a bullet wound through his hand. I examine them and am glad he is cold because everything is contracted, constricting from the cold. This keeps him from bleeding and also the tight skin around the bullet wound holds back the fat pads under his punctured skin. We then rush someone to the hospital to deliver a baby and in the chaos I lose him before I can say goodbye. I feel I may never see him again which made me feel disappointed. I then have an alternate ending to the dream where we are headed to our respective homes and he asks me to come visit him. He officially wants to see me again and now I know where he lives. Utah. I am excited because I could live in Utah. 02PF 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM Visions in place of dreams, dots, like dice, dots clustered together. The feeling was playful and adventurous, slightly exciting like in a casino. 04PM 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm on a double decker bus with other people. My skirt has got dirty and there's an unsymmetrical pattern that's like a crusty layer of dirt on the front. When we look closer its lots of little crystals, some white and some yellowy like sulphur. I have an urge to taste them but think this unwise. We decide we'll get them analysed. 08PF 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in a house in the countryside trying to carry a long plank of wood through a door way, but the long length made it difficult to navigate. There was a woman and her husband with an autistic child in a wheel chair outside the house on the lawn. I couldn't see the child in the wheel chair because it was covered with a crochet blanket. I was surprised to see the wheelchair, it drew a serious feeling that was out of character with the rest of the dream. 12PM 3 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream that I was in an unfamiliar town and I was waiting to meet up with someone. The area was very quiet, mostly suburban with very few people around. I put my handbag down on a low wall for a few moments, as I think I was going to a public toilet and did not want to take the bag with me. I walked away a few paces, but was worried someone would steal it although there was no one around. I turned round to check it was safe just before I went into the toilet, and a man was picking it up; he looked quite tough and unapproachable (street-wise). I was very worried, but had to try to save my bag, so I said that it was mine and could he put it down please. The man gave me a sulky ('dirty') look, but to my surprise/relief he actually put the bag down and walked off. I still felt uneasy in case I met him again. Next I was in shop and there were one or two other people in there so I was not alone now, and I did not have much longer to wait around until I met up with the person I knew, so felt better. 03PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM By the side of a lake- like an old quarry. Its summer and we're in swim suits. We need to swim across (deep water) to get to the other side. Husband goes in 1st with youngest son (10 yr old) and holds him up above the water in a way that seems impossible (I'm also a bit puzzled as to why he's doing this because son can swim pretty well). I'm left with a small pile of things- a towel and some other things- which need to stay dry but I don't think I'll be able to swim and hold them above the water like husband is doing. I think I'll have to wait for him to swim back for them. My son starts to come back for them around the side of the lake. I think this can't be quite right because if you can get around the side why do you need to swim across the lake? So I remodel the landscape of the dream so that now there's a vertical cliff between me and the other side of the lake. I can throw the things down to my son but none of us could get up or down. Sense that the illogicality of the dream has become logical! Sense of being cut off from them and not cut off at different points in the dream. There was a sense of both dreaming and being aware I'm dreaming and 'watching the dream' to this dream. 08PF 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was at a circus watching a man was walking a high wire inside an enclosed stadium. He had fallen and caught hold of the tight rope. After he had done this I noticed that he was now dressed as a clown. I was surprised that he had changed into a clown but couldn't comprehend how this had happened. I was worried for the man's life. He seemed to struggle with the strength to keep a hold, but each time he nearly let go he would act clownish in comical way where he would go all floppy. He acted like it wasn't really a problem and would then take hold again. I knew that this was an act and that he was really struggling. I feared that he would fall to his death, I felt desperate for the man but there was nothing anyone could do but to sit and watch him hang on. It felt like a tragic situation of life or death but I was forced to observe. There was a lot of tension as I watched. It took for what seemed like forever for him to be rescued. In my mind in the dream I had watched him hang there for 20 minutes as he struggled but acted in a relaxed fashion to keep himself from falling to his death. 12PM 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM I stood by a wooden fence and gate, when a figure emerged from the mist and strode towards me. It was cold and damp. The figure had what looked like either goat or horse legs and was wearing trousers. The top half of the body appeared to be human. It looked like the mythic figure, Pan. He had a fixed focus of direction and purpose. I was frightened by his supernatural nature. He strode by me without acknowledging my existence. I was really surprised that he didn't even notice me 12PM 4 XX:XX:XX DREAM I went down into the underground to catch a train. The old Victorian tunnels were deep and evoked erotic thoughts. There was no one around and I yearned for risky outdoor sex. I felt really turned on. I then got onto an underground train which came out from a tunnel and went across a wide river with a thriving metropolitan area on its banks. The train powered at high speed across the huge expanse of the river, it felt thrilling, like a fun park ride. There was a sensation of floating above the river because you couldn't see the tracks on either side. 12PM 5 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was with a lot of people but didn't feel I fit in. My boyfriend came by on his bicycle. I was so grateful he had come because I felt alone. I was happy to have someone to share in the experience with me. 02PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM I can remember the sensation of being in a tunnel and also remember a square shape, but I am unable to remember any more detail. 07PF 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM It was at night in the country side of what felt like an island. There was luscious vegetation and the moon light was hitting the surface of the vegetation. The parameters of the area I was in were gated with invisible electrified fences. I had a sense that the park was an animal testing facility. At one point an animal went near the fence. When it did the fence lit up and three circles or hoops of light appear and descended over the animal. I could see that this animal was cartoon animated, harmless. The animal then disappeared when the hoops of light disappeared, as if into thin air. 12PM 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was standing next to a car on the inside of the fence when an animal began to approach me along the fence line. It was dark and I couldn't see but it was stalking me and moving slowly towards me. I was petrified and feared for my life. The animal was hard to identify. I could see its black back as it moved closer. In the dream I was screaming at the top of my lungs but in waking life it was muted and I could barely manage a sound. I awoke. My mind turned to thoughts about monkeys in animal testing labs. The thoughts were linked to the dream. I sensed cages where individual monkeys were trapped in a clinical setting. They were isolated and had no comfort. It was soulless existence. 12PM 6 XX:XX:XX DREAM I wake from a dream in which there seem to be many bright colours around me. The people in the dream are wearing clothes in bright primary colours and it is as if I am surrounded by the colours you would find in a children's bright paint palette. 07PF 7 XX:XX:XX DREAM There's a yellow snake all tangled up in a confused, tangled mass of string, fabric, toys and bits of all sorts. Its in my Mum's lap. Its like the snake is part of the mass and its been there for a while and it can't do much harm all tangled up like that. But it starts to slither its way out onto the chair. I pick up a rolling pin to kill it and stop it hurting anyone but I can't bring myself to do it. It fits the idea of chaos- a tangled mass. It brings tears to my eyes- I feel really bad for the snake because its not its fault. 08PF 7 XX:XX:XX DREAM A party outdoors near some old garages. Lots of people coming and it's completely dark. There's lots of food. I can see the nose of an immaculate classic VW beetle poking out the broken bottom bit of a garage door. I'm admiring this gleaming, beautiful bit of craftsmanship which stands out with pale colours and chrome against the darkness and shabbiness of my surroundings. A few other people are admiring it with me. I'm writing my diary and keep forgetting bits. There are two men with mental health problems. One has taken a fancy to me and I tell him that I have a partner. I'm cautious because he may not like hearing that and I'm afraid he might lose it and then kill me. 01PF 8 XX:XX:XX DREAM I have some important information regarding another prover and I desperately need to get this information to the person in charge. However, I keep being followed by a man who is trying to stop me handing over the information, which is wrapped up in bright pink packaging. Whenever I get close to the person I need to talk to, the man who is trying to stop me, turns up and prevents me handing the package over. We are told that we have to disguise our writing so that no-one knows which diary belongs to which prover. This is a very important part of the proving and we are told several times how important it is that the identity of the prover is kept secret. 07PF 8 XX:XX:XX DREAM Sitting around with a group. We are talking about a boy who is in hospital with a serious mental condition. Someone tells tutor that he can take the boy out of hospital and treat him because they can't do anything for him. Tutor is going to look after him at his home and I feel really moved by that. I ask him if the boy has already been damaged. When I ask the question I can feel the emotion rise up and he sees that so he takes me to another table and tells me it's going to be ok. He tells me I'm a very complicated person but that's ok too and that he loves me. We are looking very deeply into each other's eyes and I find a huge comfort in that. I want to tell him that I love him very much and I'll miss him but the words won't come out and I'm weeping inside. I see my colleague walk by and she looks slightly annoyed at us talking alone because she has to walk away and she is upset too. I go over to her and she's weeping. I make her a cup of tea. There are two very large gravy jugs, in that elegant, elongated shape both made of beautiful pure white china. I pour boiling water into each one and then place a teabag in each, first dipping it in, by the long piece of string to which it is attached, before letting go of the string so there is no splash. I watch the bags, one each floating in the water and realise we could actually share a pot of tea so quickly, before any tea diffuses out, I take one out and put it into the other jug squashing them together to make the tea diffuse out. 01PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm looking after little girl who in real life is physically and mentally handicap. But in the dream she's perfectly capable. I see something like the neck of a horse with bits chopped out along the upper edge of its neck, It's a mathematical equation. A man with mental health problems is telling me poetry. It's beautiful but I'm not in love with him and I sense danger 01PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in the corridor of a school with a very young daughter. The corridor continued round a ninety degree bend just where we were and there were lots of people milling around. There was stuff strewn over the floor in the form of what appeared to be little parcels wrapped in something coloured and patterned. There was a sack involved and some other mothers. Not sure what we were all supposed to be doing, but there was a feeling of anxiety there. 09PF 9 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm looking after my daughter and her friend and I'm taking them to a swimming pool but I'm not sure where it is. They rush on ahead hurtling down a hill at breakneck speed through a residential area. I'm at the top of the hill watching them. They are jumping over metal rails, like hurdles, shouting with glee. There is absolutely no fear in doing this dangerous thing and I watch without fear, just a bit of anticipation. It's almost impossible to think they have any control at such speed but they clear the hurdles easily. It's super-human and they seem like wild, shrieking demonesses. I see two other people try and they trip badly, flying off into the semi-darkness. 01PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream about having to collect beer bottles. The long shape and the up and down flow of the bottles' form seemed very important and significant to me. Also to some extent the colour - I was fascinated by it. The bottle is green and has a narrow neck at the top, it becomes a little wider, but stays a long shape. 03PF 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was lying on a surgical table about to have an operation. The anaesthetist began to give me an IV anaesthetic. I said there was nothing wrong with me. She insisted there was and gave me the anaesthetic, I began to lose consciousness. Felt like I was falling backwards, I felt really heavy, things were beginning to constrict and close off my consciousness, I was losing control. I fought this and tried to stay awake. I was aware that I should be unconscious by this stage and notice everyone had taken their eyes off me and were rotating the bed into position to prepare for the surgical procedure, it was about to start. I closed my eyes and realised that I was only half in and half out of consciousness. 12PM 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was on a boat on a fast flowing and very deep river that fed into the dam. It's current was powerful and I was fearful about falling and being swept away. There was someone driving the boat at high speed. We went up and down the river twice and each time we would get to the end the driver would swing the boat hard in a circular fashion to go back up stream. He was being reckless to draw a thrill, and bank the boat hard to its side at great speed before going straight at full throttle. I was petrified. I asked him not to do this because we might lose our balance and fall in the water. At one point he stalled the boat and lost balance through its loss of momentum. I then argued that I knew this would happen, I was angry and annoyed that no one had listened to me. 12PM 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM I found a key in my pocket and opened one of the lockers. There were unopened letters and belongings that I never knew were there. There was a sense of space and needing to get away, to be distant from a job that I didn't like and where I didn't want to be told what to do. 12PM 10 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream that I am in an old castle and I hear some noise outside in the courtyard. As I open the door I see a man in a military uniform throwing bombs around the open area, there are small fire and explosions everywhere. I look at the man for a moment, as I think about trying to reason with him, but he is shouting and seems in his own world. I cannot tell if he is speaking English and I do not understand him. I decide that there is no point in trying to calm him, then I see my autistic son who does not understand what is going on, and seems both anxious and excited. I rush over to him to get him away and to somewhere safe, then I see a big scratch and blood on the right side of his face. I ask him how it happened and he says it was a dog. 03PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in the backseat of a car on the way to my house with two ex-friends. They were annoying me, being really loud and obnoxious. I was tired and wanted quiet, they were not respecting my needs. I felt totally out of control, like they had invaded my life. I finally snapped and told them to stop talking to me. I think I screamed it. I needed my space and was fighting for it. One challenged my character. I defended myself. They didn't understand the truth. I felt totally out of control. At home I passed out and when I woke up they were both being loud and annoying and messing up my place. I almost exploded with anger. I had fought so hard for order and the flat was totally cluttered. My ex-boyfriend was talking loudly on the phone to a friend. I tried to get his attention to tell him he needed to leave before my current boyfriend came by but he was too busy with his conversation. It was then I noticed that the front door to my flat (which opened onto a glass lobby) was open and one of my cats was just sneaking out. I ran after him and in the lobby saw another one of my cats was outside the lobby in the parking lot. I squatted down to try and be calm and called for her. I was terrified she would be gone forever. I saw a Hassidic Jew across the street walking. I yelled for my cat and found myself calling out the name of my cat as I awoke. 02PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm at my old house. Its no longer mine and its being done up/converted (for the rental market). I'm sitting in my car in the drive observing what they're doing and I really don't like it. They're attaching pictures to the backs of doors and I think that that's just not right so I tell 1 of the decorators (and they're horrible pictures anyway). She brings all the pictures out and throws them all down to the ground smashing them all. It seems like a bit of a triumph. 08PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm dressed up as Jesus with a cross on my back. Its some sort of fund raising campaign. My friend is dressed as Mary and also has a much smaller cross. We're supposed to be doing some sort of play/skit but I don't really know anything about it. I'm embarrassed by my costume and don't want to walk through streets to get to where we're going. I'm embarrassed because its nearly Christmas and the cross belongs to Easter. When we get to where the students are gathering there's also a vicar waiting to do something else and I'm embarrassed that I'm mocking his faith. It turns out that we're fund-raising for underprivileged kids to go on cruise holidays. I'm not sure whether this is something I want to continue to campaign for in the future! 08PF 11 XX:XX:XX DREAM I can't find my way back to the classroom- I'm lost and don't recognise any of the surroundings even though I've worked here for years! I then find myself in an enormous cafeteria. I queue past lots of different food service areas but all I want is a cup of tea. When I get to the end there's a whole room full of different types of tea. Shelves and shelves full of different packets, all with different types of tea. I just want ordinary tea and I can't it find anywhere. I spy a packet of PG Tips but when I get to where I thought they were I can't find them. I go back to the cash desks to see if ordinary tea is there or to ask for help finding it but there's no-one available to help. 08PF 12 XX:XX:XX DREAM I went down into the underground train station and waited for a train. A train quickly pulled into a platform, initially there was a little bit of confusion as to whether this was the train I needed take. I was panicked about not getting the train in time so I just got onto the train without being sure if it took me to where I was going. I pushed a Negro man out of the way to be the first to board the train. When I got on the train I realised that the door opened to a single compartment that had a single small seat for one person. I squeezed into the compartment and realised that I couldn't fit inside. I couldn't fit and I tried to cram myself in, it was tight, restricted. The train was about to take off and I had to back out quickly. The Negro man confirmed that I wouldn't fit in. I then got back out of the train and stood on the platform. 12PM 12 XX:XX:XX DREAM A town goes up the other side of the valley and I can hear singing there. I can see people standing on their roofs holding placards. Each house has a different word of the song on their placard and they sing their word of the song in turn, raising their placard. It's a joyful song and I'm thinking how perfectly timed it is. I'm aware that I'm not part of this joyfulness but admire how well executed it is. I feel slightly wistful and lonely but not unhappy. I'm accepting of my position here on the other side of the valley...I go down towards the town and, halfway down the slope, come across an indoor market which is a cross between an alternative, hippy kind of place and a basic town market. I feel alone but not excluded and look at some of the clothes 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM I visit a neighbour where she is working in an indoor market in a dingy but homely caf\u00e9. I'm making complicated calculations in my head working out her earnings and find it is less than the minimum wage and I try to tell her how bad that is. She is too desperate to care. A business man in an elegant silver-grey suit sits next to us and smokes a cigarette. Immediately I don't like him because he is a business man but she knows him. As they are talking I look at his long legs and find them elegant and attractive. I then find him attractive and start fantasizing about us having a covert sexual relationship. I see myself in this scenario as a single woman on her own having an illicit affair in her apartment. It plays out a bit like some stylish, black & white continental film. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM There is a memorial place for Lady Diana which is in a council estate. They have talks and services here which are run by a black evangelical community. I go in with some friends and it's very serious. The preacher is behind a big glass window and we sit outside to listen to him. We go into an educational suite where we sit at things like computers. We feel a bit like messing around because it's so serious and we don't really know what we're doing. A machine allows me to take photos of myself in quick succession. I fool around and make silly, contorted faces. When they come out they are really grotesque and we all find them funny. I find the distortion a bit shocking. The machine has made me look a bit like Lady Diana and a bit like me. 01PF 13 XX:XX:XX DREAM I send the boys in to start packing and decide I just need to pop out to the local town. I don't tell the boys I'm going because I'm not going to be long. I'm in the town in my oldest son's car. I've not driven it before. The gear change system is completely different and I can't remember how it works. I manage to get into gear and pull into a workshop/factory forecourt to turn round and stop to work out and practice the gear changes. When I start to go again the key breaks in the ignition. I manage to get the broken part out of the ignition but now I think I'll have to find a shop with a key cutter to get a new key cut. I'm starting to worry about the boys now because they don't know where I've gone and I've been away much longer than I intended to be. I think about phoning them but they haven't got a mobile. So I think I could phone my husband to contact the boys but then I realise that my mobile isn't working. I also need to let the factory/workshop whose forecourt I'm stuck on what's happened and I can't lock the car so I'm worried about its security and hope their security guard might keep an eye on it. I go into the reception- there's a queue and I have to wait. I think this dream exemplifies how life has felt since the start of the proving- complicated; a series of little things going wrong one on top of the other; can't get back to my boys; can't make contact with anyone.08PF 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM There was a beautiful woman standing in front of me. She had dark long hair, she was strong and feminine and in control of her life. I watched on from a distance, as if detached. There was a dilemma. I loved this woman, she was intelligent, challenging, wonderful company and she would be an ideal lover and partner for life. The problem was that I was gay and she was straight, so it could never work. The room was like a warehouse style loft apartment. 12PM 14 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was responsible for a couple of children, I was the counselor of a small, designated group. The head leader was showing me to my children but I got lost from them on the way to the parking lot because I became distracted by a group of elderly gathered in another area. In the group of elders I recognized. In real life they are not that elderly and quite fun but in the dream they looked much older, as if they had entered into another stage of their lives. I thought that they were not old enough to be there but I felt shocked at how much they'd aged. I walked with one of them on my way to the parking lot as I was really happy to see her. As I had lost the group of school kids and volunteer adults I was supposed to be with, another man had also gotten lost and he was one of the principals so I wasn't too worried because I was with him. I was given a bag of toys to entertain the kids with and when I spotted my group in the parking lot I started running towards them, turning the bag in circles over my head like a lasso and screaming like a cartoon joker or clown with great intensity, as I wanted to win their affection after having disconnected with them earlier. I took them to a campervan like area with tents set up for them. They had a choice of where to sleep and 1 girl ran into a tent that she claimed. 2 other girls followed her in even though there was only supposed to be 2 maximum. I turned a blind eye to it even though there were several other empty tents as I didn't want one of them to feel left out. 02PF 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM In a high church. Black and white people. Very formal and well dressed and sombre. I choose a seat. At first I want the blue, rotating office chair but think I might not be able to control it swinging round and making a noise. There doesn't seem to be many of the general public. A man of distinction, a religious man, right close behind me to my right shoulder, is making a speech. He has very black, matte skin, is stocky and big but with fie features. I can feel his tremendous power, it is very dark because there is so much of it and it feels really concentrated. As he speaks I can feel my whole body's hairs stand on end as if I'm having massive goose bumps, I'm frozen in a position of hunching down into the chair. It's not so much fear, more an intense sensory experience of his immense, dark power. I feel wary of moving so I feel frozen in my position. I wonder whether he may have met many cruel leaders in his life and is carrying their energy. Then another man, emerging from the gospel choir at the front, goes to the pulpit and starts preaching. He is making a loud snapping sound rhythm with his hands; it's threatening and makes everyone attend. The atmosphere is really concentrated, sombre and tense. He is wearing ornate religious costume, with gold and white, of the Catholic Church. He is black, much paler skin, with gingery blond afro haircut. He frightens me and I'm trying to open my eyes, they're like slits, hot and watery. He shouts at me \"Shut your eyes, blue eyes!\" Then people are singing in the choir and then other people are making speeches. They are talking about seeking the truth. Then I see one of my colleagues and she is lounging in a pulpit seat looking very relaxed with her legs stretched out; she shouts out \"What are you going to do with the truth!\" No one answers. When we're outside I want to speak to her and her man friend, because I admire her outspokenness, but they have gone. I have to go and stay with my sister but I have no phone, no map and I don't know where to go. I ask people from the congregation but they can't be bothered with me. I feel completely lost for any direction. 01PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM Parasailing over body of water with my dad as a passenger. He had no fear which is unusual because he doesn't swim and is not that adventuresome. I was going up and down, having trouble controlling the contraption but felt more humoured than frustrated. 02PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM Swimming the English Channel. I had chosen bright yellow clothing to wear so I would be seen and I was in the water. I recall the water being very cold, dirty and quite choppy. I was worried about sharks and being eaten and hoped I would be rescued in time if a shark was spotted. Despite this I was determined to do the swim. 06PF 17 XX:XX:XX DREAM Working at the school in the art department. Trying to put up a piece of work. Can't find it and start getting extremely frustrated and angry because the glue on the wall is drying. My boss is leaning over the sink saying \"What's the point, it all ends up in the same way.\" I am trying to cheer her up but I'm tired of it. 01PF 18 XX:XX:XX DREAM I find a swimming pool round the corner and there are big, hulking school boys in their school uniforms swimming lengths for charity. They look ungainly and exhausted, making lots of splashes and noise. Some boys are doing life saving down a fast running channel and one boy is reassuring his rescue that he is not going to let him go underwater. There is an old man with white hair in a ponytail, wearing all his clothes, surfing on flat water on a little buoyancy aid, skimming up and down with the agility of a young boy. I admire him for his quietness, inwardness and balance. I dive into the water in my clothes and feel wonderful, surrounded by the water but also enjoying the feel of the wet clothes clinging tightly onto my skin. 01PF 18 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream that I was out in a dark street that was lit by street lamps. It seemed to be some time in the past, possibly 80-100 years ago according to the buildings and people's clothes. I noticed some dust, fluff and green leaves on the pavement that had formed into a cylindrical shape that was rolling along the pavement, being blown by the wind. I stopped walking to watch this for a time. Suddenly I realised that there were several people in the street who felt sinister, it was quiet and I should not be standing around, but should walk on. There was some mild anxiety about my safety, but no strong emotions. 03PF 18 XX:XX:XX DREAM Children playing in a big wooden box with compartments, tunnels, different sized entry and exit holes. I'm watching them from the outside looking at the side of the box. It's like a game and they can crawl through, into and out of, compartments and tunnels. Sometimes turn into adults. 01PF 20 XX:XX:XX DREAM With many of my friends. They have all over-indulged in something, I'm not sure what, and they are all crashed out together like a pack of animals. Bit dog-like. I am the only one alert and I'm around them. 01PF 20 XX:XX:XX DREAM I felt alone and left out. I overheard a vendor say that there were a few rich teenagers they were befriending only to get their money off of them. I felt sorry for the rich girls as she would not realize she was being used for her money, and also disappointed at the vendors for being so closed minded just because she was rich. 02PF 21 0:09:00 DREAM Cleaning out my studio. Son of a friend is cleaning it out for me and I feel invaded. This son keeps changing from one son to another of a friend. The son comes and goes. My other friend, who shares the studio with me, comes. I ask her to make me a coffee and I feel really tired. She moans that she has a cold and I feel let down by her. It makes me feel really angry towards her. 01PF 22 XX:XX:XX DREAM In basement with family. Carrying nephew around and loving my family. I looked out the basement window and saw a scary looking old Amish family with hippopotamus teeth above ground level. They had one daughter who was beautiful, without the teeth. She was wearing braces. I chatted to her asking if her braces hurt. She said no. I knew she had just gotten them on and I knew they would start hurting her later but didn't want to tell her what she was in for. In the dream I knew she was breaking a cycle in regards to her family and the hippopotamus teeth. 02PF 22 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dream about a closed door to a bathroom and there was a large pool of water seeping out from under the door. Was preparing to decide what to do next when I woke up 09PF 22 XX:XX:XX DREAM My whole family was getting ready to leave and go off to work. I felt immediately put out as I had nowhere else to go. I went along with it all and made out that I too was busy and had to get somewhere. Everyone was detached and distant with me, nothing was familiar, there was no love or connection from anyone, they weren't happy to see me. I felt out of place and extremely self conscious, but no body was prepared to say anything, they were happier to just make me feel like I shouldn't be there. Everything was the same but the pool was bigger. I went to the toilet and closed the door to get some privacy. I realised that I had no way to get to where I was going, which was nowhere. I felt alone and isolated in an inhospitable place that was once my home. I felt displaced, unwelcomed, unloved and alien. I was overly aware of everyone cutting me out and blocking off from their life. I was an outsider in an unwelcoming place. 12PM 22 0:08:00 DREAM I remember seeing my proving supervisor standing in the dark of night on a railway track under a full moon. The light was blue-black and back lit by the moon. 12PM 23 XX:XX:XX DREAM As she coasted the car past me she nearly hit me, but she wasn't aware that she had done this. She had changed the way she looked. She had bleached her hair white, it was long and pulled back into a pony tail. It took her some time to figure out who I was. She seemed distant, like she wasn't really interested in seeing me, preoccupied and had things to do and places to go. I felt slightly rejected by her actions, she was obviously busy but it felt quite personal. Despite my understanding of her actions I didn't pull back myself, instead I continued to try and bridge over to her. 12PM 25 XX:XX:XX DREAM Going to car rental place. There was a line of people behind me and I felt lucky to be the one at the front, the next person to get the ticket takers attention. Suddenly the ticket taker man got occupied with something on his side of the glass window, doing something other than receiving me. I continued to wait. I felt patient as I was the next person to be served. When the attendant was ready he directed me to a group of people who are about to embark on a walk to their respective cars. I am confused because I thought I was supposed to be alone. The group begins walking as if going on a tour. We are all Americans, the majority being young men. I am one of 2 females and as we embark I mention to the other female that I like her shirt. It reminds me of a variation of one I have at home. We notice that we both got them from the same shop. We bond over this similarity. As we talk I lose the group and those behind me look to me for guidance. With confidence, I say 'we can find them, I think I know where they went'. Normally I would feel the pressure of responsibility but I did not in this case. We approach a dock. The wooden planks are high off the ground like scaffolding down to the water, several feet below. The wooden sidewalk I am on abruptly stops and I catch myself before I fall. The drop is further down than I had first anticipated. In that moment I imagine what it would feel like to hit the ground so far below. I think I may have felt like my legs would have snapped like wooden matchsticks. I stop to reassess. The group ahead of me notices I have lost them and they are now below me trying to guide me. I feel calm but the attention is on me and they are surprised I can't find my way down to them. There are wooden beams everywhere but no way down to them. I wish I could understand as the group behind me is depending on my decision to connect with the rest of them again. I think there is a time restraint for us all to go and get our respective cars. I am trying to show I can manage. I back track my steps off of the plank as I feel completely unsure of how to proceed. Taking a few steps back will allow me to reassess the situation. But I cannot see the way down to them (40-50 ft below). Finally I give up and someone comes from outside this group (I think) to show me. It is so obvious there is a ramp behind me to the right that appears to walk down. It has horizontal beams for traction. I feel I let everyone down for not seeing it before. We proceed. 02PF 26 XX:XX:XX DREAM Women and men with children meeting each other. They are all plain, shabby people, kindly and gentle. Looking for companionship. There is an old, decrepit water feature with opened out petal shapes made of concrete, bit jaded, with water falling into them. Children are bathing in them. I'm looking after someone's child. She is an unattractive child, about 3, but I sort of like her because she is friendly. Her father is not there. I'm sleeping in a derelict place and she wakes up in the middle of the night and comes to me. I want to sleep but I get up to play with her because I feel sorry for her being alone. I am now with the girl's father and his girlfriend. We meet his ex-partner who looks older, very made up and stiff. Her dyed hair is curled like an old lady's though she isn't that old and she's dressed in rather old fashioned clothes. I can't remember her name as I go to introduce her even though I remembered it just moments ago. She is insulted and starts criticising me. I apologise. As I try to explain how I got it so wrong I get frustrated with myself and, because I cannot appease her, I get angry. I start shouting at her and walk away. 01PF 29 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was on a disused harbour island that had been completely fortified. I was inside the fort. It felt dry and light. I was looking down a darkened stairway and I had a camera with me. There was someone who had gone down the stairs before me and I decided that I wanted to capture the stairway from the top with a photo. I went to take a photo and remembered that I still had the lens protector on. I took the lens protector off and then became excited about taking a photo. There was a sense of urgency about taking this photo, I was now standing halfway down and felt hurried about trying to get the photo, it had to be taken now. 12PM 29 XX:XX:XX DREAM Giant black crows outside window of bedroom, trying to get in under screen. I was scared and trying to keep them out without getting bitten. Then my cats were on the inside trying to get out and I removed each one from the window sill but there was always another one to be removed, including one of my cats that has been dead for 2 years now. The crows had bulging heads with balding scalps, with purply distended blood vessels like Darth Vader's head when his helmet was removed. One bird broke his beak trying to get in and he just tore off the bit that was hanging off in order to function better without feeling. I felt scared, invaded and trying to keep control calmly. The day before I had seen a black crow, but I was admiring it and it was a peaceful moment. 02PF 30 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm sitting round a table with some women. To my right is a friend of mine. Up on a hill there is an old building, a bit Grecian looking with pillars. Bulldozers are pulling it down. I predict that a piece of the building will hit us. At that moment a large piece shoots towards us like a meteorite and hits me in the eyeball. My bones protect my eye from being damaged and I don't really feel the pain. At the same time it hits my friend's left ear and the left back side of her head, which feels like my right ear. She makes a huge fuss so no one pays attention to me. This feels typical and I accept it. 01PF 30 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in a disused army barracks. The location of the barracks felt isolated and abandoned. One of the other provers was sharing a dormitory with myself and another. I was going to the shops and she asked me if I could get her something. She handed me some money from her purse and told me to get what I needed and that she would pay. I could tell that she was probably well off but wanted to tell her that she didn't need to do this. At the same time she seemed to have a lot of money, I was really tempted to not worry about it and to take the cash, after all she had a lot of money and she didn't seem at all worried about giving me what I needed. 12PM 30 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was in a hotel. There was a drag queen miming to a song. She was followed by one drag queen after another and each mimed to the song, but as this went on each drag queen became less and less interested in the song and they were becoming very lazy in their miming. 12PM 30 XX:XX:XX DREAM With a group of people. We are escaping and trying to get somewhere. We are crawling on our bellies through an extremely narrow crevice which runs horizontally in the rock. Rock feels like massive boulders which have a huge weight. A blind man is with us. His sensitive fingers can feel tunnels made by spiders as ridges running along the floor. The idea of these spiders underneath us is menacing and sinister. 01PF 32 XX:XX:XX DREAM Dreamt that a woman was having an inappropriate relationship with her father. It wasn't sexual but it was just on the boundary between appropriate and not appropriate. Charges were pressed on the father; not by the daughter but in her name. She did not want to press charges and felt her privacy was invaded. She could not escape comments and looks by her peers and colleagues. I felt she was like a victim in a witch hunt, paralyzed with oppressive disdain. Someone filed a law suit against the lawsuit claiming her father was unjustly charged, but it wasn't her doing as she was stuck in shock and frustration. 02PF 32 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm looking down on the gardens of very tall town houses. The houses are taller than me. I know that the people that live here are very rich because their houses are so tall. The gardens are barren and derelict, no trees, no flowers. There is a grandfather standing in one with his children and grandchildren. They're having a party and are just standing around. The gardens are very small and they're crowded in. There is a water feature - steps and some concrete ponds with barely any water. It's all very grey. 01PF 33 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm at school and a boy is misbehaving. I shout at him and he comes towards me in a menacing way. His facial expression predominates in this dream and it feels like we're reading and responding to each other's facial expressions in a really strong way. I back off and feel intimidated by his facial expression. I try another tack and tell him to listen to what I am saying. I start counselling him and he becomes more passive. I tell him I acknowledge his anger and he has issues with it. His face softens and gets sad and serious. I pat him on the back to comfort him and mistakenly touch the top of his buttocks. I'm aware that I have accidentally crossed boundaries and hope he doesn't notice but he does and starts putting his hands on my legs. I feel confused by these physical messages. The physical sensation is pleasant but the situation is really uncomfortable and I'm trying to move away. I then realise he is gay and his touching is part of an affectation. I feel relieved that the touching is not sexually driven because then no boundaries have been crossed. But I also feel he has used me, without my permission, to demonstrate publicly his affected gayness and this repulses me. 01PF 33 XX:XX:XX DREAM In some themed indoor park. Lots of people having fun. I'm watching them. There is an old lady on what looks like a massive skateboard but it's actually a trolley. She is all dressed up, vaudeville style, and weaving in and out on this trolley with speed and gusto. I speak to her and she tells me she was an actress. 01PF 33 XX:XX:XX DREAM We are driving to a gathering of people waiting for a superstar to turn up. The crowd is drab, it's getting dark and feels like it's going to rain. I'm on the perimeter and want to go, I feel uncomfortable and don't feel I belong here. A male friend of mine persuades me to lie down by a wired fence on a dusty, dingy verge. He puts his arm round me and I then feel protected and a bit better in this derelict, dingy place. 01PF 35 XX:XX:XX DREAM I'm with a group of skilled climbers. They are about 30 years old, mainly men and I think there is just one woman. They are friendly and a happy group. I feel like the same age as them but also my 51 years old. They are guiding me up a vertical rocky/sandy slope which bends round like a road. It's almost vertical. I'm scared but I trust them and don't look back. We use mainly our arms and can feel myself pulling my body upwards with great strength. When we get to the top there is a platform of rock that juts out into space. Even though it has a rail I cannot go onto it. I watch a man go out which makes me crouch down on the floor with vertigo. I can sense the infinite space below and it overwhelms and scares me. 01PF 35 XX:XX:XX DREAM We were all on blow up water beds and paddling out in the deep area of the water. The water was deep but the surf was calm. As I was paddling along I fell into the water. I began to panic. There was sense that I was out of my depth and that I couldn't coordinate myself back onto the water bed, I was also slightly adrift from the group, this left me to feel isolated and in a deeper danger as I might drown. 12PM 35 XX:XX:XX DREAM Swimming underwater, under ice maybe? Icy cold sensation. With my sister. 01PF 37 XX:XX:XX DREAM Having a party thrown for me. A gala with 100's of people from my life, even high school class members that I wasn't close with. I was surprised they took the time to come. They were all there for this party thrown in my honour. The mingling outside with a cocktail hour was followed by us entering a venue which housed an auditorium. As I walked in I realized that were not invited to this meeting, they would not be allowed as they were not members. I felt the party was breaking up and I was worried they would leave. I was not ready for the party to end. 02PF 37 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was waiting in a busy indoor shopping mall which was connected to an underground train station. I was full of dread and I didn't want to face this meeting. I avoided my responsibility and knew there would be consequences so I returned. I was walking down a walkway in the mall past some shops to an exit outside. I noticed that I was wearing a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up because it was really hot. I then realised that my left sleeve was rolled over my elbow and when I pulled the sleeve back I could see a dot of blood on the rolled up shirt. It then dawned on me that I had been shooting up recreational drugs. When I saw this I got really upset with myself because I thought that I had come off the rails. I wasn't in the mental space I needed to be in. I walked out of the mall and and noticed a white van at the traffic lights. I jumped into the back of the van and saw my ex-boyfriend from 15 years ago. It was so nice to see him, I felt reassured by his presence. I noticed how kind and patient he was. I felt guilty that I hadn't treated him respectfully during our relationship. I began to cry and apologised for my behaviour during our relationship. I gave him a hug and began to tell him my concerns about my life feeling, as though it was coming off the tracks. His shirt undone and his stomach and chest exposed and reassured me. I got out of the van through the sliding side door. Outside was bright, hot and sunny. 12PM 37 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was at a party somewhere in London. I had gone there with old school friends. I vividly remember someone from my group showing me 3 pairs of trousers she had brought with her, as if it was normal to bring a so many. We were in the garden standing on a concrete path with raised grassed areas on both sides, so the path was sunken. When it was time to leave I left with 3 other school friends. We walked out of the house straight in to a tube station but within minutes I had lost the other 3. I recall frantically calling their names and running around in panic. The station was quite busy but everyone ignored me. I was lost and alone and very frightened. In the end I decided I needed to get on a bus and found one. While on the bus I began to worry about how I would get to home from there. I was petrified of being on my own and being attacked. It was very dark. Eventually it dawns on me that I have a mobile phone in my bag but when I get it out the battery is on red, so I know it will soon go dead. I think about getting a taxi but worry that the driver may be the one who attacks me. I could go to a police station and ask for help but I worry that they won't take me seriously. I very nearly phone my brother and ask him to come and get me. I know he would but I would have to wait about 2 hours for him to get here and where would I go in the meantime. I also know that by the time he phones me to say where he is my phone will be dead. This dream was really vivid and scary. I felt petrified, all alone, very vulnerable and small. I woke several times during the dream but each time I was drawn back in to it. I don't know how the story ended as I woke up and got up, partly to get away from it as I felt so unsafe. 06PF 38 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was floating around in space. There was an image of a male movie star who was talking to me. In the back ground there was a planet on the brink of destruction. I couldn't understand what this movie star was trying to tell me. The dream was surreal, it felt like something was going to happen but I couldn't make out what it was. 12PM 42 XX:XX:XX DREAM I was on the top floor walkway of an atrium styled building. There were escalators crossing each other and they were filled with lots of people busily shopping. The light coming through the glass top was grey and it felt wintery. I was looking down from the top of the atrium. A door panel had been thrown from the top of the atrium space and I watched it flick and roll as it fell to the floor. I turned around and there was shop assistant talking to another worker. They were talking about me and I felt like I was in trouble. Next moment I was on the top floor at a restaurant sampling bread rolls. Then next moment I was at the bottom of the atrium mall next to the escalators. There was another open air restaurant next to the escalator and it was now night time, everything was mood lit. I watched people getting onto the escalators as they moved upwards. These people were mostly couples going out to various venues for dinner, they were dressed formally. One couple got on the escalator, the girl suffered from down syndrome and when she saw me looking at them she gave me a jealous look with squinted eyes. 12PM 43 XX:XX:XX DREAM My partner and I are watching a friend being treated by her relations, one a man and the other a woman. She is a very powerful and driven woman with long black hair and darkly sexual. She has had relationships with women as well as men. The man is inserting a massive metal syringe into the area around her inner thigh. The effort to inject and then suction is huge and he has to use all his body strength. It looks very brutal. We are watching and feel guilty that we are not helping and the insinuation from both people is that we should. She invites us to watch her performance. She is walking around on a cat walk with a model who seems to be Kate Moss. She is also reading from a book and speaking about her experience with strong language and intensity. She slowly bends over, as if in a porn show, so that her short skirt reveals her genitalia which are covered in what looks like a pair of bulky pants like a baby's nappy pants. We are shocked to see, with this erotic display, a long scar down her inner right thigh. She then asks us to accompany her. She has to remove something from her inner thigh. There is an internal bypass of her digestive and urinary passages, or so it seems, that leads out to an opening somewhere around her inner thigh. She needs to pull something out. She has to do this in a tunnel which goes down some stairs and gets narrower and narrower. She wants us to join her. I start to panic as I approach the tunnel, feeling as if I am going to suffocate. I feel my legs going down and losing control and pull myself back out. I know I should go and it will be ok but I can't do it. Parallel to this dream is the sensation of driving around roads, routes that go underground and circumvent main routes. They are secret routes used by underground people and we travel along them easily and fast with a feeling of independence. 01PF 45 XX:XX:XX DREAM References Harvey, Claire G.

Cicchetti Indian Pipes Dreams Analysis The analysis is done from the perspective of all the dreams being one dream. This one dream, containing multiple symbols, which when taken together, may, or may not, depending on many variables, reveal important information about the remedy and it's potential value in clinical practice. Along with considering all of the dreams as one, it is essential that the imagery and symbols in the dreams be carefully considered just as they appear. In any dream, the symbolism is very specific and must be addressed as if the imagery was appearing in the waking state. In other words, if, in waking state, at truck is seen, it is a vehicle with a number of wheels, weight, etc. The same applies to a truck appearing in a dream. It is a particular colour, size, etc. and this must be honoured. In a proving, this is especially important as we are attempting to understand a substance through its effect on the human psyche. Therefore, we must be as exacting in our research as possible. However, working with dreams is mostly not a logical process. One must be open to synchronistic experiences and be able to entertain possibilities that go beyond reason. For dreams are the symbolic, multi-dimensional expressions of the psyche. I will now go through the process step by step with the hope that this will be helpful to others who wish to do a similar analysis. 1. Gathering all of the Dreams All of the dreams were listed and numbered for easy reference. Then, they were read through quickly so I could receive an overall impression. In this first reading, some imagery stuck in my mind and later that night produced a dream, or I should say, a word -\"Metamorphosis.\" Of course, I began to jump to conclusions about this word. However, I must hold back and gather all of the information. With over 200 dreams, this is somewhat daunting. At this point, I stopped the analysis to finish another pressing project. 2. The Second Reading Coming back to the analysis after a period of time, I did a second, much more thorough reading of all of the dreams. This time I took notes on strong imagery that caught my attention and began to organize similar themes. These themes are not ideas per se but actual imagery, symbols, and in one case reference to a song. The song, Mad World, really interested me even though I had never heard of it, and I couldn't wait to research it. But I waited until I finished the entire reading and organization. The most frequently occurring powerful imagery was that of a being morphing from one state into another. Transvestites, cross dressing, drag queens, a child becomes a cat, a person dressed as a cow, human legs became super pistons and transforming, grotesquely, into a younger person. In a similar category, there were images of new species created after this change had occurred. These included crows with Darth Vader heads, a slug/worm, Amish family with hippopotamus teeth; a human with horse or goat legs (Pan), a farm of animal/beings fused between human and animal, a man with ridiculously huge biceps. Another group of images related to the brain. There at least 10 dreams where characters appeared with either autism, brain damage, or serious mental problems. There was one appearance of Downs syndrome. There were quite a few images of elderly people and premature aging. Also several dreams contained images of autistic people in wheel chairs. Two dreams had an interesting reference to magnetic force. Finally there were a few strong images of brutality, animal testing, and hypodermic syringes. I chose to first explore the reference to the song, Mad World, the mythological Pan, Darth Vader, and the Phantom of the Opera. 3. Mad World In 2003 Mad World was included in the film, Donnie Darko, and sung (with slight changes in the lyrics) by Gary Jules. The film Donnie Darko is a very complex, apocalyptic science fiction story about a very intelligent and depressed teenager. Interestingly, there is a giant rabbit that plays a big part in the film. This rabbit is very ominous, metallic and has large teeth. It's sort of a cross between a demonic robot and a rabbit. It's not unlike the hybrid creatures that appear in the dreams of the proving. That, plus the appearance of a very old woman named \"Grandma Death\" makes me think that Mad World in the dream may refer to not only the song but also to the film Donnie Darko. The dreamer describes a state that is very similar to the mood of the song. Also, he/she is wanting to act cool and be in control of the situation even though he feels out of control. At a festival, wandering around by myself. I didn't fit in. I felt alone and trying not to be bothered that I was on my own. I went from booth to booth pretending to look at things which I was not interested in. My belt was not on right (it was heavy and thick leather). I wanted it to sit right on my hips but I felt if it was not quite right that I looked stupid. I kept trying to adjust it as I walked around acting cool, as if I was in control of the situation when really I felt out of control. It felt to me that if and when I had it on right I would be accepted by the others, that they would understand me finally for who I was. I think I finally either took it off or completely gave up. I recognized a melody playing on the radio. It was the song \"Mad World\" which was a very sad, sombre, and lonely song, albeit beautiful. As soon as I recognized it I lit up, as if there was something I could identify with in that scene. I think it was the one thing in the environment that I felt I could connect with and therefore connect to those who also liked the song. 02PF 16 XX:XX:XX DREAM 4. The \"morphing\" imagery- Pan, Darth Vader, and Phantom of the Opera So far, looking at the specific imagery of Pan, Darth Vader, and Phantom of the Opera has simply sent me back to the idea of hybridism. My next question is - \"What is the connection between animal/human and interspecies animals, and the images of transvestites. These are both obviously unusual symbols and they appear frequently so they are likely a key clue to the meaning of our group dream. The transvestites in the dreams were men dressed as women 5. Brain damage, autism, dementia Next I looked at the issue of brain damage, autism, dementia as those are unusual images and recur frequently. 6. Aging, Premature aging, elderly, becoming younger 7. Brutality, Torture, Hypodermic needles Emerging Themes Input from other worlds leads to the appearance of psychosis. The reference to Mad World is very significant. It is the cry of a disturbed and depressed teenager who is overwhelmed with the state of the world. There is the connection to the film, Donnie Darko, the story of a teenage boy who is suspected of being psychotic. Forces from another universe overwhelm him. There is also reference to time travel. Metamorphosis The second big theme is that of hybrid creatures and metamorphosis. There are humans that have partly changed into animals, or animals that are part other species, and transvestitism. After much research and pondering, I think I have found a connection - shamanism. Transvestitism and animal/human hybrids have been a part of shamanic imagery and practices all over the world and for thousands of years. There are cave pictures that show these forms and they are thought to be the attempt of prehistoric shaman to take on the qualities of a particular animal. It is an attempt to integrate the animal and human nature. Symbolically, it could be said to be a technique for uniting the conscious ie human forces, with the libidinal, unconscious or animal aspects of reality. The shaman also attempts to transcend mundane reality and social convention by cross-dressing. The transvestite shaman is found in both east and west. Mircea Eliade, refers to this as \"ritual androgyny,\" the purpose of which is to unite, or \"reconcile,\" opposing principles such as masculinity and femininity. Jung, influenced by Eliade, defines the psychology of the shamanistic process in a similar way, but relates it to the path of individuation. \" (the shaman's symbols) were trying to portray an inner process of development independent of their consciousness and will. The process usually consists in the union of two pairs of opposites, a lower (water, blackness, animal, snake etc.) with an upper (bird, light, head etc.) and a left (feminine) with a right (masculine).\" CW 13 p. 341 The Brain Bursts Open - Psychosis, brain damage The short dream \"Head is a white tube with opening at top and my brain is exposed\" might now be seen as one of the most significant dreams of the proving . This is a particularly powerful image and reminds me of the following quote from Jung: \"The individual is much too small, its brain is much too feeble to incorporate all the projections withdrawn from the world. Ego and brain burst asunder in the effort; the psychiatrist calls it schizophrenia.\" The image and Jung's quote relate to both the film Donnie Darko and to what is now thought to be the experience of the autism and ADHD. In the film, the teenage Donnie, is overwhelmed by the information that is coming from another dimension and is overtaken by it. He ends up creating violent acts and appears schizophrenic. There are also many references to autism or ADHD in the proving. In these cases, the individual is unable to filter stimulus from the environment and becomes overwhelmed, anxious, and restless. This results in compensatory behaviours such as withdrawal, not looking directly at others, and inappropriate social behaviour. Brutality, torture, and high tech medical manipulation The dreams of animal testing, the suffering of monkeys in laboratory cages, someone being vaccinated by a machine against his will, and a woman having a massive metal syringe inserted into her thigh, remind one of the brutality of highly technical medicine. Perhaps the dreams are reminding us of the damage that can be done by forcing this upon everyone. Contemplating the emerging themes. Ideas that come to mind are that the remedy may be useful for spiritual emergencies. In these cases, the individual has ventured into the realm of the collective unconscious through various spiritual/shamanic practices, has become overwhelmed. and has become psychotic, or is exhibiting symptoms that mimic psychosis. He or she has been stuck in a certain stage of the process of metamorphosis. Another possibility is that the remedy can be helpful for brain damage, specifically autism caused by vaccinations. This can be seen in the references to laboratory monkeys and the cross species imagery, as well as the two images of injections and particularly the dream of multiple vaccinations. In immunization, cells from other species, particularly monkeys, are utilized. Appendix 2 From Michal Yakir Monotropa uniflora This odd, epiparasite plant had, until recently, but few symptoms that associated with the mouth. A new proving, conducted by Misha Norland (2011*) is shading light on this remedy and indeed establish its place near the end of the 4th column. The main themes (as interpreted by me according to its place in the Table .M.Y.) revolve around attachment \\detachment in relation to the source of affluence - the group, or family - the basis of the 4th column. The themes in the remedy* speak of safety in the family or the \"source\", and the anxiety of its absence - or a desire to leave this \"nest\" and be on your own - or being obstructed, rejected and cut off from this nurturing source, thus weakening and drained dry - as expected in the last rows of the nurturing 4th column. In the proving, a strong need to be included in the group/family and not left out came up. Being unified with the group provided security, there was intensified longing to be connected to loved ones. Strength and support were sought by their company, helplessness and dependence on others for protection. With this arose anxieties of separation, desire to be home safe with one`s families, fearing danger when not. Neediness, clinginess, and a fear of abandonment. Dreams of bird nests, protecting children and of a handicapped persons, awareness of being victimized, of vulnerable boundaries being penetrated, loss of control and powerlessness. Another aspect was a need for space and separation from the group and family [as expected in the end of the 4th column]. Hence disconnection, sensation as \"in a bubble\", and \"in my own world\". Up to autistic tendency. This isolation had a sense of not relating, not fitting in with the others. Or being obstructed and blocked out from the nurturing flow, or another version - needing to carve out one's own space within the safety of the group/family. Keywords like\" Abandoned, Snubbed, Lonely and rejected when one is cut off the family (like a cut off tube)\". \"A severed tube that connects to source still has great power but no direction, it become weak, vulnerable, separate, and eventually drain dry\". \"Feeling of loss of control leading to Intense depressions and panic attacks, questioning one`s sanity\"*. The flow is blocked [common sensation of the last row]: \"concept of flow being obstructed or detached from the source. Obstructive dreams/delusions included cars driving down narrow roads, barricades, and traffic jams*\". One can move only in secretive or underground ways. When the nurturing flow provided by the Source is disrupted, confusion, anxiety and restlessness set in. Excessive nervousness - up to spasm convulsions and even epilepsy. There's a characteristic irritability during changes that is typical to the Ericales Feeling adrift, where should it go? - when disconnected from the family. Confusion over identity, age and gender. Strength or weakness, a sense of duality alternating with apathetic hopelessness. Botanic Monotropa uniflora Indian pipe, Ghost Plant Family Ericaceae Photo: Dan Tenaglia-misouriplants.com Native to the temperate regions, North America, northern South America and some parts of Asia. **A white, mica-heterotrophs plant, epiparasite on fungus that grow on decayed leaves, in dark, sunless conditions. Lacking chlorophyll (hence its white colour), instead of generating food from sunlight it get it from fungus. Its hosts, a fungi from the Russulaceae family decomposes dead leaves and use it as source of carbon - on which the Monotropa draw (Chimaphila also grow on fungus but it produce its own chlorophyll). As it does not transfer sugar to the fungus, it must be a parasite on it. Yet it is not parasite on other plants but rather on fungi, which in turn There might be dark, hidden [family] secretes and deep self-loathing. Dark sexuality** - maybe related to childhood trauma or sexual abuse***. A secretive behaviour may result: \"dreams of... secret routes used by underground people and we travel along them easily and fast with a feeling of independence\"*. As compensation: a compulsion to put things in their proper place and set things in order. The distress is coming in waves: \"one feel good only to be sucked back in by another wave\". Strong issues of penetrating boundaries, (Dreams of being bitten, raped, vaccinated, and attacked and being a victims of violent cruelties). Pains were stabbing, pricking, and often focused in one spot. Deep pathology was implied (maybe related to the above trauma or sexual abuse): Cancer, AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, nervous, circulatory, respiratory, genitourinary and digestive systems. General symptoms included congestions, inflammations, constrictions, pressures, restlessness, numbness, and in-coordination. Specific conditions mentioned in the proving included peripheral vascular disease, aneurism, gout, severed body parts, autism, dementia, and psychosis*. A particular affinity to the mouth [the nurturing entrance] - already known from old symptoms (Allen) - like dryness and cracked skin around the mouth, capped or swollen and inflamed lips, blisters and herpes. During teething - constipation or convulsions, even epileptic seizures (dentition is the time when the child is supposed to become independent from the nurturing mother). Also anthelmintic and anti-cataract: cloudy vision - maybe due to the aging of the cornea Summary: the remedy display the Ericales themes#, in the framework of the end of forth column, which is accentuated by the plant parasitic nature - both contributing to the issues with the family, group or \"source\" affluence, being connected and flowing with it or obstructed and disconnected from it, often from nefarious reasons. The main sensations are: connection to a source which provided, protected, and moved things along with ease: a wave like sensation of flow - or its stoppage. A blocked sensation which is related to the end of the column, causing blockage and spasm. The location in the table suggest a conflict: either one is connected to the source, meaning one are on one`s path, carried by the flow, flowing freely without resistance. Or - an opposite state: blocked, having the flow cut off, disconnected; constricted, trapped, isolated, which is leading to anxiety, convulsions or numbness. The fungal aspect is adding a dark element of sexuality, possibly sexual abuse, of being penetrated, abused, controlled \"like a machine or like a robot\", losing control and sanity, and a desire to attain control by orderliness and tidiness. This deep sited yet hidden abuse may lead to disconnection from the family structure and affluence, to feeling of decomposition and dissolution, to dryness, to anorexia (dry, chapped, tight, blocked mouth), and feeling rejected. The reaction is being contracted, dry and blocked rejecting the entrance of food or affluence (hence the \"cloudy vision) - as expected from its position at the end of the nurturing column. feed from dead leaves. ***Its soft, fragile, gel like, almost melting to the touch texture bestowed on the plant one of its name - \"the Ice plants\", alluding to almost non existing borders. *Proving done by Misha Norland on 30c potency, in 2011. The main information presented here is taken from this proving. Usage: the root is used as a sedative, nervine, and antispasmodic tonic, employed in febrile diseases, pains, nervous irritability and epilepsy in children. In obstinate ophthalmic inflammation. Also in cases of acute anxiety due to drug experiences where repressed traumatic memory emerges from the subconscious, putting the person into a state of emotional and/or sensory overload. Photo by Misha Norland. The suggested sensation is flowing, wave like motion - or blocked and disconnected. Severe pathology can ensue: aids, epilepsy, gout, autoimmune disease, as well as deep anxiety, autism, dementia and mental diseases. # the Ericales themes in the fourth column Location: the forth, \"nurturing\" column in this late, adult stage brings up themes like concern for the family along with desire for autonomous living separate from it. Transitioning from the parental role to serving society on a larger scale. Feelings of loneliness and abandonment may arise on account of severing family ties and desire to be accepted in society. The column themes accentuate the issue of the need for a too tight, highly nurturing connection with one's immediate family. So it's either over dependence or extreme withdrawal from the family. The main themes of the Ericales: Obligation to give to the family, which becomes a liability; surrender to the family's dictates. Anxiety for health, need to be taken care of, dependant. Alienated and rejected from family and nurture, oppressed and imprisoned by the family unit. Coming into own fruition, seeking recognition outside the family. Creativity issues. Domineering, emasculating feminine; male-reproductive pathology; tumours and growth. Obstructed and rigid, with male sexual organ pathology. Even emasculating feeling Immobility, joints, rigidity, obstructed, resistance to change, Silica-like - or flowing and changing Cured Cases In order to fully understand this remedy and to make it useful in practice it is vital that cured cases are reported and published.
