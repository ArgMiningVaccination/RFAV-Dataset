Real learning allows you to embody the teachings through direct experience. 2 Week Ayurvedic Mind Body Cleanse & Educational Program Contrary to rigid or fasting based programs, Ayurvedic cleansing emphasizes correct nourishment while providing circumstances that allow the body to release deeply held physical and emotional toxins. With a focus on clarifying the liver to improve hormone balance and whole body detoxification, Gianna Piccardo Ripa educates and guides participants through a gentle, yet highly effective, cleanse protocol developed by Dr. Mary Jo Cravatta. The two week course is equal parts cleanse and experiential learning program. Content includes Ayurvedic diet, lifestyle, daily detoxification practices, therapeutic yoga and understanding of the subtle body. Those at any level of understanding may benefit. Dates Group Cleanse program dates are announced periodically via the Spirit Healing Arts [newsletter](/mad-mimi-plug-in). Participation in a Self Study version of this course (a solo cleanse on your own schedule) is available at anytime. "}
