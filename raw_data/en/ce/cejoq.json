His primary interest is in the role of antibodies in conferring immunity to airborne, foodborne and vectorborne infections. The laboratory has ongoing collaborations with academic and biopharmaceutic partners to develop vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for human use against COVID-19, Lyme disease, pertussis, tetanus, Salmonella, cholera, and ricin toxin.
