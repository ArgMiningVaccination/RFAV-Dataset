AT Prospectus 07.indd 4 AT Prospectus 07.indd 4 26/2/07 14:45:42 26/2/07 14:45:42Page 05With the move towards higher standards in the teaching and practice of alternative medicine, it is becoming increasingly recognised that you need a sound understanding of key aspects of orthodox medicine to be a safe and e ective practitioner. The objective of these three home-study courses in Nutrition, Human Anatomy & Physiology and Pathology & Disease is to give you the necessary knowledge and understanding of these subjects in order to best support and complement your alternative therapy practice.The study of these subjects has, in the past, presented many problems with very few texts being speci cally written for alternative practitioners. There are many ne medical books, but their content is usually too detailed or too biased towards the needs of orthodox practice. We have therefore developed these courses in order to provide a simple means for you to easily extract relevant material from carefully selected textbooks and to guide you step-by-step through your study in an interesting and easy way. This approach is aided by additional clari cation and expansion of many of the topics covered, with learning feedback provided through both self-assessment questions with model answers and tutor marked assignments. You can take any of the courses on their own, but the Anatomy & Physiology Course provides the ideal preparation before you start on the Pathology & Disease Course. The topics covered by each course should be su cient on their own for many therapies. If you need more detailed study in particular areas, however, the courses will give you a very solid foundation for this. They will also be of value if you need to expand or refresh your existing knowledge of these subjects, particularly if your previous study was in an orthodox medical environment. The emphasis in each course is to help you understand the material, and to make your study have as much practical application as possible. This is particularly true with the Pathology & Disease and Nutrition Courses, where a large amount of valuable information is readily presented for your direct use as a practitioner. AT Prospectus 07.indd 5 AT Prospectus 07.indd 5 26/2/07 14:45:43 26/2/07 14:45:43Page 06 The study of medical sciences is an essential part of the education of the alternative practitioner. It enables the practitioner to distinguish symptoms common to disease from those that are characteristic to the patient. It enables the practitioner to know how the disease is likely to progress should treatment be ine ective. It helps the practitioner know when to re-prescribe or to refer to another health care specialist or medical doctor. It helps communication and con dence both with patients and other health professionals. It provides an understanding of conventional diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and how these may a ect and modify management of an individual's health. the courses AT Prospectus 07.indd 6 AT Prospectus 07.indd 6 26/2/07 14:45:44 26/2/07 14:45:44Page 07Course Structure & Method of Study Each course is divided into a number of Study Units covering speci c areas. Objectives are given for each section of study, and suggested Study Periods are provided for the Anatomy & Physiology and Nutrition Courses. Your main method of study is by reference to speci c paragraphs and diagrams of the course textbooks, which have been carefully selected for their clarity and relevance of content. Additional explanations, descriptions and diagrams help to make the home study interesting and e ective. You are gently guided through the course, with regular self-assessment questions and model answers provided to help you check your progress and assist your learning. To enable your level of understanding to be assessed, you will answer a number of essay-type assignment questions at the end of each Unit. You will send these to your designated tutor, who will give you feedback and further guidance if required. There are no exams involved, marking is by continuous assessment. Assessment & Certi cation Rigorous external assessment is provided through completion of comprehensive assignment sets, with high standards of tutor marking. Course certi cation is equivalent to a UK vocational 'A' Level or NVQ Level 3 and will provide you with a solid foundation should you wish to undertake further study. The course certi cation is widely accepted, recommended and used by many schools, colleges and individuals as part of their integrated training programmes. There are 4 - 6 assignments at the end of each unit that you send to your tutor by post or e-mail. These are assessed and returned to you with written feedback. To complete the course, you need to attain a passing grade in each of the assignments. You will then be awarded Alternative Training's Certi cate. By purchasing a distance-learning course from Alternative Training you are assured of receiving a high quality of product, service and care.

A growing number of people want to know more about how to make healthy and informed choices about diet and nutrition. There are so many bene ts of a healthy diet and this course can inspire you to put them into practice. Our home study course is designed to give you a holistic and comprehensive overview of nutrition. It's a great introduction to the world of nutrition for both you and your family, providing you with a rm base of understanding. This course is ideal for anyone wishing to gain a sound knowledge in the subject of nutrition. Foods and their e ects on health are something that a ect us all, and this course gives a great foundation into this growing area of interest. The course explains the principles of nutrition and gives up-to-date guidance on its application. It also provides a good understanding of the scienti c basis of nutrition. The course looks at the constituent parts of what we eat, the macro nutrients of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, the micro nutrients of minerals and vitamins, and other factors of nutrition, such as bowel fl ora, that have such an important e ect on how we get the most out of our food. We study the physiology of food processing by our bodies, looking at how this works in a healthy body and how it can go wrong. We look at the problems caused by modern food processing, from use of chemicals, high protein cereal varieties and antibiotics in livestock, to the use of food additives and other techniques employed in convenience foods. Finally, we nutrition course AT Prospectus 07.indd 8 AT Prospectus 07.indd 8 26/2/07 14:45:47 26/2/07 14:45:47Page 09examine the basic constituents of a healthy diet, with guidance on diets designed for therapeutic use, for speci c illnesses, and for maintaining a healthy body. The information is presented in a way that should enable you to readily apply your understanding to many situations and to know how to nd additional guidance if the need arises. Course Textbooks J Mann & S TruswellEssentials of Human Nutrition, 2nd Edition ISBN 0198508611 R Ballentine Diet & Nutrition - A Holistic ApproachISBN 0893890480 Course Structure The two course books comprise an up-to-date reference text, plus a lively account bringing together modern science and traditional wisdom in a very readable form. Extracts from these are linked together with additional course material to make the study enjoyable as well as instructive. There is a strong emphasis on practical application, so that your understanding can readily complement your main practice. The course consists of three study units, each covering several major aspects of nutrition. Each unit is divided into a number of Study Periods of about 2-3 hours in length to help you structure your study time. The course is designed to take around 125 hours of study to complete. So if you are able to commit 6-9 hours a week to undertake 3 study periods, you can nish the course in about 4-5 months. Your study time is fl exible, however, to meet your individual needs. The main topics in each of the 3 units of the course are shown alongside.Unit 1: The Macro Nutrients Introduction to nutritionCarbohydratesProteinsFats Unit 2: Minerals and Vitamins Sodium and potassiumWater balanceAcid-alkaline balanceCalcium and magnesiumThe micromineralsVitamins Unit 3: Nutrition and Health Elimination, bowel fl ora and bowel healthDetox dietsVegetarian and vegan dietsFood combiningAllergies, chemical residues and additivesMineral and vitamin supplementationThe composition of a healthy diet AT Prospectus 07.indd 9 AT Prospectus 07.indd 9 26/2/07 14:45:48 26/2/07 14:45:48Page 010Course Content This course is designed to be studied either on its own, or as a part of your overall training in your chosen therapy, or to ful l pre-entry requirements for such training. It may also be of use to meet part of a membership organisation's registration requirements. The aim is to provide you with a good familiarity of the structure of the human body and its basic operation. It should give you a sound understanding, without the need to memorise all the information provided. If you do need further clari cation, however, you will know how to look up the details as and when they are needed. The course syllabus is equivalent to UK vocational 'A' Level standard and NVQ Level 3. It has been compiled after careful consideration of the requirements of various therapies and colleges and societies of alternative medicine. All the major systems of the body are covered, and the material is grouped and presented in a way that helps you to understand how the various elements link together holistically. The main functional groupings are as follows: Introduction to anatomy & physiology Organisation of the body Provision of energy Adjustment & control Growth, reproduction & essentials of heredity Response & coordinationanatomy & physiology course AT Prospectus 07.indd 10 AT Prospectus 07.indd 10 26/2/07 14:45:51 26/2/07 14:45:51Page 011The study material is regularly reviewed and revised with careful reference to student and tutor feedback. Course Textbooks Ross & WilsonAnatomy & Physiology in Health & Illness 10th Edition ISBN 0443064687 W. Kapit The Physiology Coloring Book - 2nd Edition ISBN 0321 036638 Course Structure The two textbooks that are provided as an integral part of the course have been carefully selected for their clarity ofinformation and practical use for study; they will also be a valuable reference for use in practice. Text and diagrams from these books are integrated into the course in a way that gives a balance between theory and application, with plenty of practical activity to help support the academic learning.The course is divided into 5 Study Units, each covering major aspects of the syllabus. The Units have suggested study periods of 2-3 hours duration each to help you structure your study time, so that the work can easily be tted in with your other activities. Although the study largely adopts the usual method of following the various anatomical systems, the various topics are integrated together to illustrate their functional interaction, so as to help you better understand and remember their purpose and operation. Around 150-200 hours of study time will be required to complete the course. If you undertake 3 study periods (i.e. 6-9 hours) each week, it would thus take you about 6 months, but you may take less or more time than this if you wish. A fuller contents list for each Unit can be provided on request. The 5 Study Units contain the following main material:Unit 1 Cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, cardiovascular system Unit 2 Respiration, nutrition, digestive system Unit 3 Temperature regulation, osmoregulation: the kidney, defence against disease Unit 4 Cell division, reproduction, genetics & heredity Unit 5 Sensory & nervous system, endocrine system, musculoskeletal system AT Prospectus 07.indd 11 26/2/07 14:45:51 26/2/07 14:45:51Page 012Course Content This course is designed to enable you as a student or practitioner of alternative medicine to understand the basic principles by which orthodox medicine operates. The viewpoint, however, is always in relation to the alternative practitioner. The emphasis is on the management of cases that are commonly seen in clinical practice, together with recognition of warning signs and symptoms that may require you to refer your patient to another practitioner. Throughout the course, there are discussions on how to relate conventional ideas of disease to those of alternative medicine, so that you can view conventional medicine from the perspective of your own particular therapy. The objective of the course is to help you carry out your particular form of practice with a more informed understanding of disease processes that will in turn lead to better and safer treatment for your patients. At the end of this very practical course, you should be able to: Compare the philosophical di erences between conventional and alternative medicine State common terms used by conventional medicine Understand common investigational procedures of conventional medicine State the clinical features of the many disease conditions studied Explain how treatment by conventional medicine a ects treatment by alternative medicine Explain appropriate courses of action to take in particular clinical situations State how to liaise with other health professionalspathology & disease course AT Prospectus 07.indd 12 AT Prospectus 12 26/2/07 14:45:53 26/2/07 14:45:53Page 013Course Textbook S. Gascoigne, - A Holistic Perspective Jigme Press: ISBN 0952218933 Course Structure Stephen Gascoigne is well known and respected as an author, lecturer and practitioner of Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, and Medical Sciences. His textbook provides you with a valuable source of reference on completion ofthe course, along with the course notes and practical research assignments. Information is presented in a dynamic and interesting way, by means of exercises and useful case studies, enabling you to prepare for situations that you may well encounter in your own clinical work.The course is divided into 4 Study Units, each covering a number of major topics. The approach mostly follows theusual method of study of conventional medicine, i.e. through the various anatomical systems. Within each system, there is discussion of symptoms, how to recognise serious disease, investigations, speci c disease states, and how you can manage these conditions as an alternative practitioner. The nominal course duration is around 200- 250 study hours, but the study time for each topic is left to your discretion, as students of di erent therapies may wish to apply a greater focus to some aspects than others. The 4 Study Units contain the following material:Unit 1 Introduction & philosophyBasic pathological Unit 4 ObstetricsGynaecologyChildren's healthPsychological disorders 14:45:53 ered by \"alternative training\" is perfect. You learn the basics about nutrition without being overwhelmed by strange words, heaps of numbers and weird philosophies. Instead, you learn the common sense side of nutrition, the stu that is actually logical and usable in every day practice. The assignments are fun to do, the support you get from the mentors is great and above all helpful, and the knowledge that you gain can be summed up like this - absolutely essential!\" \"I found it to be all very convenient because there is so much time allowed for study and no set timetable for handing work in. There was always support if I needed it and in general the course is so well done that if you read all the material carefully and do some of your own research it is very feasible to get it done!\"\"First, I love understanding the science of pathology and disease, at the no-I'm-not-a-biochemist level. I actually had a patient who had thyroid symptomatology and it was great to be able to feed o the knowledge that I gained through doing the essay - and quick enough after the essay that I actually remembered some of it too. Now that is really amazing!!\" \"Since the course is designed for alternative practitioners it was not too heavy, but for me it was very inspiring. It opened my eyes and my mind to how beautiful nature is, how highly organised it is, how everything is so interconnected, related and infl uenced by everything else. It made me appreciate life itself even more. Every day I am more amazed by how rich and in nite the process of life is.\"\"I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I have had no formal A&P training before, but I think that the course, with a stimulating and challenging content, provides a solid foundation for alternative medicine training, as may be required.\" \"It is a great challenge to study all on your own but the course content, which is so thought provoking and well presented, does compensate to an extent. More important though, are the much appreciated support and encouragement that I have received from the tutors.\" AT Prospectus 07.indd 14 AT Prospectus 07.indd 14 26/2/07 14:45:54 26/2/07 14:45:54Page 015\"I had fun working on this course for the summer! The human body (or any body for that matter) is truly amazing. I think the most important thing I am taking away from this course is to realise how it all ts and works together. Which is right where a holistic approach to medicine and healing comes in!\" \"What I initially felt would be an overload of information actually has turned out to providing a deeper understanding and alternative view of pathology.\"\"I really enjoyed the P&D course . I found the course to be very well structured, especially for non-medically trained students. It covered all the important aspects of human diseases and provided detailed information about their descriptions and course. His comparisons between allopathic and holistic treatments of chronic disorders totally changed my point of view about my approach to the human body. Through this course I realized how easily you can destroy the balance of the human system through the allopathic treatment. At the same time, the holistic approach o ers tremendous possibilities to restore this balance and bring the patient to greater awareness of himself and the world.\"\"I have found the information to be helpful already, in some of the paper cases I've done in my school assignments. It does indeed seem to be a missing piece that is coming together well. Thanks.\" \"This course has been really valuable to my professional development - thanks. I de nitely learned more details about the pathology and disease process from the conventional medical eld and felt reassured with what knowledge was necessary to also practice responsibly from the alternative perspective.\" \"I am nding the course very interesting. I often don't think that I took much of the information into my head, but then something seemed to managed to stay in there.\" AT Prospectus 07.indd 15 AT Prospectus 07.indd 15 26/2/07 14:45:56 26/2/07 14:45:56Page 016These are the books that come with each of the three courses except for The Prescribed Drug Guide by Stephen Gascoigne, this book is not required for the course but can be purchased separately.
