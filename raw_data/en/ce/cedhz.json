They propel negative energies and even entities. They can be worn on a leather cord (I wear mine at all times and just tuck into my shirt), or can be carried in your pocket, purse, or kept near bedside. I highly recommend that children have one near their beds and carry one in their back packs for protection while at school. Mother earth's facial love, organic night oil This amazing facial oil is hand-crafted by Cheryl (my dear friend and Adv. spiritual healing practitioner). This oil contains valuable Omega fatty acids (linoleic acid), Oleic acid, Vitamin E, Antioxidants, Anti-inflammatory (phenolic) compounds, CoQ10, and plant sterols. Other ingredients include organic non-comedogenic oils blended with my proprietary blend of herbs, vitamins and Essential Oils. This formulation can reduce damaging effects of free radicals, inflammation and oxidative stress while supporting the repair and maintenance of your skin. Can also help reduce visual signs of aging and increase skin elasticity and hydration. Cheryl recommends using a few drops each morning, gently patted into my skin after cleansing. I also mix a drop or two into my normal nightly face cream. You can add a couple drops to your regular hand or body lotion before applying. It nourishes the skin instantly yet absorbs quickly. HOME CLEANSING SUPPLY PACKAGE (for \"smudging\") These kits are intended for those who have already purchased and received their Home Clearing with a blessing and Magnetic Grid Realignment (more information can be found on the [Home & Business Clearing page](https://www.miahayya.com/home-business-clearings-with-magnetic-grid-realignment)).
