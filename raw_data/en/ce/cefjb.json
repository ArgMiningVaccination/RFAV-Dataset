As a community-driven and community-guided initiative, ABIC seeks to expand the role microscopy plays in biomedical research on the continent \u2014 helping embrace imaging approaches in solving research questions of importance to the African continent. As a centralized hub, the ABIC network provides an opportunity for African biologists, microscopists, and data scientists to foster new partnerships and form a unified voice of the community. bottom of page "}
