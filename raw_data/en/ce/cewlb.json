Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 1-13. doi:10.1038/s41370-021-00306-8 [More info](#more-journal-publication0)BACKGROUND Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression could provide a mechanism linking firefighter exposure to increased cancer risk. OBJECTIVE To determine if changes in longitudinal miRNA expression in firefighters are associated with occupational exposures. METHODS Whole blood MiRNA was evaluated in 52 new recruits prior to live-fire training and 20-37 months later. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, ethnicity, BMI, and batch effects were used to determine associations separately for all fires and structure fires only between employment duration, cumulative fire-hours and fire-runs, and time since most recent fire with (1) nine a priori and (2) the full array of 799 miRNAs. RESULTS For multivariable models including all fires, two a priori miRNAs were associated with employment duration and four with time since most recent fire. For multivariable models restricted to structure fires, three a priori miRNAs were associated with employment duration and one with fire-runs. Additional miRNAs from the full array were associated with employment duration for all fires and/or structure fires. In general, tumor suppressive miRNAs decreased and oncogenic miRNAs increased with exposure. SIGNIFICANCE Changes in miRNAs may serve as biomarkers of exposure effects and a mechanism for increased cancer risk in firefighters. - Poplin, G., Griffin, S., Pollack, K., & Burgess, J. L. (2016).

Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 1-10. doi:10.1038/s41370-021-00311-x [More info](#more-journal-publication3)Background Firefighters have increased cancer incidence and mortality rates compared to the general population, and are exposed to multiple products of combustion including known and suspected carcinogens. Objective The study objective was to quantify fire response exposures by role and self-reported exposure risks. Methods Urinary hydroxylated metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH-OHs) were measured at baseline and 2-4 h after structural fires and post-fire surveys were collected. Results Baseline urine samples were collected from 242 firefighters. Of these, 141 responded to at least one of 15 structural fires and provided a post-fire urine. Compared with baseline measurements, the mean fold change of post-fire urinary PAH-OHs increased similarly across roles, including captains (2.05 (95% CI 1.59-2.65)), engineers (2.10 (95% CI and paramedics (1.84 (95% CI 1.33-2.60)). Interior responses, smoke odor on skin, and lack of recent laundering or changing of hoods were significantly associated with increased post-fire urinary PAH-OHs. Significance Ambient smoke from the fire represents an exposure hazard for all individuals on the fireground; engineers and paramedics in particular may not be aware of the extent of their exposure. Post-fire surveys identified specific risks associated with increased exposure. - Staack, S. D., Lutz, E. A., Lee, V. S., Griffin, S. C., & Burgess, J. L. (2021). Evaluation of CBRN Respirator Protection in Simulated Fire Overhaul Settings.. Annals of work exposures and health, 65(7), 843-853. doi:10.1093/annweh/wxab004 [More info](#more-journal-publication4)Overhaul is the phase of firefighting after flames have been extinguished but when products of combustion are still being released. While positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) provide the highest level of respiratory protection during overhaul, use of air-purifying respirators (APRs) with suitable filters could potentially provide a lower weight, longer duration option for first responders. The objective of this study was to assess whether an APR with a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) canister could be recommended as substitution for SCBA during overhaul. A total of 15 simulated standard overhaul environments were created by burning household materials. Sampling was conducted using mannequin heads fitted with full facepiece respirators with either a CBRN canister or SCBA. In-mask and personal samples were collected for aldehydes, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, inorganic acids, aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. An additional six simulated high-exposure overhaul environments were created in a flashover chamber by continuously adding household materials to a smoldering fire. The sampling train was the same for both the standard and high-exposure environments; however, the facepiece was sealed to the mannequin head in the high-exposure environments. In the standard overhaul environment, the CBRN canister effectively reduced the level of exposure for most contaminants, while in the high-exposure overhaul exposure setting in-mask acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were detected. In both exposure settings, the SCBA prevented almost all exposure, and therefore remains the recommended respiratory protection during overhaul. - Vega-millan, C. B., Rourke, M.

Environmental science and pollution research international. doi:10.1007/s11356-021-13070-x [More info](#more-journal-publication5)Environmental arsenic exposure in adults and children has been associated with a reduction in the expression of club cell secretory protein (CC16) and an increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), both biomarkers of lung inflammation and negative respiratory outcomes. The objectives of this study were to determine if the levels of serum CC16 and MMP-9 and subsequent respiratory infections in children are associated with the ingestion of arsenic by drinking water. This cross-sectional study included 216 children from three Yaqui villages, Potam, Vicam, and Cocorit, with levels of arsenic water of respectively. Total arsenic in water and urine samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry. Serum was analyzed for CC16 and MMP-9 using ELISA. The children had an average urinary arsenic of 79.39 g/L and 46.8 % had levels above of the national concern value of 50 g/L. Increased arsenic concentrations in drinking water and average daily arsenic intake by water were associated with decreased serum CC16 levels ( = - 0.12, 95% CI - 0.20, - 0.04 and = - 0.10, 95% CI - 0.18, - 0.03), and increased serum MMP-9 levels ( = 0.35, 95% = 0.29, 95% CI 0.18, 0.40) at significant levels (P < 0.05). However, no association was found between levels of these serum biomarkers and urinary arsenic concentrations. In these children, reduced serum CC16 levels were significantly associated with increased risk of respiratory infections (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.90). In conclusion, altered levels of serum CC16 and MMP-9 in the children may be due to the toxic effects of arsenic exposure through drinking water. - Yoo, Y. M., Yoo, Y. M., Thornburg, N.

Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic characteristics (50% aged 40 or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American Indian), by occupation (40% healthcare personnel, 30% first responders, and 30% other essential workers), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, participants complete active surveillance for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. CLI symptoms and impact on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation and demographic characteristics and by seropositivity status and infection and vaccination history..The AZ HEROES study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Enrollment began July 27, 2020 and as of May 1, 2021 a total of 3,165 participants have been enrolled in the study..AZ HEROES is unique in aiming to recruit a diverse sample of essential workers and prospectively following strata of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and seropositive adults. Survey results combined with active surveillance data on exposure, CLI, weekly molecular diagnostic testing, and periodic serology will be used to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, assess the intensity and durability of immune responses to natural infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and contribute to the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness..DERR1-10.2196/28925. - Yu, C.

Interim Estimates of Vaccine Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Health Care Personnel, First Responders, and Other Essential and Frontline Workers - Eight U.S. Locations, December 2020-March 2021.. MMWR. Morbidity and COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trials (1,2); however, the benefits of these vaccines for preventing asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection, particularly when administered in real-world conditions, is less well understood. Using prospective cohorts of health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers* in eight U.S. locations during December 14, 2020-March 13, 2021, CDC routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections every week regardless of symptom status and at the onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19-associated illness. Among 3,950 participants with no previous laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,479 (62.8%) received both recommended mRNA doses and 477 (12.1%) received only one dose of mRNA vaccine. Among unvaccinated participants, 1.38 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per 1,000 person-days.\u00a7 In contrast, among fully immunized (14 days after second dose) persons, 0.04 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported, and among partially immunized (14 days after first dose and before second dose) persons, 0.19 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported. Estimated mRNA vaccine effectiveness for prevention of infection, adjusted for study site, was 90% for full immunization and 80% for partial immunization. These findings indicate that authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptom status, among working-age adults in real-world conditions. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons. - Harris, R. B., Hadeed, S. J., O'rourke, M. K., Harris, R. B., Hadeed, S. J., Canales, R. A., & Burgess, J. L. (2020).

Environment international, 135, 105207. doi:10.1016/j.envint.2019.105207 [More info](#more-journal-publication11)Firefighters can be exposed to a complex set of contaminants while at a fire scene. Identifying new ways to monitor and assess exposure, particularly relating to toxicity is essential to determine the effectiveness of intervention techniques to reduce exposure. This study investigated the use of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) CALUX\u00ae bioassay for the assessment of exposure and associated toxicity firefighters might encounter. This was done through analysis of extracts of dermal wipes and urine samples collected from firefighters before and after a controlled fire. An increased bioassay response was observed from post-fire neck and calf samples, indicating a greater concentration of PAH-like compounds on the skin. The use of a baby wipe to clean the face and neck during rehab resulted in the attenuation of the observed bioassay response from the neck post-fire. Though a correlation was observed between the bioassay response and hydroxylated PAH concentrations found in the urine, the increased bioassay response from the post-fire urine samples was likely due to unknown compounds other than the hydroxylated PAHs tested. Our results suggest that this bioassay provides a useful measure of firefighter exposure, particularly relating to the potential toxicity of contaminants. - Littau, S.

This cross-sectional study examined 127 children from five elementary schools, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Arsenic was analyzed in the dust using a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer. Total urinary spectrometry. Serum was analyzed for MMP-9 using ELISA. Arsenic levels in playground dust averaged 16.9 arsenic averaged 34.9 \u00b1 17.1 \u00b5g/L. playground dust was positively associated with serum MMP-9 levels in crude analyses and after adjustment (P < 0.01), MMP-9 and CDI were positively associated only after adjustment (P < 0.01), and no association was found between MMP-9 and urinary arsenic. In conclusion, our study showed an association in children between serum MMP-9 levels and playground dust arsenic concentrations. Therefore, exposure to arsenic in dust where children spend significant time may manifest toxic effects. - Bui, D. P., Hu, C., Jung, A. M., Pollack Porter, K. M., Griffin, S. C., French, D.

We hypothesized that occupational exposures in firefighters would lead to DNA methylation changes associated with activation of cancer pathways and increased cancer risk. To address this hypothesis, we collected peripheral blood samples from 45 incumbent and 41 new recruit non-smoking male firefighters and analyzed the samples for DNA methylation using an Illumina Methylation EPIC 850k chip. Adjusting for age and ethnicity, we performed: 1) genome-wide differential methylation analysis; 2) genome-wide prediction for firefighter status (incumbent or new recruit) and years of service; and 3) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Four CpGs, including three in the YIPF6, MPST, and PCED1B genes, demonstrated above 1.5-fold statistically significant differential methylation after Bonferroni correction. Genome-wide methylation predicted with high accuracy incumbent and new recruit status as well as years of service among incumbent firefighters. Using IPA, the top pathways with more than 5 gene members annotated from differentially methylated probes included Sirtuin signaling pathway, p53 signaling, and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. These DNA methylation findings suggest potential cellular mechanisms associated with increased cancer risk in firefighters. - Griffin, S. C., Porter, K. P., Jung, A. M., Hu, C., Griffin, S.

Journal of safety research, 71, 103-109. doi:10.1016/j.jsr.2019.09.020 [More info](#more-journal-publication16)Emergency service vehicle crashes (ESVCs), including rollovers and collisions with other vehicles and fixed objects, are a leading cause of death among U.S. firefighters. Risk management (RM) is a proactive intervention to identifying and mitigating occupational risks and hazards. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of RM in reducing ESVCs..Three fire departments (A, B and C), representing urban and suburban geographies, and serving medium to large populations, participated in facilitated RM programs to reduce their ESVCs. Interventions were chosen by each department to address their department-specific circumstances and highest risks. Monthly crash rates per 10,000 calls were calculated for each department an average of 28 months before and 23 months after the start of the RM programs. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the effect of the RM programs on monthly crash rates. Poisson regression was used to estimate the number of crashes avoided. Economic data from Department A were analyzed to estimate cost savings..Department A had a 15.4% (P = 0.30) reduction in the overall monthly crash rate immediately post-RM and a 1% (P = 0.18) decline per month thereafter. The estimated two-year average cost savings due to 167 crashes avoided was $253,100 (95%CI= $192,355 - $313,885). Department B had a 9.7% (P = 0.70) increase in the overall monthly crash rate immediately post-RM and showed no significant changes in their monthly crash rate. Department C had a 28.4% (P = 0.001) reduction in overall monthly crash rate immediately post-RM and a 1.2% (P = 0.09) increase per month thereafter, with an estimated 122 crashes avoided..RM programs have the potential to reduce ESVCs in the fire service and their associated costs; results may vary based on the interventions chosen and how they are implemented. Practical applications: Risk management may be an effective and broadly implemented intervention to reduce ESVCs in the US fire service. - Solle, N. S., Santiago, K. M., Lee, D. J., Kobetz, E.

[More info](#more-journal-publication22)At a storefront museum approximately 25 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a sign reads, \"Clean Air Started Here.\" This is not hyperbole. At the end of October 1948, the communities of Donora and Webster in Pennsylvania were visited by a smog that changed the face of environmental protection in the United States. Conservative estimates showed that 20 individuals died, while an additional 5900-43% of the population of Donora-were affected by the smog. This event led to the first large-scale epidemiological investigation of an environmental health disaster in the United States. Questions remain about the long-term effects of the smog, because higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer than were expected were observed in the region in the decade following the smog. Recent work has suggested that environmental contaminants from a bygone era in Donora might have an impact even today. In addition, reports regarding air pollution have indicated that levels of pollutants similar to those estimated to have occurred in Donora are currently present in some rapidly industrializing regions of China and India. Seventy years after the smog, this event still resonates. - Maldonado Escalante, J. F., Meza Figueroa, D., D\u00e9vora Figueroa, A. G., Garc\u00eda Rico, L., Burgess, J. L., Lantz, R.

Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 75. doi:10.1136/oemed-2018-icohabstracts.336 [More info](#more-journal-publication26)Introduction The Emergency Preparedness and Response in Occupational Health (EPROH) scientific committee was developed to raise awareness of emergency risks for workers, to train managers, employees, and medical staff to prepare for and prevent accidents, acute medical events and disasters, and to mitigate their impact. The committee proposes a position statement on the fundamental need for prevention, response, first-aid treatment, and care in the field of occupational health care. Methods This position statement was developed following Evidence Based Medicine principles, including literature review, practice networking, and surveys including workers' expectations. Result The scope of the EPROH group will be focused on Emergency Plans, Procedures, Preparedness, and Training. To ameliorate the dramatic situation of workplace fatalities and accidents/events, EPROH experts have developed recommendations for what every worker should expect in case of a medical emergency, work-related or not, minor or major, while working for his/her company. Minimum response plans for every workplace include information about initial management and contact information. First aid must be encouraged, and occupational health and safety professionals will have to develop procedures that detail responses to emergencies, from minor events to major disasters. As needed, emergency providers should be followed up regularly by an occupational specialist for extended intervals after an event. Discussion Although global harmonisation, local adaptation, and additional research are needed, this position statement emphasises the importance of having a global statement on the multiple aspects of emergency preparedness and response in occupational settings for every worker everywhere in the world. - Griffin, S.

BMC public health, 17(1), 885. doi:10.1186/s12889-017-4894-3 [More info](#more-journal-publication28)Emergency service vehicle crashes (ESVCs) are a leading cause of death in the United States fire service. Risk management (RM) is a proactive process for identifying occupational risks and reducing hazards and unwanted events through an iterative process of scoping hazards, risk assessment, and implementing controls. We describe the process, outputs, and lessons learned from the application of a proactive RM process to reduce ESVCs in US fire departments..Three fire departments representative of urban, suburban, and rural geographies, participated in a facilitated RM process delivered through focus groups and stakeholder discussion. Crash reports from department databases were reviewed to characterize the context, circumstances, hazards and risks of ESVCs. Identified risks were ranked using a risk matrix that considered risk likelihood and severity. Department-specific control measures were selected based on group consensus. Interviews, and focus groups were used to assess acceptability and utility of the RM process and perceived facilitators and barriers of implementation..Three to six RM meetings were conducted at each fire department. There were 7.4 crashes per 100 personnel in the urban department and 10.5 per 100 personnel in the suburban department; the rural department experienced zero crashes. All departments identified emergency response, backing, on scene struck by, driver distraction, vehicle/road visibility, and driver training as high or medium concerns. Additional high priority risks varied by department; the urban department prioritized turning and rear ending crashes; the suburban firefighters prioritized inclement weather/road environment and low visibility related crashes; and the rural volunteer fire department prioritized exiting station, vehicle failure, and inclement weather/road environment related incidents. Selected controls included new policies and standard operating procedures to reduce emergency response, cameras to enhance driver visibility while backing, and increased training frequency and enhanced training. The RM process was generally acceptable to department participants and considered useful. All departments reported that the focused and systematic analysis of crashes was particularly helpful. Implementation of controls was a commonly cited challenge..Proactive RM of ESVCs in three US fire departments was positively received and supported the establishment of interventions tailored to each department's needs and priorities. - Kurzius-spencer, M., Harris, R.

Nutrients in one-carbon metabolism and urinary arsenic methylation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004.. The Science of the toxicant, occurs primarily through ingestion of food and water. The efficiency with which it is methylated to mono and dimethyl arsenicals (MMA and DMA) affects toxicity. Folate, vitamins B12 and B6 are required for 1C metabolism, and studies have found that higher levels of these nutrients increase methylation capacity and are associated with protection against adverse health effects from inAs, especially in undernourished populations. Our aim was to determine whether 1C-related nutrients are associated with greater inAs methylation capacity in a general population sample with overall adequate nutrition and low levels of As exposure. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the relationship of dietary and blood nutrients to urinary As methylation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004. Outcome variables were the percent of the sum of inAs and methylated As species (inAs+MMA+DMA) excreted as inAs, MMA, and DMA, and the ratio of MMA:DMA. In univariate models, dietary folate, vitamin B6 and protein intake were associated with lower urinary inAs% and greater DMA% in adults (18years), with similar trends in children (6-18). In adjusted models, vitamin B6 intake (p=0.011) and RBC folate (p=0.036) were associated with lower inAs%, while dietary vitamin B12 was associated with higher inAs% (p=0.002) and lower DMA% (p=0.030). Total plasma homocysteine with higher MMA% (p=0.004) and lower DMA% (p=0.003), but not with inAs%; other blood nutrients showed no association with urinary As. Although effect size is small, these findings suggest that 1C nutrients can influence inAs methylation and potentially play an indirect role in reducing toxicity in a general population sample. - Reed, R.

Eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA8) exposure concentrations of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 75% biodiesel/25% diesel blend (B75) fuels were compared. Compared to diesel, use of B75 was associated with relative percent reductions of 22 and 28% in median respirable (r) diesel particulate matter (DPM) and nitrogen dioxide and 25 and 23% increases in median total DPM and nitric oxide TWA8 exposure concentrations, respectively. Diesel was associated with a slightly greater total geometric mean mass concentration and lower mean surface area concentration. Although further testing is needed, B75 has the potential to reduce rDPM exposures. - Wada, K., Schunder-tatzber, S., Rotthier, S., Kubo, T., Descatha, A., Cassan, P., Burgess, J. L., & Baer, M.

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of dietary components of inorganic As (iAs) intake on serum MMP-9 concentration at differing levels of tap water As. In a cross-sectional study of 214 adults, dietary iAs intake was estimated from 24-h dietary recall interviews using published iAs residue data; drinking and cooking water As intake from water samples and consumption data. Aggregate iAs intake (food plus water) was associated with elevated serum MMP-9 in mixed model regression, with and without adjustment for covariates. In models stratified by tap water As, aggregate intake was a significant positive predictor of serum MMP-9 in subjects exposed to water As10 g/l. Inorganic As from food alone was associated with serum MMP-9 in subjects exposed to tap water As3 g/l. Exposure to iAs from food and water combined, in areas where tap water As concentration is 10 g/l, may contribute to As-induced changes in a biomarker associated with toxicity. - Mehus, A.

Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene, 12(5), 314-22. [More info](#more-journal-publication37)In the United States, there are approximately 366,600 structural fires each year. After visible flames are extinguished, firefighters begin the overhaul stage of firefighting to smother remaining hot spots and initiate investigations. Typically during overhaul significant ambient concentrations of chemical contaminants remain. However, previous research suggests that the use of air purifying respirators (APR) fitted with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) canisters may reduce occupational respiratory exposures. This pilot study used large-scale prescribed burns of representative structural materials to perform simultaneous, side-by-side, filtering and service-life evaluations of commercially available CBRN filters. Three types of CBRN canisters and one cartridge were challenged in repetitive post live-fire overhaul exposure tests using a sampling manifold apparatus. At a flow rate of 80 L/min, nine tests were conducted in the breathing zone for three different exposure durations (0-15 min, 0-30 min, and 0-60 min). Fifty different chemicals were identified for evaluation and results indicate that 21 of the 50 chemicals tested were in the air of the overhaul environment. Respirable particles and formaldehyde were consistently present above the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH\u00ae) recommended exposure level (REL) and threshold limit ceiling value (TLVc), respectively. Each filter effectively reduced concentrations for respirable particulates below the maximum recommended level. Formaldehyde was reduced, but not consistently filtered below the TLVc. These results were consistent across all exposure durations. This study indicates that, regardless of brand, CBRN filters provide protection from the vast majority of particle and gas-phase contaminants. However, due to formaldehyde breakthrough, CBRN filters do not provide complete protection during firefighter overhaul. - Julia, P., Griffin, S., Gary, W., Peate, W., & Burgess, J. L. (2015).

Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene, 12(3), D18-25. [More info](#more-journal-publication40)Diesel fuel is commonly used for underground mining equipment, yet diesel engine exhaust is a known human carcinogen. Alternative fuels, including biodiesel, and a natural gas/diesel blend, offer the potential to reduce engine emissions and associated health effects. For this pilot study, exposure monitoring was performed in an underground mine during operation of a load-haul-dump vehicle. Use of low-sulfur diesel, 75% biodiesel/25% diesel blend (B75), and natural gas/diesel blend (GD) fuels were compared. Personal samples were collected for total and respirable diesel particulate matter (tDPM and rDPM, respectively) and total and respirable elemental and organic carbon (tEC, rEC, tOC, rOC, respectively), as well as carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, naphthalene, nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Compared to diesel, B75 use was associated with a 33% reduction in rDPM, reductions in rEC, tEC, and naphthalene, increased tDPM, tOC, and NO, and no change in rOC, CO, and NO2. Compared to diesel, GD was associated with a 66% reduction in rDPM and a reduction in all other exposures except CO. The alternative fuels tested both resulted in reduced rDPM, which is the basis for the current Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) occupational exposure standard. Although additional study is needed with a wider variety of equipment, use of alternative fuels have the promise of reducing exposures from vehicular exhaust in underground mining settings. - Pena, J.

Methods Data were collected for work-related injuries in a medium-sized metropolitan fire department. In a descriptive study, the factors explored included the nature of injury, agent, mechanism, body location, environment, abbreviated injury scale (AIS), functional capacity index (FCI) and lost time status. Results From 2004 to 2009, the annual injury incidence rate averaged 17.7 per 100 employees. One-third of all injuries (32.9%) resulted from physical exercise activities, while patient transport, training drills and fireground operations resulted in 16.9%, 11.1% and 10.2% of injuries, respectively. For all job operations, sprains and strains were the most prevalent type of injury (40.2-85.2%), followed by contusions and lacerations (7.7-26.1%). The third most common injury was related to the conventional hazards of the individual job operation. Most injuries (n=862, 95.6%) were minor in severity, while 4.3% of injuries were classified as having some impedance of normal function (FCI 3). Moderate injuries (AIS 2) were infrequent, but comprised a greater proportion of fireground injuries (8.7%) than the other activities (1.0-4.1%); however, lost time injuries were more frequent for patient transport (46.1%) than other operations (22.0-29.1%). Conclusions Physical exercise, patient transport and training activities were responsible for a greater percentage of injuries than fireground operations. Focused efforts to improve the characterisation of risks during these more diverse set of work processes should help guide the development of salient strategies for injury prevention. - Roberge, J., O'Rourke, M.

[More info](#more-journal-publication60)The Binational Arsenic Exposure Survey (BAsES) was designed to evaluate probable arsenic exposures in selected areas of southern Arizona and northern Mexico, two regions with known elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater reserves. This paper describes the methodology of BAsES and the relationship between estimated arsenic intake from beverages and arsenic output in urine. Households from eight communities were selected for their varying groundwater arsenic concentrations in Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico. Adults responded to questionnaires and provided dietary information. A first morning urine void and water from all household drinking sources were collected. Associations between urinary arsenic concentration (total, organic, inorganic) and estimated level of arsenic consumed from water and other beverages were evaluated through crude associations and by random effects models. Median estimated total arsenic intake from beverages among participants from Arizona communities ranged from 1.7 to 14.1 \u00b5g/day compared to 0.6 to 3.4 \u00b5g/day among those from Mexico communities. In contrast, median urinary inorganic arsenic concentrations were greatest among participants from Hermosillo, Mexico (6.2 \u00b5g/L) whereas a high of 2.0 \u00b5g/L was found among participants from Ajo, Arizona. Estimated arsenic intake from drinking water was associated with urinary total arsenic concentration (p < 0.001), urinary inorganic arsenic concentration (p < 0.001), of species (p < 0.001). Urinary arsenic concentrations increased between 7% and 12% for each one percent increase in arsenic consumed from drinking water. Variability in arsenic intake from beverages and urinary arsenic output yielded counter intuitive results. Estimated intake of arsenic from all beverages was greatest among Arizonans yet participants in Mexico had higher urinary total and inorganic arsenic concentrations. Other contributors to urinary arsenic concentrations should be evaluated. - Burgess, J. L., Wong, S. S., Sun, N. N., Fastje, C. D., Witten, M. L., Lantz, R. C., Lu, B., Sherrill, D. L., & Gerard, C. J. (2011). Role of neprilysin in airway inflammation induced by diesel exhaust emissions. Research report (Health Effects Institute). [More info](#more-journal-publication61)In this study, we examined the role of neprilysin (NEP), a key membrane-bound endopeptidase, in the inflammatory response induced by diesel exhaust emissions (DEE) in the airways through a number of approaches: in vitro, animal, and controlled human exposure. Our specific aims were (1) to examine the role of NEP in inflammatory injury induced by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) using Nep-intact (wild-type) and Nep-null mice; (2) to examine which components of DEP are associated with NEP downregulation in vitro; (3) to determine the molecular impact of DEP exposure and decreased NEP expression on airway epithelial cells' gene expression in vitro, using a combination of RNA interference (RNAi) and microarray approaches; and (4) to evaluate the effects on NEP activity of human exposure to DEE. We report four main results: First, we found that exposure of normal mice to DEP consisting of standard reference material (SRM) 2975 via intratracheal installation can downregulate NEP expression in a concentration-dependent manner. The changes were accompanied by increases in the number of macrophages and epithelial cells, as well as proinflammatory cytokines, examined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cells. Nep-null mice displayed increased and/or additional inflammatory responses when compared with wild-type mice, especially in response to exposure to the higher dose of DEP that we used. These in vivo findings suggest that loss of NEP in mice could cause increased susceptibility to injury or exacerbate inflammatory responses after DEP exposure via release of specific cytokines from the lungs. Second, we found evidence, using in vitro studies, that downregulation of NEP by DEP in cultured human epithelial BEAS-2B cells was mostly attributable to DEP-adsorbed organic compounds, whereas the carbonaceous core and transition metal components of DEP had little or no effect on NEP messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. This NEP downregulation was not a specific response to DEP or its contents because the change also occurred after exposure to urban dust (SRM 1649a), which differs in physical and chemical composition from DEP. Third, we also collected the transcriptome profiles of the concentration-effects of SRM 2975 in cultured BEAS-2B cells through a 2 X 3 factorial design. DEP exposure upregulated 151 genes and downregulated 59 genes. Cells with decreased NEP expression (accomplished by transfecting an NEP-specific small interfering RNA [siRNA]) substantially altered the expression of genes (upregulating 17 and downregulating 14) associated with DNA/protein binding, calcium channel activities, and the cascade of intracellular signaling by cytokines. Data generated from the combined RNAi and microarray approaches revealed that there is a complex molecular cascade mediated by NEP in different subcellular compartments, possibly influencing the inflammatory response. Fourth, in a controlled human exposure study, we observed significant increases in soluble NEP in sputum after acute exposure to DEE, with an average net increase of 31%. We speculate that the change in NEP activity in sputum, if confirmed in larger epidemiologic investigations at ambient exposure levels to DEE, may provide a useful endpoint and promote insight into the mechanism of DEE-induced airway alterations. - Cara L.

Utilization of the Native American Talking Circle to teach incident command system to tribal community health representatives. Journal of community health, 35(6). [More info](#more-journal-publication64)The public health workforce is diverse and encompasses a wide range of professions. For tribal communities, the Community Health Representative (CHR) is a public health paraprofessional whose role as a community health educator and health advocate has expanded to become an integral part of the health delivery system of most tribes. CHRs possess a unique set of skills and cultural awareness that make them an essential first responder on tribal land. As a result of their distinctive qualities they have the capability of effectively mobilizing communities during times of crisis and can have a significant impact on the communities' response to a local incident. Although public health emergency preparedness training is a priority of federal, state, local and tribal public health agencies, much of the training currently available is not tailored to meet the unique traits of CHRs. Much of the emergency preparedness training is standardized, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Training Programs, and does not take into account the inherent cultural traditions of some of the intended target audience. This paper reports on the use of the Native American Talking Circle format as a culturally appropriate method to teach the Incident Command System (ICS). The results of the evaluation suggest the talking format circle is well received and can significantly improve the understanding of ICS roles. The limitations of the assessment instrument and the cultural adaptations at producing changes in the understanding of ICS history and concepts are discussed. Possible solutions to these limitations are provided. - Wong, S. S., Sun, N. N., Miller, H. B., Witten, M. L., & Burgess, J. L. (2010).

Tracheobronchial markers of lung injury in smoke inhalation victims. Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association, 29(2). [More info](#more-journal-publication71)Although smoke inhalation injury victims frequently develop severe hypoxemia and are at increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), no early prognostic tests are currently available. The objectives were to determine early longitudinal changes in tracheobronchial fluid inflammatory markers and assess the value of initial concentrations as predictors of subsequent lung injury. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) were recorded approximately every 6 hours from intubated smoke inhalation victims admitted to a regional burn center. Tracheobronchial suction fluid was collected every 2 hours and assayed for interleukins (IL-1beta, -8, and -10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta1, soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), and complement factor 5a. Temporal trends in marker concentrations during 36 hours and the relations between initial concentrations and lowest Pao2/Fio2 or ARDS within 72 hours were assessed using random coefficients modeling and cross-sectional analysis. In 21 subjects with tracheobronchial samples collected within 6.5 hours of intubation, 14 (66.7%) developed acute hypoxemia (Pao2/Fio2 < or =200) within 72 hours of exposure and nine (42.9%) developed ARDS, as defined by the American-European consensus conference on ARDS. IL-8 increased sharply in the first 6.5 hours postexposure (P < .001), and IL-1beta in the first 6.1 hours (P < .001). No significant temporal trends in IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta1, sFasL, or complement factor 5a were found. Only initial IL-8 was associated with increased Pao2/Fio2 (P = .013) and with a minimum Pao2/Fio2 >200 (P = .042) during 72 hours. In smoke inhalation victims, tracheobronchial IL-1beta and IL-8 increase rapidly and high initial IL-8 may predict improved oxygenation. - Maria M. Meza-Montenegro, ., Michael J. Kopplin, (2008).
