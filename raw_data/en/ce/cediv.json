A whole-foods diet is not like that. That's because it's not a traditional diet. Instead, it's an overall approach to eating that can be used to guide your food choices over the long term. What Is a Whole-Foods Diet? A whole-foods diet is not a formal or commercial diet, says [Lisa Young, PhD, RDN](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1478993022), author of Finally Full, Finally Slim and adjunct professor at New York University. Rather, a whole foods-based approach to eating is designed to be a long-term, sustainable plan. It's about as self-explanatory as possible: You fill your plate with whole foods and, as much as you can, avoid those that are processed. Whole foods, Dr. Young explains, are as close to their natural, unprocessed form as possible. They include foods like [whole grains](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/whole-grains-in-the-diabetes-diet/), [fruits and vegetables](https://www.everydayhealth.com/senior-health/health-benefits-of-fruits-and-vegetables.aspx), [legumes](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/legumes-types-health-benefits-nutrition-facts-cooking-methods-and-more/), [nuts](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/0406/why-you-should-go-nuts-for-nuts.aspx), and seeds. \"The whole-foods diet is not closely defined \u2014 there's a big gray area,\" says [Caroline Susie, RDN](https://carolinesusierd.com/about/), a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in Dallas. \"The idea is to consume minimally [processed foods](/diet-nutrition/processed-foods-linked-shorter-life-span-study-finds/) as close to their natural state as possible.\" Whole vs. Processed Foods \"I think we need education around the term 'processed foods,'\" says Susie. \"They can be very convenient, especially since we're all so busy. I don't want someone thinking they cannot have 90-second microwaveable brown rice, when it's a nutritional powerhouse.\" [risk factor for heart disease](/heart-disease/)and stroke. And excess sugar consumption comes with a greater risk of health ills, such as excess weight gain and [type 2 diabetes](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/). What Are the Potential Health Benefits of a Whole-Foods Diet? \"Whole foods retain their nutrients, phytochemicals, and [fiber](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/), which are often removed in processed foods,\" says Young. Research suggests that there are many reasons to consider making the move toward eating more of this nutrient-rich fresh food and less heavily processed fare, including: Chronic Disease Prevention [plant-based foods](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/plant-based-diet-food-list-sample-menu/), because it emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes. In one study, people who stuck to a [plant-based diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/plant-based-diet-food-list-meal-plan-benefits-more/)had a 19 percent lower risk of dying from [cardiovascular disease](https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/)and an 11 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, compared with those whose diet was lower in plant-based foods. [cancer](https://www.everydayhealth.com/cancer/guide/), type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and [stroke](https://www.everydayhealth.com/stroke/guide/). Meanwhile, consumption of red and processed meats and [sugary](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/which-sugars-are-good-you-which-ones-avoid/)beverages was linked to a higher risk of those conditions. Chronic Disease Management [autoimmune diseases](/ankylosing-spondylitis/autoimmune-diseases-questions-answered/). Weight Loss Improved GI Health [grams of fiber per day](/hs/guide-to-daily-fiber/too-much-fiber/), while men should aim for at least 38 grams per day.) \"A diet high in fiber leads to lower rates of chronic disease and improved digestion and [gastrointestinal](/digestive-health/common-digestive-conditions-from-top-bottom/)health,\" says Young. A Stronger Immune System [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/), zinc, and [selenium](/drugs/selenium), that are known to boost your body's defenses. What's more, a diet lacking in fruits and vegetables but filled with ultra-processed foods (which are discouraged or severely limited in this eating plan) may negatively affect gut health and raise inflammation, both of which may have negative effects on your immune system. What Are the Risks of a Whole-Foods Diet? Generally, there are few downsides to a whole-foods diet, as long as you maintain perspective. \"It's important to realize that this does not have to be all or nothing. By avoiding that mentality, you will not be setting yourself up for failure,\" says Young. \"Tread lightly if you have a history of [disordered eating](https://www.everydayhealth.com/eating-disorders/guide/),\" adds Susie. Following a whole-foods diet too strictly can veer into a fixation on \"clean eating\" and, for some people, even prompt shame if they eat something processed. If you have become obsessed with food choices in the past, reach out to a registered dietitian who can help you adjust your diet in a safe way. You can also reach out to the [National Eating Disorders Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline) for resources and support. While it's not a risk, another potential negative with this diet is that it likely will require more meal planning and prep than eating processed foods does \u2014 though that's something that you can get used to and streamline through habits like batch cooking and freezing leftovers, adds Young.

(This aligns with the [U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPlate recommendations](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/myplate-the-ultimate-guide-to-healthy-eating/), in which you aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables, a quarter with grains, and a quarter with lean protein. A serving of low-fat or fat-free dairy on the side is optional.)

The premise behind this diet can serve as a guideline for how to choose the most nutritious foods, but it won't provide you with a set of rules to follow, and it is meant to be done as a long-term lifestyle choice rather than a short-term [fad diet](/food/the-10-most-famous-fad-diets-of-all-time.aspx).
