Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine can help improve the function of your organs such as the kidneys, liver, and your digestive system, which all play an important role in removing waste and toxins from the body. Why not give your body a boost and let it do what it naturally does best: keep you active and healthy! It is now spring and the energy of spring brings the urge to clear away the debris of winter and to make room for new growth. For many, \"spring cleaning\" includes a personal detox regime of some sort, to clear the accumulations and stresses that have built up over the winter months. Modern environmental \"toxins\", excess ingestion of food and drink, medications and supplements, all put an unnatural burden on the organs and systems in the body including the liver, kidney, lymphatics, digestive tract, and connective tissue. Acupuncture treatment (including guasha, cupping, auricular acupuncture, and, when needed, an appropriate Chinese herbal formula) is a proven effective means to assist in the detoxification process. Following the treatment principle to \"treat the branch\", in this case clearing the symptoms of \"stagnation\", while \"supporting the root\" constitution brings the body into energetic balance and improved function. This is experienced as more energy, better digestion, reduced pain (in pain sufferers), better sleep, a clearer mind, and an improved sense of well-being in general.
