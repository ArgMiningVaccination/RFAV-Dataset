Recommended Vaccines by Age An immunization schedule lists the timing of recommended vaccinations. The CDC's recommendations are based on extensive research. It was created to protect children from diseases at the earliest time that vaccines are safe and effective. Delaying vaccines leaves your child vulnerable to disease at the time when they are the most at risk.
