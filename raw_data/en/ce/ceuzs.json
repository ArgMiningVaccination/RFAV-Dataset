EMDR is a structured therapy that encourages the patient to focus briefly on the trauma memory while simultaneously experiencing bilateral stimulation (typically eye movements), which is associated with a reduction in the vividness and emotion associated with the trauma memories. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an extensively researched, effective psychotherapy method proven to help people recover from trauma and PTSD symptoms. Ongoing research supports positive clinical outcomes showing EMDR therapy as a helpful treatment for disorders such as anxiety, depression, OCD, chronic pain, addictions, and other distressing life experiences (Maxfield, 2019). EMDR therapy has even been superior to Prozac in trauma treatment (Van der Kolk et al., 2007). Shapiro and Forrest (2016) share that more than 7 million people have been treated successfully by 110,000 therapists in 130 countries since 2016.

EMDR therapy does not require talking in detail about the distressing issue or completing homework between sessions. EMDR therapy, rather than focusing on changing the emotions, thoughts, or behaviors resulting from the distressing issue, allows the brain to resume its natural healing process. EMDR therapy is designed to resolve unprocessed traumatic memories in the brain. For many clients, EMDR therapy can be completed in fewer sessions than other psychotherapies. How does EMDR therapy affect the brain? Our brains have a natural way to recover from traumatic memories and events. This process involves communication between the amygdala (the alarm signal for stressful events), the hippocampus (which assists with learning, including memories about safety and danger), and the prefrontal cortex (which analyzes and controls behavior and emotion). While many times traumatic experiences can be managed and resolved spontaneously, they may not be processed without help. Stress responses are part of our natural fight, flight, or freeze instincts. When distress from a disturbing event remains, the upsetting images, thoughts, and emotions may create an overwhelming feeling of being back in that moment, or of being \"frozen in time.\" EMDR therapy helps the brain process these memories, and allows normal healing to resume. The experience is still remembered, but the fight, flight, or freeze response from the original event is resolved. Who can benefit from EMDR therapy? EMDR therapy helps children and adults of all ages. Therapists use EMDR therapy to address a wide range of challenges: - Anxiety, panic attacks, and phobias - Chronic Illness and medical issues [Depression and bipolar disorders](https://www.emdria.org/about-emdr-therapy/emdr-depression/) - Dissociative disorders - Eating disorders - Grief and loss - Pain - Performance anxiety - Personality disorders [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other trauma and stress-related issues](https://www.emdria.org/about-emdr-therapy/emdr-ptsd/) Can EMDR therapy be done without a trained EMDR therapist? EMDR therapy is a mental health intervention. As such, it should only be offered by properly trained and licensed mental health clinicians. EMDRIA does not condone or support indiscriminate uses of EMDR therapy such as \"do-it-yourself\" virtual therapy. How did EMDR therapy start? In the late 1980s, Francine Shapiro, Ph.D., discovered a connection between eye movement and persistent upsetting memories. With this personal insight, she began a lifelong study and development of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. Over the years, and in the face of initial skepticism, [Dr. Shapiro's work](https://www.emdria.org/public-resources/emdr-therapy-beginnings-francine-shapiro/) developed from a hypothesis to a formal therapy process. EMDR therapy has been demonstrated to be effective for treating trauma in [randomized clinical trials, case studies,](https://www.emdria.org/publications-resources/francine-shapiro-library/) and millions of clinical hours treating trauma and trauma-related disorders across the globe. The American Psychiatric Association, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USVA) and Department of Defense (USDOD), the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (NICE), and the World Health Organization (WHO), multiple global organizations now recognize the effectiveness of EMDR therapy that Dr. Shapiro developed. Most recently, the public acceptance of EMDR therapy was illustrated when [Prince Harry reported that he engaged in EMDR therapy to treat trauma from his childhood. ](https://www.emdria.org/emdr-in-the-news/prince-harry-speaks-out-about-his-experience-with-emdr-therapy/) [Sandra Bullock also opened up about using EMDR therapy to treat trauma from an at-home break-in.](https://www.emdria.org/emdr-in-the-news/sandra-bullock-speaks-out-about-her-experience-with-emdr-therapy/) Dr. Shapiro encouraged the foundation of EMDRIA, which comprises more than 15,000 mental health professionals who use EMDR therapy in their clinical practice to treat many conditions that impact mental health. [Dr. Shapiro died in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/science/francine-shapiro-dead.html), but her legacy of trauma-informed mental health care lives on in the EMDR therapists, researchers, and patients for whom EMDR therapy heals. EMDR Therapy is a Recognized Effective Treatment for PTSD Anyone can experience intense trauma. EMDR therapy is widely considered one of the best treatments for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and it has been endorsed as an effective therapy by many organizations.
