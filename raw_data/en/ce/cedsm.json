For mild respiratory symptoms, testing before travel or a medical procedure, or if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, please consider using an at-home antigen test (which is normally the best course even when PCR testing is available). PCR testing is typically recommended when directed by a provider. If you test positive for COVID-19, stay home and follow the [self-isolation guidelines from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). In addition, consider talking to your primary care provider to see if you are eligible for treatment, especially if you are considered high-risk. If you test positive for COVID-19, stay home and self-isolate. If possible, use a separate bathroom and avoid sharing personal household items. [See more guidelines from the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) In addition, contact your primary care provider or submit a [COVID-19 Outpatient Therapeutics Patient Self-Referral Form ](https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/?s=4X8HRMYE3N)to see if you should receive the Paxlovid treatment, which should be taken within the first 5 days of testing positive. Once you submit the form, a team member will contact you within 24 to 48 hours. If your first COVID-19 test results are negative, repeat the test 48 hours later. Latest Updates - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends individuals 6 months and older receive the updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Doses vary depending on age and vaccination status. In addition, adults 65 and older can now get a second bivalent booster. See our [vaccines page](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/discover/covid-19-resource-center/vaccines-testing/covid-19-vaccines.html)for details. - In alignment with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and local counties, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), booster shots are no longer required for health care workers. However, we will still require health care workers to receive the primary series of the COVID-19 vaccine. - New guidelines on masking: see our [Visitor Policy](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/discover/covid-19-resource-center/your-visit/visitor-policy.html)for details - Our drive-thru testing and vaccination sites have closed for the season.
