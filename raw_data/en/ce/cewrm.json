Patient-provider communication is essential when taking a heath history because patients may present with a personal history of medications or medical conditions that have the capacity to negatively infl uence their nonsurgical cosmetic outcomes ( De Boulle & Heydenrych, 2015 ). Health care providers also need to be aware of the various herbal substances that their patients may be taking on a daily basis ( Ismail, 2009 ). A Recipe for Improved Nonsurgical Cosmetic Outcomes: Know Your Herbs and doctor of nursing prac- tice who has been in nursing since 1974, with an advanced practice degree since 1980.

The nonsurgical cosmetic arena continues to grow, with more people consistently seeking minimally invasive pro-cedures for facial rejuvenation. However, although these prospective patients are not seeking surgical correction to obtain their results, there is still the potential for nonsurgi-cal procedures to yield adverse events posttreatment. Pa-tients often do not realize that their dietary regimens may affect their nonsurgical cosmetic outcomes. For example, many patients desiring these types of treatments are often found to be taking prescription medications, herbs, and spices on a daily basis that may have the capacity to potentiate adverse outcomes such as bleeding and/or bruising. For these reasons, it is important for clinicians to be inclusive while taking health histories and to properly educate their patients so that administered treatments have the best chance of yielding the desired results. The focus of this article is to provide health care providers information on many of the herbs and spices that have the potential to negatively impact nonsurgical cosmetic outcomes. Obtaining a complete health history, which includes pre- scription and herbal drugs/spices prior to treatment, be-comes essential for ensuring patient safety and satisfac-tion ( Hussain, 2011 ). Although herbs/spices also have the capacity to affect surgical outcomes, this article focuses solely on the potential negative effects of herbs/spices on nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. BACKGROUND Over the last few years, there has been an overwhelming increase of herbal consumption noted in the United States ( Pradhan & Pradhan, 2011 , p. 334). Yet, only a very small percentage of patients have been shown to initiate con-versations with their health care providers regarding their herbal usage ( Kennedy, Wang, & Wu, 2008 ). As de ned by Merriam-Webster Dictionary (n.d.-a) , \"An herb is a plant or plant part valued for its medicinal, savory, or aromatic qualities,\" whereas a spice is de ned as \"a seasoning (as pepper or nutmeg) that comes from a dried plant part and that is usually a powder or seed\" ( Merriam-Webster Dictionary, n.d.-b ). Because the Food and Drug Admin- istration does not regulate herbs by the same standards used to evaluate prescription medications, and herbs can interact with medications and affect body functions, it be-comes just as important for health care providers to be aware of the herbs their patients may be taking on a daily basis ( Anastasi, Chang, & Capili, 2011 ). Herbal agents alone or in combination with certain medications may have the ability to affect the ef cacy of nonsurgical cosmetic outcomes, thus underscoring the need for clinicians to educate their patients prior to treat-ment ( Emer & Waldorf, 2011 ). Many patients have been shown to mix their prescription and herbal medications together without truly understanding how this can result in complications ( Hussain, 2011 ). HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS/SPICES Salicylates and Coumarin There are many herbs and/or spices that contain sub- stances such as salicylates and coumarin that prevent or inhibit the formation of blood clots. Salicylates ( Table 1 ) not only are found in medications but are also incorpo-rated into certain spices, foods, and beverages ( Waldron 1.0 ANCC Contact HoursCECopyright \u00a9 2017 American Society of Plastic Surgical Nurses. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.64 www.psnjournalonline.com Volume , p. 5). In addition, there are a number of herbs that contain coumarin, which has anticoagulant properties ( Waldron & Moll, 2013 , p. 6). Again, the im- portance of clinicians taking a thorough patient health history cannot be emphasized enough, as ingesting certain herbs/spices prior to treatment may affect non-surgical cosmetic outcomes ( Brennan, 2014 ). In addition, consumption of herbs/spices in combination with certain medications may contribute to increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising ( Waldron & Moll, 2013 ). As a result, knowledge of spices that contain natural salicylates becomes invaluable by providing clinicians sig-ni cant information to make appropriate decisions during their patient selections and treatments. There are a number of herbal supplements that have been found to contain coumarin ( Table 2 ). As discussed by (2013) , \"Since natural coumarins have anticoagulant properties, caution may be warranted by persons taking prescription anticoagulants to avoid ex-cessive bleeding risk\" (p. 6). For these reasons, it is once again important for a health care provider to be aware of these potential blood thinners so that patients may be properly prepared for their nonsurgical cosmetic proce-dures by educating them on the potential consequences of ingesting certain medications, herbs, and spices. Evidence has shown that there are a number of herbs and spices that may affect platelets, thus potentially pro-moting bleeding and/or bruising ( Table 3 ; Nutescu et al., 2006 ). Moreover, because many people think that all herbs are safe and natural ( Hussain, 2011 ), it is possible that they may be mixing certain medications with herbs and creating an opportunity for their body to bruise or bleed more than normal if they were to have any nonsurgical cosmetic treatments ( Nutescu et al., 2006 ; Samuels, 2005 ). Anecdotally, many patients that I have interviewed during their rst of ce visit acknowledged taking one or all of these mentioned herbs and/or spices: sh oils, the three G's: garlic, ginkgo, and ginger, onion, and turmeric, with a small percentage also taking blood thinners. Know-ing this type of information prior to an actual treatment enabled me to properly educate those patients regarding possible negative outcomes from the herbs/spices being consumed, potential increased bleeding and bruising, in addition to providing them with realistic expectations. Although a patient taking blood thinners, herbs, spices, or a combination of all three may be injected, depend-ing on age, diet, exercise schedule, skin thickness, tur-gor, and skin elasticity, a clinician might decide that some patients are not desirable candidates for nonsurgical cos-metic treatments at their initial of ce visit ( Brennan, 2014 ; Samuels, 2005 ).

This verbal examination will provide clinicians with in-depth health history informa-tion so they may determine whether this potential patient is a good candidate to receive any nonsurgical cosmetic treatments on the same day as his or her initial consult. This examination should be performed by the MD or advanced practice registered nurse prior to treatment. In addition, all returning patients should be questioned whether anything in their medical history has changed since their last visit. Upon questioning, if patients acknowledge that they have been taking a number of herbs/spices on a dai-ly basis that their health care provider believes might negatively affect the procedures outcome, the patients should be given the opportunity to decide if they want to proceed knowing that their chances of bleeding and/or bruising may signi cantly increase. There are varied articles addressing how many days prior to treatment a patient should stop his or her herbal/spice intake to achieve the best nonsurgical cosmetic outcomes. Evi-dence has suggested anywhere from right before and after the treatment ( Brennan, 2014 ) to 1 week prior to any treatment ( Anastasi et al., 2011 ). CONCLUSION The number of people taking herbs/spices continues to increase ( Hussain, 2011 ). As refl ected in the litera- ture, many individuals consuming these products are not aware of their potency or potential effects ( Ismail, 2009 ). Also, many are mixing their herbs with medica- tions unaware of how these interactions might affect their health ( Hussain, 2011 ). This article has attempted to present the importance of including herb/spice intake in patients' health histories, knowing about these products and how they may impact the results of a nonsurgical cosmetic procedure, and the importance of educating patients about their herbal/spice regimens to maximize outcomes.
