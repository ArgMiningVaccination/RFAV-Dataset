Phrases like \" [herd immunity](https://www.self.com/story/what-is-herd-immunity)\" and \" [immunocompromised](https://www.self.com/story/immunocompromised-people-fourth-covid-19-vaccine-dose)\" proliferated in official public health updates, news stories, and health care centers as experts navigated all the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we know that the virus can affect anyone, but it can lead to particularly risky complications for the most vulnerable people in our communities.1 Of course, the [immune system's job](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/immune-system-overview) is to protect your body from all invaders that may be harmful, not just certain viruses: When functioning properly, it alerts your body to a wide range of potential threats and helps it respond accordingly. However, some people have dysfunctional immune systems\u2014which are also known as weakened or compromised immune systems\u2014that cause their bodies' protective response to be under- or overactive, per [Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/disorders-of-the-immune-system). There's no exact figure for how many people live with weakened immune systems, but it's safe to say it's in the millions, [Leonard Calabrese, DO](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/337-leonard-calabrese), a rheumatologic and immunologic disease expert at the Cleveland Clinic, tells SELF. Some research suggests at least 7 million adults in the United States are immunocompromised, per the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-immunocompromised-etr.html) (CDC). Below, experts explain the factors that can break down the immune system's defenses, the common symptoms associated with compromised immune systems, and what kinds of treatments are available to help. [What is a weakened immune system?](#what-is-a-weakened-immune-system) | [Weakened immune system causes](#weakened-immune-system-causes) | [Weakened immune system symptoms](#weakened-immune-system-symptoms) | [Treatments for immunocompromised people](#treatments-for-immunocompromised-people) What is a weakened immune system, exactly? Your [immune system](https://www.self.com/story/can-you-boost-immune-system) is an intricate network of cells, tissues, and organs (as well as the substances they make) that, generally speaking, fight disease and infection, according to the National Institutes of Health ( [NIH](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/immune-system)). White blood cells may come to mind, but there are lots of body parts that play important roles in your immune health, like your skin, lymph nodes and vessels, thymus gland (which makes white blood vessels), spleen, tonsils, and bone marrow, among others. The immune system is generally broken down into two parts, [Scott Weisenberg, MD](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1366609042/scott-a-weisenberg), an infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. These are called the innate (or inherited) and the adaptive (or acquired) immune systems. The major difference between the two is that you're born with the former and your body develops the latter.2 The innate immune system is the first to respond to an invader\u2014such as a harmful germ\u2014by surrounding it with protective cells and, if all goes as planned, killing it. The adaptive immune system supports your innate response by producing proteins called antibodies.2 These are designed to counter a specific threat, like certain viruses or bacteria, should your body be exposed to them and need backup in the future, per [Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-immune-system). Problems can occur when the immune system either doesn't respond enough or responds too strongly, Dr. Calabrese says. \"A compromised immune system fails to either detect danger or [reacts] aggressively and causes collateral damage to our systems,\" he explains.3 It's worth noting that problems with the immune system exist on a spectrum, Dr. Calabrese adds. The potential health risks posed by a weakened immune system aren't the same if you're comparing one person who, for example, has moderate allergies, to someone who'd recently had an organ transplant. \"They're hardly in the same category,\" Dr. Calabrese says. What causes a weakened immune system? Any number of health issues, such as mild asthma, can affect your body's ability to fight disease and infection\u2014and certain lifestyle factors, like smoking tobacco and not getting enough sleep, can also interfere with your body's ability to stay balanced and heal, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/features/enhance-immunity/index.html) says. However, there are several major factors that can compromise your immune system's defenses. These include: [Autoimmune diseases](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/autoimmune-diseases) are characterized by a malfunctioning immune response; essentially, your body goes a bit rogue and starts to attack its healthy cells, tissues, and organs, according to the NIH. There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases that experts know of, including [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis), [type 1 diabetes](https://www.self.com/story/is-type-1-diabetes-genetic), [lupus](https://www.self.com/story/9-symptoms-of-lupus), and many more; these conditions are thought to impact at least 24 million people in the United States, while an additional 8 million are estimated to have blood markers that point to their susceptibility of developing one of these disorders, per the NIH. Autoimmune diseases in general compromise a person's immune system by attacking the body. On top of that, to help a person manage the symptoms caused by their condition\u2014many of which can severely affect the person's quality of life\u2014experts often recommend medications called immunosuppressants, like steroids or [biologics](https://www.self.com/story/how-do-biologics-work). These medications can be life-changing for some people but, in turn, the treatments can weaken the entire immune system or just a specific part of it, according to the [American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology](https://www.aaaai.org/Conditions-Treatments/Related-Conditions/immunosuppressive). People who receive a bone marrow, stem cell,4 or organ transplant will also have a weakened immune system during the first few weeks after the procedure because the body's white blood cell count is depleted, increasing the risk of potential infection. Immunosuppressants are also commonly prescribed following these procedures because they help the body accept the transplant and prevent it from attacking normal (and vital) tissues, according to experts at the [University of Pennsylvania Health System](https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/may/what-it-means-to-be-immunocompromised). [Primary immunodeficiency diseases](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/primary-immunodeficiency-diseases) (PIDDs)\u2014also commonly known as inborn errors of immunity\u2014are rare genetic disorders that cause at least one part of a person's immune system to malfunction, according to the [NIH](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/primary-immune-deficiency-diseases-pidds). There are nearly 500 known PIDDs, and they're typically characterized by repeated or severe infections.5 There are a variety of other health conditions including type 2 diabetes, liver or kidney diseases, alcohol use disorder, and HIV/AIDS, among others, that can compromise your immune system, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/risk-groups/weakened-immunity.html) notes. Any form of cancer can also weaken or suppress the immune system, per the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/physical-side-effects/low-blood-counts/infections/why-people-with-cancer-are-at-risk.html), but the associated treatments, which tend to be really hard on the body, can mess with immune defenses as well. These can include chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, stem cell transplants, and more. These conditions are known as secondary immunodeficiencies, which are far more common than primary immunodeficiencies. Secondary immunodeficiencies are not a result of genetic errors, but rather a variety of potential factors that can impact a person's once-normal immune system, like an infectious pathogen, certain substances, and environmental changes, for example.6 What are some common signs of having a weakened immune system? Immunocompromised people tend to get infections more often, or they may get severely ill from infections that people with healthy immune systems can recover from more easily, Dr. Weisenberg says. This means the infections may be harder to treat or last longer than expected. People with weakened immune systems are also more likely to experience symptoms triggered by germs\u2014including viruses, bacteria, and fungi\u2014that aren't normally seen in people with healthy immune systems. For example, Dr. Weisenberg says, a serious infection caused by the fungus [Pneumocystis jirovecii](https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/pneumocystis-pneumonia/index.html) is usually only detected in people with weakened immune systems. Frequent [digestive issues](https://www.self.com/story/when-to-see-doctor-digestive-symptoms), like diarrhea, constipation, and gas, are also worth noting, per the [University of Pennsylvania Health System](https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/march/weakened-immune-system). (One theory that might explain this: Research suggests a large portion of the immune system lives in the gastrointestinal tract. In fact, up to 80% of your immune cells are found in the gut.7) Minor wounds\u2014such as cuts and scrapes\u2014may also be slower to heal, since healthy immune cells are needed to shepherd the recovery process. What kinds of treatments are available for people with weakened immune systems? The best treatment plan will vary depending on what, exactly, is compromising a person's immune system, Dr. Weisenberg says. In general, many treatment plans are focused on symptom management and infection control. Some people may also benefit from [intravenous immunoglobulin therapy](https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Treatments/Intravenous-Immunoglobulin-IVIG#:~:text=Intravenous%20Immunoglobulin%20(IVIG)%20is%20a,the%20purpose%20of%20fighting%20infections.) to help replenish protective proteins, namely antibodies, and prevent infection, he adds. Immune system replacement in the form of stem cell or bone marrow transplants, as well as gene therapy, are also options depending on the cause and severity of a person's condition, [as SELF previously reported](https://www.self.com/story/primary-immunodeficiency-diseases-facts). Even with these care options, it's important to recognize that people with weakened immune systems often depend on herd immunity or community immunity. This is achieved when a majority of a population has a sufficient level of immunity against a specific [infectious disease](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/infectious-diseases) through vaccination or prior infection and recovery. This helps reduce the person-to-person spread of a pathogen, ultimately protecting vulnerable people who can't afford to get sick due to a higher risk of complications or who don't respond to or can't receive certain vaccines.8 Community immunity is \"extremely important,\" [Dusan Bogunovic, PhD](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/dusan-bogunovic), a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, tells SELF. \"This can be a lifeline for many.\" There are other common-sense strategies that slow infection in our communities, too, like frequent handwashing and masking up in crowded spaces. It takes a collective, conscious effort: Together, we can help protect the millions of immunocompromised people we live, work, and hang out with every day.
