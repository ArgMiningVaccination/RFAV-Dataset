Biomedical research is the broad area of science that involves the investigation of the biological process and the causes of disease through careful experimentation, observation, laboratory work, analysis, and examination. Scientists expand this knowledge base to discover ways to prevent ill-health, and to develop beneficial products, medications, and procedures to treat and cure diseases and conditions that cause illness and death in ourselves, our families and friends, our pets, farm animals, and wildlife. Biomedical research requires the input and participation of many individuals from both the life and physical sciences, with many different backgrounds and skills. Such a research team might include medical doctors, veterinarians, computer scientists, engineers, technicians, researchers, and a variety of scientists from the different fields of the life sciences.

Students who become interested in the life sciences today, are tomorrow's discoverers and innovators in the fields that impact the general health and well-being of our communities, our country, and the world. CBRA's sister organization, the [ California Society for Biomedical Research ](https://calbioresearch.org/) (CSBR), is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization dedicated to improving human and animal health by promoting public understanding and support for bomedical research and discovery through lifescience education and outreach. The Society seeks to foster an understanding of the scientific process, and to inspire students to careers in the lifesciences. Be a part of the future of research - support CSBR's life "}
